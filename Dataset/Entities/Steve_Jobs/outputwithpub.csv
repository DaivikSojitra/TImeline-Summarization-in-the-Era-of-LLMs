1999-01-07,"In perhaps the most hotly - anticipated keynote he 's given since returning to the helm of Apple Computer in 1997 , Steve Jobs took the stage at the major Mac event of the year , San Francisco 's MacWorld Expo , and wowed the crowd with a family of see - through , iMac - like G3 computers and a new line of multi - coloured iMacs . '
What we 're going to do here today is kick off 1999 with a bang , ' said the blue - jeaned ' interim ' CEO , who returned to the Apple fold as ' special adviser ' to then - CEO Gilbert Amelio in 1997 .
Jobs is riding high .
PC Data , the analyst based in Reston , Virginia , recently released figures pegging the iMac as the number one - selling retail PC in November , with 7.1 per cent of unit sales in America .
Crucially , 32 per cent of iMac buyers were first - time Macintosh customers , and 13 per cent were converts from the Windows / Intel platform .
Apple once held 18 per cent of the computing market , but years of clumsy marketing , bungled relationships with developers , and unruly product lines left it almost a nonentity : a mere 3 per cent of the computing population used Macs prior to the iMac .
The iMac - and to a lesser extent , the G3 line of desktop systems - have pushed Apple up to a healthier , but still skimpy , 5 per cent market share .
As John and Yoko smiled down benignly from a huge ' Think Different ' banner , part of Apple 's most recent advertising campaign , Jobs paced the stage and revealed a new line of translucent white and blue G3 computers based on 300 , 350 and a new 400MHz G3 chip . '
We wanted to make not only the most powerful Macintosh ever built but the best PC in the industry , ' said Jobs .
With built - in 3D acceleration in the form of the ATI Rage 128 card , 16 megabytes of graphics memory as standard , 64Mb of main memory , and a 6 gigabit drive ( expandable to 100 G ) , Apple is also pitching the new line squarely at a market it must capture if it is to have any viability with future consumers : gamers . '
We recommitted Apple to games nine months ago and we 've been working really hard at this , ' said Jobs . '
Now , we want to be the best gaming platform in the world . '
The Rage card will render 68 frames per second , compared with 50 for VooDoo 2 , the most popular PC graphics card .
Jobs clearly hopes that by following the old Macintosh practice of incorporating mulitmedia technologies directly into the system as standard , he will win over gamers who would have to pay $ 200 for a graphics card .
Obviously games mattered to the crowd , who cheered Jobs 's announcement that 12 current games , including Tomb Raider III , StarCraft , Heretic 2 , Age of Empires , Quake and Quest for Glory 5 would be out on the Mac within the next 120 days .
An appearance by games software house iD Software 's co - founder John Carmack , in which he pledged to release Quake Arena simultaneously on Mac and PC , no doubt helped convince many in the crowd that Apple might be ready to flex some games muscle .
But the stars of the show were the new computers .
The new G3 towers have twin handles moulded into the top of the casing .
In a simple but surprising innovation , the entire side of the tower drops down when a recessed handle is turned .
This gives easy access to the Mac 's innards : a major change for a company which traditionally encouraged consumers to leave system alterations to Apple professionals .
Like the iMacs , the new G3s lack a floppy drive , but some incorporate a Zip drive .
An Ethernet connection and USB ports are standard and the G3s incorporate a fast FireWire connection for external devices like video cameras and portable hard drives ."
1999-01-14,"THE new iMac computer that Apple boss Steve Jobs announced last week at MacWorld in San Francisco ( Online , January 7 ) will be available in the UK by the end of the month .
It 's a bit faster than the last version - the processor runs at 266MHz instead of 233MHz - and a bit cheaper at £ 915.33 ( inc VAT ) compared with £ 999 .
But the main difference is that it will be available in five colours : red , green . . .
Sorry !
In strawberry , lime , blueberry , tangerine and grape .
Jobs said : ' For most consumers , colour is much more important than the megahertz , gigabytes and other gibberish associated with buying a typical PC . '
Anyone who still longs for an original Bondi Blue version of the iMac should be able to get one for £ 200 off ( £ 797.83 ) while stocks last .
The real question is : when will Apple produce an iMac in the colour it pioneered 22 years ago with the Apple II , and continued with the Macintosh in 1984 ?
Answer : as soon as someone comes up with a believable fruit that 's coloured beige .
MAC users who need to run programs that are available only for Wintel PCs ( ones based on Microsoft Windows and Intel processors ) may be able to solve the problem by running these programs via PC emulation software such as Connectix 's Virtual PC .
Connectix may also have the answer to the Mac 's shortage of action games :
Virtual Game Station software that emulates Sony 's best - selling PlayStation games console .
There 's no news about when the $ 49 program will be released in the UK , but a list of compatible games is online at www.virtualgamestation.com MICROSOFT is increasing its involvement in the PC games market by taking over Fasa Interactive , a Chicago - based developer .
The name may be unfamiliar , but not the products : it 's responsible for developing the BattleTech series , including MechWarrior and MechCommander .
MICE , joysticks and touch - screens may be hazardous to your health , but very little research has been done into the ergonomic effects of using these relatively new input devices .
The Health and Safety Executive ( HSE ) , a government agency , is therefore funding a two - year study , which will be undertaken by researchers at the universities of Surrey and Loughborough .
The results will be used to update the advice the HSE gives British companies on the use of computer equipment .
So will they test the £ 29 key - flipping keyboard that Blue Egg will launch next month ?

1999-06-30,"iMac to go Apple is expected to unveil a portable and probably colourful Macintosh computer aimed at consumers at the MacWorld show in New York later this month ( July 20 - 23 ) .
The P1 , which may be called the WebMate , is being made in Taiwan by Alpha Top , and is expected to start shipping in August , though an unconfirmed report has suggested further delays .
Apple 's interim chief executive Steve Jobs killed the company 's last effort in this area , the curvaceous Newton - based eMate , and the new machine will fulfil his strategy of providing Macs in four basic categories : consumer desktop , consumer portable , business desktop , business portable .
Apple may also unveil an improved version of the iMac , code - named C2 , with 366MHz processor , 64 megabytes of memory and an almost-17 in screen .
Lookalike Ever since the iMac came out , Taiwanese PC manufacturers have talked about producing lookalikes running Microsoft Windows 98 .
Future Power , a Californian start - up , seems to have beaten them to it with its E - Power all - in - one machine , ( right ) shown at last week 's New York Expo computer exhibition .
The E - Power has a 400MHz Intel Celeron ( Pentium II ) chip , 64 MB of memory and a 6.4 G hard drive in a translucent coloured case .
It looks like an iMac but at $ 799 costs a third less .
It even has a floppy disk drive .

It 's official :
Microsoft 's Windows NT operating system really is better than the GNU / Linux clone of Unix , but not by as much as Microsoft would like you to believe .
In a five - day showdown conducted by PC Week Labs in the US , NT beat GNU / Linux in every test .
However , to take but one example , the NT / Web server proved only 225 % faster than GNU / Linux / Apache , not 400 % .
The larger difference was claimed earlier this year following benchmark tests conducted independently by Mindcraft Inc but paid for by Microsoft .
Linux fans cried foul and demanded a rematch .
For the PC Labs tests , the Linux supporters - represented by Red Hat , the leading GNU / Linux distributor - were able to make all the tweaks they could think of , but were unable to match NT even on low - end hardware .
In fact , a single - processor NT system performed as well as a four - processor Linux box , which is exactly the reverse of the Linux movement 's propaganda .

1999-07-15,"Apple Computer is set to unveil its revolutionary consumer laptop next week , which will combine cutting - edge design with new engineering techniques in a package priced below the company 's existing PowerBook range .
An industry analyst who has been briefed by Apple engineers says the machine , pitched at students and home users , will be introduced by Apple interim chief executive Steve Jobs at the MacWorld exhibition in New York next Wednesday .
Despite speculation last month that the project could be cancelled because of technical problems , it is now thought the new machines could go on sale in the US in September , and be available in the UK before Christmas .
Richard Doherty , director of research at the Envisioneering Group in New York , told OnLine the new machine will deliver "" most of the Macintosh Powerbook experience , in a much more affordable , economical , lighter and durable package "" .
The price of the machine , thought to have a 12 inch screen , is not yet known , although it is expected that Apple will be aiming to compete with the $ 1,700 ( £ 1,062 ) notebooks currently on sale .
Prices could fall as demand increases , bringing the new machines into the price range of the sub - notebook market currently dominated by Windows CE devices .
"" Our ongoing research with consumers and business professionals alike shows that should the PowerBook be delivered in this new portable , it will appeal to many users who have turned to Windows CE devices , because it will have more PC final functionality , and compatibility , than many of the $ 800 - $ 1,000 notebooks that are out there , "" says Doherty .
At the heart of the portable will be a new technology to put most of the computer 's components on a single chip -a feature which Doherty thinks will not be widespread in the PC world "" for some time "" .
He adds : "" To get improved battery life and processing power , Apple has engaged in a massive re - engineering of the electronic componentry inside , which will also allow them to price it for consumers and for some organisations , who will order these in lieu of PC or even Powerbook products . ""
Almost everything but the processor has been put into a single chip , which reduces the cost and raises the reliability , while reducing the power it needs .
"" That 's very hard for the PC community to do , because when there is too much chip integration , especially by a company like Intel , people say that 's too monopolistic .
But for Apple , with just under 10 % market share worldwide , it 's just plain good business sense .
"" News of the announcement comes as Apple is about to reveal its second quarter results .
These are expected to show that Apple has managed a seventh successive profitable quarter .
The company has now completed the first stage of a re - alignment led by co - founder Jobs , who returned to Apple mid-1997 as it bled red ink and fussed over a large and fault - ridden range of products .
He set about reorganising the company , abandoning unprofitable projects and focusing Apple on four key areas : corporate desktop and portable machines , and domestic desktops and portables .
The resultant G3 range of desktop machines and sleek new high - end Powerbooks have revived Apple 's reputation in the corporate market and halted Apple phase - outs in key areas like publishing and education .
But by far the most interest has been in Apple 's answer for the domestic desktop market : the iMac .
Launched this time last year , the comparatively cheap , colourful , all - in- one computer quickly became the US 's top selling computer by taking Apple back to its original message - computers for the rest of us .
Using that message , it effectively targeted a new generation of "" non - nerd "" computer users , while still offering respectable technical specifications .
Building on that success , the company is expected to unveil the next generation iMac in time for the Christmas rush , which will sport a faster processor and larger screen .
There have also been suggestions the company may produce Apple - branded Palm V handheld computers in iMac - matching colour schemes .
That will be Apple 's first dalliance in the handheld market since Jobs killed off the flawed and unprofitable Newton project ."
1999-07-23,"Steve Jobs , wearing a black turtle - neck sweater and a messianic smile , holds up a small , tangerine - coloured computer .
For analysts and computer buyers alike , this week 's launch of iBook , the new Apple laptop , said a lot about the renaissance of Mr Jobs and his company .
The man who once said "" the only problem with Microsoft is that they just have no taste "" has staged a corporate recovery by meeting the consumer 's desire for something that looks better than a grey box .
The success of iMac , the desktop computer that comes in six fruity colours , has led to seven consecutive profitable quarters for a company which most had left for dead two years ago .
Apple now has a 12 % share of the US retail and mail - order computer markets .
With a product that appealed directly to the consumer , Mr Jobs reinvented a company which seemed to have become one of the many victims of the mighty Microsoft .
From an all - time low share price of just over $ 13 in mid-1997 , when Mr Jobs returned to the company he co - founded in 1976 , Apple 's stock has risen to top $ 50 .
On Wednesday , after the launch of the iBook at MacWorld , Apple 's biannual trade show , the shares rose more than 2 % to $ 55 .
But questions remain about the company in spite of its turnaround .
Some concern the intentions of Mr Jobs , who staged a sort of reverse takeover of the company when a struggling Apple bought NeXt , his software company , at the end of 1996 .
For the past two years , this charismatic leader , whose life story and rivalry with Bill Gates , his counterpart at Microsoft , has been made into a television film , has been "" acting chief executive "" .
Mr Jobs refuses to comment on whether he will pass on the mantle or drop the "" acting "" tag .
So far he has appeared keen to prove that the company he started by building a computer in his garage and giving it a name that reminded him of summer on an Oregon farm , is a success .
He is credited by analysts and Silicon Valley types with putting the company on a new footing .
He also hopes to disprove critics such as Esther Dyson , the queen bee of Silicon Valley , who reportedly said of his appointment : "" It 's romantic going back to your first love , but it rarely works out . ""
However , questions revolve around whether the group 's success , largely dependent on the iMac , can be sustained .
William Hamilton , computer analyst at the investment bank Brown Brothers Harriman , says : "" iMac has been a very successful product line for Apple but the PC market is a fiercely competitive one .
"" The jury is still out on whether the group has turned round by putting style over substance . ""
This is a product - driven company .
iMac was more about packaging and clever marketing than performance , although it was competitive , "" says Mr Hamilton .
Apple 's answer is to continue to provide desirable computers .
iBook is a variation on the iMac .
Shaped like a clam , its twin - coloured , translucent case and light weight appeals to the consumer and educational markets .
It dispenses with the need for a phone link by using a special wireless connection to local computer networks .
Mr Jobs demonstrated this by passing a hoop around the machine while surfing the web .
The laptop market is the fastest - growing area of the PC market and was an important gap in Apple 's arsenal .
While computer giants such as IBM and Compaq battle it out for the bigger , corporate market , the iBook is aimed at the poorly served , little understood consumer market for portable computers .
Its design and portability have made it attractive to schools .
Its price is as crucial as its looks and reliability .
Mr Jobs said on Wednesday that the iBook , with a starting price of $ 1,599 , is far cheaper than the other laptops on the market , which cost on average between $ 1,800 and $ 2,000 .
However , the price was at the top end of the range of expectations , which started at $ 1,000 .
Mr Hamilton believes Apple will have to offer discounts on the machines when they are rolled out this autumn because consumers will not be willing to pay that much for a non - essential item .
However , supporters of Apple point to its success at a pricing strategy which saw consumers pay $ 1,500 and more for iMacs last year .
Its gross margins of 27 % are better than the industry average , but operating margins are slightly worse because of its spending on research and development .
This is partly due to the need to develop "" non - standard products "" which do not necessarily run Microsoft Windows .
Mr Jobs may have publicly embraced his former nemesis Bill Gates , but his use of the rival products only goes so far .
Mr Jobs has made little headway in the corporate market and analysts wonder whether his products will stay a favourite of first - timers and design geeks .
This week 's presentation was opened by the actor who plays Mr Jobs in the television film Pirates of Silicon Valley .
While the programme has been a success , as with Apple , no one knows exactly how it will end .

At the core of the Apple"
1999-09-02,"Apple Computer 's enigmatic interim CEO Steve Jobs has unveiled the company 's latest top - end range of machines - the G4 Power Macs , promising they will bring "" the power of a super computer to the desktop "" .
In a bullish speech to the Seybold publishing conference in San Francisco on Tuesday , he also hailed Apple 's continued prosperity , gave a sneak preview of the company 's new Mac OS 9 and showed off a sleek new 22-inch flat - panel display which the company says is the largest monitor of its kind ever sold .
The top - end 500MHz G4 will , Jobs said , be able to perform more than one billion operations per second .
Jobs claimed this will make it twice as fast as 600MHz Pentium III PCs when running applications like Photoshop .
It will be aimed at graphics and publishing professionals , as well as high - end consumers .
"" The Power Mac G4 is not only the fastest Mac ever , it 's the fastest personal computer ever , "" Jobs told the conference .
He quoted Intel figures which he said showed the 500MHz G4 was 2.94 times faster than the 600MHz Pentium III .
However , within hours of the announcement industry analysts were disputing his figures .
"" There are lies , damned lies and demos , "" David Wu , an analyst at ABN AMRO , told News.com .
As well as the top - end machine , which will sell for $ 3,499 , there will be G4s running at 450 and 400 MHz , costing $ 2,499 and $ 1,599 respectively .
All the systems will come with a Photoshop plug - in to optimise their performance when running the popular image - editing software .
In contrast to the expected G4 announcement , the unveiling of the Apple Cinema Display took the audience by surprise .
The 22-inch letterbox format screen will offer a visible display area equivalent to a 24-inch conventional screen and sell for $ 3,999 , although supplies will be limited ; the screens will be available only when bundled with G4 systems bought direct from Apple 's website .
Jobs also revealed that 140,000 of the new iBook laptop computers have been pre - ordered before their launch in the US later this month , and the company has not even begun to take orders in the potentially vast Japanese market .
"" We are thrilled by the customer response to the iBook , and we 're working hard to ensure that we can meet the demand , "" Jobs told the conference .
Apple users , who have been waiting expectantly for the company 's delayed Mac OS9 , may have been disappointed by Jobs 's preview of the system , which is due to ship in October in the US for $ 99 .
He gave little away ; the OS will have the slogan "" Your internet co - pilot "" and "" nine internet power features "" .
It will have version II of Sherlock , Apple 's popular search engine , new multi - user functions , voice - authenticated passwords , automatic OS updates via the internet and built - in encryption capabilities .
It was also revealed that Apple has enjoyed its seventh profitable quarter in a row , boosted by the 2 million iMacs sold since the colourful personal computer was launched a year ago .
The iMac is proving particularly popular for new buyers wanting to get online - 90 % of iMac users are online , with one third saying the iMac is their first PC .
Partly as a result of the iMac 's success , Apple is now holding $ 3bn in cash with "" very little debt "" .
Inventory control is also stronger , Jobs said ; at the end of the last quarter there were just "" 15 hours "" of supplies in stock .
He also promoted Apple 's QuickTime multimedia technology , QuickTime TV ; a new online network intended to promote the live audio and video - streaming capabilities of QuickTime over rival technologies including RealPlayer and Microsoft 's Windows Media Player .
Jobs revealed music giant Warner Bros had signed up to launch a channel on QuickTime TV , which will allow users to watch music videos and order CDs online .
There was one major disappointment for Apple - watchers :
Jobs failed to mention a new generation of iMacs , expected to be launched in time for Christmas .
Rumours have suggested the new iMacs could have larger screens , a revamped design or faster processors .

Intel has also announced a new chip - the Coppermine Pentium III , which will have a speed of "" at least "" 700MHz , according to chief executive Craig Barrett .
The chip , an enhanced version of its fastest model , will be available sooner and run faster than many analysts expected .
The new chips will also run in notebook computers - which could help bridge the gap between PC desktops and portables ."
1999-09-23,"Steve Jobs is tired .
The co - founder and interim CEO of Apple Computer is sitting in an anonymous , grey meeting room in Paris 's Palais des Sports , playing distractedly with a bottle top , looking every one of his 43 years - and possibly a few more .
"" I 've not slept in two days , "" he says in a weary Californian drawl .
"" Jetlag ...
"" It 's a surprise to see him looking this drained .
Only two hours earlier he had been thrilling an unabashedly adoring audience of thousands in the giant centre 's auditorium , pacing the stage as he displayed his famous , near childlike enthusiasm for Apple 's products .
"" This is the most amazing product I 've ever seen , "" he says , introducing the company 's new Apple Studio Display - a 22-inch wide screen only one inch thick .
Later he asks : "" Is n't this incredible ? "" , and as the crowd laughs a ' yes ' , he bounds over to Apple 's new G4 computer , a sleek box finished in graphite grey which is also the fastest desktop PC around .
He runs a series of computing races on giant screens above the stage , between his G4 and "" the fastest Pentium money can buy "" .
The rival machine is left lagging by the G4 as they race to complete a complex Photoshop picture , and when it finally displays the image on its screen , he milks the moment for all it 's worth .
He 's almost hopping with delight , a broad grin on his face , as he sarcastically congratulates the Pentium III for catching up fully a minute after the G4 has finished .
Rumours of delays in deliveries of the hot new PowerPC processor from Motorola that powers the machine , later confirmed by Apple , are forgotten as the crowd whoops its approval for the new machine .
But now , that exuberance - a quality which makes Jobs appear more an enthusiast than the world - class salesman he is - appears to have vanished , as he focuses on that bottle top , which he is now trying to dismantle .
"" Things seem to have gone well , "" he says in a guarded tone as he eyes the table .
"" You guys hear more than I do on the stage , but it seemed quite enthusiastic .
"" It is hard to believe he was unaware of the crowd 's warmth towards him , as the crowd of Apple users , dealers , staff and potential converts bathed in the feeling that Apple is the only computer company on earth .
Apple , of course , is n't even in the biggest five personal computer companies on earth , by sales if not "" mindshare "" .
That notion is created only by what has been called the "" Jobs reality distortion field "" , which can reach out to Apple users around the world , and keep them loyal .
It was partly the force of his personality which led , in late 1996 , to then Apple CEO Gil Amelio bringing Jobs back to the company he helped found , but was effectively ousted from in 1985 .
Apple was in dire trouble : its operating system software strategy lay in ruins , after its next - generation Copland operating system was scrapped , and the company was haemorrhaging money as users turned to Windows 95 .
Jobs did n't take long to muscle his way into the CEO position , and a turnaround quickly followed .
He boosted cashflow by pulling the plug on loss - makers like the Newton handheld device , and boosted confidence in the Mac by taking a $ 150 m investment from Microsoft .
A little more than a year ago , he pulled the rabbit out the hat - the colourful all - in - one iMac .
It has now sold more than 2 million units , making it one of the most popular personal computers ever , and has helped lift Apple 's market share in the US to a more respectable 11 % , in retail and mail order .
More than 30 % of iMac buyers are first - time home computer owners , Apple says .
But that 's still a long way short of market dominance , let alone ubiquity .
Challenged on the issue of market share , Jobs looks up from his bottle top , slowly sits back in his chair , and brightens .
The distortion field goes up .
"" You know , I think we just want to make the best computers in the world ; that 's what we do , "" he says .
"" I do n't think most of our competitors care about that any more - they just want to make money .
We like making money too , but we think that if you make the best computers in the world , you will make money .
And I think that we are the last company in this business that really cares about making great computers . ""
It depends how you look at it .
If you look at it in total , you 're right [ about Apple 's small slice of the market ] .
But if you 're willing to accept that it 's OK not to go after the big enterprise customers then our market share looks much bigger .
For instance , in the design and publishing market - which is huge - worldwide we have the largest market share .
In the education market , which we think is very important , Apple is the largest education supplier in the world .
So we 're number one in design and publishing , and number one in education . ""
In consumer our market share has gone up in the last year and we have now doubled our market share , and who knows what will happen in the future ?
In these markets that we serve , I think Apple is doing very well , and in some cases has the largest market share .
"" The suggestion that Apple does n't want to be the number one PC maker is , of course , nonsense .
But Apple , boxed in now by Microsoft and Intel 's stranglehold on the market , has to make like it 's looking to greater things than mere world domination .
Is one of the first of those ambitions , the philosophy of "" computers of the rest of us "" invented with the first Macintosh in 1984 , still alive at Apple ?
Jobs interjects with an emphatic "" sure "" at the mention of the old slogan .
"" If you look at it , our industry has done a pretty poor job of listening to the customers in the consumer market .
I mean , "" Jobs pauses , arms wide , and frowns , "" the industry sold big , ugly beige load boxes that took up desks and everything else .
The customers were saying ' my God , I do n't know how to connect all these cables ' , ' my God this thing is too noisy ' , ' my God it does n't fit on my desk ' and ' my God I have to hide it when visitors come over ' .
iMac was the first time that a computer company had really addressed some of theses issues , these challenges .
"" The other companies are n't really computer companies , "" he says , warming to his theme . "" They 're distributors .
They take technology from Microsoft , they take technology from Intel , they put it in a box they buy in the far east and then they ship it .
And they try to do it more efficiently than the other guy .
So the arguments are not really over who makes the better product , but who has the best distribution .
That 's what they fight about .
They just do n't care about design .
We think it 's really important . ""
He sounds almost incredulous at his competitor 's lack of nous .
Is he surprised , given the massive success of the iMac , that no major manufacturer ( two small PC makers in the far east excepted ) has tried to copy the idea ?
Jobs is dismissive .
"" I do n't know .
You 'd have to ask them why . '
Original ' is not in the vocabulary of the Wintel market .
I do n't know - we have so many challenges
we 're just focused on what we 're doing , and the competitors will just do whatever they 're gon na do .
We ca n't influence or change them .
We just try to do our best , and stay ahead . ""
Away from the headline grabbing hardware , Apple has made one other surprise push in its attempt to lead again .
It has started promoting , heavily , its QuickTime multimedia streaming technology , which has existed - and been admired - for years , but never been given a great deal of attention , until now .
Jobs ' Paris keynote dwelt at length on the software , which works on PCs as well as Macs , and the company 's new Quick - Time TV , which broadcasts programmes from a range of broadcasters including the BBC , Disney and CBS .
This new content role sits easily with Jobs 's other CEO job - at Toy Story animater Pixar - and his anti - PC bile is quickly replaced by more enthusiasm , this time for the Apple software challenging RealNetwork 's market - leading Real Player , and Microsoft 's Windows Media Player .
He also hints at how vital the internet is to Apple 's strategy . ""
Clearly , we 're very focused on the internet - the "" i "" in iMac is for internet , and I think we 've succeeded in making the most exciting internet computer in the world .
We do a lot of things on the internet - obviously ,
OS9 , if you look at that you 'll see a lot of its features are targeted at making the internet experience better for users . ""
So it 's natural to think that we 'd be investing in other software for the internet too .
OS9 has Sherlock in it , and QuickTime is also internet - based software for the most part .
So it 's a pretty natural fit . ""
Do possibilities lie ahead for Apple as TV , mobile communications and the internet converge ?
"" We build computers , "" he says defensively , and for a moment it seems he is ready to launch into his stock "" we do n't talk about future products "" answer - often a prelude to his brisk departure from an interview .
But this time Jobs continues , picking his words carefully . ""
The internet is clearly giving a whole new area of possibilities to computing .
But the internet - remember - is 99.9 % accessed by personal computers - Macs and Intel machines .
And so internet content producers have come to rely upon all the capabilities of those PCs to make the most competitive content - they need to run QuickTime or one of its competitors .
They need to run Java , some of them run all sorts of things .
They use the latest browser features .
And if they do n't , they do n't have a competitive website .
"" So there are all these people trying to make phones , and other devices , go on to the internet , and they have quite a big software hurdle .
It 's pretty hard to put QuickTime in a phone .
It 's pretty hard to put the latest browser features in a phone .

1999-09-23,"American computer company bosses are like buses : you wait ages then half a dozen turn up at once .
Friday was Oracle 's Larry Ellison ( famous for having an ego the size of a planet ) , Tuesday was Intel 's Andy Grove , and Red Hat 's Bob Young will be along any minute .
Even more turned up in Paris last week , including Larry 's mate Steve Jobs of Apple , and Compaq 's new head Michael Capellas .
Compaq was noticeable by its absence from the "" concept PC "" show at Intel 's conference in Palm Springs , California , less than a month ago .
But Capellas said it was working to produce some iMac - style machines before Christmas : "" Yes , you will see us absolutely follow that pattern .
We 're going to really , really drive innovative design .
"" Compaq is the world 's largest PC manufacturer , and research firm IDC reckons it shipped 3.8 million of the 26 million PCs sold just in the year 's second quarter .
It was n't such a good week for Britain 's Psion .
Profits for the past six months plunged from £ 4.1 m to £ 57,000 after deductions , as turnover fell by 12 % to £ 64.2 m .
Palmtop sales fell 34 % to £ 24.5 m because demand for the Series 5 crumbled as buyers waited for the 5mx .

1999-10-06,"Apple 's interim chief executive Steve Jobs has unveiled three upgrades to the year - old iMac , the colourful computer that helped turn Apple 's fortunes around by selling about 2 million units since its launch last autumn .
The new machines - which Apple UK says will all be available in Britain by the end of the month - are priced aggressively , starting at £ 799 including VAT for the new entry - level iMac and rising to £ 1,199 including VAT for the digital video disk ( DVD ) -equipped
iMacDV Special Edition . ""
The iMac has been a landmark product , not just for Apple but for the whole industry , "" Jobs told an audience at the Flint Center in Cupertino , California , on Tuesday .
He said that Apple planned to bring video to the desktop with the new machines , as it had brought publishing to the desktop in the 1980s , and unveiled software which would make video editing "" incredibly easy "" for home and school users .
The new iMacs feature more powerful processors than their predecessors , as well as increased memory , larger hard drives and faster graphics chips .
But they will not have cooling fans - a Jobs pet hate .
"" We 've made the computer beautiful to look at , "" he said .
"" Now we want to make them beautiful sounding . ""
The machines are being targeted at schools and the consumer market , with the low prices being interpreted as a defensive move against PC price wars in the Windows/ Intel market , which have taken the price of some machines below $ 500 in the US .
The new iMacs will ship with Apple 's long - awaited operating system , Mac OS 9 , which will contain a raft of new features to aid internet navigation , including version two of Apple 's Sherlock search engine .
The new OS will allow multiple users to share the same Mac while keeping their individual settings and preferences .
It has built - in encryption and password management , including voice - activated passwords .
OS9 will sell separately in the UK from October 28 .
It will cost £ 79 .
Later this month , for the first time , buyers will have a three iMac models to choose from , each sporting different configurations .
The revised "" standard iMac "" with 350MHz processor will cost £ 799 including VAT , against £ 925 for the current 333MHz model .
Two higher - end iMacDV models will include a slot - load DVD ( Digital Versatile Disc ) drive to play movies on the machine 's 15-inch screen .
Sound will be delivered through hi - fi speakers by Harmon Kardon , designed to give better bass resonance than typical PC speakers .
Harmon Kardon will also release a subwoofer , specially designed for Macs , which will connect to the USB port .
The DV models will have two ports for the high - speed FireWire ( 1394 ) system for connecting peripherals like digital camcorders , and Apple 's new iMovie software for creating "" pro - quality home and classroom movies "" .
The top of the range £ 1,199 400MHz "" special edition "" model will come in the same graphite grey as the G4 machines announced last month , with a 13 GB hard drive and 128 MB of memory .
The announcement of the new Macs follows a difficult few weeks for Apple .
After unveiling its G4 "" supercomputer on a chip "" system at the end of August , Apple warned analysts to expect lower earnings for its fourth quarter because of supply problems with the new machine 's Motorola - made PowerPC processor .
However , the company is expecting a strong run - up to Christmas .
Jobs is promising to fulfil orders and to ramp - up production to deal with the holiday season rush ."

Mr Jobs , who stunned a MacWorld audience in 1997 with news of a $ 150 m investment in Apple by its rival Microsoft , became interim chief executive in September 1997 while the company searched for a permanent leader .

2000-05-18,"X off Apple has just delayed the release of its next generation operating system , Mac OS X ( pronounced "" ten "" ) by about six months .
Or as Apple boss Steve Jobs says , it has changed what would have been a summer launch into a "" public beta "" release . ""
Like a lot of things in life , you can do what you were going to do but change the names of things to make a lot of people happy , "" Jobs said .
Mac OS X is a version of BSD Unix , and needs a G3 or G4 processor and 64 megabytes of memory .
It is based on the NextStep operating system , created by Next , Jobs ' former company .
Apple bought Next at the end of 1996 to provide a faster way of replacing the ageing Mac OS .

Now Ellison has founded New Internet Computer ( NIC ) with what looks like the old logo .
It is being run by a former ABC - TV technology journalist , Gina Smith .
NIC 's 266MHz $ 199 NC will not have a hard drive , monitor , keyboard or speakers but will run the GNU / Linux operating system and a browser from CD - rom .
It 's intended to provide access to email and the internet : "" We 're not positioning this as a replacement for the PC , "" Smith says .
As usual , the problem is that by the time you 've added the missing bits , the cost - $ 376 - is not far off a cheap PC .
NIC has launched a website at www.thinknic.com .

2000-06-08,"Apple 's decision to delay the release of MacOS X - the long - awaited successor to the Mac 's venerable system software - disappointed many Mac users , but came as no surprise .
The story of Apple 's attempt to create a brand new , up - to - date operating system has had such a soap opera quality that as the final episode nears , a last - minute plot twist seemed inevitable .
You almost expect the chief executive officer Steve Jobs to lean out of the shower and tell us all it was just a bad dream , Sue - Ellen .
And to Mac users , MacOS X - it 's a roman numeral , not a letter - is something of a dream .
It promises Mac owners the kind of crash - free computing they 've hoped to get from their system software but have never had .
And it comes with a new graphical user interface , Aqua , that Apple claims will put the Mac as far ahead of Windows as it was back before Microsoft released Windows 95 .
Sounds too good to be true ?
It 's beginning to feel that way too .
Last January , at the bi - annual gathering of Mac fans , MacWorld Expo San Francisco , Jobs unveiled MacOS X and promised to ship it , shrinkwrapped "" in the summer "" and bundle it with all shipping Macs early 2001 .
But at last month 's Worldwide Developers ' Conference ( WWDC ) , we learned the new operating system , built pretty much fresh from the ground up , would arrive early next year , with the summer 's release being relegated to a public test release of the as yet unfinished software - a "" beta "" version .
Apple 's spin doctors immediately attempted to persuade software authors at the conference and Mac users reading reports on the internet that the six - month slip was nothing of the kind .
"" We 're delivering the same software at the same time , but with different names , "" was how Phil Schiller , the company 's VP for product marketing , put it .
Which begs the question : how come you were previously willing to ask users to pay for unfinished software , but you 're not now ?
Now the rotational paramedics go quiet - surprise , surprise .
May 's six - month setback is just the latest in a very long line of broken promises .
Understandably broken , to be fair , since the creation of an operating system - the code that governs how a computer looks , feels and behaves - is no simple task .
Even the mighty Microsoft regularly put back the release of what became Windows 2000 but started out as Windows NT version 5 .
And Linux has taken the best part of nine years and thousands of net - connected collaborators to reach the stage where it disturbs Bill Gates 's sleep .
In comparison , the genesis of Apple 's next - generation operating system does n't seem too extraordinary .
But then we 're not talking about the gestation of a single product .
Unlike Linux and Windows 2000 , MacOS X is the latest in a line of would - be successors to the classic MacOS , stretching right back to a 1987 research project called Pink .
Pink ended up being spun out of the company as part of Apple 's bizarre liaison with IBM in 1990 , sent out into the world as Taligent , only to col lapse , product unshipped , in 1995 .
The irony : Pink / Taligent was an attempt to build an object - oriented OS - one made of small , highly efficient and re - useable chunks of soft ware code - something that Jobs , by then out of Apple , was hard a work on at his new company , NeXT .
After Pink , Apple engineers in 1993 initiated project Raptor , the company 's second attempt to build MacOS :
The Next Generation .
Raptor pretty much failed too , being finally rolled the following year into try three , Copland .
This time Apple bosses figured they had the right strategy : create a brand new Mac operating system and imbue it with the features that would beat Microsoft 's MacOS killer project , codenamed Chicago .
Copland was originally codenamed Capone , after the mobster who brought the city of Chicago to its knees .
But the release of Chicago ( the OS ) in 1995 as Windows 95 , while Capone was still in Apple 's labs , forced a hasty name change .
It also brought a wake - up call to the Mac maker , which suddenly released it was n't the main man any longer .
In early 1996 , Apple officially announced Copland and promised to ship it around the middle of the year .
By then Apple 's management was imploding , and Gil Amelio , brought in to rescue the company , had seen that Copland would not only be incompatible with existing Mac software , but would n't provide users ' applications with any of the new , more powerful OS benefits .
He canned the project and decided to buy in its replacement .
Eventually , Apple bought NeXT , Steve Jobs ' company , you 'll recall , just before Christmas for $ 400 m .
The following month Apple announced Copland 's replacement , Rhapsody ( next - gen operating system number four ) , and pledged to ship it mid to late 1998 .
Unlike Copland , Rhapsody would provide that all - important backwards compatibility and bring in a powerful object - oriented approach to application creation , plus the two key features : memory protection , which allows an application to die without bringing the entire system down ( as anyone who 's experienced an Unexpected Type 1 Error will appreciate ) , and pre - emptive multi - tasking : the ability to run applications simultaneously and give each a full share of the host computer 's hardware resources .
Both sound highly abstruse but are essential to creating highly stable systems that do n't fall over every time QuarkXPress goes off in a huff .
And that was central to Apple 's Rhapsody strategy : to provide its professional users , and those who develop software for them , with a solid operating system that could compete with Microsoft .
For once , Apple was able to ship Rhapsody broadly on time .
As 1998 rolled round , the company released MacOS X Server .
Of course , in "" Operating System Street "" , nothing is quite that simple , and Apple had already been forced to rethink Rhapsody / MacOS X by its major developers , led by Adobe , the creator of PhotoShop , who did n't want to rewrite all their popular applications solely to take advantage of the new OS features .
So while Apple was spinning MacOS X Server as a kind of preview to much - promised next - generation OS , it was reworking MacOS
X proper to allow existing Mac applications to use memory protection and pre - emptive multi - tasking , using a technology called Carbon .
Carbon is essentially a re - write of the classic MacOS software toolbox that fits it into the new OS 's modern framework , allowing modified apps to operate as if they had been designed for MacOS X. Alongside Carbon sits Classic , formerly known as Blue Box , the MacOS 9 emulation module , and Cocoa , the object - oriented application framework derived from NeXT 's bought - in OS and the basis for next - generation applications .
All provide three ways of to run applications on a MacOS X - based Macintosh , maximising the system software 's backwards compatibility and making the most of its new features .
Add the new OS 's powerful Adobe Acrobat - based 2D graphics system and the industry standard OpenGL 3D graphics technology , advanced networking and internet access , and Apple 's well - established QuickTime multimedia technology , and MacOS X is shaping up to be a very powerful operating system indeed , one that , unlike the classic MacOS , can compete with Windows and Linux .
For all Steve Jobs 's frequent comments that Apple has "" lost the OS war "" , this is really what MacOS X is about .
That statement is really about how Apple is n't about to become a software company the way Microsoft is - at least until the US Department of Justice breaks it apart - but a system business .
The Macintosh is as much a hardware platform as an operating system , and Apple wants the two to fit snugly together .
How else is it going to sell systems that are more expensive than their Wintel equivalents ?
T he snag here is that MacOS X needs to fit two markets : the professional buyer and the new , iMac - hungry consumer .
Classic MacOS works well in this joint role , providing consumers with a user - friendly user interface and the pros with a stack of well - established applications .
Unfortunately , MacOS X , while providing the stability professional users crave , has n't yet proved itself on the applications front .
Apple representatives mention the 200-odd developers who are creating MacOS
X applications - almost all of them simple Carbonisations of existing programs - but are unable to say when we 'll see any but a handful of them .
That no doubt explains the latest delay .
"" We 'll be shipping a final [ Mac OS X ] 1.0 with pre - loading options in January , "" said Jobs at WWDC , a far cry from his MacWorld statement : "" Mac OS X will go on sale as a shrink - wrapped software product this summer , and will be pre - loaded as the standard operating system on all Macintosh computers beginning in early 2001 .
"" And "" there is certainly more work to finish on the details of [ Mac OS X ] .
There is some fine - tuning , but the majority of the product is in place "" , says Phil Schiller .
Apple probably wants to give itself more time to make MacOS X 's decidedly NeXT - like user interface , Aqua , appear more like the classic Mac .
Again , it 's a sign of the OS 's schizophrenia : a cute , gizmo - filled front - end to tease the consumers , but one that does little for Apple 's professional hardcore .
If the reactions of pro users I spoke to at MacWorld are anything to go by , they do n't care for all Aqua 's UI flim - flam .
Can MacOS X become the genuine successor to the classic MacOS , a "" one size fits all "" operating system for pros and consumers alike ?
Until we get to see the public beta , with its complete feature set , it 's difficult to say .
Certainly , Microsoft 's attempts to merge Windows 2000 and Windows 98 into a single , core OS have n't gone according to plan , and are n't expected to deliver until after the successor to 98 , Windows Millennium , is released .
Even Apple seems concerned - hence the OS 's relegation to "" optional "" status .
But Apple 's need to get its OS strategy
right is greater than Microsoft 's and that could ensure MacOS
X has the cross - community appeal it needs .
The classic Mac OS is so far behind the times developers are already turning away from it - even the upcoming next - gen Amiga OS looks more advanced .
And after so many false starts - Pink , Raptor , Copland and Rhapsody - Apple needs to prove it can do the business .
And if that takes a six - month set - back , so be it .

2000-07-19,"Apple Computer was last night expected to continue its remarkable turnaround with a jump in profits on the back of the successful iMac desktop computer .
Its rival Microsoft was likely to strike a sombre note , analysts said , with earnings growth from its main desktop software knocked by a recent slowdown in PC sales .
Apple , headed by Steve Jobs , was due to announce third quarter earnings ahead of its annual MacWorld exhibition in New York today .
Wall Street analysts expected the company , which introduced its sorbet - coloured range of iMac computers a year ago , to introduce a new version .
Among improvements suggested by observers were a faster G3 processor or chip or a more conventional mouse instead of its round one .
Analysts expected the company to report a 26 % increase in third - quarter earnings at 44 cents a share yesterday in spite of a seasonal slowdown .
Some doubts have remained about Apple .
In a note to clients , Andrew Neff , analyst at Bear Stearns , wrote : "" Investors do not accord it the valuation it deserves because - in our mind - Apple is still viewed by many as a reformed alcoholic - just one step away from the gutter . ""
Microsoft was due to reveal a slower rate of earnings growth yesterday .
Overall revenues were expected to grow 1 per cent to $ 5.8bn , compared with $ 5.4bn last year ."
2000-07-19,"Apple Computer unveiled its first new product line for nine months yesterday , including a cube - shaped power computer and an updated iMac range for the consumer market .
Steve Jobs , wearing his trademark baggy jeans and black polo neck jumper , said the Power Mac G4 Cube combined the power of the group 's business - focused desktop with the "" iMac magic "" of sleek design .
He won an appreciative gasp from an audience of thousands of Mac devotees at the annual MacWorld event in New York when he demonstrated the ease of removing the inside of the eight - inch cube - shaped computer .
Wall Street analysts hope the updated iMac range will help improve sales of the colourful computers .
Although about 3.7 m iMacs have been sold since they were introduced two years ago , making them among the most popular desktops , sales slowed in the quarter to the end of June .
Apple hopes that the latest range , which boasts five new colours as well as an optical mouse and keyboard , will reinvigorate demand in the run - up to the all - important Christmas selling season .
Wall Street 's immediate reaction was negative .
Shares in Apple were down more than $ 3 to $ 53.625 an hour after the new range had been announced as traders reacted to the slightly weaker sales released the night before .
Apple took the wraps off four new models of the iMac yesterday .
The basic model in a new indigo colour scheme will be priced at $ 799 in the US and aimed at first - time users .
The entry - level machine is important for the group because internal analysis suggests that 30 % of all iMac buyers were first - time users of the group 's products .
The more expensive models boast digital video and a palette of colours to extend the "" fruit sorbet "" range .
Other new developments revealed with some gusto by Mr Jobs include computers with dual processors and a demonstration of a new interface for the version of Mac OS to be released next year .
A senior manager at Microsoft received the least enthusiastic welcome from an audience which included some enthusiasts wearing Monopoly - board images of the company .
However , the company displayed a new software suite designed for Macs , prompting Mr Jobs to exclaim : "" The best version of Office is that used on the Mac - who would have thunk [ sic ] it a few years ago . ""
Average unit prices have been affected by a bigger than expected shift to lower - priced iMacs and iBooks in the education sector .
The company has made generous allowances , too , for the discounting it sees as necessary to clear old stock before the new range arrives in the shops ."
2000-07-27,"Steve Jobs , Apple chief executive , took centre stage last week to unveil a new product range , but perhaps his most interesting comments passed almost unnoticed in the latest Business Week magazine .
There , he was quoted as saying the Mac maker is working "" on a handful "" of internet appliances - cutdown computers which offer only internet access , without the expensive memory or hard disk requirements of general purpose computers .
The new devices could start appearing next year , the magazine suggested .
That would be quite a departure for Apple , which currently markets the iMac -which starts at £ 649 - as its simple solution for surfing the net .
For now , the new G4 Cube was getting the most applause at the MacWorld expo in New York - for its good looks , if nothing else .
It is a stylish 20 cm square box with some cute design innovations : instead of having a noisy fan inside , it has a vent on top , next to a toaster - style slot loading CD / DVD drive .
The innards , however , are not so exciting : there is a 450MHz or 500MHz G4 processor , 64 MB of memory , a 20 GB hard drive , a 56k modem , and the dated ATI Rage 128 Pro graphics card .
There are no internal expansion slots .
As we went to press , there was no price for the 500MHz version , but the 450MHz model will cost £ 1,467 , including VAT .
There is also a new range of iMac colours , waving goodbye to the likes of blueberry and tangerine , and saying hello to ruby and indigo .
And , to cheers , the hated iMac mouse and tiny keyboard has been abolished .
The new Apples will all ship with an optical mouse ( with no moving parts ) and a proper keyboard .
For details , see www.apple.com/uk .
Flying phone
We 've all heard commuters shouting "" hi , honey , I 'm on the train "" down their mobiles on the way home .
Soon we could be suffering "" hi , honey , I 'm on the plane "" as we watch the in - flight movie .
BAE Systems , a UK - based aerospace company , has devloped a new system called CabinCall which will allow aeroplane passengers to use their own mobile phones in flight .
The system routes the calls from the plane via satellite or terrestrial networks .
With several airlines said to have expressed an interest , the system could start appearing in planes from autumn 2001 .
Cabin crews will retain control of the system , meaning that calls can be prohibited during critical times such as take off and landing and - one would hope - night flights ."
2000-09-17,"There are not many people whose mere entry into a room elicits an outbreak of spontaneous joy and vigorous clapping . '
The Fonz ' from the television show Happy Days was a pioneer , but he had nothing on Steve Jobs , the chief executive of Apple .
Even before he opened his mouth , Apple 's founder and saviour had provoked a mini - Mexican wave out of an astonishingly delirious crowd gathered for last week 's keynote speech at Apple 's Paris expo .
A glimpse of Jobs in his trademark shambolic jeans and buttoned - up black shirt was enough .
Jobs is the leader of a tribe that has been rescued from the doldrums in less than three years .
It has been rescued in style , and partly because of style .
The iMac and iBook , both now famously available in a choice of five colours , as well as the new PowerMac Cube , have been designed to work solidly but simply and to look good .
When The Observer met Jobs , he was still in salesman mode about the new Cube .
He said : ' It 's amazing in that it takes the power of a big super computer - and it 's very quiet , so you can hear yourself think .
It 's just a very beautiful shape and it 's very simple and we love it . '
He was focused on the new product announcements .
At the Paris show he revealed three new colours for iBook - indigo , graphite and key lime - and special editions with new functions : playing DVDs and connecting to digital video cameras . '
Customers like [ the colours ] a lot
and they respond to specific colours .
They do n't all sell the same .
Blues are always a top - seller . '
The iBook , a rugged laptop with rubberised edges , has an impressive , but not top - end , specification .
Nevertheless , it has made significant strides .
Measured by revenue , Apple is number one in the world in the education market , Jobs says .
Schools and universities have been keen users - and children and students may pose the toughest test of a company whose mantra is that computers should be fun to use .
Its professional range of computers , including the G4 tower , the new Cube and the more reserved Powerbook , are particularly popular in creative industries : publishers and designers have always been major Mac users .
In the Eighties , Apple popularised desktop publishing , enabling users to design and publish newsletters from home .
Today 's equivalent in the multimedia world is the iMovie , and Jobs is trying to push it as a killer application for the Mac . '
Everyone 's taking videos , but they do n't do anything with those videos .
People have the raw materials to edit it , put a soundtrack or title on it , position it .
This lets any body make a movie on their computer with their own video footage , and then put it on the internet , ' he says .
At a corporate level the company is branded around the creativity of use of its products as well as creativity of design .
It 's ads implore people to ' Think different ' , taking a highly creative approach to grammar . '
Its human to like to create things , we make these wonderful personal computers that people use to express themselves creatively , ' says Jobs .
He appears to be on auto - pilot for the interview , occasionally yawning , and answering four different questions with some variant of ' All we 're trying to do is make the best personal computers in the world ' .
Jobs is jetlagged and tired .
The previous night , Apple 's showpiece expo in Europe was flooded by the sprinkler system , and there had been a muddle over tickets for his speech , with hundreds of ' Mac - heads ' locked out .
In the past he has abruptly halted interviews because of questions he did not like .
Apple has a strict policy of not commenting on future developments , nor is Jobs keen on talking about the past , and we 're advised not to ask anything personal .
What 's left ?
He seems an entirely different person from the man showing off products on stage .
Although the complete focus on Apple is clear , the genius does not come across .
Jobs 's appearances in front of crowds are theatrical : he is like an actor , or a magician .
In private , there is an extremely hard edge .
It is also clear that some of the Apple staff are terrified of him .
The operator of one Apple stand , eyes bloodshot from the night 's flood rescue effort , visibly trembled as Jobs came into view .
But these are , of course , the qualities that have turned round the company from its mid - Nineties slump to seven straight quarters of profits .
In the past , Apple 's renowned creativity may have caused a lack of focus , but Jobs injected a strict corporate backbone when he rejoined the company in 1997 after 12 years in exile .
Another problem of the Apple of the past was that it was leaky .
As a comparatively small player with only 5 per cent of the global PC market , it needs to punch above its publicity weight .
Spectacular design helps but Jobs also has to save product launches to achieve maximum impact .
The iMac launch was a complete surprise and the industry was knocked for six .
Since then the constant reinvention and regeneration have not disappointed .
Apple goes to spectacular lengths to protect this but the Mac - heads do not complain .
They appear to support Apple as anyone else might follow Arsenal .
So fervent is their passion that they will boast about the fact that Apple Macs have a higher profit margin than Windows - based PCs , where other consumers might complain of being ripped off .
But this loyalty can be excessive , and on entering the Apple expo one is engulfed in a funky business hell .
People zoom past on shiny aluminium micro - scooters or on rollerblades .
Grown men wear tight black T - shirts emblazoned with ' MacUser ' where others might sport the name of a designer .
There were repeated attempts to get iBooks autographed by Jobs .
Long term , Apple needs to broaden its appeal , and persuade people to transfer from conventional Windows / Intel PCs . '
That 's already happening - about 14 per cent of iMac customers are "" Wintel "" switchers , ' Jobs says .
Mac OS X , the new operating system released in development format in Paris , is key to any attack on the Wintel hegemony .
It appears to be trying to do for the experience of using a computer what the iMac and Cube have already done for the exterior .
The ' Aqua ' user interface - which , quips Jobs , made the Paris flood highly appropriate - has nice user - friendly touches and looks polished .
The design uses shadows and translucence .
The system is remarkably robust and failed to crash despite the efforts of The Observer IT team .
Surprisingly , Jobs prefers to talk of Microsoft as partners - a heresy among some Mac - heads . '
I 've known Bill [ Gates ] for a long time -
he and I started out when we were both very young , and now we 're not so young
and I admire what he 's done .
Now we 're working together on many projects and it 's good , ' he says .
And where does he think the Mac will stand in an era of convergence between television , mobile phones and computers ? '
Y'know the refrigerator and the television have n't merged .
Not everything will come together .
There will be a computer and a television for different purposes .
Computers will be in everything but the PC is still a very useful tool . '
Now the interview time is up . '
I wanna go and take a look at the booth
- I hear we 're crazy down there selling Mac OS X , the line is really long . '
The personnel on that stand must have been shaking .
Jobs 's latest venture with Pixar , his production company behind films like Toy Story and A Bug 's Life , is called Monsters Inc ... but no , he 's not in it ."
2000-09-21,"It was an eventful Apple Expo 2000 last week in Paris , with the company 's chief executive Steve Jobs rolling into town to unveil a test version of the new Mac OS X and a series of more powerful iBook laptop computers .
The event was marred by a flood in the main exhibition hall , caused by a faulty fire sprinkler system , which left many booths - including Apple 's - under two inches of water .
The new iBooks laptops do n't float , but are beefed up after criticism that previous versions have been short on power .
The processor on the entry level iBook is now a 366MHz G3 , with a 10 GB hard drive and 64 MB of memory as standard .
A special edition version has a faster 466MHz G3 processor , high - speed FireWire port and DVD drive .
All versions come with the video editing package iMovie 2 .
The standard iBook costs £ 1062 , and the special edition £ 1275 , ex VAT .
Following the pattern of the recently revamped iMac desktop range , the new iBooks are available in new colours - indigo and lime .
The special edition comes in graphite or lime .
Also unveiled was the first beta version of the new Mac OS X , a complete re - write of the Mac operating system which will radically change the way the machines work and look on screen .
Unlike many beta versions which are free , the Mac OS X beta will cost £ 24.95 .
It will also need a mammoth 128 MB of memory to run , which may cause some upset among Mac users .
Even the latest Macs only have half the necessary memory fitted as standard .
The new OS is expected to be realised in its final version in the first quarter of next year ."
2000-09-30,"Apple Computer yesterday lost at a stroke much of the hard - won credibility it had regained over the past three years as its market value halved in the wake of a surprise profits warning .
The company , which suffered a loss - making streak in the mid-1990s , had come back into favour after founder Steve Jobs returned to the helm at the end of 1996 .
But Thursday 's after hours warning sent Apple almost back to square one .
Around $ 9bn ( £ 6.5bn ) was wiped off the company 's market capitalisation as its shares more than halved to $ 26.12 by midday .
Several analysts downgraded their forecasts after Apple warned that its earnings would be substantially lower than expected in the fourth quarter .
It blamed weaker demand in the important education sector and a slow start to its recently launched PowerMac G4 Cube .
It added that there had been a "" business slowdown in all geographies "" .
Apple 's warning prompted a sell - off among computer and semiconductor chip manufacturers as investors worried about longer term demand for personal computers .
PC maker Dell and Intel , the semiconductor manufacturer which issued its own profits warning earlier this month , were particularly hard hit .
However , several analysts downplayed the broader significance of Apple 's warning .
In a note to investors , Steve Fortuna , an analyst at investment bank Merrill Lynch , urged investors to buy shares in Apple competitors such as Compaq and Gateway on the back of the downturn . ""
Investors should not read this Apple blow - up as evidence that personal computer demand is weak .
Apple is , in many ways , a market unto itself , "" he wrote .
Thursday 's announcement delivered a sharp blow to Apple 's revival under Mr Jobs .
When he returned to Apple , it was losing money and staff .
He turned the company around and reported a succession of profitable results , largely due to the launch of iMac , the colourful range of computers designed for the consumer market .
As recently as this summer , however , industry analysts admitted that investors continued to be wary .
Now there are doubts about the company 's ability to pull off a swift improvement in sentiment after this week 's disappointment .
Charlie Wolf , an analyst at UBS Warburg , said : "" This raises a red flag for the future . ""
In his note , Mr Fortuna wrote : "" We do not see this as a one quarter phenomenon for Apple but rather as the beginning of many tough quarters ahead . ""
Although the Cube was launched in July amid much fanfare and an advertising campaign promoting a range of new iMac colours ran in July , Mr Fortuna said that the company 's "" existing products were getting stale "" .
Announcing the unexpectedly slow sales in September after the stock market closed on Thursday , Fred Anderson , Apple 's chief financial officer , offered little encouragement .
"" We are currently re - evaluating our plans going forward , and will provide lower growth targets for next quarter and the next fiscal year when we announce our final results , "" he warned .
Apple will announce its results next month .
The company indicated that it would announce fourth - quarter earnings of between 30 and 33 cents a share , well below the expected 45 cents ."
2001-01-10,"Apple Computer started its fightback yesterday against falling sales and heavy losses by announcing a revamp of its professional range of computers , new consumer - orientated software and a March release date for its long - awaited operating system , Mac OSX .
The announcements were made by the company 's chief executive officer , Steve Jobs , to an adoring crowd of 5,000 people at the Macworld show in San Francisco .
The adulation could not hide the fact that Apple has been struggling recently .
In December it forecast a loss for the first quarter of this year , the first since Mr Jobs returned in 1997 to the company he founded .
Industry researcher PC Data reported that Apple 's US sales in the first half of December fell 40 % against an industry - wide fall of 20 % .
Apple is expected to report this month a last quarter loss of $ 250 m ( £ 168 m ) due to disappointing sales of its new Cube desktop computer and its colourful iMac machine .
Yesterday Mr Jobs admitted : "" The last few months have been particularly challenging for Apple and the rest of the industry , "" but added : "" We 've decided to start 2001 with a bang . ""
The most gasps were reserved for Mr Jobs 's final announcement - a new ultra - thin PowerBook laptop computer called Titanium , the metal from which its case is made .
The new machine is only 1 in thick , weighs 5.3 lb and sports a 15.2 in display .
There were whoops of delight for a range of G4 machines which take the company 's top - rated chip to 733MHz .
Perhaps more significant for Apple 's long - term prospects was Mr Jobs 's declaration of the company 's vision , based around what he termed the "" digital lifestyle "" .
Included in his presentation was a trio of software packages : iMusic was presented as sophisticated software for handling digital music files , which Apple will give away from its website .
He also announced iDVD , a new DVD creation program ."
2001-12-18,"It 's a bit like Christmas when you were a kid .
The Mac community is getting all excited about what Steve Jobs might have in his sack when he turns up at MacExpo in San Francisco in early January .
It 's pretty much agreed there 's a new flat - panel iMac in there - but can we expect more ?
Fuelling the speculation is the fact he 's brought his keynote Expo speech forward by a day , and extended it to two and a half hours .
Full coverage in Online and here , natch ."
2002-01-07,"( Blogging from MacExpo in San Francisco )
At around 5 pm today UK time ( 9 am tomorrow here :-))
Apple CEO Steve Jobs will stand up to deliver his eagerly - anticipated keynote address to the MacExpo here at the Moscone convention center .
You 'll be able to watch a QuickTime video live : otherwise , watch out for a brief update here later tonight , and ( hopefully ) fuller details of any announcements in Online and on Guardian Unlimited .
But what is he going to announce ?
Consensus agrees that new flat - panel iMacs will be announced , although the exisiting cathode ray tube ( CRT ) models will probably be kept and upgraded for entry - level machines .
But , after the hype Apple has been giving this keynote , Apple - watchers agree he 'll have to pull a few other rabbits out of the hat to keep the hoards happy .
Expensive new iMacs , even if they look very cute indeed , wo n't make the grade after a week of building hype from Apple itself , in the midst of what is supposed to a computer industry slowdown ..."
2002-01-08,"Apple Computer 's chief executive , Steve Jobs , yesterday unveiled a radically redesigned version of the company 's iMac consumer computer , stating that he wanted the new machine to be a "" digital hub "" in millions of homes .
The new machine does away with the multicoloured styling of previous versions of the all - in - one computer , with a white dome shaped base unit and a flat panel liquid - crystal display connected by a flexible desk lamp - style arm .
"" There has been a three - year evolution for the iMac , "" Mr Jobs told the MacWorld show in San Francisco . ""
Now we have redesigned it from the ground up .
It 's the best thing we have ever done . ""
During his two - hour address , Mr Jobs berated the rest of the computer industry for focusing on cost - cutting over the last year , instead of designing new products .
"" This project has taken two years , "" Mr Jobs told the conference .
"" We have been busy innovating while our rivals have been restructuring and laying off thousands of people . ""
The LCD screens replace the previous model 's cathode - ray tube [ CRT ] displays - a move which Mr Jobs said would be "" the biggest change in desktop computers in the next ten years ...
this is the official death of the CRT today .
"" The new iMac , versions of which will be rolled out over the next three months - with the most basic model priced at $ 1,299 ( £ 897 ) in the US - and will be joined by a new larger - screen version of the iBook consumer laptop computer .
All the new machines sport easy connectivity with digital cameras , camcorders and music players - a key part of the company 's "" digital hub "" strategy which aims to make Apple computers a central part of gadget - filled homes .
The company announced new free software , called iPhoto , to make it easier to transfer photographs from digital cameras and then produce websites , photo albums and books using their photographs .
The software is integrated with Kodak 's digital photograph printing service , offering "" one click "" ordering of poster - size prints , and cloth - bound photograph albums .
It joins Apple 's iDVD and iMovie packages , which help consumers cut together films and produce DVDs , and the iTunes software which organises MP3 music files .
Unusually , all of Apple 's announcements yesterday were devoted to the consumer market , despite the company 's popularity in the graphic design and publishing fields .
The new consumer machines will be seen as an attempt to breath life into its non - professional lines during a difficult time for computer manufacturers .
Sales for the company overall were down 34 % last year to $ 5.4bn , and profits fell from $ 784 m in 2000 to a loss of $ 25 m last year .
Mr Jobs yesterday trumpeted over 6 m sales of the original iMac , which he said "" changed the way we look at technology , and had influence way beyond the technology industry "" because of its colourful , all - in - one design , and its then groundbreaking industrial design , which used translucent plastics in its case .
Recently sales of the machine , which was launched three years ago , had been flagging because of its age and a fierce price war among manufacturers of PC systems running Microsoft 's Windows operating system ."
2002-01-17,"CNet has started an interesting series of CEO profiles on the top chief execs in the computer industry .
The first two are Sun 's Mr Motormouth , Scott McNealy , and Microsoft 's "" Dancing Steve "" Ballmer .
No idea why Apple 's Steve Jobs is not on the list ."
2002-01-24,"Pixar Studios has been selected by the Producers ' Guild of America to receive its inaugural Vanguard Award , which honours achievements in new media and technology .
The award will be given to Pixar executives , possibly including Apple CEO Steve Jobs , at a ceremony in Los Angeles on March 3 .
The award will be given for Pixar 's excellence in computer graphics , on display in such animated greats as Toy Story , A Bug 's Life , Toy Story 2 and Pixar 's most recent hit Monsters , Inc. PGA Awards co - chairs Bruce Cohen and Debra Hill told Variety of their admiration for the computer wizards , "" Their Academy Award - winning RenderMan software propelled computer graphics into mainstream moviemaking by allowing computer - generated images to blend in seamlessly with live - action scenes .

2002-03-20,"Here 's one device Apple boss Steve Jobs certainly wo n't be unveiling at Tokyo MacWorld this week ...
the , er , iBong ."
2002-05-14,"Apple has announced its first rack - mounter server : all brushed metal on the outside , big hard drives , loadsa memory and dual G4 processors on the inside .
CNET News.com has the details , including the quotes from an unusually cautious , humble - sounding Steve Jobs . ""
For everything we know , there are 10 things we do n't know , "" he said , presumably only referring to Apple 's knowledge of the enterprise market ."
2002-05-15,"More from ZD Net on that new rack - mounted Apple server , which seems to be meeting with reasonable approval from those who know about such things .
Meanwhile CNET News.com has a remarkably stilted interview with Steve Jobs , Apple 's CEO ."
2002-05-19,"CNet has been talking to Apple boss Steve Jobs .
Apparently the number of OS X users "" is now in the range of 1.5 million to 2 million , although about 3 million Macs have been sold with the new OS on the hard drive "" ( not a direct quotation ) .
This seems to suggest that up to half the people who get Apple 's latest version of Unix change the default back to OS 9 .
The article also credits Apple with "" 25 million Mac owners "" , which is a pretty scary number unless someone looked up 1992 by mistake .
It means there are already twice as many people using Microsoft Windows XP as are using Macs ."
2002-07-16,"We 're expecting a few interesting announcements tomorrow at MacWorld in New York , but Steve Jobs ' keynote will be too late for Online 's print deadlines .
Have no fear : we 'll still be doing full coverage on the web .
I 'll be filing to Guardian Unlimited 's Netnews section tomorrow afternoon , after Apple CEO Steve Jobs has done his sales pitch .
Self - linking to the story will doubtless appear here , too ."
2002-07-17,"Just back from watching Apple chief executive Steve Jobs ' keynote , and very interesting it was too .
We always get excited about the new hardware most - and there was a new £ 1,649 iMac with a 17-inch display unveiled , as predicted by the "" rumour "" sites , and a new 20Gb iPod for £ 399 .
iPods for Windows users were also promised ; they will use the Musicmatch software to synch up in the same way the MP3 players do with iTunes on the Mac platform .
But the really big story this MacExpo lies in software : Apple is going at connectivity in a big way .
This runs from new ways to synch your GPRS mobile phone and Palm with your Mac , via Bluetooth , to the cheekily - titled .Mac web services , once called iTools but renamed after Microsoft 's .Net , which will provide email , online storage , backup , anti - virus software and online synching of diaries and contacts .
( Rather less cheekily , whereas iTools was free , Apple will charge new sign - ups $ 99 a year for .Mac .
Exisiting users will have to pay $ 49 to keep their Mac.com websites , storage and email alive , which is bound to upset quite a few people , new services or not ) .
Many of the coolest new functions will be built into the new release of Mac OSX , version 10.2 ( code - named Jaguar , or "" Jagwire "" as Jobs kept calling it today ) , which will be released for £ 99 on August 24 .
But , while there 's a new version of the MP3-playing iTunes software out now , we 'll have to wait a little longer - probably into next year - for rather cool new functions which will allow you to tap into someone else 's MP3 playlist on their computer , and stream it over an 802.11 network to your own machine and speakers .
More analysis of today 's announcements will be appearing tomorrow morning , when we 've had a chance to delve a little deeper into what all this means , on GU Netnews .
In the meantime , CNet News.com has a summary of the various announcements , although Wired news does it better ."
2002-07-18,"If yesterday 's keynote speech by Apple 's chief executive , Steve Jobs , could be summed up in one word , that word would be "" connectivity "" .
This is a departure .
Normally , the word would probably be "" hardware "" -
Mr Jobs knows a sexy new piece of computer kit , like another flash iMac or a cute laptop , is the sure - fire way to guarantee a happy MacWorld .
Certainly , in New York yesterday , Mr Jobs had some hardware to show off : he pulled the wraps off a new 17-inch iMac with his customary flourish .
The new model duly got a cheer , but the move was hardly unexpected : an iMac with a bigger screen was high on the wish list of many Mac users .
In two weeks , for £ 1,499 , they will be able to buy one .
But by far the most significant developments revolved around software , and particularly around the next revision of Apple 's OSX operating system .
This upgrade has been code - named "" Jaguar "" ( pronounced "" Jagwire "" by Mr Jobs ) , but is likely to be formally known as version 10.2 when it appears on sale on August 24 .
And connectivity - whether those connections are over the net , over wireless connections , with gadgets , other computers or web services - lies at the heart of much that is interesting in the new system .
First , Apple 's digital hub strategy has been extended .
Already , Mac users know it is very easy to attach digital cameras , camcorders and MP3 players to their machines , and use software built into the system to manage and edit images and music .
It is Apple 's frequent boast - made again yesterday - that nothing exists in the Windows world to match its capabilities in this area .
Yesterday , mobile phones and Palm personal digital assistants ( PDAs ) joined Apple 's hub .
Using Bluetooth , a communication standard designed to join up gadgets without the use of wires , your Mac will soon be able to manage your mobile phone and PDA .
You 'll be able to send text messages , via your mobile , from your desktop .
And instead of keying in 100 phone numbers into your new phone , you will be able to beam your Mac address book - or a portion of it - over at the touch of a key .
Ditto with your calendar to your Palm .
To help with this , in a move that is likely to have developers of Mac diary software groaning , Apple has dramatically enhanced the Mac 's built - in personal information management software .
A scheduling program called iCal , as well as a much - improved address book , will come free with Jaguar .
iCal , which can publish your diary to the web to let others know what you 're doing , will make use of .Mac , Apple 's cheekily titled foray into web services .
Mr Jobs acknowledged the services were named after .Net
- Microsoft 's much - hyped drive to provide services over the net - but claimed .Mac was already doing what .Net had yet to deliver .
"" We 're already doing stuff - we know what it means , "" he joked .
In reality , .Mac does not come close to the complexity of the .Net scheme .
What it is - at least for now - is an enhanced version of Apple 's free iTools service , which offers email , online storage and other services .
With .Mac , users will get 100Mb of storage , a variety of premium email services and new backup and anti - virus software services
But , whereas iTools is free , .Mac will cost $ 99.95 ( £ 64 ) a year for new users .
The existing 2.5 million iTools users will get in for half price for the first year .
Yesterday 's keynote was also unusual for the glimpse the normally secretive Mr Jobs gave into the future of Apple 's operating system development .
He was particularly keen on a new feature called Rendezvous , which will make it easier to control devices like printers from your Mac , and spot other people on networks , both wired and wireless .
One of the first applications to use Rendezvous will be iChat , a new AOL Instant Messaging - compatible chat program that will be built into Jaguar .
Future versions of iTunes , the free MP3 playing software , will also benefit : users will be able to dip into the music collections of computers nearby via wireless technology and play music from those machines .
And administrators of large computer networks may celebrate at the news Rendezvous will be able to spot network devices , like printers , without human intervention , and then set up the Mac automatically .
When the user hits print , the Mac should got on with it , without any configuration .
Mr Jobs said that the various functions of Rendezvous shown off yesterday were "" only the start "" of the company 's exploration of the system 's capabilities .
If all this goes a little over your head for now , Apple 's simplest gadget was also given an easy - to - understand boost yesterday .
iPod , Apple 's dinky MP3 player , was lowered in price ( it now starts at £ 259 in the UK ) , and a new higher capacity model ( £ 399 ) was added to the top of the range .
To cheers , Mr Jobs also announced that the little gadget will also be doing missionary work in the PC world - a Windows - compatible version is to be launched in the middle of August , to show off the Apple way of doing things to the PC - toting masses .
It will , promised Jobs , appear a couple of weeks after the new Mac - only models have gone on sale , of course .
"" We want to look after you guys first , "" he said , again playing to his audience perfectly ."
2002-08-31,"A belated plug for a good quick overview of Microsoft .
Net by Jeff Lewis in his MacOpinion column .
It 's painfully obvious that Apple ( and particularly Steve Jobs ) does n't have a clue about .Net , and my unverified hunch is that the same goes for most Mac users .
Since .Net is based on standards , there 's really no reason why Macs should n't be great .Net clients and servers , but who is going to pitch in and do the sort of work Mono is doing for Linux ?
As far as I can tell , Apple has already wasted two years and will probably waste a couple more before it wakes up .
And the result may well be that Mac users who are already second class citizens on today 's Web will become third class citizens on tomorrow 's ."
2002-09-10,"Two announcements emerge from MacWorld in Paris today , where Steve Jobs is giving the keynote .
First , iCal , Apple 's new calendar program for OS X 10.2 users , is now available for download .
The free program allows Mac users to create calendars , put them on a variety of handheld devices and share them over the internet ...
I 'll be playing with it this week for review purposes , so do let me know how you get on .
Meanwhile , Apple says that all new Macs will boot into Mac OS X by default from the start of next year , although they will retain the ability to run OS9 applications in the "" classic "" mode that comes bundled with OS X.
It 's a move that makes sense , both for Apple and the users : new developments on the Mac platform are only going to happen on OS X , and running Classic too often appears to cause headaches for all who try .
Those users who move wholesale to OSX report far fewer problems ."
2002-12-23,"Not tough enough to stop Apple spending $ 90 million on Steve Jobs 's jet , of course , but worrying enough for Mac fans .
Total Mac sales for this year have come in flat at 3.1 million units , which is much better than the 32 % decline Apple suffered in 2001 .
However , sales of the more powerful , more professional and much more profitable Power Mac desktops and servers fell by 18 % ( units ) to only 766,000 , following a 35 % decline the previous year .
Apple now needs to double its sales of Power Macs just to get back to where it was in 2000 .
Apple warns that "" Continued deterioration in Power Macintosh unit sales will adversely affect the Company 's future net sales and gross margin .
If future unit sales of Power Macintosh systems fail to partially or fully recover , it will be difficult for the Company to improve its overall profitability . ""
Still , sales of iBook portables grew by 14 % , albeit from a low base : in unit terms , from 596,000 to 677,000 .
Also on the good side , Apple sold $ 143 million worth of iPod portable music players and $ 248 million worth of software -- perhaps justifying the unpopular decision to sting OS X users for the Jagwire update .
( Portable sales are particularly good news for Taiwan because , as Apple says : "" Currently , manufacture of many of the components used in the Company 's products and final assembly of all of the Company 's portable products including PowerBooks , iBooks , and the iPod is performed by third - party vendors in Taiwan . "" )
As for the important US education market , Apple says : "" Total net sales in this channel fell 15 % in 2002 and 4 % in 2001 .
These declines are consistent with industry data that shows the Company losing market share in the US education market in each of the last two fiscal years .
The Company believes this weakness has been caused by multiple factors , including increased price competition in this price sensitive market from the Company 's competitors who sell Windows - based personal computers . ""
Fortunately , Apple was able to increase consumer sales of more expensive flat - screen iMacs by enough to compensate for the shortfall .
Overall , iMac sales grew by 8 % to 1.4 million units , though again , this is still far below the 2.4 million sold in 2000 .
All numbers and quotations are provided by Apple in its annual 10-K filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission , which is a good indication that they are as true and accurate as possible .
You can read it here .
In the Mac market , where impartial reporting is in short supply , Apple 's filings are an important source of information ."
2003-01-06,"The Merc 's Dan Gillmor , writing from Apple 's heartland in Silicon Valley , speculates about the old Mac - on - Intel issue in his pre - MacWorld column , while admitting that this is very unlikely to feature in Steve Jobs 's MacWorld keynote tomorrow .
In eWeek , Matthew Rothenberg gives some credence to the Mac Tablet idea .
The video iPod is being most widely tipped , but CNet has a good round - up of possibilities ."
2003-01-07,"This is what we know for sure : Apple computer chief executive Steve Jobs will walk onto the stage of the Moscone Centre , San Francisco , at 9 am ( 5 pm GMT ) today .
He is likely to be wearing blue jeans , a black polo - neck top with rolled - up sleeves , and spectacles .
He may have had a haircut especially for the occasion .
What happens beyond that is anyone 's guess - and almost everyone is having a guess .
The Macworld conference floor , rumour websites and - of course - the press room , are abuzz with speculation about the new Apple goodies that Mr Jobs may introduce in his keynote speech .
Speculation about the speech , to be delivered to an audience of thousands , is more intense than ever this year , because Apple 's next move is not that obvious .
In the background is the worst possibility of them all for the Mac gossip machine - a scenario in which Apple does not announce anything at all .
Whatever happens , Mac OS Rumors ( macosrumors.com ) is calling this "" one of the most mysterious Macworlds in recent memory "" .
Apple carefully cultivates that mystery by refusing to comment on possible developments - or lack of them .
But why should we care about what this niche player has to say ?
The fact is that Mr Jobs ' speech remains an important event in the computer industry , carrying a weight disproportionate to Apple 's modest 3 % share of the worldwide personal computer market .
Apple has a tendency to announce industry - leading innovations at these twice - annual shows , meaning that the PC world listens with almost as much interest as the Mac faithful .
Over the years there have been plenty of surprises for them all to enjoy , from the first iMac in 1998 to the introduction of WiFi equipped laptops years ahead of the rest of the industry .
So what will we see later today ?
Opinion is building that Apple has to announce at least one big product .
Otherwise , the headlines will be dominated by the charges that the organisation is expected to levy on new versions of its previously free digital media applications .
Pundits hold out most hope for a new "" digital lifestyle device "" - most likely a new iPod , an update to the MP3 player unveiled by Apple in late 2001 .
The new model , it is claimed , will have a larger colour screen and will also be able to play movies .
And with Apple having just announced a new version of its iCal calendaring software and version 1.0 of its iSync synchronisation software , it seems reasonable to expect that the new iPod will also feature improved personal digital assistant ( PDA ) functions .
Some observers - and this is where things take another step away from informed rumour and move towards wish - list fantasy - are also hoping for Bluetooth and WiFi capabilities in the new iPod , with a mobile phone built in .
Analysts , it is claimed , have already been briefed on an "" iPod 2 "" , and the larger form - factor of such a device could also explain persistent recent rumours of a Mac tablet computer .
We know for sure that Apple is keen on Bluetooth , the wireless way to connect devices together .
The Mac OSX operating system beat Windows for built - in Bluetooth capabilities last year , and it seems likely that new Apples will soon have Bluetooth available as a built - in option in the same way that WiFi is available today .
Staying on the wireless theme , Apple could also use the speech to announce an upgrade of its WiFi kit to the 802.11 g technology ( the current standard is 802.11b ) , which will lift data speeds to a whopping 54Mbps .
In addition , there are strong suggestions that Apple will reveal that it is moving to the fast Firewire 2 standard to physically connect devices to its machines .
But , and this is where things get contradictory , the rumour mill suggests that we should not expect new computers to be announced today .
Dealers say Apple must first clear an inventory backlog : expect new Mac models , with Bluetooth , Firewire 2 and modest upgrades to specifications , to be announced later this month instead .
A revamp of the company 's digital media applications seems likely .
Apple is set to offer enhanced versions of applications like iDVD and iMovie , but only in exchange for a fee of $ 50 - a move unlikely to be popular .
Whatever is eventually announced , the crowds flocking to the Moscone Centre ballroom will remember this Macworld for the keen sense of anticipation , and all the speculation , surrounding it .
Gossip is clearly now as much part of the Macworld experience as Mr Jobs ' polo - neck and faded jeans .
As one contributor to Mac OS Rumors ( macosrumors.com ) put it recently : "" We are all running around wandering about and looking for the thing from Apple that will make us happy - but the funny thing is that what makes us happy is the fond memories we are creating in the process . "" ·

2003-01-07,"... nobody really knows what Steve Jobs is going to say in today 's keynote , but the queues to get in - which started forming long before 7 am , when I arrived at the Moscone Center - are as long as they always are .
Some of them look a lot like they 've camped out here overnight .
Just before 9 am the doors will open and there will be a fantastic scrum to get the good seats , as everyone chases the VIP guests who get a head start - and breakfast beforehand .
The media stumbles along behind .
For those press men and women not quite at their optimum fighting weight , elbows and camera tripods help clear a path .
Sometime after 11 am ( 7 pm GMT ) we 'll all do the same thing , in reverse , to get a seat in the press room .
I 'll send an update here the moment I get a WiFi connection ..."
2003-01-08,"As the crowds filed out of the Moscone centre in San Francisco last night , the principal emotion was one of surprise .
Steve Jobs , in his keynote to the Mac community , had pulled rabbit after rabbit out of the hat in his two - hour address .
He had been widely expected to announce little to excite the crowds at the Macworld show .
The keynote had been preceded by gloomy predictions from industry observers and , on Monday , a "" sell "" recommendation from one US investment house which described Apple 's new product pipeline as "" skimpy "" .
But , having promised enough announcements "" for two Macworlds today "" , Mr Jobs went on to announce two new laptop computers and a substantial revision of the company 's software products , to whoops of delight from the crowd .
"" We want to drive this industry with innovation , "" Mr Jobs told his audience .
Hardware The PowerBook
G4 17 "" - a new top - end laptop £ 2599 , including VAT , ships February
The Powerbook G4 17 "" This new 6.8 lb addition to the very top of Apple 's notebook range sports an enormous 17 "" widescreen display , yet is also the company 's thinnest laptop at less than 1 "" thick .
It has Bluetooth built in , allowing it to communicate wire - free with other mobile devices , and also sports Apple 's new Airport Extreme - a faster version of the WiFi networking standard .
The Airport antenna is built into the lid of the device , to tackle complaints that previous PowerBooks had poor WiFi reception .
It has a 1GHz processor and a DVD burning SuperDrive as standard , and Apple claims four hours of battery life .
The PowerBook G4 12 "" - a new compact notebook From £ 1399 , including VAT , available late January
The PowerBook G4 12 ""
Apple says this is the world 's smallest "" full feature "" notebook .
It has a 12 "" display , and it is capable of burning DVDs with an optional SuperDrive .
It is only 1.2 inches thick , and weighs 4.6lbs .
Like its bigger sibling it comes equipped with Bluetooth , although Airport Extreme is available as an option rather than fitted as standard .
Battery life is claimed to stand at five hours .
Software iLife - Apple 's revamped digital media suite £ 39 , available
late January iLife Apple has revamped its digital media software , more closely integrating iTunes , iMovie , iDVD and iPhoto .
This makes it easier , for instance , to set your digital photograph slide show ( in iPhoto ) to music ( from iTunes ) .
Apple sees its iLife suite doing for digital media what Microsoft 's Office suite did for productivity software .
The iMovie , iDVD and iPhoto programs have all been given major upgrades .
Apple is charging for this software bundle for the first time , although all bar iDVD will still be available for free download .
New Macs will come with the software bundled in .
Safari - Apple 's new web browser Free to download , in beta ( test ) version now Safari A major surprise was the arrival of Apple 's new open source - based web browser .
The move is seen by some as an attempt by Apple to become less reliant on Microsoft for vital programs .
Safari is in a test version at the moment , but Apple claims it is already substantially faster than Internet Explorer - although they did not reveal how well it compares with the Mac browser from Norwegian software company Opera .
Other features include Google integration , a "" snap - back "" feature to make searches easier , easier organisation of bookmarks and pop - up ad prevention .
Keynote - Apple 's answer to PowerPoint £ 79 , available now
Keynote Another surprise , seen as a dig at Microsoft ,
whose PowerPoint software is the industry standard presentation creator on both Windows and Mac .
Mr Jobs claimed the package had been specially made for him and , indeed , his presentation featured a few new special effects between some of the 500 slides .
On first inspection Keynote seems a straightforward but powerful package .
A library of templates is intended to give the impression of a large graphics design studio working for you "" day and night "" , said Mr Jobs , although the TV - like special effects could wear thin in the hands of a David Brent .
Importantly , Keynote will be able to import and export PowerPoint files .
Could this be a subtle attempt to get Apple into PC - dominated businesses ?
Final Cut Express £ 248.99 , available now Final Cut Express
This cut down version of Apple 's award - winning video editing package , Final Cut Pro , shaves £ 580 off the price , without losing much of the functionality that makes its parent package popular .
The interface remains the same , there are plenty of special effects to give your video a professional look , and even sophisticated functions like colour correction remain .
It usefully bridges the gap for amateur film makers who have grown out of iMovie , but who can not afford - or face - the more complex Pro package ."
2003-01-08,"One of the few sure things about this Expo was that Apple was going to charge $ 49 for its iApps bundle - iTunes , iMovie , iPhoto and iDVD ( and possible iSync and iCal ) .
Both News.com and Thinksecret ran well - founded stories anticipating the change - and sparked a major backlash among Mac users .
Yet when Steve Jobs stood up yesterday , three of the Apps remained free , and only iDVD - the software for DVD burning , which is useful only to a small number of Mac users - was locked behind a $ 49 fee .
What happened ?
I have it on good authority that Apple briefed a few people about the iApps charge late last year .
It was their intention until only a few days ago to levy a $ 49 charge for the whole bundle of upgraded digital media software .
But , having witnessed online the unhappy reaction of Mac users to the charging plan ( the software was previously free )
Steve Jobs ordered that three of the four go free .
Only iDVD - never available as a download anyway - would remain fee - only .
Jobs , cursing the gossip sites , became concerned that the original plan might have drawn boos - and significant adverse publicity - had it gone ahead .
Looks like some online flames saved us all a few quid ..."
2003-01-17,""" Apple Computer has forced a developer to stop distributing a plug - in that turned Apple 's iTunes music player into a peer - to - peer music sharing client .
The plug - in , called iCommune , allowed iTunes users to browse the music libraries of other Macintosh PCs over a network and stream or download music from the remote libraries , "" reports ZDNet UK .
"" In a keynote speech last year , Apple chief executive Steve Jobs also demonstrated an iTunes feature strikingly similar to iCommune , "" says the report .
In a comment to this post , Ian Betteridge argues that "" The feature that Jobs demonstrated last year was auto - discovered streaming from iTunes ( via Rendezvous ) .
iCommune , on the other hand , allows music sharing .
The two things are not ' strikingly similar ' . ""
However , this does not affect the fundamental problem , which is Apple 's efforts to limit and control third - party developers ."
2003-01-27,"Wired News has a mostly tedious report on a campaign to get Apple CEO Steve Jobs to run for President .
It only gets interesting further down when we learn about his political activity , and the best bit is right at the end , where they report a wag on Slashdot suggesting Jobs invade Iraq and rename it iRaq .
Well , it made me laugh ..."
2003-02-13,"What computers do you use ?
In 1983 , I bought an Apple Lisa , Steve Jobs ' first effort at a computer with a user friendly front end .
It cost $ 10,000 and I 've stayed loyal .
I still own and publish MacUser , although it 's getting too technical for me .
I only buy a computer when it 's two years old , after the glitches have been worked out .
I 'm probably the last living user of MacWrite Pro .
How has the growth of computers affected magazine publishing ?
When we started Oz , we used typewriters , but it was impossible to get typesetters to work for the underground press .
Then IBM brought out the Selectric , a primitive computer that justified copy and printed it so we could paste the pages .
The Selectric made alternative magazines and newspapers possible !
When we computerised Personal Computer World in 1985/6 , it changed magazine publishing forever .
The art room - the heart of a publishing company , where designers and editors worked together in a creative , happy go lucky process - was fragmented into separate units , each working alone .
Is that when you started to lose enthusiasm for computers ?
Yes , I saw how destructive they could be .
There are jobs , particularly database - oriented ones , for which computers are necessary , but for everyday office life , I question whether they have brought the productivity that their enormous cost , up to £ 10,000 per person , demands .
Nor do I believe they will .
Computers are wasteful of paper and time .
Once , we 'd get documents with a few errors .
Now , people make hundreds of copies until each sheet is flawless and memos are duplicated endlessly .
Managers get swamped with emails .
Are you a fan of the internet ?
Although we have many successful websites , I value the net primarily as a business tool .
Maxim became a huge success in the US because we sold 600,000 subscriptions online , which cost us $ 2 m instead of the $ 24 m a junk mail campaign would have cost .
We were the first company to insist that visitors to our website filled out a questionaire and the information we gathered was invaluable for us and advertisers .
Does IT affect your daily life ?
I detest gadgets , especially mobile phones , and prefer face - to - face meetings , faxes or talking on the phone .
Do you use IT for writing or performing your poetry ?
I use Google for research and a brilliant actor - Patrick Sont - devised an adaptation of PowerPoint that projects , with perfect timing , the words of my poems on to a screen for the audience to read as they are spoken .
I also wrote a prayer for my MacIntosh that begins :
Alert 01 - 01 - 01/

2003-04-12,"Apple Computer is in talks to purchase Universal Music in a deal said to be worth $ 6bn ( £ 3.8bn ) , according to reports neither party would confirm or deny last night .
According to a report in the Los Angeles Times yesterday , the co - founder and chief executive of Apple , Steve Jobs , could become the most powerful player in the music business if the deal goes ahead .
No formal bid has yet been made , according to reports throughout the day , but one is planned before the Vivendi board meeting on April 29 .
A spokeswoman for Vivendi declined to comment from New York but it is known that the company has been listening to "" expressions of interest "" in its entertainment division .
A spokesman for Apple also declined to comment .
Universal , the world 's largest record company , has sales of around $ 6bn annually .
But profits for the company dropped by 23 % last year to $ 510 m .
Universal Music artists include Luciano Pavarotti , U2 , Shania Twain and 50 Cent .
The talks come at a time of a slump in the music business and Vivendi is seeking to sell assets to reduce debts .
Apple 's Steve Jobs has often expressed an interest in expanding into the entertainment business .
He is also chairman of Pixar Animation Studios , which produced Monsters Inc and Toy Story .
Apple now has less than 3 % of the desktop computer market and has been damaged by online piracy .
Mr Jobs is said to think music on the internet is about to become profitable - which would make the marriage between Apple and Universal viable .
The US government has been active in closing down internet piracy sites which Mr Jobs believes makes the climate healthier for his plans .
Vivendi was reported to have approached Mr Jobs last December after a visit by executives to Apple 's headquarters in California and a viewing of his new digital service ."
2003-04-17,"Apple CEO Steve Jobs , in a statement , said , "" Apple has never made any offer to invest in or acquire a major music company , "" reports USA Today .
However as someone on MacSlash has pointed out , Apple apparently registered the AppleUniversal.com domain name , as you can see here , but as Onlineblog reader Nick Miners points out , this looks more like a late April Fool joke ."
2003-05-03,"Apple 's entry into the music business looked slick enough when Steve Jobs unveiled the long - awaited iTunes internet music store and an ultra thin version of its iPod portable MP3 player last week .
But the questions of whether Apple can restore its sagging fortunes and help point the way to rescuing the music business from itself , were not answered .
Still , as an innovator and salesman Jobs ' gambit goes a little further in trying to address them .
Apple , with just 3 per cent of the PC market , desperately needs a new source of revenue ; the music business needs revenue , too , after seeing CD sales slump by nearly 20 per cent over the past two years .
It has found no solution to the chaos caused when illegal downloading and CD - burning meant it lost control of distribution .
Efforts to close down file - sharing services such as Napster and to sue its best customers - computer - savvy students - have simply created a consumer antipathy no business can afford .
The root of the problem is the fact that the industry has ignored its best customers - two generations that grew up with music and do not know how to download - in favour of concentrating on adolescents who understand that it 's far easier to pinch a song off the internet than to pay $ 18 for a CD that contains one good song .
So with the industry in an almost perfect storm of corpulent vested interests , poor product and consumer rebellion , it has long been suggested that only a software company with hardware credentials can make sense of it .
Jobs , the pop star of the tech world , has now made it his business to turn the music industry into what it had become - software .
Industry efforts to do that , through ventures such as Rhapsody and Pressplay , have failed , largely because they rely on a subscription model , with strict limitations on how and where music can be played .
iTunes , by contrast , acknowledges that for digitally distributed music to be successful , it must be offered to the consumer to use in any fashion they please - not just sitting in front of a computer .
Apple 's system will essentially wholesale music at 99 cents a song for buyers to do what they choose with - burn it on to CDs or put it on their iPods .
Encryption software will still limit the number of computers or iPods the music can be transferred to .
The iTunes Music Store is launching with a library of 200,000 tracks , with participation from all five major record labels .
In addition , it will list exclusive tracks from 20 artists , including Bob Dylan and U2 .
Initially , the service is available only to owners of Macs running recent versions of the company 's operating system , a tiny fraction of the personal computer market .
But by the end of the year , Jobs said , the service will be available to the far wider consumer market of Windows users .
But will consumers go for it ?
At $ 1 a song , the price amounts to about the same as music on a CD , so the only advantage is being able to buy single songs instead of complete albums .
But Jobs believes consumers will adopt the service because they do not inherently want to see themselves as criminals .
However , the industry is having mixed results in trying to stop consumers stealing .
Last week , a court in New York ruled that internet services providers are obliged to reveal the names of people pirating music .
At the same time , a court in California ruled that two of the largest free song - sharing services , Grokster and Morpheus , can not be held liable for copy right infringements committed by its users .
The first ruling may be the more important .
After all , file - sharing services depend on people with files to share ; the services are merely conduits .
Industry executives say iTunes should be seen as an experiment , not a panacea .
Many of the biggest names , from the Rolling Stones to Madonna and the Beatles , are absent and much of the music is from older artists offering only selected tracks .
But it does put Apple ahead of arch rival , Microsoft , which is expected to launch its own service this year .
Not surprisingly , Jobs dismissed the Microsoft - based efforts , saying Apple 's ' lets users explore music in an entirely new way ' .
Last week , the industry stepped up efforts to dissuade pirates by launching a public awareness campaign that paints file - sharing services as seedy realms where viruses , porn and the law lurk .
But suing illegal down - loaders is not in itself a cure , concedes Cary Sherman of the Recording Industry Association of America . '
Everyone knew this was a long - term problem - that we never intended to rely on litigation as a substitute for a business strategy , ' she says .
Executives for Kazaa and Grokster said they doubted the industry 's efforts would amount to much . '
Will it scare our users ?
' asked Wayne Rosso , Grokster 's president . '
I do n't know .
But I can tell you one thing .
Our users are a lot smarter than the RIAA .
They declared war on their own customers .
All we have to do is stand back and the customers will be heard . '
Apple 's efforts may not be a revolution but they are at least an evolution .
Record companies and bands get money and protection , and consumers get a relatively easy - to - use way of buying high - quality recordings .
For Jobs , iTunes offers one thing , says technology writer Michael S. Malone - the chance to become what he was always suited to be , ' a classic megalomaniacal music mogul ' .
He already sounds like one . '
This will go down in history as a turning point for the music industry , this is landmark stuff . '
Only time will tell if he has a hit on his hands ."
2003-05-13,"After years enjoying the pleasures of illegally downloaded songs , music fans are starting to enjoy an unexpected pleasure of going legal - and all because of their warm feelings towards the Apple computer brand .
Apple is negotiating with major European record labels to launch a version of its hugely successful iTunes online music download store before the end of the year .
The legal download service , launched in the US two weeks ago by Apple 's chief executive , Steve Jobs , has got off to a hugely successful start with over 1 m songs downloaded in its first week of operation .
And now Apple is hoping to prove it can solve the problems facing record companies in Europe too .
The secret of Mr Jobs ' success is partly to do with Apple 's cachet , its reputation for good design and for championing consumers rather than corporations .
But it is also to do with the simplicity of the transaction .
Songs cost a flat fee of 99 cents to download , and the company has developed software that allowed users to "" burn "" an unlimited number of tracks to CD or transfer them to the Apple iPod portable music player .
At present the service is available only to owners of Apple computers , representing around 3 % of the world 's total , but the company is also planning a Windows version for PCs before the end of the year .
Apple , which pioneered the personal computer in the 1970s before Microsoft and IBM took over as the dominant force , has retained a certain prestige among its consumers , who tend to be loyal advocates of the brand .
Analysts have suggested this also has much to do with the success of the Apple service because the company is perceived as being on the side of the consumer , rather than trying to rip them off .
The success of the iTunes store is also expected to convince those major artists who have yet to licence their music for use on the web , including the Beatles and the Rolling Stones , to look again at the idea .
Mr Jobs , a big fan of the Eagles , intervened personally in order to get the veteran Hotel California rockers to change their minds about the web .
Music industry insiders say Apple , buoyed by the overnight success of the US version , plans to launch a European service before the end of the year - as soon as it can agree rights deals with the record labels and artists involved .
Given record labels ' growing enthusiasm for the concept of paid - for downloads , as evidenced by EMI 's recent decision to make over 90 % of its catalogue available on the web , the service could launch by the autumn . ""
Hitting 1 m songs in less than a week was totally unexpected , "" said the Warner Music chairman , Roger Ames .
"" Apple has shown music fans , artists and the music industry as a whole that there really is a successful and easy way of legally distributing music over the internet . ""
Doug Morris , the chief of Universal Music , which is home to Mariah Carey and Eminem , added : "" Apple definitely got it right with the iTunes music store "" .
Mr Jobs is keen to push the idea of legal music downloads as an alternative to the peer - to - peer file sharing sites such as Kazaa and Soulseek , over which millions of illegally pirated tracks are swapped every day .
The music industry is blaming the rise of peer to peer sites for a global slump in music sales , which last year declined by a further 7.2 % to £ 20bn according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry , the trade body .
The record labels have had little success with their own legal download services , MusicNet and PressPlay , with consumers complaining that they do not offer enough choice , are too restrictive in allowing them to transfer tracks to CD or portable Walkman - type devices and require a monthly subscription .
Apple has sought to address these criticisms by signing deals with all five major labels to make sure the vast majority of artists are represented .
The US service currently features over 200,000 songs , and Apple is lobbying record companies to further increase the choice on offer ."

Well , quite an evening here .
Big strategic announcements from Apple on the software and the hardware front - including the new G5 Mac - and the storm to end all thunderstorms , which caused quite a bit of damage in Berlin and blacked out Steve Jobs live satellite broadcast from San Francisco .
At least it did n't defeat the QuickTime feed ...

And for those of you wondering : we 'll wrap up all today 's announcements , along with details of UK pricing and some pix of the San Francisco event , in Thursday 's Online section ."
2003-06-26,"Apple chief executive Steve Jobs pulled the wraps off what he called "" the world 's fastest personal computer "" this week and promised that a new generation of faster Macintosh machines was now on the way .
The new computer - called the Power Mac G5 - was unveiled at a developers ' conference in San Francisco on Monday night by Jobs , who trumpeted it as having "" the world 's first 64-bit desktop processor "" .
The new chip at the heart of the machine , made by IBM , processes data in bigger chunks , meaning the machine can make use of more memory than its predecessors .
Apple 's claim to a 64-bit first was immediately disputed by some , who pointed to earlier 64-bit desktops from DEC , built in the 1990s .
But it is certain that the new chips represent a huge boost for Apple .
For , just as importantly as the 64-bit architecture , the new chip has a much faster headline speed .
In recent years , the company has seen its computers become noticeably slower than ones using Intel and Athalon chips , and the headline megahertz speed , used in most PC advertising , has fallen even further behind .
The new Power Mac G5 runs at up to 2GHz , almost double the speed of its G4 predecessor .
The machines also include such features as very fast internal "" bus "" connections and Apple 's Velocity engine to speed up graphics performance , which is designed to appeal to professional users .
In a series of "" bake - off "" tests between Apple and Intel systems , Jobs showed the G5 system completing a variety of graphical tasks well ahead of its Intel - powered rival .
The tests , revived after a long absence from Apple 's regular , evangelistic gatherings , were greeted with applause at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference .
During his two - hour keynote , Jobs said the new processors were "" a whole new generation of architecture for Apple "" , and added : "" You can basically say we 've caught up . ""
Some Apple staffers were suggesting this week 's announcements were as significant as Apple 's original move to PowerPC chips in the early 1990s , which dramatically increased the speed and functionality of the company 's computers .
But some analysts were less impressed in the wake of the announcements .
Martin Reynolds , a Gartner Group analyst , told Associated Press that the tests "" do n't always translate to real - world performance "" .
He said : "" The real value in the Mac is n't in the processors , it 's in how the system and the user interface works . ""
But Pascal Cagni , Apple 's vice - president for Europe , said the new hardware presented a strong argument for professional users to upgrade their machines , after a period that has seen the replacement age of computers increase by 33 % to 40 % .
And he said there was major significance in IBM 's heavy investment in research and infrastructure needed to produce the new chips for Apple . ""
The important thing to notice is that you 've got John Kelly on stage , a senior vice - president [ at IBM ] , the head of a $ 5bn a year R&amp;D department , the decision maker on their $ 3bn processor plant , "" said Cagni . ""
[ He ] is stating that after a decade of partnership with Apple , they are looking for a different kind of partnership going forward , and committing to a long road map .
I think that 's immense .
This renewed IBM partnership , the investment that IBM is making in it , that is critical . ""
The new Power Macs towers start at £ 1,318.30 , rising to £ 1,956.60 for a dual 2GHz version ( ex VAT ) .
One other piece of hardware was also launched - a £ 119 digital camera designed to sit on top of screens , to make video conferencing easier .
The company also used the event to promote a major revision of its Unix - based OS X operating system .
The new version , called Panther , sports a number of new features : Finder A new version of Apple 's file management program , designed to make it easier to search out files on hard drives , networks and online .
iChat AV
A new version of the instant message client that sports video and audio messaging between iChat users .
Exposé An effort to make it easier to cope with multiple open windows and applications .
Exposé can shuffle and reduce open windows to thumbnails , allowing the user to pick the window to work in next .
FileVault
A new option to have your personal files encrypted and decrypted "" on the fly "" as you use them , to improve data security -especially for mobile users concerned their laptops might get stolen .
Fast user switching
In what is likely to be a boon for users of shared machines at work or home , a new pull - down menu allows a change of users with a couple of clicks , rather than having to log out .
Apple says Panther will be released "" sometime before the end of the year "" , although no firm date has been set .
It will cost $ 129 .
During the keynote , Jobs also delivered an upbeat assessment of Apple 's performance in the first six months of the year .
He said the millionth iPod was shipped this week , while the iTunes music store , which offers legal music downloads to US Apple users from major record labels , had sold more than 5 m songs in its first eight weeks .
A recent $ 2bn surge in Apple 's stock market value has been attributed to the success of the store .

£ 3.45bn Staff : 10,194 Salary : £ 6.7 m 2002 ranking : new entry As much as anyone ,
Steve Jobs ignited the personal computer revolution when he co - founded Apple in 1976 and he has spent much of his time since returning to the company in 1996 attempting to place it at the forefront of the internet age .
While it continues to underperform financially , Apple 's attempts to move the computer from the study to the lounge are beginning to take effect .
The design revolution that began with the iMac has evolved to take in a whole family of products and software .
In the past year , the most dramatic development has been the development of the iPod personal music player - an MP3 player that weighs less than two CDs but can store up to 7,500 songs - which promises to have much the same effect on internet music sales this decade as Sony 's Walkman did on cassette sales in the 70s .
And his British designer Jonathan
I ve won the Design Museum 's first designer of the year award for a range of products from the iMac to the iPod .
Mr Jobs showed he could retain the cutting edge when he launched his other pet project this year - the iTunes music download service in the US , which clocked up one million sales in its first week and for the first time made a vast catalogue of legal music available to the masses at a reasonable cost .
He still faces a huge challenge in growing Apple 's market beyond the hardcore of enthusiasts to which it has always appealed and diversifying further into digital media might be its best shot .
And , say his enthusiastic supporters , if anyone can do it then it is the mercurial , driven , strictly vegan entrepreneur who inspires an religious devotion in his employees and his customers ."
2003-08-08,"Disney is facing a potentially disastrous split with Pixar Animation Studios , whose underwater adventure Finding Nemo is poised to become the biggest animated film ever to be released Stateside .
As Nemo closes in on The Lion King 's record mark of $ 328 m this weekend , Pixar chief Steve Jobs has threatened to take future films from Disney to another distributor unless new contracts are drawn up .
Since 1996 the House of Mouse has distributed all Pixar films , a mighty roster of table - topping , multi - million - grossing titles including worldwide hits Monsters , Inc and Toy Story .
Jobs wants to change current arrangements so the companies no longer share cost and profit with a distributor 's fee going to Disney .
Under his proposals the fee will remain but Pixar will pay for the entire film and receive all ticket receipts .

2003-09-11,""" The inevitable has happened : The Beatles have sued Steve Jobs over Apple iTunes and the Apple iPod -- at least the band 's company , Apple Corps , has sued Apple Computers , "" reports Fox News .
"" When Apple Computers first came into existence , the Beatles ' lawyers sued -- and won -- over the use of the corporate name .
The Fab Four , it was widely known , already had their own company called Apple Corps .
( Ironically , Jobs admitted to naming his company as a tribute to the Beatles . )
The result of the suit was a huge cash settlement and a promise that the Apple logo and name would only be used for computers -- and never for a music company . ""
Update :
Now The Mercury News has a piece , too .
Comment :
It 's hard to imagine that Apple launched its music services without due consideration of the terms of its promise to Apple Corps .
Perhaps having $ 4bn in the bank means it does n't have to care , but some of us assumed Apple might well have done the obvious thing and quietly negotiated a settlement first ...."
2003-09-15,"We are currently in the middle of a fairly Apple - intensive fortnight .
At one time , the company 's chief executive , Steve Jobs , used to make a speech to showcase new products two or three times a year .
Not much happened between those speeches , apart from rumours created by Apple 's obsessive secrecy .
These days , the secrecy remains , but the party begins a week before the speech .
Last week , we had new iMacs and iPods and , in Paris tomorrow , Mr Jobs is expected to unveil yet more gadgets that will keep the company in the news for a few more weeks .
Why this constant attention ?
Partly , it happens because Apple is very good at attracting it by keeping everything secret until the last minute .
But it is also because the company has more products - and product lines - to furnish with new models than it used to .
They range from dinky iPods to powerful G5 towers , via iMacs , laptops and even a rack - mounted server .
Then there is a burgeoning software line - up which goes from email clients through presentation software and digital media to pro - quality video editing and - the jewel in the software crown - Mac OSX , on and through which all this works .
On the software side , Apple is both taking on development of its most important applications - a good web browser , top - notch digital media apps and a presentation package - and defining where the company 's main appeal should lie .
What is that appeal ?
As a straight replacement for a Windows PC ?
For a long time , Apple used to attempt to compete with the Windows world in a fairly direct way , proclaiming early on , for instance , that its easy to use PCs were "" computers for the rest of us "" .
That is why it was important to have Microsoft Office for Mac .
It was a way of saying : "" We can do that stuff too - and we 've got a cuter interface . ""
However , in the dark days of the early to mid-90s , those looks faded fast .
With the birth of the new OSX operating system , Apple has had a wonderful facelift , but the company is a little older and wiser now .
It knows that beauty by itself will not do .
For all that Windows XP might still feel clunky and rough at the edges to those of us more used to Mac OSX , it is good enough for most .
Similarly , some Mac fans , and more than a few PC diehards , moan about the expense of owning a Mac .
This weekend , I went shopping for a PC system of similar capabilities to the newly revised top - end 17-inch iMac , which sells for £ 1,712.99 including VAT and delivery .
At Dell , I could have assembled a similar system for £ 212 less .
The fact is that , for Apple , price is not really the point .
For a start , Dell leads most of the PC world on price : Apple is not the only computer manufacturer left standing by the the PC giant .
Instead , Apple has bet the ranch that Mac customers are not being led by price , performance , or even compatibility with the PC world when they buy a Mac .
Apple wants to flog much more than just a PC .
There 's that aura of cool - nice - looking machines that you would have in your living room or a smart office space .
More practically , there are creative applications to make the most of digital photographs and movies , superior digital music capabilities when a Mac 's iTunes software is twinned with an iPod music player , and a robust and secure operating system .
In short , the company is selling lifestyles and ( in the pro line - up ) workstyles , a computing platform that makes a statement when you buy .
And these are all niches .
You could argue that , from the moment Mr Jobs returned to the company and launched the strategy being pursued by Apple today , it has been about pursuing small parts of the market left unsatisfied by the beige boxes and cheap clunkiness of the PC market .
In any other business , chasing niches is a perfectly acceptable plan .
Look at the car industry , retail , or the rest of the consumer electronics industry and , around the mass - market players , there are successful , profitable companies serving specialist needs or high - end , high - margin markets .
It is a strategy that could easily work quite nicely for Apple .
However , the problem , for some , is Apple 's early promise to make a "" computer for the rest of us "" - a vow which still defines the Mac experience for many of its users .
The company 's new strategy is clearly not that , and some would argue that Apple has never really followed its own mantra , producing machines that have consistently cost more than their PC counterparts .
Apple serves its niches well these days : a renewed focus on digital media and music creation in OSX has brought huge benefits for people working in those fields .
The new , much more powerful G5 chips from IBM will help both there and in publishing .
But the result of all this effort may be hard for some Mac diehards to accept .
Yes , the new - look Apple might be beautiful , and the functionality may be wonderful in some , mostly creative , fields , but all pretence at going for the real mass market has long since been dropped .
Today , the "" rest of us "" are mostly using Windows , and Apple is no longer concerned with changing that ."
2003-09-16,""" Apple on Tuesday announced a new wireless keyboard and mouse , which the company expects to be available in two weeks .
Apple CEO Steve Jobs debuted the products during his Apple Expo keynote in Paris France , "" says MacCentral .
"" Apple was the first to fully integrate Bluetooth support in its operating system with Mac OS X and the first to make Bluetooth standard across our entire line of professional notebooks , "" said Philip Schiller , Apple 's senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing .
Comment : along with all those important firsts , it is nice to see Apple catching up with what Microsoft announced about a year ago .
Microsoft Readies Bluetooth Keyboard , Mouse"
2003-09-16,""" Chief Executive Steve Jobs ( news - web sites ) said on Tuesday the company had launched three new laptop computers before the key holiday selling season , "" reports Reuters .
"" The new machines will be faster and better - equipped versions of existing laptops with 12-inch , 15-inch and 17-inch screens , Jobs said during a keynote speech at the Apple Expo . """
2003-09-18,"Apple chief executive Steve Jobs unveiled a new range of faster , cheaper professional notebook computers this week , as well as a wireless keyboard and mouse , but flew away from the Apple Expo in Paris without answering the one question on the lips of most attendees .
Amid the fuss surrounding the expected updates to the PowerBook range , the issue of when Apple 's pioneering iTunes music store would arrive in Europe hung over the show - and continues to be unresolved .
The store , which lets users download tracks by leading pop and classical acts for 99 cents a time , has been a huge hit in the US since its launch on April 28 .
Apple announced its 10 millionth download last week .
Some in the music industry have gone so far as to hail the service - with its liberal copyright protection and a la carte approach to music - as being the future of the music business .
But Jobs made no mention of the music store in his keynote speech to 3,500 Mac fans at the Palais des Congrés on Tuesday morning .
Only later did he acknowledge there would be delays to the store opening , as first reported in Online last month , admitting that negotiations with record labels are continuing . ""
Obviously , we 're hard at work on it , "" he said .
"" I think we 'll do it next year . ""
Record industry sources insist the store is unlikely to appear before next spring .
Jobs said a version of iTunes for Windows users , which is expected to lead to a huge increase in revenues for Apple , will arrive - only in the US - before the end of the year .
The company 's music business , which revolves around the iTunes store and the iPod music player , is becoming increasingly important for Apple , which has aggressively targeted niche markets as its share of the overall desktop computer market has fallen below 4 % worldwide .
Jobs announced the company had sold 1 m iPods in the past 20 months , with 304,000 sold since the music store opened in late April .
Jobs , dressed - as ever - in his trademark black turtleneck , blue jeans and greying sneakers , was more keen to talk about Apple 's long - standing strength in laptop computers .
He said the "" year of the notebook "" he had announced in January was being reinforced by the new PowerBook lineup .
The new machines sport faster processors and speedier peripheral support , and Jobs said he hoped they would help push Apple towards a goal of selling as many laptops as desktop systems .
Currently , laptops make up around 43 % of Apple 's sales .
Phil Schiller , Apple 's senior vice president of product marketing , said the growth of the laptop market was sparked by new wireless technologies , broadband and the increasing power of notebook computers .
Customers who did not want the clutter of a second desktop computer were looking to notebooks as a compact alternative , he said .
"" The capabilities of portables have really broken through , "" said Schiller .
"" Things like the size of the hard drive and burning optical drives means there are real benefits .
Notebooks have become much more personal to us .
"" I can check my email on the couch and , because of the wireless connection , even in a multi - computer family , we 're not competing for internet use . ""
The likely top - seller of the new range is a new - look 15 in PowerBook , which replaces the popular Titanium PowerBook first launched in January 2001 .
The aluminium - clad laptop has a bright 15.2 in widescreen display and souped - up connectivity , including Airport Extreme ( Apple 's name for 802.11 g wireless networking ) , Bluetooth , USB 2.0 , FireWire and Gigabit Ethernet .
A backlit keyboard that reacts automatically to light conditions is also fitted - a feature that had PowerBooks being shrouded from the Paris show 's bright lighting .
The recently introduced 12 in and 17 in PowerBooks are upgraded , with the 12 in getting a faster 1GHz G4 processor and speedier internal components , and the 17 in being fitted out with a 1.33GHz G4 processor and double - speed , CD and DVD - burning SuperDrive .
Both are fitted with the USB 2.0 port that is quickly becoming a standard for connecting high - speed peripherals to PCs .
Jobs also showed off the next version of Apple 's operating system , Mac OS X. First launched in 2000 , the company has produced a major revision of the system every year since .
The latest , code - named Panther , is due to arrive before the New Year .
Features include improved user switching , making it easier for multiple users of shared Macs to leave their applications , files and preferences secure and untouched while away from the machine , and switch back with a few clicks and a password .
Jobs also demonstrated a video and audio chat system , built on top of its existing iChat instant message application , which allows Mac users with FireWire video cameras to hold video conferences over broadband , or users with microphones to hold audio chats over a 56k modem .
Panther will also boast a new graphics system called Pixlet which , claimed Jobs , will produce "" the highest [ graphics ] resolution on a PC "" , and rapid processing of PDF files at several times the speeds of rival Windows systems .
The new system also adopts a more Windows Explorer - like method for browsing files , drives and remote servers .

2003-10-03,"Silicon.com has released its top 50 Agenda Setters list .
Top of the list is Steve Jobs , with Bill Gates in second place , although the most interesting debating points come further down the list .
There 's Greg Dyke at number three , for instance .
Or the major of Munich at number 20 and , one place ahead of him , spam - fighter Steve Linford .
Strangest placing , to me , seems to be Linus Torvalds at number five , when they acknowledge "" Torvalds best work is in the past "" ."
2003-10-23,"The release tomorrow of Panther - the new version of Apple 's OS X operating system - is far more significant an upgrade than the change in version number from 10.2 to 10.3 would suggest .
The new system , which Online has been able to put through its paces , is the most mature version of OS X so far , and lies at the centre of efforts by the company 's chief executive , Steve Jobs , to revitalise the company .
First launched in March 2001 , Mac OS X v10.0 promised much .
It proved stable , but was found to be extremely slow and unpolished .
In the three years since , Apple has released three major revisions to Mac OS X. Version 10.3 finally delivers the operating system that Mac users have been waiting for .
The first major difference is that the Finder has been re - written and is now "" user - centric "" , making the filing and retrieval of files much easier .
Adopting the brushed metal look of iTunes and iPhoto , the new Finder has a sidebar on the left - hand side of its window .
This allows faster access to disks and customisable locations such as the user 's home , documents and pictures folders .
These sidebars also appear in the redesigned open and save dialogs , which were , in earlier versions , unwieldy and unintuitive .
Panther also supports encryption of the user 's home folder , with a near - transparent process that adds a new layer of security for users .
Overall performance is also much improved .
Applications now launch considerably faster than under previous releases of OS X. Startup and shutdown times have been reduced , too , with these improvements most apparent in dual processor systems .
Panther also tackles the bane of many a computer user today : multiple open windows .
Running with lots of documents , in several applications , it can be difficult for users to find the window they are looking for .
Apple 's answer to this is Exposé .
By pressing a user - definable hot key or moving the mouse to a specified corner of the screen , all the open windows are reduced to miniature versions , allowing the user to pick the one they want .
They can also be quickly slid off to reveal the desktop .
Fast - user switching is a feature Apple will happily admit it has copied from Windows .
This allows multiple users to be logged in to the same Mac at once , while preserving a setup unique to each user .
Typically , Apple has implemented the functionality with rather more style than Microsoft ; given a suitable graphics card , the switching effect has the appearance of a giant cube rotating to reveal each user 's desktop .
Other features include iChatAV , first released as a public beta in June , which allows video chat via a Firewire web cam or DV camcorder and a broadband internet connection , and audio chat via a microphone and dial - up connection .
Meanwhile , Safari , Apple 's web browser , has become more closely integrated into the operating system in a similar way to Windows ' integration of Internet Explorer .
The new mail client , for example , uses the Safari rendering engine to display HTML formatted emails more accurately , and the engine is accessible to developers writing their own applications .
The bundled Apple mail client now includes support for accessing Microsoft Exchange mail servers and address books .
Finally , recognising that most Mac users work in a heterogeneous computing environment , Panther considerably improves support for integration with Windows PCs .
Included is improved ability to access Windows file servers , print to Windows printers and to share the resources of the Mac ( file sharing and printers ) with Windows PCs .
For the corporate user there is enhanced support for Microsoft 's Active Directory .
In summary , this is a far - reaching and impressive upgrade to the Mac experience .
It justifies its £ 99 cost far more than the 0.1 version change would suggest . ·

2003-11-28,"Robert Cringely is writing about the Tablet PC , and thinks Apple may be ready to enter , as soon as January , a market that Steve Jobs has scoffed at for some time . "" '
Real computers have keyboards , ' Steve has said a zillion times , "" writes Cringely . ""
He 'll mean it right up to the moment he changes his mind ...
That moment appears to be coming soon . ""
Cringely 's vision is an entertaining one .
But we can certainly expect speculation about this January 's announcements to be even worse than normal .
Apple always launches something in January - Jobs has to have something to uncover at the MacExpo in the second week of the month - and this time around , it 's hard to see what he could be about to do .
All of Apple 's existing lines have been refreshed recently - speed bumps for the G5 , PowerBooks and iBooks , and a new 20-inch iMac .
Cringely 's getting his speculation in early .
A tablet makes sense , for the reasons he outlines , although it 's another product line for Apple at a time when it 's pushing hard with music .
My money is on something a little more modest - the video iPod we were all speculating about last December .
But - like all speculation -
this is based on nothing more than shrapnel - sized bits of information , many big assumptions , and my own gadget wishlist ."
2003-11-30,"Good , intelligent stuff today on why Apple 's iPod has done so well , from the New York Times Magazine .

No , really ..."
2004-01-05,"Good morning , btw , from San Francisco , where I arrived yesterday for the start of a week - long tech - show frenzy .
Tomorrow I 'm at MacExpo for Steve Jobs ' keynote , always full of surprises , and then it 's off to Las Vegas on Wednesday for Bill Gates ' keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show .
I 'll be blogging as I go - you 'll get first news of both keynotes here - and also doing plenty for the newspaper , Online and Guardian Unlimited on the latest stuff at both shows ."
2004-01-06,"Well , that was fun .
Steve Jobs ' keynote , as expected , was very music centric , although he opened with a nod to the Mac 's 20th birthday this year .
He harked back to that ad , run during the 1984 SuperBowl , which announced the arrival of the first Mac , and screened a subtly remade version to wild acclaim in the hall .
But grabbing the headlines will be the new iPod minis , which are tiny wee things : half an inch thick , and around the same size as a business card .
We were bathing in the glow of their bite - sized elegance , until we learned the UK pricing .
They 'll cost $ 249 in the US , which works out at £ 138 at today 's exchange rate .
But when they eventually reach the UK - in April - they 'll cost £ 199 .
Either Steve Jobs knows something we do n't about where exchange rates are going , or Apple 's having a laugh at our considerable expense .
I 'd bring some over for y' all , but they do n't go on sale here until February .
In other news , there 's a revamp of the iLife suite , including a good - looking music sequencer called GarageBand .
You can mix 64 tracks of loops , software instruments , live audio and live guitar put through one of half a dozen software amplifiers .
Musician John Mayer was on stage earlier to put the package through its paces and made a very credible track although , quite clearly , having oodles of musical talent helps a great deal .
Apple got the pricing right , too - the entire iLife package , including revamps of iTunes , iMovie , iDVD and iPhoto will cost $ 49 , and come free with new Macs .
It looks nice , although after previous dodgy experiences with iLife
I 'll reserve judgement until I 've used a copy for a few weeks .
There 's a new version of Final Cut Express 2 , Microsoft 's launching a new version of Office for Mac in the Spring , and the server room Macheads will have new XServe and XServe RAID storage systems to play with too ."
2004-01-06,"It 's worth prefacing this contribution with a warning .
Much of what you are about to read is speculation , fuelled by nothing more than the bonfire of "" he said "" , "" she said "" , and "" I heard in an internet chatroom "" that is the Mac rumour mill in holiday season .
If anyone is discussing what Apple chief executive Steve Jobs will unveil in his new year keynote to the January MacExpo conference , only one thing 's for sure : there are a few things we know for sure .
That does n't stop the world of Mac fandom from speculating , and looking forward to today 's show .
Part of the reason they are so keen is that Jobs delivers his speech with the kind of panache and theatrical presentation that makes it worth watching .
But the fans also love the fact there will always be a surprise .
Once , only once , the surprise was that there was no surprise .
But mostly , despite the rumour mill 's energy and impressive output , the gossips rarely get all the components of a Steve Jobs keynote spot on .
And that 's part of the fun .
Take last year , when Apple users approached the show with some gloom .
As well as a sluggish economy , which was taking its toll on the entire technology sector , Apple itself was being talked down by supposedly in - the - know analysts and pundits .
One US investment house even downgraded Apple stock to a "" sell "" , berating the company for its "" skimpy "" product development line .
The analyst who penned that must have had a difficult day after Jobs took to the stage .
Apple 's CEO promised enough announcements for "" two Macworlds "" , and promptly delivered two new laptops , a new web browser and revamps for a range of the company 's digital media applications .
So what of this year ?
The smart money is on the iPod music player taking centre stage .
There has been persistent talk of changes to Apple 's hottest product for some time and , given its importance to Apple 's reputation and bottom line ( it 's made Apple more relevant , and profitable ) , it seems to make sense that the company would want to keep the range fresh .
The gossips ca n't agree on what , exactly , will happen , however .
Think Secret , a well - regarded gossip site , suggests Jobs ' keynote will be "" music centric "" .
It reports with some conviction that Apple will launch new low - end mini iPods in a range of colours , "" including stripes "" , with prices starting at a remarkably low $ 100 ( £ 55 ) for a machine that could hold 400 songs .
Audiorevolution.com correctly notes that such a device , which might use flash memory rather than a hard drive to store the music , would provide a major boost to Apple 's iTunes Music Store .
Think Secret also predicts Apple will also offer coloured cases for the existing iPod range , and revamp its iLife digital media suite , which was launched at last year 's show .
The site has the distinction of being proved right on one prediction already .
Its prediction of a new version of the video editing package , Final Cut Express , has already been fulfilled after copies were spotted at a US computer store by Macrumors.com spies .
But that vindication does n't stop Apple Insider from boldly contradicting Think Secret 's assertion that there will be no computer hardware announcements at the keynote .
Apple Insider predicts new G5 desktops for professional Mac users and a long - awaited upgrade to Apple 's XServe server .
The latter prediction comes complete with more information than you 'll likely want to know on problems with the new machine 's self - diagnosis systems .
In its grand rumour roundup Macrumors.com notes Apple has trademarked the term iWrite , which has - no prizes for guessing - led to suggestions the company will continue its process of offering an alternative to popular Microsoft programs by unveiling a new word processor .
Safari , a web browser , and Keynote , a rival to PowerPoint , are already produced by Apple .
And if all these rumours seem a little pragmatic , you could always turn to the more wild suggestions being offered in some quarters .
The Register claimed in December that a new , cheaper iMac was being planned , despite the recent launch of a version of Apple 's consumer desktop computer with a 20-inch screen .
The site also speculates that the company will use the Mac 's 20th anniversary to launch a "" special "" Mac ; a tablet computer is their bet for what could be waiting in the wings for us tomorrow .
I 'm not holding my breath .
But , as experience tells us , you never know .
With Apple 's reputation for surprise innovations , you 'd have to be rash to make any predictions .

Fuller details will be on Guardian Unlimited tomorrow ."
2004-01-07,"Apple Computer last night announced it is to sell a cheaper version of its iPod music player , in a drive to further bolster its dominance of the digital music market .
Steve Jobs , the company 's chief executive , launched the new iPod Mini in a keynote speech at the start of the MacWorld show in San Francisco .
The new machines will cost $ 249 ( £ 138 ) , $ 50 less than the cheapest current iPod .
The iPod Minis will also be smaller than existing models , at half an inch thick and the same size as a business card .
Their aluminium shells will come in silver , gold , blue , pink or green and have 4Gb of storage , capable of holding about 1,000 songs .
The iPod Mini is intended to bridge a gap between the bulk of the rapidly growing music player market , and Apple 's more expensive full - size iPods , although the iPod Mini is more capable - and more expensive - than many of its rivals .
Mr Jobs said the company was now "" going after "" the portion of the market dominated by digital music players that use memory chips .
California - based Rio Audio dominates this end of the market , which accounts for about 62 % of sales , with music players that typically hold fewer than 100 songs are priced between $ 100 and $ 200 .
Mr Jobs said the iPod range had "" a really successful holiday quarter "" , selling 730,000 between October and December .
With more than 2 m iPods sold since its launch two years ago , Apple says it has now has about 31 % of the music player market , and 55 % of revenues .
Apple will announce its results for the quarter next week .
The iPod drives sales of 99 cent - a - time songs through the company 's iTunes music store .
The store , launched in April 2003 , has now sold more than 30 m songs , and has 70 % of the legal download market .
The new iPods go on sale in the US next month and will reach Britain in April .
This may coincide with the launch of the iTunes music store in Europe ."
2004-01-08,"The iPod Minis that Apple 's Steve Jobs unveiled this week are intended to bridge the gap between today 's powerful but expensive iPods and the rest of the music player market .
Many of the iPod 's rivals use memory chips instead of hard drives , so they are cheaper , but they hold far less music .
The iPod Minis will cost $ 249 , or £ 138 at today 's exchange rate , although the UK price will be much higher : £ 199 .
As such they cost more ( and , in the UK , much more ) than the sub-£100 players they are intended to compete with .
However , Apple is banking on their far greater capacity and more pleasing aesthetics to persuade customers to spend a little more .
"" It 's the best $ 50 you 'll ever spend , "" promised Jobs at the MacExpo show .
For your money , you 'll get a tiny device : a half - inch thick business card - sized aluminium sliver in silver , gold , blue , pink or green .
Its 4 GB hard drive will hold around 1,000 songs , and the device sports the same scroll wheel and user interface that has won the bigger iPod such plaudits ."
2004-01-08,"MacExpo Apple unveiled a new object of lust for techno - fetishists this week - but you 'll have to wait until April to see the new iPod Mini in this country .
Chief executive Steve Jobs unveiled the new devices in San Francisco this week , during his announcement - packed keynote speech to the MacExpo show .
The iPod is massively important for Apple .
Since its launch two years ago , it has sold more than 2 m units and - more importantly - become the kind of must - have gadget that has catapulted Apple 's image to new highs , and provided a useful diversion from the becalmed personal computer industry .
But Apple also showed off plenty of innovations for its core business .
Most impressive was a revamp of the iLife digital media software suite , which Jobs branded "" like Microsoft Office - for the rest of your life "" .
The suite , which already had packages to organise and edit music , video , photographs and DVD productions , now sports a fifth element - Garageband .
Garageband is an easy - to - use music sequencer , with a surprising amount of power under its user - friendly interface .
It is possible to mix audio loops , tracks from 50 "" software instruments "" and live audio - up to 64 tracks - and then export the finished production to iTunes and your iPod .
The software allows guitarists to plug in their instruments and put their music through one of several classic amplifiers , all imitated by the machine , or add the sound of a £ 50,000 Yamaha grand piano .
Guitarist and songwriter John Mayer came on stage during Jobs ' keynote to demonstrate the package , and eulogise about its power . ""
If I had this when I was 13 , "" he said , "" I 'd have locked myself in my room for ever . ""
The rest of the $ 49 ( £ 27 ) iLife package has also been updated .
It includes : · iTunes - the music management package that gives access to your music library on your computer , and on your iPod , and a way in to the Apple Music Store - if you live in the US .
A European version of the store is expected this spring .
· iPhoto - a digital photo management package which , after criticism of its speed with large numbers of images , can now cope with 25,000 images with "" zero waiting "" , says Jobs .
iPhoto can also share its library with other Macs via a wired or wireless network through Apple 's Rendezvous technology .
· iMovie - Apple 's stalwart movie - editing package has received a minor makeover , and can now import directly from Apple 's iSight digital camera .
· iDVD - the DVD production package has new themes , enhanced menus and , perhaps most importantly , "" pro - quality "" DVD encoding . which should give a sharper picture .
It can fit two hours of video on to one disc .
During the keynote , Jobs also announced a new version of Final Cut Express 2 , Apple 's mid - range video editing package , which will sell for £ 299 , or a $ 99 upgrade from the current version , and a new G5 version of the company 's Xserve file server .
Satellite car navigation system Navman 's new satellite navigation systems for cars , the iCN620 , is a big improvement on its clunky predecessors and is almost plug - and - play .
You put the connector into the cigarette lighter in your car and stick the unit on your windscreen with a suction clamp .
All you need do is type in your destination ( from an easy - to - use panel with navi - bar on the right ) and the system automatically picks up your starting point after taking a few minutes to find its bearings .
You are then guided by voice instructions to your destination .
At least that 's the theory .
In practice , it took time to master the idiosyncratic instructions , such as having to press an unlisted button to unravel details of the streets of London .
And since there is no confirmation of the chosen destina tion on the screen , you can sometimes drive for a while before realising you are on the wrong route .
Like similar systems , it operates better in the country than on complicated routes in the inner city ( for example , where there is a left turn and a left filter close together ) .
I did n't have the bottle to do a "" legal U turn "" as instructed by the computer in the middle of Victoria Street in London - but at least it recognised my predicament .
Once you have got over the quirks , it is impressive and compact .
Prices are coming down fast for positioning systems , but at £ 820 to £ 850 , the iCN620 is still mainly for the enthusiast .
Navman has also announced the iCN630 V2 ( £ 1,000 ) , which has a 3D map view and postcode search .
Victor Keegan Portable video Media on the go
Fancy a portable video version of the iPod music player ?
Microsoft co - founder Bill Gates was expected to an nounce further details of the company 's Media2Go PVP ( portable video player ) project during his opening keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last night , after Online went to press .
What is surprising is that devices are not already on sale .
Gates demonstrated Media2Go with a fanfare at last year 's CES , when Samsung , iRiver , ViewSonic and Sanyo were named as hardware partners .
Why did n't they have products on the market this Christmas , to compete with the now long - established Archos Jukebox Multimedia 20 ?
Although it remains to be seen what kind of form factors the Media2Go hardware partners have fashioned , there is probably not much that is new about the software .
Media2Go is based on Windows CE ( Consumer Electronics ) , which is well known in handheld computers and other devices , including smart wristwatches , sewing machines and mobile phones .
Given that a CE - based Pocket PC handheld like the Compaq iPaq has been able to play video files for several years , it ca n't have been that hard to convert it for a PVP .
It did need a simplified user interface , but Microsoft developed one successfully for the Windows XP Media Center home entertainment PC .
Other parts of the specification are up to the manufacturers , but typical machines should have an Intel XScale ( Arm - compatible ) processor , 4 in or larger colour LCD screens , and 5 GB or larger hard drivers .
Creative said its Media2Go system would provide continuous video playback for up to six hours , and continuous music playback for up to 12 hours .
Price and weight will also be significant considerations .
And someone might even think of offering a video download service similar to Apple 's iTunes .
Stat of the week : US ethnic net access

2004-01-11,"Last week saw the annual Macworld exhibition , held this year in San Francisco .
As usual , its highlight was the keynote address by Steve Jobs , Apple 's mercurial CEO .
Macworld is part trade - show and part revivalist meeting , because Apple users ( of whom this columnist is one ) tend to be passionate about their view of computing .
The Jobs speech is therefore a strange event - somewhere between the sermon on the mount and Henry V 's speech before Agincourt .
He comes on dressed in jeans and a black turtleneck and spends two hours explaining to the faithful his vision of the future and Apple 's role in it .
This year , his theme was digital music and video .
The main product release at the show was a miniature version of Apple 's delectable iPod MP3 player .
( Jobs also announced a high - end server machine which marks Apple 's foray into territory hitherto occupied by boring old outfits like Sun , IBM and HP , but this was a sideshow compared with the multimedia stuff . )
To geeks who slaver over new hardware , this looked like pretty thin gruel , but the strategy implicit in Jobs 's speech is very interesting .
Basically , he is betting the company on making it easy for users to create , manipulate and publish digital content .
Why is this interesting ?
Lots of reasons .
First , Jobs has a good track record as a visionary .
He was the driving force , for example , behind the Apple Macintosh ( launched 20 years ago this year and still the most innovative personal computer the industry has produced ) .
Second , Apple is in the same relative position now as it was in 1986 - 7 , when it became clear that the business world preferred the grey , pedestrian angularity of the IBM PC architecture to the chic , designer - friendly Mac with its bit - mapped screen , resizable windows and mouse - driven interface .
Then , Apple was marginalised in the corporate market but saved by the arrival of desktop publishing software and the laser printer , for which the Mac was a perfect tool - which explains why even today the design and art departments of most companies are stuffed with Apple kit .
Time moves on , and the corporate world is still almost as suspicious of Apple Macs as it was in 1986 .
But technological advances in the consumer electronics market have opened up a huge new opportunity which Jobs has spotted and is in pole position to exploit .
The key shift is that consumers are now in a position to generate or acquire lots of digital content , and they want to do things with it without having to acquire a PhD in computer science .
Ripping CDs into MP3 files is now commonplace - as is file - sharing and CD - burning .
Digital cameras ( both standalone and integrated into mobile phones ) are producing terabytes of digital imagery every day .
Ditto digital camcorders .
These changes are transforming ' ordinary ' people from being passive consumers of multi - media content ( CDs , videos , DVDs ) into active producers of content which they want to manipulate and share .
Under Jobs , Apple 's strategy has been to provide tools that make it easy to do all this .
Consequently , all Macs come with iTunes ( for ripping , mixing and burning CDs ) , iPhoto ( for managing digital photographs ) , iMovie ( for editing home movies ) and iDVD ( for authoring DVDs ) .
Want to make a home movie ?
Just do the filming , then hook up the camera to a Mac .
IMovie grabs the video and chops it into separate sequences which can then be drag - and - dropped into a linear film .
It provides tools for DIY captioning , transitions and adding music and stills ( from your iTunes and iPhoto libraries , naturally ) and then lets you write the edited film onto DVD .
Any fool can do it ( believe me , I know ) .
It 's desktop multimedia and Steve Jobs thinks it 's the future .
Which explains why , at the moment , Apple is the only outfit doing it right ."
2004-01-29,""" Pixar Animation Studios is ending talks aimed at continuing its relationship with The Walt Disney Co and will seek a deal with another studio , Pixar chief executive Steve Jobs said Thursday .
Pixar , which co - produced last year 's top - box office draw , Finding Nemo , said it will look for an agreement that allows it to retain ownership of future movies , "" according to AP ."
2004-02-06,"Pixar chief Steve Jobs has attacked the Walt Disney Company over a lack of creative ambition a week after announcing that the companies would end their highly lucrative partnership by 2006 .
Steve Jobs is the top man at both Apple computers and Pixar , the animation studio behind global blockbuster Finding Nemo and hits Toy Story and Monsters Inc.
Speaking in a Pixar conference call to analysts , he poured scorn on Disney 's recent animated efforts .
"" Not even Disney 's marketing and brand could turn the last two animated films , Treasure Planet and Brother Bear , into successes .
They both bombed , "" Jobs reportedly said .
The partners have split cost and profit on every Pixar title since Toy Story was released in 1995 and will part company at the end of next year after Jobs reportedly sought to lower Disney 's 12.5 % distributor fee .
Disney has the rights to make sequels of some of the films , a prospect Jobs said made him feel sick . ""
If you look at the quality of their sequels , like The Lion King , Peter Pan and stuff , it 's pretty embarrassing , "" he said .
A spokesperson for Disney said : "" It 's sad and unfortunate that he has resorted to insults and name - calling in the wake of the disagreement .
We expected better of him . """
2004-05-13,"Wired News reports that technology company executives are piling in behind President Bush 's campaign for reelection . ""
From Microsoft 's Steve Ballmer to Cisco Systems ' John Chambers to IBM 's Samuel Palmisano , chief executives of the nation 's largest tech firms have written checks to the Bush campaign this election cycle .
While there are exceptions -- such as Apple Computer 's Steve Jobs , a non - contributor recently named by John Kerry 's presidential campaign as an economic adviser -- people familiar with technology leaders ' political spending habits say industry heavyweights are predominantly backing the incumbent president .
"" For those of you fearing your technology idols do n't share your political views , there may be an explanation - "" some political analysts are uncertain whether it 's Bush 's positions on the issues or his status as a sitting president that 's inspiring executives to contribute this election year , "" reports the site ."
2004-06-09,""" Apple Computer Inc today announced three new dual - processor Power Mac G5 configurations , with the fastest model topping out at 2.5 GHz and using a new liquid cooling system .
The new high - end systems miss the 3 GHz mark that Apple CEO Steve Jobs said the company would achieve at last year 's Worldwide Developers Conference , but Tom Boger , Apple 's director of Power Mac product marketing , said it came down to a technology challenge that was bigger than expected , "" reports MacCentral . ""
Boger also said today that users should n't expect to see a PowerBook G5 before the end of the year because of the challenges of putting the G5 in a small enclosure . """
2004-06-15,"Apple founder Steve Jobs today promised to "" revolutionise "" the music industry by allowing users to download a song for just 79p on the long - awaited UK version of its iTunes online music store .
The computer giant hopes to revitalise the beleaguered singles chart and boost flagging record sales by making available up to 700,000 tracks at a fraction of the price charged in the high street .
Albums will also be available - it is undercutting record shops and other digital services by pricing them at around £ 7.99 - on what Apple calls "" the biggest jukebox in the world "" .
Apple revealed today that the US version of the iTunes store had sold 85 million downloads in just over a year and had a huge 70 % market share of legal downloads .
But the maverick Apple chief , who personally unveiled the service at a lavish press conference in London that featured a performance from American diva Alicia Keys , will face an uphill battle to establish similar supremacy for the service on this side of the Atlantic .
"" We think this is the digital music store that Europe has been waiting for , "" Mr Jobs said today but US rival Napster , which launched last month , has already beaten iTunes to launch in the UK .
Apple will also face competition from OD2 , the service co - founded by former Genesis frontman Peter Gabriel that pioneered legal downloads in the UK and powers services for Coca - Cola , MSN , Tiscali , HMV and others .
In the US iTunes became an instant hit after Mr Jobs called on record firms to license more of their catalogue for digital downloads .
He intervened to ensure fans could buy Hotel California by The Eagles , his favourite band , through the online store but has so far been unable to persuade the remaining members of the Beatles to follow suit .
In the UK Apple has signed deals with all five major record labels , representing best selling artists including Coldplay , Madonna and Beyonce .
But it emerged that it has yet to sign deals with independent labels such as XL and Beggars Banquet , so will be missing tracks from cult favourites such as The White Stripes and the Prodigy when it launches today .
The independent labels are furious they have been offered worse terms than their bigger rivals .
The online store will also offer extra features such as music videos , exclusive tracks and more than 5,000 audio books from authors including John Grisham and Bill Bryson .
But Mr Jobs said he believed the combination of lower prices , seamless integration with its best selling iPod player and the added flexibility allowing users to access the songs on five different computers and transfer them as many times as they liked to CD would give Apple the edge .
Music downloading could be the salvation of the outdated Top of the Pops and other chart shows that rely on sales of singles , or a combination of sales and radio airplay , to gauge tracks ' popularity .
An official download chart is expected to launch in autumn as a precursor to digital tracks being included in the official UK Top 40 .
Record chiefs hope the move will revive the troubled singles chart .
Apple 's clear pricing structure in the US , with all tracks costing 99 cents , and extensive catalogue have been credited with helping to wean customers from free peer - to - peer download services such as Kazaa in the States .
Mr Jobs said today iTunes was competing with piracy more than with rival services .
The record industry has blamed illegal downloading and physical piracy for a calamitous drop in global sales , which caused an unprecedented round of cutbacks with hundreds of redundancies and scores of artists culled .
Jay Berman , the chairman of global trade body the International Federation of Phonographic Industries , said today the European launch of iTunes was "" probably the best evidence yet that the music industry 's evolution from physical formats to online distribution is working and will be a success "" . ""
Consumers are hungry to get music in new convenient and flexible ways , and the recording industry has proved its commitment to making a huge catalogue of its music available online , "" he added .
Key to the battle of the download stores will be a format war that is likely to mirror the battle for control of the video market between VHS and Betamax two decades earlier .
The iTunes music store will only transfer tracks to Apple 's own iPod , of which it has already sold 3 million , and does not work with players made by rival manufacturers .
Conversely , rival services such as Napster are n't compatible with the market leading iPod but will work with more than 60 other players .
Mr Jobs took a veiled swipe at Napster today when he said the company 's subscription model , which allows users to download as many tracks as they like for £ 9.99 a month , was at odds with consumers ' desire to own music .
But if a user cancels their subscription , they lose all the songs they have downloaded unless they have paid extra to download them to CD or a portable player . ""
Users do n't want to rent their favourite songs , they want to buy them , "" said Mr Jobs .
Apple also plans to launch a pan - European store by October to augment today 's UK , French and German sites .
In continental Europe tracks will be priced at 0.99 euros each .
It has also signed a number of deals , including an agreement with AOL to provide exclusive content from its AOL Sessions with the likes of Eric Clapton and Alicia Keys and a deal with Disney to exclusively sell its soundtrack albums online .
To accompany today 's announcement Apple also unveiled a number of new gadgets to allow iTunes users to transmit music around the house wirelessly to their home stereo or other computers .
Mr Jobs said it was also in negotiations with car manufacturers to allow iPod users to easily play their music on the move . ·

2004-06-16,"Steve Jobs zipped around the iTunes music store yesterday .
He watched free music videos , played songs , and showed just how frighteningly easy it was to rack up those 79p spends with the click of a mouse .
iTunes is perfect for him .
But Jobs is the technological visionary who founded Apple and appears to have broad , mainstream music tastes , encompassing Alicia Keys and Jamie Cullum .
I , on the other hand , am a technologically incompetent fan of indie music , blessed with an ageing computer .
So when I try to buy and download songs from iTunes , I find it a little bit trickier .
My computer 's operating system is too old to support the software .
I jump on two further computers before finding one that downloads iTunes easily .
The music store looks fantastic and is easy to use .
As well as searching for and buying songs , customers can purchase and download 5,000 audio books in the store , 12,000 classical tracks , and get "" exclusive "" iTunes songs performed by the likes of Eric Clapton .
Whether you will find what you want may depend on how broad your music tastes are .
While 700,000 songs sounds a lot , my palate is limited .
I start by searching for my all - time favourite indie dreamers :
Ride .
No tracks found .
A search for Suede turns up all the songs from their poorest album , and none from Dog Man Star , their greatest .
I can buy plenty of contemporary alternative rock by the likes of PJ Harvey and Snow Patrol , but it is only when I try something a little older that I hit gold .
Duran Duran - everything seems to be there .
I try to buy Hungry Like the Wolf .
It seems to go smoothly .
Buying an iPod or working out how to play it on my computer comes next ."
2004-06-17,"I got a brief interview with Apple 's chief executive , Steve Jobs , right after Tuesday 's launch of iTunes music store in the UK , France and Germany .
We did n't get to use much in the final piece so , given the level of interest in the story , I thought I 'd post a fuller , edited transcript of our chat here .
Students of Jobs interviews -
and I know there are some - will note his comments on the iPod 's changing role for Apple ( it 's not seen as a flag - bearer for the whole Mac OS any more ) and Jobs ' repeated statement of admiration for Sony .
Conspiracy theorists , start your engines ...
NM :
What 's the rationale behind the pricing of music on the store ?
SJ : "" We want to offer a really good product at a really aggressive price .
We want to be the price leader .
OD2 announced a price of 75p , but it 's from 75p .
We looked at their store and we could only find very few songs .
Most songs were at 99p .
NM :
Was it also down to the fact that , unlike in the US where you pretty much had the market to yourselves , in the UK the market is
more developed …
SJ : ""
But it 's not more developed here .
It 's still very , very tiny .
In the UK , the numbers are only about 50,000 songs being sold here a week .
We sell 2.5 m songs a week in the US .
The market really has n't been opened here .
We hope that iTunes does that .
The thing to keep in mind is there 's not a lot of money to be made running an online music store .
Most of the money goes to the record labels .
I 've always wondered why small companies would want to do it .
We 're the largest , and we 're breaking even , making a very small profit , but the other guys must be losing money .
And they do n't have an iPod business .
If you 're not selling iPods , and you have a tiny market share , you must be losing a lot of money .
Why would a small company like Napster or OD2 want to be in this business ?
But that 's their business , not ours .
I 'm sure they have their reasons . ""
NM :
When the iPod was launched , you said it might lead people to the Mac platform .
Does you still believe that ?
SJ : "" No .
We brought the iPod to Windows .
That was a big decision .
That was basically a decision not to use the iPod to drive people to Macs .
We 're going to use it as a music device , and we 're going to put it on Windows .
The majority of iPods we sell are used on Windows . ""
NM : You 've gone back to renegotiate with the labels after the first year .
Have attitudes changed towards you ?
SJ : ""
Oh sure .
Absolutely .
The labels are really happy with the success that we 've shown .
We told them we were going to go do a bunch of things , and we did them .
And they were n't used to that .
So I think there 's a lot of trust that 's been built up . ""
NM :
They 're also more likely to be keen on you - you 're shifting a lot of songs , and putting some marketing muscle behind it …
SJ : ""
We 're investing a lot in this , and they like that "" .
NM :
Coming to Europe , were the negotiations more difficult than those you had in the US ?
SJ : ""
No , they were n't more difficult .
But the difficult thing was the rights .
In the US , a company has the right to distribute a song .
But in the UK , a different company has the right to distribute that same song .
And maybe in Germany , a third company will have the right .
And there 's no central database that tells you who to pay when you sell a song in the UK , versus Germany , versus France .
We had to sit down with the labels and figure all this out .
And that 's what took a long time – figuring out the rights issues . ""
On other services , every song has a different set of rights attached to it .
We did n't want that .
The user should never have to worry about that .
When they buy a CD they do n't have to worry about what rights they have , and they 're the same for every CD they have .
So I think what the big breakthrough for iTunes was that the rights – and the price – are the same for every song . ""
NM :
What 's happening with the indie labels ?
You appear to have some , but by no means all .
SJ : ""
We have over 500 indies in the US , and most will be coming here .
We have dozens signed here , but there are a few – probably many – that we do n't .
But we 're open for business now , and we 'll obviously have time now to sign those guys up over the next several weeks . ""
NM : Your competitors are quick to point out iTunes Music Store only works with the iPod , and that their services works with dozens .
SJ : ""
Right , but nobody buys those .
iPod has over 50 % market share .
And , more than that , if you look at the market share of in use players – and there 's no data on this –
but we guess the share is closer to 75 % because that 50 % includes comparing iPod with the $ 50 MP3 players that only hold 16 songs .
When you get one of those as a gift , you do n't use it . ""
NM : Do you have any data on the market share in hard - disk based players ?
SJ : ""
Oh – in the 90s .
iPod works with anything – you can put any MP3s from any jukebox , any computer .
You can rip your CDs from any jukebox , any computer .
With iTunes , we decided to work with the most popular music player – and that 's by far the iPod .
Rather than support all these other guys , we 'd rather use the engineering to innovate .
So far the customers have said that 's what they want .
"" NM :
I was speaking to an academic yesterday who was finding that digital music is changing our listening habits
– we have a far broader taste in music than any radio station would give us credit for , especially .
SJ : ""
I agree with that .
Another thing that 's new is shuffle – there was never real shuffle before the iPod .
You could shuffle a CD , but there would be only 12 songs .
So you 've got 1000 songs and you put it on shuffle in your iPod , and you 're listening to things you have n't heard in a couple of years .
It 's a new way to discover things both on the iTunes music store , but also to discover your own music library again .
People are listening to lots more .
I think there 's a renaissance in music that this is going to ignite .
Sony did a great job of this in the 70s and 80s .
They had the best CD players , and we look at them as a role model in this new digital age –
a lot of people have said this iPod is the Walkman for the digital age . ""
NM :
But the download and play model holds – streaming , for instance , is n't something you 're interested in doing at this stage ?
SJ : ""
It 's not something the customers seem interested in doing .
We have n't seen a lot of interest . ""
NM : And
a la carte pricing is what people want too ?
SJ : "" It was proved long before iTunes
– it was proved with LPs , it was proved with cassettes , it was proved with CDs .
People want to own their music . """
2004-06-20,"Steve Jobs and co entered a large and diverse club today , filled with everyone from Tony Blair to asylum seekers , Europe and "" liberal values "" , when Apple got its first monstering in the Mail (
The Mail , for our overseas visitors , is right wing daily newspaper that sells more than 2 m copies a day in the UK ) .
The story ( sorry : ca n't find it online ) under the headline "" The great iTunes rip - off "" pretty much does what it says on the tin , laying into Apple for pricing songs at 79p here , against 54p in the US , and 65p in France and Germany .
The paper quotes "" Phil Evan , of the Consumers ' Association "" ( they mean Phil Evans , but not to worry ) saying he feels it "" makes a mockery of the concept of a single market "" .
Meanwhile Andy Evans of "" ITportal.com "" ( they mean theitportal.com , but not to worry ) says it is "" totally unfair
and I feel short - changed "" .
His is certainly a widely held view , even if it feels a little unfair to bash iTunes when its rivals in the UK are charging more - much more , in some cases - for the same music , often with much tighter DRM .
But Apple 's excuse that music simply costs more in the UK sounds hollow when you consider the company 's pricing policy with hardware over the years .
We still await their price announcement for the iPod mini , which - according to their initial plans , at least - will cost far more in the UK than in the US .
Of course , were we in the Euro you 'd imagine the extra transparency that would shed on pricing issues would make it far harder for Apple to pull its little currency conversion tricks .
But , then again , that 's hardly a point the Mail is likely to raise ..."
2004-06-23,"Apple claims to have sold more than 800,000 songs in Europe in the first week of the European iTunes music stores , with more than 450,000 downloads being sold in the UK alone .
Apple CEO Steve Jobs says that makes the iTMS "" Europe 's top online music store "" , with sales "" 16 times as many as OD2 , its closest competitor "" .
To put this in perspective , record industry body the BPI announced total digital music sales in the UK , between January and the end of May , for all vendors , of 500,000 tracks .
Looks like Jobs ' claim in our interview last week - that the download business was not yet developed in the UK - was spot on .
Such sales also imply , even at this early stage , that Apple will move on to take as dominant a market share here as it already enjoys in the US ."
2004-06-24,"Apple 's new music download service iTunes has proved a hit in the UK , selling almost as many tracks in its first week as its rivals sold in the first five months of this year .
The music download service launched in Europe by Apple 's chief , Steve Jobs , seven days ago announced today it had sold 450,000 of the 79p tracks in the UK alone .
This is only marginally behind the number of legal downloads sold in the first five months of this year - according to figures from the Official UK Chart Company , sales of legal digital downloads topped 500,000 in the year to May 31 .
Across Europe , iTunes ' sales reached 800,000 - well ahead of its chief European rival , Peter Gabriel 's OD2 .
In comparison , Coca - Cola , which uses OD2 's download technology , sold just 50,000 downloads in its first week after launching in the UK in January .
The impressive start for iTunes in the UK , Germany and France will be welcome news to Apple and the big five record labels that have joined the service .
They are looking to iTunes and competitors such as Napster , OD2 and Wippit to fend off the rise in pirated downloads and reverse a slump in CD sales . ""
After selling over 800,000 songs during its first week , iTunes is Europe 's top online music store , "" Mr Jobs said .
"" In the UK alone , iTunes sold more than 450,000 songs in the last week - 16 times as many as OD2 , its closest competitor . ""
Apple 's move into Europe has already sparked consolidation in the download industry .
Earlier this week the US digital media company , LoudEye , said it was buying OD2 for around £ 21 m in a bid to become the global leader in business to business downloads .
OD2 , the European leader until the arrival of iTunes , does not run a download service itself but provides the technology behind online music retailers such as Coca - Cola , MTV and Microsoft .

2004-06-27,"· The impasse continues between Apple and the European independent record labels after the abrupt intervention of Steve Jobs last week .
Jobs called Alison Wenham , the head of the Association of Independent Music , the body that represents UK independent labels .
After ending the conversation by almost slamming the phone down , Jobs has wisely taken a back seat in the talks , leaving Eddie Cue , the head of iTunes to mend the fences .
Diary 's indie sources , however , say Cue has yet to start "" substantive "" talks about improving the licensing deal on offer to the indies .
Perhaps Apple has taken a leaf out of the Microsoft book of negotiation diplomacy , if you ca n't talk your way through a deal just walk all over them . ·
No question yet of an impasse between the government and the BBC over charter renewal .
The long - winded process just seems to drag on .
Diary was woken from its sleep during last week 's culture select committee by the revelation that Lord Burns , the grandee charged by Tessa Jowell with leading the review , is a bit of a geek .
Amid calls from MPs for the BBC to wake up to the challenge of broadband and new technology - despite its industry - leading record - Lord Burns revealed his new media knowhow .
"" I 'm very aware of technology , "" he said .
"" I 've got a wireless network at home . ""
This instantly put to shame most of the MPs and hacks in the room .
· Talking of shameful , how about the latest lame attempt by the music industry to flog another format - the "" pocket "" CD .
After trials in Germany the 3-inch discs are set to launch in the UK later this month , with Asda lined up as one of the key retailers , and Busted , Girls Aloud and Black Eyed Peas the trial bands .
Diary can only stand in awe of the operatives at Universal for deducing that the discs , which contain music and ringtones , are going to be a hit .
They are playable on PCs and targeted at tech - savvy teenagers and 20somethings , who must go through the laborious process of downloading the ringtones on to their computers before uploading them on to their mobiles .
Genius .
· Diary thought it was only pouty supermodels who could n't get out of bed for less than £ 50,000 a day .
Now it appears the phenomenon has spread to the City .
Eager to cash in on the Google float , Diary was bemused to see that Merrill Lynch had dropped out of the most famous floatation since Lastminute.com due to smaller - than - expected fees .
If Google raises the $ 2.7bn it is after , then the remaining banks , led by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse First Boston , can expect to pocket between $ 135 m ( £ 75m)and $ 190 m , worth getting out of bed for in anyone 's books ."
2004-06-29,""" Apple Computer is predicting that rivals will mimic Mac OS X Tiger , but one developer says it 's the new Mac operating system that is doing the copying .
Arlo Rose is outraged at the similarity of Apple 's Dashboard , previewed earlier Monday by Apple CEO Steve Jobs , to his Konfabulator , a $ 25 Macintosh program .
Both programs allow easy access to small programs called Widgets , which can perform a number of useful little tasks , "" reports CNet .
"" It is not the first time Mac OS X has stepped on what some see as other 's turf .
Apple , based in Cupertino , Calif. , previously expanded its Sherlock search tool to add features such as movie times and yellow pages in a format that closely paralleled a third - party tool called Watson . ""
Update :
There 's now a better account of the kerfuffle at MacCentral :
Konfabulator , Dashboard controversy flows out of WWDC .
Comment : One of the more amusing things about this little spat
is that Konfabulator was itself accused of being a bit of a rip - off of a very popular Windows program that came out about three years earlier .
In that case , Brad Wardell 's real complaints were that ( 1 ) Mac programs get loads of publicity while similar or better PC programs like his are ignored ; and ( 2 ) that he kept being attacked by outraged Mac fanatics "" for copying their stuff "" when his stuff was out years before .
No surprises there .
But while it 's not hard to bury Konfabulator under two decades of "" prior art , "" including Apple 's [ see below ] , it does seem that Apple is sending out a message : that if you support the Mac by creating popular software , Apple will have no compunction about invading the same market .
Well , Steve Jobs may not have to care about trampling developers underfoot , but this is not the most tactful message to send to the audience at your Worldwide Developers Conference .
Who really invented "" widgets "" is another matter -- that 's a name that was ripped off from Unix .
In the 1980s , we used to call things like that Desktop Accessories , and there 's a plausible claim that Desktop Ornaments were thunk up in 1981 for the orginal Mac ( though this does n't explain why they appeared in the Apple Lisa before the Mac came out ) .
Even way back then , however , it did n't seem to be a particularly novel idea : if you had an interface based on a desktop metaphor , why would you be surprised if it had desktop utilities such as a clock , a calculator , and a notepad ?
Later , the huge success of Borland 's Sidekick and similar DOS programs showed you did n't even need a desktop to find the idea useful ."

49 Industry : new media , film Company turnover : $ 6.2bn ( £ 3.4bn )
2003 ranking : 13 Such has been the success of the iPod that Apple now sells more of them than it does computers .
The ubiquitous digital music players , with their familiar white earphones , have revolutionised the music industry and look set to send compact discs the same way as vinyl .
The iTunes website sold more than 70 million tracks in its first 12 months in the US , capturing 70 % of the market for legal music downloads , while in the UK it sold 450,000 songs in its first week alone .
At a time when dwindling record sales have made the singles charts irrelevant , music downloads might finally make the top 40 interesting again .
There are other digital players on the market , but none have captured the imagination quite like the iPod .
That 's partly down to Apple 's enviable brand image , and partly down to Mr Jobs ' charisma .
But Mr Jobs was n't only making waves in the music and online industry in the last 12 months .
He is also chief executive of animated film maker Pixar , the company behind Toy Story and Finding Nemo .
At the beginning of the year it walked away from its long - standing partnership with Disney amid a dispute over money and a reported clash of egos with Disney chairman Michael Eisner .
Mr Eisner is likely to miss the partnership more than Jobs , contributing as it did up to half the annual revenue of Disney 's film division .
Mr Jobs has been spoken about as a possible successor to Mr Eisner , although he is better known for his creativity and vision than he is for his management skills .
One thing 's for sure - he does n't need the money .
Mr Jobs co - founded Apple in his family garage in 1976 and by the age of 25 he was worth $ 165 m .
He returned to the company in 1997 attempting to place it at the forefront of the internet age .
With the iPod , it looks like he 's done it ."
2004-07-17,"Sun :
A CEO 's Last Stand , is Business Week 's cover story for July 26 , and there 's an "" online extra "" in the form of an interview with Scott McNealy .
He 's always interesting because he has the same kind of gigantic ego as his better - known buddies , Larry Ellison ( Oracle ) and Steve Jobs ( Apple ) , even though Sun 's products are becoming increasingly irrelevant ."
2004-07-22,"As far as the music industry is concerned , the message is clear : file sharing is killing it .
"" Research clearly illustrates that the illegal use of music on the internet is damaging the entire UK music industry , "" said Peter Jamieson , the chairman of the BPI ( British Phonographic Industry ) .
Even Apple 's chief executive , Steve Jobs , agrees .
"" iTunes really competes with piracy , not the other services , "" he said at the iTunes Music Store Europe launch last month .
"" Piracy is the big enemy - the market has shrunk in France and Germany and seen zero growth in the UK . ""
Yet despite the industry 's belief that file sharing is anathema to record sales , a recent study has shown that it may not be so clear cut . ""
Downloads have an effect on sales that is statistically indistinguishable from zero , "" the controversial report claims , even going so far as to suggest that for popular albums , "" the impact of file sharing on sales is likely to be positive "" .
The study , by Felix Oberholzer - Gee , Associate Professor in the strategy unit at Harvard Business School , and Koleman Strumpf , Associate Professor in the economics department at the University of North Carolina , analyses sales and download data , and its conclusions contradict the established music industry line .
During the last quarter of 2002 , the pair gathered data from two peer - to - peer file sharing servers on the OpenNap network and matched individual downloads to the weekly sales figures of 680 chart albums .
"" Our hypothesis was that if downloads are killing music , then albums that are downloaded more intensively should sell less , "" says Strumpf .
But , after adjusting for the effects of popularity , they discovered that file sharing has "" no statistically significant effect "" on sales .
An economist with a love of music , Strumpf has been interested in file sharing since the Napster trial in 2000 , but was not impressed by the evidence presented in court .
"" I read through the studies that were used during the trial , and they were really horrible , "" he says .
Many of the surveys concluded , incorrectly according to Strumpf , that people who download more buy less . ""
The fact that there 's a correlation does not imply that downloading is the root cause of these people buying less .
File sharing is done primarily by teenagers and college kids because they have a lot of time on their hands
but they do n't have a lot of money .
If we got rid of file sharing tomorrow , it does n't necessarily mean these kids would be buying any more music .
"" Another problem is that asking someone about their illegal activities , particularly in the US where they risk prosecution , is unlikely to result in honest or accurate answers .
But Oberholzer - Gee and Strumpf are not without critics .
"" We consider it a very flawed study , "" says Matt Phillips , a BPI spokesperson .
Both the BPI and the International Federation for the Phonographic Industries ( IFPI ) have criticised the study for including the Christmas period when people are buying CDs as gifts .
"" It 's very straightforward to address these kinds of criticisms , "" says Strumpf .
"" We got rid of the Christmas season and just looked at the first half of our data .
We still find the same effect . ""
So , if downloading has n't caused the slump in sales , what has ?
There are several factors that could be involved , but the easiest explanation is the popularity of DVDs . ""
Over the period 1999 to 2003 , DVD prices fell by 25 % and the price of players fell in the US from over $ 1,000 to almost nothing , "" says Strumpf .
"" At the same time , CD prices went up by 10 % .
Combined DVD and VHS tape sales went up by 500 m , while CD sales fell by 200 m , so a possible explanation is that people were spending on DVDs instead of CDs .
"" It is clear that more work needs to be done before the market effect of downloading is fully understood , but Strumpf was unsure whether they would be able to conduct further work . ""
The problem is getting hold of sales figures .
Getting data on file sharing is hard , but it 's possible .
However , I imagine it 's going to be difficult for us to get sales data in the future because of the views of the record industry towards us . ""
Prior to Oberholzer - Gee and Strumpf 's report , there were no empirical studies based on actual file sharing behaviour , and the music industries in the US and the UK have based their policies on , at best , incomplete research .
At worst , the surveys and analyses they quote are misleading and inaccurate .
Yet still the RIAA has sued its customers - an action Strumpf calls "" one of the stupidest things in the world to do "" .
The BPI has stated it is "" prepared to go that route if forced "" .
Some even question whether the fall in sales the RIAA quotes is real , or a product of a creative redefinition of the word "" sale "" .
Even if it is real , there is one final fly in the ointment that ca n't easily be explained away : during the past nine months , CD sales in America have increased by 7 % , despite continued growth in file sharing .
As Strumpf says : "" If file sharing is killing record sales , why are records starting to sell better ? """
2004-08-03,"Steve Jobs , chief executive of Apple Computer , was yesterday recovering from weekend surgery to remove a cancerous tumour from his pancreas .
Mr Jobs , 49 , broke the news of his surgery in an email to staff late on Sunday .
He said he would take August off to recuperate but expects to make a full recovery .
He hopes to be back at his desk in September .
He identified the cancer as an islet cell neuroendocrine tumour , a rare form that can be cured by surgical removal if caught early , as Mr Jobs said his had been .
He said he would not undergo chemotherapy or radiation treatment .
He added that the far more deadly and common form of pancreatic cancer was adenocarcinoma .
"" I mention this because when one hears pancreatic cancer ( or Googles it ) one immediately encounters this far more common and deadly form , which , thank God , is not what I had . ""
Mr Jobs founded Apple with school friend Steve Wozniak in 1976 and launched the Macintosh computer less than 10 years later .
It was the first to use graphics to represent a desktop .
Mr Jobs left Apple in 1985 to create another computer company , NeXT .
NeXT failed to prosper and Apple lost its way without Mr Jobs .
He returned in 1997 and revitalised the business by cutting the num ber of product lines and refocusing on innovative design .
The revamped iMac computer and iBook laptops became innovative design icons .
In the past year Apple shares have risen more than 50 % , largely owing to the resounding success of the iPod , the stylish handheld digital music player .
Last month Apple said that third quarter profits had more than tripled to $ 61 m , largely thanks to rapid sales of the iPod .
Last year Apple launched iTunes , a digital music store .
It has been credited with being the first real breakthrough in legitimising online music .
Apple shares were yesterday trading 70 cents lower at $ 31.64 , with Wall Street analysts raising concerns about the lack of a succession plan .
Mr Jobs has enjoyed a double success as chairman and chief executive of Pixar , the computer animation studio which has scored successive hits with films such as Toy Story , Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo .
In Mr Jobs ' absence , Apple will be run by Timothy Cook , vice - president of worldwide sales and operations .
Ed Catmull , who runs the day - to - day operation at Pixar , will continue to oversee that business .
Bill Campbell , an Apple board member , said Mr Jobs ' doctors "" felt very confident that the surgery was successful and the prognosis is excellent "" ."
2004-08-04,""" Steve Jobs says he expects a full recovery from his cancer surgery , but news of his illness raised the question of how his companies , Apple Computer Inc. and Pixar Animation Studios , would fare without the executive — whom some consider the companies ' soul — at the helm . '
What makes him very hard to replace is his charisma , ' said industry analyst Rob Enderle .
Jobs ' can sell refrigerators to Eskimos',""reports AP .
"" Jobs , 49 , assured employees and investors he expects a full recovery and plans to return to work next month . """
2004-08-04,""" The past couple of years , Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs has gotten nothing but roses and kisses from the public and the media .
But a feud between Apple and RealNetworks over music downloads is exposing Jobs ' tragic flaw .
Amazingly , he seems to be making the same devastating mistakes with the iPod that he made with the Mac 20 years ago . "" writes Kevin Maney in his Wednesday column in USA Today .
Maney says Avram Miller , a tech investor and former vice president at Intel , compares Apple to Singapore .
"" You know Singapore : autocratic , insular , elegantly engineered , repressively controlled — and destined to never amount to more than a small but interesting dot on the world map .
"" Comment :
It 's an old tale , but amusingly told .
However , it is n't true to say that Jobs refused to license the Mac OS in 1985 ( which was when Gates wrote to Apple , recommending and offering to support licensing as a way to make Mac OS a standard ) .
Jobs had no real power at Apple once the Mac had flopped : John Sculley was the CEO , and it was Sculley who decided against licensing .
To be specific , Jobs was booted out of Apple on May 24 , 1985 and the Gates memo was sent on June 25 .
Of course , Jobs would certainly have made the same mistake , and it was Jobs who -- after returning to Apple in the 90s -- got rid of the Mac "" cloners "" that Gil Amelio had belatedly allowed in .
But at the critical time , Jobs was n't even there ."
2004-08-10,"Following its recent compromise deal with the independent labels behind big selling bands such as the White Stripes and the Streets , Apple 's iTunes online music store today announced it has boosted the size of its available catalogue to more than 1 million tracks in the US .
The music download service , which finally launched in Europe in June , has added more than 300,000 new tracks to the US version of the service as the battle for market share of the online music sector gains pace .
The European version of iTunes , launched by Apple founder Steve Jobs in the UK , France and Germany in June , currently offers 700,000 tracks at 79p each , although record industry insiders say this too will soon be boosted to more than 1 million .
Apple is battling with Napster , which was relaunched earlier this year , Sony , Microsoft and others for control of the market , kick - started in the last 12 months by the popularity of Apple 's iPod player .
The belated determination of record companies to find new ways to combat online piracy and arrest declining sales has led to more enthusiasm to license tracks to online services .
While some notable omissions remain , including The Beatles , Apple now offers more than one million tracks in the US . ""
The iTunes music store offers the world 's most extensive collection of downloadable music with over 1 million tracks available , "" said Eddy Cue , Apple 's vice president of Applications .
"" With more than 1 million songs , over 600 independent labels and dozens of innovative features , iTunes is the ultimate destination for discovering and downloading music , "" he added .
Record labels are watching with interest to see whether consumers prefer Napster 's mixture of subscription and permanent downloads , iTunes ' straightforward download service or OD2 's hybrid version .
In the US iTunes is the clear market leader with a market share of more than 70 % , selling more than 100 million songs since it launched last year .
In the UK , much depends on whether Apple 's rivals can topple the iPod as the most popular digital music player .
Tracks downloaded on iTunes only work with the iPod , while those downloaded using other services will work on a variety of similar devices .
In September the British Phonographic Industry will launch the first UK national download chart , seen as a precursor to including downloads in the official top 40 .
Record labels hope such a move will help revive the moribund singles chart and shows such as Top of the Pops . ·

2004-08-19,"Back last month when Real Networks said that it was making songs available for download to the iPod after the cracking of Apple 's proprietory code , it was apparent that a conflict was building between the two companies . ""
[ The ] company has been threatening to make this move for a couple of months , ever since he [ Real boss Rob Glaser ] claimed publicly that Apple founder Steve Jobs refused to reply to his emails when he suggested working together on enabling universal digital music compatibility , "" reports MacNewsWorld
Now things have taken a further step .
An online petition from Real has somewhat backfired and now Real is slashing the price of their downloads to 49 cents , effectively stoking up a price war . ""
But the offer wo n't come cheaply for Real Networks .
The company said Tuesday that the campaign could increase its third - quarter loss by a penny per share , "" says CNet .
Comment :
There are serious questions about Digital Rights Management at stake here .
For Apple , the iPod is effectively a loss leader , with the real money to be made from drawing people into the brand .
But should one company really be the only one able to offer iPod downloads ?
Whatever the issues , though , Real has gone off the deep end .
If they really believe that they should take Apple on , surely this is not the best way to go about it .
While Steve Jobs recovers from his cancer operation , Real sticks the boot in , annoys its investors and - ultimately - fails to align itself with public sympathy ."
2004-08-31,"Apple today unveiled the latest incarnation of its iconic iMac computer - a sleek all - in - one machine , barely 2 in thick , which the company is describing as "" the world 's thinnest desktop "" .
Apple executive Phil Schiller , standing in for the chief executive , Steve Jobs - who is recovering from surgery for cancer of the pancreas - made the announcement at the start of the Apple Expo in Paris .
The machine , which was spun out of the stage at the Palais des Congrès at the end of Mr Schiller 's 90-minute presentation , was greeted by huge cheers from the packed auditorium .
The new computer is as wide and a little taller than the size of its screen - either 17 or 20 in - and sits on a slim aluminium base .
The smaller model is less than two inches thick , while the 20-inch model is slightly deeper .
Noting that the machines were around the same dimensions as some flat panel displays alone , Mr Schiller said : "" I think a lot of people will be asking : ' Where has the computer gone ? ' . ""
Speakers are housed on the underside of the unit , reflecting sound off the table on which it sits , and there is enough space under the machine to stow its keyboard and mouse .
The third generation iMac is a return to the all - in - one principle Apple popularised with its Macintosh computer , launched in 1984 .
The first iMac , introduced in 1998 , quickly became seen as a design classic , bringing a colourful and quirky look to computer design for the first time .
Its huge sales helped save California - based Apple at a time when it had only a tiny share of the worldwide PC market , and its looks helped the manufacturer regain its reputation for innovative design - something on which it has subsequently capitalised with iPod music players and laptop computers .
The second - generation iMac , launched in 2002 , incorporated a flat panel display for the first time , balanced on the end of a chrome arm on top of a domed base .
However , it failed to catch the public 's imagination in the same way as its predecessor , and its replacement this year had long been expected .
The entry - level iMac is priced at £ 919 , including VAT , and has a 17 in widescreen display , 1.6GHz 64-bit processor , 80Gb hard drive and a "" combo "" DVD playing , CD read / writing drive built in .
A mid - range model , at £ 1,049 , adds a "" superdrive "" that can write as well as play DVDs .
The top - end model , costing £ 1,349 , adds a 20 in display and a 160Gb hard drive .
All prices include VAT .
During his speech , Mr Schiller also revealed that more than 5 m songs had so far been downloaded from the company 's new iTunes Music Store Europe , and that Apple now had a 70 % market share of all legal music downloads .
Overall , he said , the company had sold more than 100 m songs .
He also previewed a new version of the company 's OSX operating system , due out in the first half of next year , which will feature : · Much improved hard disk search facilities · Enhanced video conferencing · A new version of the Safari web browser , including support for RSS and Atom web feeds for the first time · New means to automate repetitive tasks using an easy - to - program "" visual scripting "" application called Automator ."
2004-09-01,"Apple Computer unveiled the third generation of its iMac range of computers yesterday , showing off machines housed in all - in - one cases that incorporate the processors , disk drives and screen in a box about two inches thick .
The range was unveiled by Phil Schiller , Apple 's head of worldwide product marketing , at the start of the five - day Apple expo show in Paris .
He was deputising for Apple 's chief executive , Steve Jobs , who is recovering from surgery to treat cancer .
Mr Schiller hailed the new iMacs - brilliant white and supported by a curved aluminium arm - as "" the world 's thinnest desktop computers "" .
They come in three configurations and two sizes : two models have 17-inch screens , starting at £ 919 , and there is also a top - end model with a 20-inch display costing £ 1,349 .
Reflecting continuing pressure on pricing in the PC market , the faster , redesigned machines are still cheaper than their predecessors .
Despite Mr Jobs 's absence , Mr Schiller and the slimline iMac received a rapturous welcome from an audience of 4,000 Apple fans in the Palais des Congres .
"" It 's time for a completely new iMac , "" Mr Schiller told the crowd .
As well as bypassing the traditional tower or base unit of most desktop computers , the machines are designed to do away with wires , incorporating Bluetooth wireless technology to eliminate keyboard and mouse wires , and WiFi technology to connect to the internet without a lead .
"" I think a lot of people will be asking ' where has the computer gone ? ' ""
Mr Schiller said .
The new iMacs start shipping from mid - September , and are the latest in a line from Apple that has sold 7.5 m computers since the launch of the first "" bondi blue "" iMac in 1998 .
That launch helped save Apple at a time when years of management blunders and fierce competition from Microsoft saw its market share slump to single digits .
Sales of the second generation iMac - introduced in 2002 with a dome - shaped base and a chrome arm supporting the thin display - had slowed in recent quarters , and Apple 's share price was hit in July when it was forced to admit stocks of that model were being run down ahead of the new machine 's launch .
Despite that , Apple shares have risen from about $ 20 at the end of last year to nearer $ 35 yesterday , aided by strong sales of the company 's pioneering iPod music player , which now holds 58 % of the music player market ."

The studio is setting up its own digital animation studio following the end of its collaboration with Pixar earlier this year , and seems set to produce Toy Story 3 on its own .
Disney had so far refused to produce a second sequel , in deference to Pixar CEO Steve Jobs and Toy Story director John Lasseter , who did not want to lose control of the characters .
However , Tom Hanks looks unlikely to reprise his role as the voice of Woody , citing concern over the authenticity of any new film made without Pixar . ""
The creative team that put together the original Toy Story was very specific and organic to the success of the process .
Not that there are n't other talented people that would be involved [ if another sequel was made ] .
That would be a bridge to cross when I come to it . ""
Tim Allen , who voiced Buzz Lightyear , is perhaps less cautious : "" If [ Disney ] can get the magic that Pixar had , then I do n't think anybody 's going to complain about it . ""

2005-01-06,"Whether you love them , loathe them or remain resolutely indifferent , Macs are more of a cultural phenomenon than a computing platform .
The love of Apple 's computers is such that one of America 's most popular Macintosh magazines is named MacAddict .
Next week San Francisco plays host to the first of four annual Macworld Expo shows at which Apple 's chief executive , Steve Jobs , trundles out the "" next big thing "" for the Macintosh faithful .
Journalist Leander Kahney has made much of Macintosh fanaticism in recent years .
His interest in the subject has spawned a column at Wired News , a blog and now a book : The Cult of Mac .
It is not a serious sociological treatise but rather a sidewards glance at the Mac world , packed with insight and entertaining anecdotes .
Kahney is himself a paid - up member of the religion , but even he is surprised by the lengths which some fans go to - getting Apple tattoos seems extreme until you read about people who sleep in their cars while visiting Macworld or , in one case , dress up as Jobs . ""
The thing about geeks , or anyone with a passion , "" says Kahney , "" is that if they can express that passion , they 're interesting . ""
As with any minority group , identity is an issue and , in this case , it has become bound up with users ' relationship with the object .
But what bonds do this group of people really hold ?
None , according to Kahney : "" I 've met a lot of Mac people and there 's no real archetype , but everyone thinks they 're it .
I 've met retired admirals who are to the right of Adolf Hitler and sandal - wearing Californians .
Both types think they are typical Mac users . ""
One interesting character who makes an appearance in the book is the iBrotha : the late Rodney Lain .
Lain was a controversial columnist who compared Mac users ' experiences to the fight for civil rights in the US .
Not only was Lain a Mac user , but he was a black American and politically rightwing : a minority within a minority who dedicated much of his life to a minority computer .
Lain died in 2002 after a lifelong battle with manic depression , but during his high periods he evangelised the Mac to anyone who would listen .
Despite such love for the corporation , all is not well in the Mac world .
The products which attract the most devotion are unsuccessful machines like the Power Mac Cube or the discontinued Newton PDA .
Now that Apple is the dominant player in one market - digital music players - its users face a strenuous test ... can they love something so mainstream ?
Some believe that Apple will use the Macworld Expo to unveil another product aimed squarely at the masses .
Bruce Horn , one of the original Mac designers , is enthused by the possibility : "" I 'm reading rumours of a sub-$500 Mac .
Would n't that be interesting ? ""
Such a machine would clearly be an attempt to woo iPod - owning Windows users over to the Apple side , but if successful , the Mac would lose much of its cachet . ""
Whatever Jobs unveils during his keynote speech , the move toward the mainstream is assured .
Apple has already announced a deal with Motorola to put the iTunes download service onto the company 's mobile phones - likely to be the first of many such partnerships - and the distinctly dull PC manufacturer HP is already selling iPods .
According to Kahney , the cult of the Mac will survive : "" A lot of it is about Steve Jobs .
He 's a contrarian .
He literally flew a pirate flag at Apple . ""
The Mac cult comes down to exactly that sort of contrariness - but Apple 's increasing success may mean Mac users having to face the reality that their beloved machines are simply tools and Apple is just another corporation , no more or less worthy of devotion than any other ."
2005-01-10,"I expect Bobbie will be able to pick up a copy of US magazine VAR Business , which seems to be targeting MacWorld with its latest issue .
It has a picture of cheeky - looking Steve Jobs on the cover with the headline Bad Apple . ""
Under the leadership of Steve Jobs , Apple 's ever - expanding ambitions have put it on a collision course with partners , some of whom have witnessed the demise of their livelihoods .
Think they 're feeling burned ?
You bet .
Here are their stories , "" says the blurb for the story , here .
It 's no secret that Apple 's approach is wiping out Apple dealers , who , in the VAR article , complain that they ca n't get the stock they need to compete , and then Apple undercuts them on price .
It also refers to a Web site , TellOnApple.org , which says it was "" created by a group of former Apple Authorized Resellers as a means to document and share any unethical or illegal business practices of Apple Computer , Inc. """
2005-01-11,"So , it went pretty much as expected here when Steve Jobs rolled out the keynote speech for the Macworld conference .
We were n't given wi - fi access inside the main conference room itself , which prevented me from blogging the announcements in real time , but if you want to see exactly what was put out on stage , take a look at the Apple website The big products , hardware - wise were the MacMini - the monitorless unit that had been codenamed Q88 in pre - show speculation - and the flash - based iPod Shuffle , a dinky little unit that is intended to break the lower end of the market .
MacMini :
Jobs : ""
This is the most affordable Mac ever .
In fact it 's the cheapest computer Apple has ever offered .
"" It 's tiny ( around 6""x2 "" ) but comes without any peripherals at all , in a move which Jobs termed "" BYODKM "" ( Bring Your Own Desktop Mouse and Keyboard ) .
It was eerily reminiscent of the ill - fated Cube , but perhaps Apple feel that the price point ( $ 499 for the cheapest , 40 GB model ) was the most important thing .
Personally , I 'm disappointed that they did n't use this opportunity to move into Media Center territory and are instead focusing on converting existing PC users and getting them into the Mac fold .
iPod Shuffle :
Steve gave a warning to the rest of the digital music player market when he pointed out iPod 's figures .
"" A year ago iPod 's market share was about 31 % and flash players had 62 % .
We introduced the iPod Mini to go after the high end of the flash market .
By January 2005 , the iPod 's market share has doubled to 65 % and flash has halved .
But we 'd like to go after the remaining mainstream flash market . ""
And this little model is what they want to do that .
No screen , and wearable ( either pendant - style , sport armband etc )
, it 's probably going to be a much more important product to Apple in terms of volume than the MacMini .
It comes in sizes of 512 MB and 1 GB - not 2 GB , which disappointed those of us who had thought it might be on the cards , and costs either $ 99 or $ 149 .
Contrary to rumours before the show , it * can * play designated playlists as well as on random , so it 's not going to annoy music fanatics too much .
Steve also demonstrated the new iLife , iWork and OSX Tiger - all building on existing products really .
One big surprise was when he wheeled out the president of Sony , Kunitake Ando , to talk about the dual push from the firms to promote HDTV over the next year .
Two rivals getting together to promote a standard was an interesting twist that I had n't anticipated .
But then apparently neither had
Jobs - Ando said he 'd only got the invite to turn up and speak at the weekend .
The crowd were behaving in their usual over - excited manner ( people running to get seats , whooping with delight all the way through , laughing at jokes that were n't even funny ) but that 's the way Apple does things , I suppose .
Strange , when you consider they 're just a technology firm , but there 's a kind of giddy excitement that passes around most of the arena in waves .
Anyway , those are the big announcements .
I 'll write more later - time to go and look around the stands ."
2005-01-11,"One of the most amusing moments , for me anyway , of the keynote was Steve Jobs talking about the Apple store in London .
Not the store so much as the gasps and astonished sounds of astonished wonderment coming from the throng as Jobs showed them the Regent Street store - followed by , of course , spontaneous rapture when Steve said it was the biggest Apple store in the world and that it was already the second - biggest selling store they had .
And is n't that just great ?
A point of interest : he also said Apple was planning to open new stores across the UK over the coming year ."
2005-01-12,"Few technology companies inspire as much excitement , devotion or speculation as Apple Computer , maker of the bestselling iPod digital music player .
The launch of Apple 's retail store in London in November brought out thousands of fans and yesterday even more turned out to witness the company unveil its latest gizmo : a smaller iPod aimed at the mass market .
The iPod Shuffle , which comes with the slogan "" Life is random "" , was launched at the Macworld conference in San Francisco by Apple 's chief executive , Steve Jobs , marking a shift by the company towards low - cost products .
"" We wanted to make something that 's even easier to use than the iPod , "" Mr Jobs told an enraptured audience at the Moscone conference centre , a short distance from the company 's headquarters in Cupertino , California .
"" Something happened in the iPod market - people discovered a new way to listen to their music that became the most popular way to listen to your music : shuffle . ""
Rather than selecting what tracks to listen to , users can select the shuffle setting on their machines and allow songs to be played from their collection randomly .
After years of cultivating an exclusive image by sticking to high prices , the success of the iPod - 4.5 m of which sold over the 2004 holiday season - has driven Apple to reconsider its strategy and enter the lower - priced end of the technology market .
"" We think it 's going to bring tons of people into this new era of digital music , "" Mr Jobs said .
"" We 're going to see some healthy progress in the next year . ""
The screenless , palm - sized white unit - which will initially sell for between $ 99 ( £ 53 ) and $ 149 in the US - will be available in Europe shortly at a likely cost of around £ 100 .
Based on inexpensive solid - state technology , the Shuffle has a smaller capacity than its larger cousins - storing between 100 and 250 songs - but could help the iPod explode in the same way the Sony Walkman did in the 80s by bringing down the price into the reach of mainstream consumers .
At the conference most of the buzz seemed to be about the new iPod . ""
If I take my full - size iPod into school I have lots of hassle with wires and stuff , "" said Hunter Siegel , 16 , from Denver , Colorado.""There 's none of that with Shuffle .
The only problem is that the battery life is only 12 hours - it could be better . ""
Many focused on the fact that users could wear it like a pendant .
Stacie Yamaki , from San Mateo , California , said : "" It 's so small you can even wear it .
They 're really neat .
"" The company also confirmed speculation by launching a low - cost home computer aimed at converting PC users to the Macintosh platform .
The tiny white MacMini , which is set to sell for $ 499 in the US , comes without a monitor , mouse or keyboard and is aimed at those looking to replace their existing machine but initial consumer enthusiasm yesterday seemed more muted than for the Shuffle .
The MacMini will be seen as part of a long - term strategy to increase Apple 's share of the home computing market .
Apple hopes the iPod Shuffle and MacMini will boost its profits further after a bumper year in which company 's revenues were up by 34 % ."
2005-01-13,"America might be struggling to understand the freak weather that has brought torrential rain and snow to the west coast , but it could n't stop a whirlwind rolling in as Apple chief Steve Jobs revealed his ambitious plans for the year at the Macworld conference in San Francisco , California .
Giving the show 's keynote speech to a typically overenthusiastic crowd , Jobs confirmed weeks of rumour by unveiling a tiny , cheap Macintosh computer dubbed the MacMini , aimed at drawing millions more users into the company 's brand . ""
This is the most affordable Mac ever , "" Jobs told the conference .
"" It 's the cheapest computer Apple has ever offered . ""
The MacMini , which will retail in two models - a 40 GB hard disk for $ 499 or 80 GB for $ 599 - is aimed at providing a less expensive way for some of the estimated 6 m iPod users to choose an Apple home computer .
The high premium for Apple exclusivity had left the Cupertino - based firm struggling to make a strong play in the home computer market against lower cost PC manufacturers such as Dell .
"" We like to call it BYODKM - Bring Your Own Display , Keyboard and Mouse , "" Jobs said , claiming that "" people who are thinking of switching have no excuses "" .
Also served up was the Flash - based iPod Shuffle , aimed at the lower end of the music player market .
The Shuffle will come in 512 MB ( $ 99 ) and 1 GB models ( $ 149 ) .
To reduce size , the unit does not have a screen and will be primed to play music on a random setting - and is aimed at people who like the prestige of an Apple product but not the price .
Its launch is being accompanied by the slogan "" Life is random "" . ""
A year ago , iPod 's market share was about 31 % and Flash players had 62 % .
We introduced the iPod Mini to go after the high end of the Flash market .
By January 2005 , the iPod 's market share has doubled to 65 % and Flash has halved .
But we 'd like to go after the remaining mainstream Flash market . ""
The iPod Shuffle is really tiny : the headphones plug in the top and it is smaller than most packs of gum . ""
It weighs less than an ounce , "" Jobs continued .
"" You can shuffle your music , listen to your songs in a million different ways , or by flipping a switch in the back , you can listen to a playlist . ""
Despite the smaller capacity , Flash - based players are cheaper to produce and more reliable than their larger cousins .
The combination of no screen and solid - state Flash technology means the Shuffle will be more durable , and Apple is likely to initially target children and sports fans .
Jobs will be hoping that Apple 's dominance of the digital music market through iPod and the iTunes Online Music Store - which has sold in excess of 230 m tracks - will draw more people into the Apple brand .
He chose not to broadcast his speech simultaneously on the internet , but was in ebullient mood as he announced a raft of hardware and software releases .
"" We have a lot of people making accessories for the iPod , we have an incredible iPod economy out there .
This is unmatched in the industry by a mile .
We think it 's going to bring tons of people into this new era of digital music . ""
Jobs ' usually slick keynote routine suffered a few technical errors , but he still squeezed in a few pops at Microsoft - saying that the next OS X update , Tiger , is on target for release in the first half of 2005 ... ""
Long before Longhorn "" .
Rumours of the MacMini and Shuffle had been circulating on the internet after the website ThinkSecret ( www.thinksecret.com ) published a leaked report of a sub-$500 "" headless "" Macintosh .
Apple last week took legal action against the site for what it claims was a breach of commercial confidentiality by an employee .
The one surprise was when Jobs wheeled out Sony president Kunitake Ando , to discuss their close relationship in promoting High Definition TV .
Putting aside traditional rivalries , the pair put forward plans to turn HDTV into a mainstream home product through a combination of hardware and software .
Other releases included upgrades to existing hardware , an iTunes - compatible Motorola phone and an office software suite , iWork .
The Motorola phone , which had been trailed at the CES show last week , had not been seen until Jobs whipped one out of his pocket .
At first glance it appeared in keeping with Motorola 's typical style - a GSM model that can be connected to your computer to upload tunes , while an on - screen iTunes interface allows users to manage the music and even download tracks on to the XGB / MB memory .
Not quite the iPhone some were expecting - and 3 G capability would have helped - but it is an indication of things to come .
On show at Expo Mac OSX Tiger : the upcoming release has more than 200 applications , including : Spotlight , a desktop search tool , desktop widget manager Dashboard ( stock tracker , weather reports , dictionary etc ) , and an updated iChat , including a good - looking , four - way video conferencing facility .
iLife 05 : updates of Apple 's digital media applications including iPhoto , iMovie , iDVD , Garageband and iTunes .
iWork : includes Keynote 2 and pages , a word processor with limited desktop publishing abilities .

2005-01-16,"Last Tuesday saw the enactment of a venerable twice - yearly ritual - the unveiling of new Apple products at the Macworld Expo in San Francisco by the company 's mercurial CEO , Steve Jobs .
At first sight , it seemed to follow the time - honoured pattern : weeks of fevered pre - release speculation ( some of it no doubt seeded by Apple 's inventive PR machine ) ; Jobs on stage in black turtleneck and jeans ; hysterical applause from the assembled Mac enthusiasts ; a confident , jokey presentation - to be followed by interminable commentary in the business and technical press along the lines of ' lovely products , pity about the market share ' .
This time it was slightly different , in two respects .
The first was that the post - presentation commentary suddenly became more reverential .
And the strange thing was that this was n't just due to the revelation that Apple 's first - quarter earnings had quadrupled because of runaway sales of the iPod music player .
Apple earned $ 295 million , or 70 cents per share , on revenues of $ 3.49 billion , easily surpassing Wall Street 's expectations of 49 cents a share on revenues of $ 3.19bn .
Over 4.5 million iPods were sold in the last three months of 2004 - which is more than double the previous quarter 's figure .
This is big news , of course , but it was predictable given Apple 's success at establishing the iPod as the iconic successor to the Sony Walkman .
Like a brilliant general who spots a strategic opening and exploits it for all it 's worth , Jobs had capitalised on the iPod as a way of reinventing Apple , and indeed had restructured the company into two major divisions , one based on iPod and media products generally , the other centred on the original core business - computing .
Until last week , the consensus in Wall Street was that Apple would metamorphose into a media products company making delicious high - margin gadgets of the iPod type .
But then came the second bombshell .
Apple 's sales of computers surged to $ 1.6bn , up 26 per cent from a year ago at a time when most personal computer manufacturers are struggling .
This has already been christened ' the iPod halo effect ' but in fact is merely confirmation of Jobs 's intuition that the popularity of the iPod with new generations of users would lead them to think that a computer made by the same company might be something worth having .
Jobs unveiled two products on Tuesday , both of which are clear pointers to where Apple intends to go next .
The first was a tiny version of the iPod called the iPod Shuffle .
This is a radically pruned version of the iPod with no screen and no hard drive - and therefore limited storage .
The cheapest model , priced at £ 69 , has 512 MB of flash storage ( enough for 120 songs ) ; a bigger model costing £ 99 holds twice that number .
The absence of a screen means that you can drive the device in only two ways : either by playing through tracks sequentially , or by letting the player ' shuffle ' tracks at random - hence the curious name .
The significance of the iPod
Shuffle is that Apple , having captured the high - end market for expensive , hard - drive players , is now moving to attack the segment of the market which , up to now , has been the exclusive preserve of MP3 and PC - docking players .
This is a radical - and risky - strategy , because it 's very difficult to make money from cheap hardware and it 's a market that Apple knows nothing about .
It 's a bit like BMW deciding to take on the Ford Ka .
The rationale behind it , however , may be that if the millions of teenagers who can not afford high - end iPods get their hands on Apple products , sales from Apple 's iTunes online music store will increase - and the ' halo ' effect may also boost sales of Macs .
The other product unveiled by Jobs is much more interesting .
It 's the Mac Mini - a tiny compact version of an Apple Macintosh computer in an elegant box not much bigger than a standard hard drive .
The fact that it comes without a screen , keyboard or mouse may lead some to conclude that Apple has finally lost the plot .
But a moment 's reflection suggests that it 's actually very ingenious .
The Mac Mini may be small , but inside is an eerily quiet , powerful , fully - fledged computer with an industry - strength operating system , together with all Apple 's multimedia software , a DVD drive and every connection you could need for cameras , networks and music players .
And it 's cheap - £ 339 in the UK .
So if you want to upgrade your existing system , you simply throw away that clunky system box that sits under your desk whining like a vacuum cleaner and just plug your existing screen , keyboard and mouse into the Mac Mini .
And Hey Presto !
You 've got yourself a brand new Apple .
You can see where this is heading .
Increasing numbers of PC users , especially non - technical ones , are finding that their Windows - based computers are becoming a bind because they require regular downloading of security upgrades and patches - not to mention expensive anti - virus services .
Although PCs can be used to store music and photographs , edit movies and create DVDs , the software available for these purposes on the Windows platform is generally inferior to that bundled by Apple with the Macintosh .
Above all , the PC is a clunky , ugly technology which looks increasingly out of place in modern living rooms .
It 's the computing equivalent of a Korean car .
But up to now , it 's been difficult to change to another platform without throwing everything out and starting again .
The Mac Mini threatens to change that .
By launching it , Steve Jobs has effectively parked his tanks not just on Microsoft 's lawn but also in the lush parkland hitherto owned by Intel .
They wo n't take it lying down .
There are interesting times ahead , folks . john.naughton@observer.co.uk"
2005-01-16,"While the likes of Apple 's Steve Jobs enjoy rock - star status , a quiet American with ungeeky good looks and a passion for classical music is driving the company which has a more genuine claim to world computer domination .
Kevin Rollins is the violin - playing , alpine - skiing and motorcycling chief executive of Dell - a man who will apparently not rest until there is a PC in every home on the planet .
Dell is the world 's biggest PC manufacturer - 18 per cent of the market compared to Apple 's 3 per cent - and has ridden out a three - year downturn in the industry to reach a worth of $ 50 billion ( £ 26.75bn ) , with limitless expansion plans .
Reclining in an unostentatious conference room at Dell 's no - frills headquarters in Austin , Texas , Rollins outlined the scope of his ambition . '
We own 18 per cent of the PC business , ' he said . '
Is it conceivable to double the size of that business ?
Yes : 36 per cent market share is not irrational .
That would take us from this year , $ 50 billion , to $ 100 billion just like that . '
We believe that as a company we have to grow globally , in France and Germany and the UK , but also in India and China .
We 're not in Africa yet , but the same would apply . '
Bill Gates 's building of the Microsoft software behemoth is the stuff of legend and his nearest hardware equivalent was Michael Dell , who started the firm in his University of Texas dorm room in 1984 .
But , like Gates , Dell last year gave up the chief executive post while remaining chairman , handing the crown to Rollins , who at 52 is some 12 years his senior . '
I did n't seek the position , which is maybe a little unique in our industry , ' Rollins said . '
Bill Gates , Steve Jobs
, Michael Dell are in a class by themselves : they 're founders , they 've been very successful .
My desire for recognition is very , very small : I have a suppressed ego when it comes to a need for fame . '
Rollins is a classically trained violinist and performs three or four concerts a year .
Active in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , he is known as a family man who makes time for his wife , Debra , and their three children . '
I 'm also a big alpine skier and I race motocross motorcycles , which is maybe a strange juxtaposition with the classical violin , ' he said .
Rollins , who grew up in Provo , Utah , and joined Dell in 1996 , is a voracious reader , saying he finds inspiration from biographies of famous politicians and leaders ."
2005-01-16,"Clad in black , a lone figure on stage wielded icons , spoke of their mysteries and whipped up the 4,000-strong crowd into ecstasy .
Apple has always inspired religious devotion and , last week , as its chief executive , Steve Jobs , preached to the converted with revelations of a new iPod and Mac , the cult had never seemed more powerful .
But the status that Apple has long enjoyed as a friend of the people - David to the corporate Goliath of Microsoft - is set to be sorely tested in the American courts .
Apple has launched a legal suit against a fan website for giving away trade secrets by revealing the launch of its £ 339 ' Macintosh computer for the masses before the Mac Mini was formally announced by Jobs at last week 's Macworld event in San Francisco .
The move has shaken some of Apple 's most fanatical supporters to the core .
They say the company has previously been content to bask in internet gossip and speculation , giving its Mac computers and iPod digital music players the sort of publicity money ca n't buy .
But when one website , Think Secret , obtained a leak about the cut - price Mac and the scoop was followed up by media around the world , Jobs decided to play hardball .
The online community of Apple devotees , one of the most vibrant in cyberspace , is humming with a sense of betrayal and talk that the worm will finally turn .
Speaking from San Francisco , Leander Kahney , author of the book Cult of Mac , said : ' Apple is biting the hands that feed it and there is a risk they will turn against it .
Apple is seen as this hippie , friendly , alternative - living company , yet it 's setting the legal attack dogs on people . '
It is heavy - handed and counter to the image of the brand .
Apple has used its customers as a marketing vehicle for about 10 years .
Some have spent weekends in Apple stores as unofficial salesmen , or phoned schools urging them to buy Macs for pupils .
Apple has always relied on that loyalty , but now it risks alienating a lot of people .
By launching a lawsuit , it is also reinforcing and validating the speculation about the cut - price Mac .
Which , of course , is another way of creating more press . '
Apple would lose the case if it ever came to court , but is counting on scaring the wits out of the poor kid who runs this site .
It is obsessively secretive and this guy is on an amazing run : he 's had a lot of scoops this year and they do get chased up by the media . '
Think Secret also recently broke news of a flash memory - based iPod , confirmed when Jobs announced the iPod Shuffle , starting at £ 69 and no bigger than a packet of chewing gum .
The Shuffle plays the user 's selection of downloads in order or randomly .
The site 's editor - in - chief , who uses the pseudonym Nick dePlume , said via email : ' We 're confident that Think Secret 's reporting is consistent with the rights protected by the First Amendment .
The complaint is being reviewed , and Think Secret defers further comment until it has been analysed . '
Kasper Jade , editor - in - chief of another fan site , Apple Insider , said : ' Apple is an intuitive and intriguing company with an enthusiastic following who are passionate about the company itself , its technology , Macs , and now the iPod .
And while Apple does not necessarily publicly condone the free publicity generated by rumour sites , its actions appear to be a desperate attempt to control the marketplace and silence journalists . '
Apple was defended by Dylan Jones , editor of GQ magazine and the author of a forthcoming book , iPod
Therefore I Am . '
It 's a simple case of a company trying to protect its interests , ' he said .
' There is so much riding on these events in terms of PR that anyone would be irritated by details getting out in advance . '
They have enjoyed the free publicity in the past , but this leak was so specific that it represented a serious breach of security . '
Apple is a mass market cult because it makes beautiful products .
It has an awful lot of press attention because of that .
But it has also gone through times when the press was very critical , and the fans and devotees and lunatics love Apple in spite of itself . '
Apple has sold more than 10 million iPods since the product 's launch in 2001 , including a spectacular 4.6 m in the most recent retailing quarter .
But as some hail the company 's march as unstoppable , rival computer giants such as Dell insist there is a longer - term view .
Kevin Rollins , Dell 's chief executive , told The Observer : ' Those things that become fads rage , then drop off .
When I was growing up , there was a product made by Sony called the Walkman .
A rage : everyone had to have one .
You do n't hear about Walkman any more .
In fact , after two or three years you did n't hear about it , so I believe that one - product wonders come and go , but you have to have sustainable business models , sustainable strategy . '
Right now it [ the iPod ] is very hot , but I do n't think there 's anyone who believes that in three years or so it 's going to be at the same level of fever pitch that it 's at today .
Everybody gets one , then it 's done and then it 's what 's next ,
what 's the next exciting technology ? '
Do n't read that as any disparagement of Apple - they 've done a nice job . '
In keeping with tradition , Steve Jobs was yesterday unavailable for comment ."

2005-01-25,"Twenty - one years ago yesterday , the Apple Mac was launched .
A collective of German Mac fans has digitised the only surviving video tape of the launch .
The recording features all the often - told moments of the launch - from Steve Jobs 's bow tie ( how diferent from the jeans and black turtlenext of today ) to the moment he pulls the Mac from the bag , and the huge grin he casts at the assembled early Church of Mac at the now - demolished Flint Center in Cupertino .
Until yesterday the video has never been seen online .
But now it 's available on several mirror Web sites ( list here ) .
In my book I wrote about my own first encounter with the Mac .
I 've just dug out what I wrote .
Here it is : "" The venue was a stuffy conference suite ringed with tables covered in green baize .
On each table stood an astonishing little machine with a nine - inch screen and a detached keyboard .
Compared with the clunky , three - box design which then represented the industry 's idea of what a personal computer should look like , these elegant little machines seemed , well , just gorgeous .
I could n't wait to get my hands on one .
After an initial spiel by the Apple crowd , we were let loose on the machines .
They had been set up , for some unfathomable reason , displaying a picture of a fish .
It was , in fact , a MacPaint file .
I remember staring at the image , marvelling at the way the scales and fins seemed as clear as if they had been etched on the screen .
After a time I picked up courage , clicked on the ' lassoo ' tool and selected a fin with it .
The lassoo suddenly began to shimmer .
I held down the mouse button and moved the rodent gently .
The fin began to move across the screen !
Then I pulled down the Edit menu , and selected Cut .
The fin disappeared .
Finally I closed the file , confirmed the decision in the dialog box , and reloaded the fish from disk .
As the image reappeared I experienced what James Joyce would call an epiphany :
I remember thinking , this is the way it has to be .
I felt what Douglas Adams later described as ' that kind of roaring , tingling , floating sensation ' which characterised his first experience of MacPaint .
In the blink of an eye -- the time it took to retrieve the fish from disk -- all the DECwriter teletypes and dumb terminals and character - based displays which had been essential parts of my computing experience were consigned to the scrapyard .
I had suddenly seen the point -- and the potential -- of computer graphics .
All this was Bill Atkinson 's doing .
In the circumstances , to call him a programmer is like calling Christian Dior a dressmaker .
Atkinson is in fact a genius , or at the very least an artist whose medium just happens to be software . ""
Note for non - Macintosh folks : Bill Atkinson was the programmer who wrote MacPaint .
He later wrote HyperCard .
Not many people change the world twice in one lifetime ."
2005-02-06,"Yet another article complaining about the outpourings of vitriolic abuse and stupidity with which the Mac "" faithful "" respond to anything that 's less than unstinting in its praise for all things Apple , this time in Silicon.com .
The MacLoonies are a small minority , of course , but It 's this minority that seems to be under some form of mass hypnosis - perhaps some far - reaching extension of Steve Jobs ' ' reality distortion field ' - thinking that Apple can do no wrong and is a panacea for all the IT wrongs in the world .
Even if this were true , it 's the wrong way to get the message across .
As the article notes : The collective moral outrage does Apple evangelists , and by extension the company itself , no favours .
The vitriol seems particularly misplaced in online forums read worldwide by thousands of senior technology professionals and business decision makers holding the IT purse strings .
Apart from anything else , it 's odd , because large numbers of journalists are Mac users , and give Apple far more coverage -- and far more favourable coverage -- than it could reasonably expect .
But even Mac fans such as the Wall Street Journal 's Walt Mossberg have suffered torrents of abuse .
Fans of minority and/or failing systems sometimes overcompensate -- we 've seen it with the Amiga and OS/2 in particular .
However , in this case , Apple must bear some of the responsibility .
In the Mac 's early days , ace marketing man Guy Kawasaki -- the first real IT evangelist -- ran an Evangelist mailing list that drew attention to the sins of any journalists who failed to toe the Apple party line .
This often led to them being deluged with hate mail .
Being a smart guy , Kawasaki figured out that this was doing Apple more harm than good and eventually he closed the list .
Unfortunately , once this kind of idiocy had got going , it never stopped .
And given Steve Jobs 's congenital arrogance and apparent need to be worshipped , it 's hard to imagine the company trying to do anything about it .
Indeed , Jobs appears at MacWorld and plays to the crowd .
The Linux movement has its share of nutters , too , but Linus Torvalds just laughs at them , and they 've become increasingly marginalised .
But of course , Torvalds is actually leading a revolution , rather than marketing an off - the - shelf lifestyle choice ."
2005-02-11,"For many it was already over , but any chances of a reconciliation were dampened yesterday when Pixar chief Steve Jobs said that his blockbuster animation company would not renew their deal with Disney next year .
Over the course of a 10-year relationship Disney has co - produced and distributed all six Pixar features from Toy Story in 1995 to current smash The Incredibles , which have earned more than $ 3billion in worldwide ticket sales .
However Jobs is known to be dissatisfied with a profit - share arrangement in which Pixar and Disney split revenues 50 - 50 after Disney takes a hefty distribution fee .
Reporting strong fourth quarter 2004 earnings that were largely attributable to the success of The Incredibles and excellent sales of Finding Nemo on DVD , Variety says Jobs told investors it was "" likely we will not forge a new relationship with Disney beyond our current deal . ""
The Pixar - Disney collaboration ended in January 2004 and talks to extend the relationship broke off , leaving Pixar free to talk to other distributors once it delivered its seventh and final picture , Cars .
Disney recently put back the release of Cars from November 2005 to June 2006 .
Every Hollywood studio has been courting Pixar , whose world - beating stable of artists , writers and directors is akin to gold dust in a town where critical accolades and commercial success rarely go hand - in - hand .
Under the existing agreement , Disney retains rights to distribute Pixar 's first seven films and Pixar will continue to receive earnings on those titles .
Disney is also allowed to produce sequels to any of those pictures on its own if Pixar chooses not to take part .
Jobs indicated a decision on a new distribution partner was likely towards the end of the year , when Pixar would also unveil its first lineup of post - Disney titles with an eventual target of two releases each year .
Meanwhile Disney animators are currently working on Toy Story 3 without Pixar 's input .
When asked why Pixar did n't want to get involved , Jobs told investors : "" The question is : Should we fill the previous slots in our production schedule with sequels on which we will earn only 50 % of the profits and will be forever controlled by Disney ? ""
Or should we fill it with original Pixar films , on which we will earn 100 % of the profits , fully own and control ? ""
While a reunion with Pixar is not on the cards , negotiations with Disney 's other troubled partnership , Miramax Films , have taken a brighter turn .
Recent talks to renew the contract between Miramax co - founders Bob and Harvey Weinstein and their parent company have taken a more conciliatory tone with negotiations set to conclude at the end of this month .
The Weinstein brothers ' contract is up in September and their recent successes such as The Aviator and Finding Neverland give Miramax new leverage in the deal ."
2005-02-20,""" If you want to spread bad news about Napster Inc. , just tell Steve Jobs .
The Apple Computer Inc. chief executive sent an e - mail Tuesday morning to top record industry executives , alerting them to a security gap in Napster 's music service -- a rival to Apple 's iTunes online store , "" reports the LA Times .
""
Napster CEO Chris Gorog sent the labels a retort Tuesday afternoon , arguing that such copying programs were neither new nor a problem only for Napster . ""
By contrast , he said , it is ' trivial ' to download a free program that circumvents Apple 's anti - piracy software and unlocks ' a large collection of iTunes music in seconds . '
He provided the Web address of a site that supplied such a program . ""
Comment :
Pretty funny for Stevie boy to complain about Napster considering Apple released a program that stripped out its own FairPlay DRM -- iMovie -- and when everyone knows you can remove it by burning to a CD and re - ripping it .
Jobs must be more worried about Napster than we thought ...."
2005-03-16,"Motorola bosses have said that the iTunes phone launch was not hit because networks were n't interested , but that Apple did n't want them to trail a new product , according to Reuters .
In response to a question about why Motorola did not show its upcoming iTunes phone at the Cebit technology fair in Germany Motorola said it tends to display its products before they go on the market but Apple 's Chief Executive Steve Jobs does not . ""
The first thing you 're seeing here is a merger of two different industries with different ideas of launching products , "" Ron Garriques , president of Motorola 's mobile phone division told analysts and reporters at a news conference at the CTIA U.S. wireless show in New Orleans . ""
Steve 's perspective is that you launch a product on Sunday and sell it on Monday . "" he added .
He also downplayed a question about whether the reason Motorola did not unveil the phones at Cebit was because of a disagreement with mobile phone carriers .
"" I 've got lots of carriers fighting to be the first one we go with , "" Garriques said in an interview .
Different businesses , different practices : but are we getting the whole story on this launch ?"
2005-03-16,"It is well known in techie circles that the cool , shiny peel encasing Apple Computer has , for some time now , obscured an ugly core of corporate paranoia .
The company 's instinct is for opacity rather than transparency , for proprietary control rather than open collaboration .
It is widely assumed that this mindset is born of Steve Jobs ' years spent battling Microsoft and others , keeping Apple on the computing fringe for so long .
But wherever it comes from , none of this sits comfortably with those achingly hip , design - conscious products .
Still , the peel has come right off this week after a California judge decided that Apple has been right to argue that three web - based journalists who published details of new Apple products should be forced to reveal their sources .
The ruling declared that articles in two online publications , Apple Insider and PowerPage , contained "" stolen property "" in the form of trade secrets .
Crucially , the judge went on to say : "" Defining what is a ' journalist ' has become more complicated as the variety of media has expanded .
But even if [ web - based writers ] are journalists , this is not the equivalent of a free pass . ""
Predictably , this has caused a wave of protest and debate in the US over the effect on legitimate business journalism - was Enron 's off - balance sheet funding structure a "" trade secret "" , for instance ?
And , in a nation of compulsive bloggers , the scope for copycat legal action from corporations seeking to shut down their critics would appear to be enormous .
But while the American media can probably be left to fight its own corner , it remains a mystery as to why Apple should so actively seek to alienate the people who are its fans and customers .
Apple is seen here as trying to crush the little guys - which is rather rich , given Apple 's historical place in the computing hierarchy .
Corporate secrets leak , that 's corporate life .
Using the courts to suppress information simply puts a premium on that information and will encourage the moles within Apple to double their efforts .
Suddenly this company is asking to be loathed and subverted - which does n't seem to make much business sense .
Smuggling gun Tobacco smuggling , like smuggling of alcohol and fuel , is running at an unacceptable level , said the Treasury select committee yesterday .
It 's a fair point , and the committee produced a mass of well - sourced statistics .
But get this : according to something called Retailers Against Smuggling , 26 % of independent retailers are considering closing their business because of tobacco smuggling .
Really ?
It is hard to believe , and only partly because Retailers Against Smuggling is funded entirely by the Tobacco Manufacturers Association .
Membership for the 18,000 corner shops is free .
So it would be understandable if there is a tendency to say what the tobacco barons might want to hear .
But the 26 % claim looks shakiest when measured against another of Retailers Against 's numbers .
Though the press release fails to make the basic distinction between turnover and profits , it turns out that the organisation reckons £ 1,000 is the average lost weekly sales per outlet .
So what 's the profit margin on a packet of smokes ?
Tobacco is notoriously low margin , but if the rate were 4 % , then we 're talking £ 40 of lost profit a week , plus a few quid for lost add - on sales like newspapers .
Yes , £ 50 might be a matter of life or death for some corner shops - but 26 % of them ?
If they 're really thinking of throwing in the towel then the causes are likely to be far more complex .
Chief among them would be the advance by Tesco and Sainsbury 's into local neighbourhoods .
That threat , of course , can also be an opportunity : the big boys are paying serious bucks for decent premises .
None of which is to deny there is pain for some corner shops , but you have to worry when 73 % apparently say the way to prevent smuggling is to freeze or reduce duties .
Do n't these people know there 's a National Health Service to fund ?
RSVP Jean - François Théodore , the usually urbane boss of Euronext , gave us an illustration yesterday of how dull the financial world has become under the current regulatory lock - down .
At a public presentation of year - end figures from this French - led alliance of continental exchanges , there was a blanket refusal to discuss the one issue people want answers on : namely Euronext 's putative bid for the London Stock Exchange .
Instead , all we got was some flannel about Euronext listening to its shareholders and really caring about things like corporate governance .
This typically gallic institution is promising , for example , to adopt a much more Anglo - Saxon approach to boardroom matters : investors are even promised the novelty of a vote on the re - election of directors .
But quite why Théodore can not discuss his ambitions for the LSE , when the matter is so clearly in the public domain , remains a mystery .
We can only conclude that he does not have answers to the umpteen questions hanging over Euronext 's strategy and finances ."

2005-04-25,"Apple 's new version of OSX , Tiger , arrives later this week - and there 's no surprise that the claws are out from Microsoft ( and the media ) .
Macworld UK cribs a piece from Newsweek : Microsoft 's Windows Vice President Jim Allchin has dismissed Mac OS X 10.4 as "" a peripheral to the iPod "" while admitting that the constant delay in shipping Longhorn ( the code - name for the next Microsoft OS ) is "" a problem , "" Newsweek reports in a look at the intensification of competition between Apple and Microsoft regarding operating systems .
Allchin also suggested features such as Tiger 's Dashboard feature were inspired by Longhorn - a charge Apple CEO Steve Jobs rejects : "" We 've been showing pieces of Tiger for 18 months , "" Jobs says , insisting that all of Apple 's ideas came from within Apple . ""
And you can be assured all these things have plenty of patent protection , "" he added .
Jobs added : "" Microsoft has followed our taillights for a long time .
Maybe [ in the ' 90s ] we stopped innovating for a while , but now they 've been copying OS X the same way they copied Mac . ""
If there 's anything less tedious than the constant releases of operating systems , it 's the constant rehashes of old argument between the system creators .
Guys , listen to me ...
I Do n't Care .
If it 's good , people buy it , people copy it , people come up with new ideas .
There 's nothing that enthuses me less about a new system than listening to the whining from all concerned .
That said , Tiger does look like it has some interesting features .

2005-04-28,"Fantastic story of control freakery from Apple in today 's Independent .
The company has tried to veto an unofficial biography of Steve Jobs , even to the point of dropping other books by the author , Jeffrey Young ( left ) , from being carried in Apple stores .
It is not exactly clear what in the book is so upsetting to Apple , although even the title is double - edged .
iCon , Steve Jobs :
The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business is expected to be published within the next few weeks and has been written by Jeffrey Young with William Simon .
It does include passages about Mr Jobs ' struggle and recovery from cancer and his divorce .
He is notoriously secretive about his private life .
The trouble started after John Wiley dispatched a proof version of the book to Apple headquarters in Cupertino , California , with the simple request that the company survey it for any factual mistakes .
According to Mr Young , the company 's response was blunt .
We do n't like any of it and we demand that you cancel its publication .
But Wiley decided to stand behind the book and its author .
It was then that other publications by Wiley began to vanish from the shelves of Apple 's 104 retail outlets worldwide .
Whoops ."
2005-05-04,"A piece in today 's Wall Street Journal ( Europe ) by the publisher of Forbes magazine , Rich Karlgaard , makes an interesting case study of St Eve of Jobs , the Apple man who I ca n't seem to stop writing about at the moment ( this is the last one , I promise ) .
I think the article 's subscription only ( here is a link to WSJ.com )
so I 'm going to crib it and distill it down to the most important bits .
It begins with a rather strong opening gambit : "" The greatness of American democratic capitalism can be summed up in two words : Steve Jobs "" .
But there is , always has been , a dark side to his genius .
Once again we see it .
Angered out of scale by an unauthorized biography , Jobs went nuclear last week .
He banished iCon from Apple stores .
You might say , fine , that is his prerogative .
But is it wise ?
Apple 's shareholders , not its CEO , own the stores .
The dummy here is Mr Jobs .
The genius , idealism , charisma , salesmanship , obsession , paranoia and cruelty that come together in Steve Jobs and other great American icons such as Henry Ford and Howard Hughes also combine in history 's worst tyrants .
The cult of personality built around Lenin and Mao is not unlike the cult Macolytes have built around Mr Jobs .
But , says Karlgaard , the beauty of America is that "" it takes would - be Lenins , redemms them in the crucible of capitalism , and turns out Steve Jobs "" .
PS :
Please forgive the rather dodgy Photoshoppery , but it was too good to miss ."
2005-05-10,"There 's something more than a little ironic to hear Hilary Rosen - former boss of the RIAA - complaining that about the incompatibility between her iPod and non - Apple download sites .
The new iPod my girlfriend gave me is a trap .
Yeah , it is great looking
and I really love the baby blue leather case but
when , oh when , will Steve Jobs let me buy music from somewhere other than the Apple iTunes store and put it on my iPod ?
I 'm no fan of Apple 's lock - in method , even if I can see why they 're doing it .
But it 's not about why Apple 's machines does n't like other DRM : it 's about DRM as a whole .
Why not just give us plain old vanilla MP3 and be done with it ?
Because Rosen , and the RIAA , did n't want that to happen .

Perhaps Rosen should n't be surprised at the results ."
2005-05-13,"Remember the recent spat between Steve Jobs and his unofficial biographer Jeffrey Young ?
Wired News is running an excerpt from the book in question , iCon .
It looks at Jobs ' obsession over gadgets through a slightly strange prism --- buying a washing machine .
The big decision came down to whether to purchase a European machine or an American - made one .
The European machine , according to Steve , does a much better job , uses about one - quarter as much water , and treats the clothes more gently so that they last longer .
But the American machines take about half as long to wash the clothes .
"" We spent some time in our family talking about what 's the trade - off we want to make .
We spent about two weeks talking about this .
Every night at the dinner table "" -- imagine dinner - table conversation about washing machines every night ! --

Steve Jobs :
The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business , by Jeffrey S. Young and William L. Simon , got a lot of publicity because Apple 's CEO , widely regarded as a control freak , responded to its impending publication in characteristic fashion : "" by removing all copies of other Wiley books from Apple 's chain of retail stores "" .
This weekend , Alan Deutschman reviewed iCon in the San Francisco Chronicle , pointing out that stretches of it were summarised from his own bio , The Second Coming of Steve Jobs . ""
Every author wants his work to influence later tellings , but hey , guys , this is kind of pushing it .
I do n't know whether I should feel flattered or ask for my fair share of the book 's royalties . ""
The iCon review does n't tell you much about the book , though it does make it sound pretty lame .
However , it does point out that Jobs ca n't exert the same control over books that he exerts over other media because mainstream book publishers do n't need his "" exclusives , "" his advertising , or even shelf space in his Apple Stores ."
2005-06-06,""" Apple previewed a version of its critically acclaimed operating system , Mac OS X Tiger , running on an Intel - based Mac to the over 3,800 developers attending CEO Steve Jobs ' keynote address .
Apple also announced the availability of a Developer Transition Kit , consisting of an Intel - based Mac development system along with preview versions of Apple 's software , which will allow developers to prepare versions of their applications which will run on both PowerPC and Intel - based Macs , "" says an Apple press release , here or here at Apple .
"" Our goal is to provide our customers with the best personal computers in the world , and looking ahead Intel has the strongest processor roadmap by far , "" said Steve Jobs , Apple 's CEO .
"" It 's been ten years since our transition to the PowerPC , and we think Intel 's technology will help us create the best personal computers for the next ten years . ""

2005-06-06,"One of the standard stories in the Mac press , and on Mac - oriented Web sites , is the one about how Apple is increasing , or is about to increase , its market share .
A graph in today 's Wall Street Journal , with the article Apple Is Poised to Shift To Intel as Chip Supplier , shows the reality , based on research from IDC :
It 's interesting to see the dramatic decline that followed the launch of Windows 95 and its R2 release , when Apple 's turnover almost halved -- and the relative come - back engineered by the returning Steve Jobs ."
2005-06-06,"Apple Computer announced yesterday that it was dumping the IBM - manufactured chips used in its Macintosh products and switching instead to Intel , a move which analysts said could result in cheaper , faster machines .
Steve Jobs , the Apple chief executive , said the company would move all of its flagship Macintosh computers to Intel processors by the end of 2007 .
Intel is the main supplier of chips used in personal computers that run on the Microsoft Windows operating system .
Analysts said that switching to Intel might eventually enable Apple to cut its prices by between 10 % and 20 % , an important move for a company that has been regarded by many as too expensive .
Using Intel chips could also make Mac products more powerful , thinner and cooler .
The switch though is not without risks , as Apple software developers are forced to rewrite programs to work with the new processors .
"" It could cost hundreds of millions of dollars of re - engineering , "" said analyst Brian Gammage at research group Gartner .
"" It 's not easy work .
It 's deep work at the base of the software kernel . ""
Mr Jobs , at an annual conference for developers in San Francisco , said : "" Our goal is to provide our customers with the best personal computers in the world , and looking ahead Intel has the strongest processor road map by far . ""
Apple has been reinvigorated by the worldwide success of the iPod , its stylish , handheld digital music player .
Analysts have suggested that the success of the iPod has created a "" halo "" effect for Apple , and could help lift sales of the company 's more traditional business .
That theory appeared to be proven in the first quarter when Mac sales increased by 43 % , four times as fast as the industry .
But it still holds only 2.3 % of the personal computer market .
In January , the company launched the Mac Mini , a stripped - down version of the Macintosh for less than $ 500 in an attempt to broaden Apple 's appeal .
It comes without a monitor , keyboard or mouse .
Although the shift is a blow to IBM , the loss will be more than offset by the recent announcement that its chips will be used in the next - generation of video game consoles produced by Microsoft and Sony ."
2005-06-06,"There is a curious unanimity about the idea that Apple is finally going to adopt Intel processors , with the usually - reliable Wall Street Journal in the lead .
Sure , we do n't know , officially , but put it this way : there is nobody in the media world who would not talk to Apple boss Steve Jobs if he could be bothered to pick up the phone , and Jobs has now had a month to say the story was rubbish .
He has failed to do so .
According to today 's WSJ ( online version , paid subscribers only ) : Apple , of Cupertino , Calif. , has begun briefing some partners about plans to begin shifting its Macintosh computer line next year to Intel chips , according to industry executives and people familiar with the briefings .
Apple has said it expects to announce the move today , these people said .
Further , says the Journal : Apple recently briefed IBM and other major software partners on its plans , according to people familiar with those briefings .
On the other hand , some Apple watchers said that , given Mr Jobs 's mercurial reputation , they wo n't be sure a change will happen until a formal announcement .
All the companies involved are saying the same thing , No comment , while the staff who might be expected to know are not going public because they 'd expect to lose their jobs .
So again , what 's interesting is not the lack of confirmation , but the complete lack of any sort of denial .
Even the Think Secret site , which is being sued by Apple for publishing this sort of information , remains strangely silent .
We should know in a couple of hours , when Jobs takes the stage to keynote ( sic ) Apple 's Worldwide Developer Conference 2005 , which opens today in San Francisco .
What 's rather odd is the timing .
Microsoft is putting 3.2GHz triple - core PowerPC chips -- faster than the most expensive Mac -- into its cheap Xbox 360 games console , and you 'd have thought this would reduce production costs for the Apple versions .
There 's also the overhyped Sony / IBM Cell processor , which is claimed to be dramatically faster than anything available in the PC world .
Meanwhile , Intel has given up on the megahertz speed race , having signally failed to push the Pentium 4 above 4GHz .
In the past , Apple has suffered from selling machines with slow chips at high prices , but the IBM v Intel story looks better for IBM now than it has for a decade .
If you are going to switch , why switch now , Steve ?
We want to know ."
2005-06-08,"Apple co - founder Steve Jobs dropped a bombshell in his keynote speech opening this week 's Worldwide Developer Conference in San Francisco . ""
Yes , it 's true , "" said Jobs , confirming the rumours .
"" We are transitioning from PowerPC to Intel processors . ""
Jobs said Apple will start shipping Intel - based Macs next year , and will complete the transition by the end of 2007 .
This represents a significant U - turn for Apple , which has attacked Intel in its advertising .
Jobs has even run side - by - side demos to show that Macs with IBM PowerPC chips were faster than PCs with Intel processors .
Mac software is incompatible with Pentium chips and will need to be rewritten or recompiled to run on Intel - based machines .
However , during his speech , Jobs demonstrated a program called Rosetta , which will do the recompilation while programs are running .
This is said to run old Mac applications "" fast enough "" .
In the future , software developers will be expected to produce two versions of their programs : one for PowerPC- and one for Intel - based Macs .
Jobs said Apple would support both architectures for a long time .
None the less , there is a risk that the announcement will have a "" chilling effect "" on Mac sales .
Some users will be put off buying PowerPC - based Macs believing they could become obsolete within a few months .
Intel will be the third incompatible processor used in Macs since 1984 .
Originally , Apple used the Motorola 68000 range and in the 1990s , it moved to the IBM PowerPC line .
The switch is another step in a long line of changes , whereby the company has modified the Mac 's design to follow PC industry standards .
SCSI disks , NuBus expansion slots , ADB ( Apple Desktop Bus ) connectors and other features have been abandoned for Serial ATA disks , Intel PCI expansion slots , USB ports and so on .
Using the same parts has enabled Apple to benefit from the huge economies of scale and wide choice of suppliers generated by the Wintel market .
The move has also been facilitated by the change from the now obsolete Mac OS , last seen in Mac OS 9 , to a version of BSD Unix known as NextStep , which already ran on Intel processors .
In 1996 , Apple bought NextStep for $ 427 m from Next and used it to create Mac OS X.
The Intel version has been maintained ever since .
Jobs said : "" Every release of OS X has been compiled for PowerPC and Intel ... just in case . ""
Apple is now offering Intel - based Macs to its software developers as part of a $ 999 transition kit .
The switch may also lead to some new types of Mac , as Intel Pentium M chips , used in the Centrino chip set , could be used to make "" thin and light "" notebooks and tablet PCs .
An Apple spokesman said the company would not sell or support Microsoft Windows on Intel - based Macs , but it would not install hardware to prevent Windows from running .
Also , it would not enable Mac OS X to run on any non - Apple PCs .
Whether hackers can find a way around this remains to be seen .

2005-06-15,"As best one can Jack Schofield stated ( Apple gets Intel inside , June 9 ) : "" In the future , software developers will be expected to produce two versions of their programs : one for PowerPC - and one for Intel - based Macs .
"" You were obviously present at a different briefing .
Steve Jobs was quite explicit in the webcast
I saw that developers will produce just one version - a Universal Binary .
Such a binary will run on either type of computer .
This is not dissimilar to what Apple did when porting from 68xxx to PowerPC in the 90s , whereby so - called Fat Binaries did the same .
Ian Hobson London Code clear
My understanding of the speech was that XCode would produce a single app that had code for both - Steve Jobs seemed to stress that it was one application rather than two .
Jason Davies London Going nowhere fast Jack Schofield wrote : "" Mac software is incompatible with Pentium chips and will need to be rewritten or recompiled to run on Intel - based machines .

Fast enough "" is a vague enough term .
Ten times slower ?
Two times slower ?

The ageing techies ( Feedback , passim ) who accuse Victor Keegan of being patronising do not realise that he was not addressing them , but people who come to computers and the internet in their 60s and 70s .
Many of them have problems because websites are still un - navigable , because modem - driven use of the internet is painful but broadband is still too expensive and , above all , because help screens are seldom any help .
For normal human beings , the whole technology is still as "" user - friendly as a cornered rat "" , written by teenage techies for teenage techies .
Remember that a grandparent 's help - desk ( child or grandchild ) is usually in Toronto or Hong Kong , not in the IT department along the corridor .
If the industry is serious about silver surfers or , indeed , non - techie people of any age , it must learn that there is a lot more work to do to make it intelligible .
That is not being patronising .
It is good marketing .
Richard Sarson London Citizen gain
As Michael Cross ( First port of call , June 9 ) explained , the government is right to encourage usage of e - government services rather than continue pushing to get them online .
But in terms of e - democracy , my experience is that much of the resistance to take - up lies with local government rather than citizens .
There is still a profound fear among council officers and councillors of real two - way dialogue with the public , and many councils still cling to one - way market research as being a "" safer "" alternative to consultation .
Innovators such as Bristol City Council have created virtual spaces where citizens can debate issues openly - so it can be done .
But without more education for council officers to dispel their concerns , the supply of e - democratic systems will lag behind the demand for them .

For those of you who 'd rather read it , Bruce Sterling has a transcript on his weblog , along with some serious praise : "" It deserves to be heard in full , especially if you are in its intended audience , new college graduates , "" urges Sterling .
Anyway , the speech is pretty good in terms of getting out the Jobs message : motivating people , understanding that the things you learn can all be useful in your life , and to appreciate the things you do .

Personally , I think one of the most important pieces of advice that I 've ever read came from one of my literary heroes , Jonathan Swift , who wrote that "" when a true genius appears in this world , you may know him by this sign : that the dunces are all in confederacy against him "" .
Unfortunately the dunces have never lined up against me , but I live in hope .

The iPod phenomenon has transformed Apple 's fortunes .
More than 16 m have been sold and Apple has four - fifths of the legal download market .
But iPod and the new generation of portable digital players are having an impact on the media industry far beyond Apple 's bottom line .
The ubiquotous players are also changing the way we buy music and listen to the radio .
With users able to download huge chunks of radio programming - from niche new music shows to Radio 4 's Today programme - it has the potential to do for radio listening what personal video recorders are doing for television .
And with the launch of iPod video , it 's not just about music anymore .
More worryingly for broadcasters , with users able to listen to random selection of their favourite songs , then why bother listening to music radio at all ?
"" I do n't listen to the radio anymore .
I have my own personal radio station on my iPod -
it 's Me FM , "" said one of this year 's panellist .
"" The iPod has had an absolutely huge influence , "" said another . ""
Steve Jobs is the architect of the perfect brand . ""
Apple reported a sixfold increase in profits in the first quarter of this year , to $ 290 m ( £ 150 m ) on the back of revenues up 70 % to $ 3.2bn , including $ 1bn in iPod related sales .
The iPod craze is expected to have a "" halo "" effect on other parts of Jobs ' business , with iPod owners buying into other Apple products such as the new Mac Mini computer .
Jobs is n't just a force in the online and music business .
He is also co - founder and chief executive of Pixar , the animated filmmaker behind hits including Toy Story , Finding Nemo and The Incredibles .
Pixar walked away from a long - standing partnership with Disney at the beginning of last year .
But since the departure of Disney chairman Michael Eisner - the Apple boss was mooted as a possible successor - Jobs has hinted at a possible reunion .
Jobs , who had surgery last year to remove a cancerous tumour from his pancreas , founded Apple in 1976 .
He quit in 1985 and returned to revitalise the business 12 years later .
"" I was worth over $ 1 m when I was 23 , and over $ 10 m when I was 24 , and over $ 100 m when I was 25 , "" he has said .

While the overall number of Sky+ users is n't yet stratospheric , nearly a quarter are new customers and the technology has a positive affect on churn .
Watch out for Sky to Go - a portable device that lets you watch a football match on the move - and bigger storage as he aims for a 25 % penetration by 2010 .
While Sullivan and Sky are using new technology to transform a 70-year - old media , Anurag Dikshit ( 95 ) has put a 21st century spin on a 19th century pastime and made himself , at 33 , a multibillionaire .

In the first three months of this year it made $ 125 m , or $ 1.4 m a day .

The marketplace site currently boasts around 135 million customers generating nearly $ 5bn in fees .
Also riding the second wave is Yahoo ! 's chief executive Terry Semel .
Through a series of neat acquisitions and a refocusing of the business from 40 to a handful of businesses , Semel has made the one - time internet portal a name to be reckoned with .
Likewise Amazon 's longtime chief Jeff Bezos , who survived the first dotcom boom and shows no signs of giving way the company 's preeminence as the online champion of pile 'em high and sell them cheap .
Only a fool would bet against it .

2005-07-18,"Out of the dark : Steve Jobs .
Photograph :
Susan Rangan / AP Steve Jobs was in typically ebullient mood as he announced that the iTunes music store had surpassed half a billion downloads - and announced the winning 500,000,000th downloader , who got a rather excessive 10 iPods , 10,000 free iTunes downloads and a trip to see mid - paced chart plodders Coldplay .
Apple today announced that music fans have purchased and downloaded more than half a billion songs from the iTunes Music Store .
The 500 millionth song , Faith Hill 's "" Mississippi Girl , "" was purchased yesterday by Amy Greer from Lafayette , Indiana . ""
Just over two years ago , we sold our first song .
Yesterday , we sold our half billionth song .
WOW ! ""
said Steve Jobs , Apple 's CEO .
"" As we cross this major milestone , we could n't be more excited about the future of digital music , iTunes and the iPod . ""
His reaction to being placed a head - spinning sixth place in today 's MediaGuardian 100 remains unknown ."
2005-08-05,"Four years of frustration ended for Japan 's iPod owners yesterday when Apple announced the launch of a Japanese version of its iTunes music store .
The online store , which will begin with a playlist of a million songs by Japanese and international artists , is the latest move in Apple 's quest to outperform its main rival , Sony , in its own backyard .
"" We 're super - excited about this , "" Apple ' chief executive , Steve Jobs , told a packed news conference in Tokyo . ""
The future looks very , very bright for the iPod in Japan . ""
Globally , the iPod is outselling Sony 's portable game and media console , the PSP , Mr Jobs said .
Sony sold about 2 million PSPs during the last quarter , while Apple says 6 million iPods were sold over the same period .
Mr Jobs said he hoped to repeat the success iTunes has enjoyed in the US , where it accounts for more than 80 % of legally downloaded music .
Apple has sold 22 million iPods worldwide since its launch in October 2001 , and more than 500 million songs in 19 countries through iTunes .
Although the iPod controls 70 % of the global market in digital music players , its market share falls to 36 % in Japan , where Sony has 22 % of the market .
Mora , the music download service used by owners of Sony players , charges an average of 200 yen a song but the company denied it had been outwitted by Apple , saying many of its own downloads were just as cheap .
Japanese iTunes subscribers will be charged
¥ 150 a song for 90 % of those on offer . ""
Apple 's announcement is creating a big stir here , and so we see it as a good opportunity for the music download business to expand , "" said Kazuo Washimi , a Mora spokesman ."
2005-08-14,"Microsoft has won a ruling from the US patent office saying that the software giant filed for patents on key technology used in the iPod five months before Apple .
Apple intends to appeal the decision .
However , if unsuccessful Steve Jobs 's company may be forced to pay royalties to Microsoft on every sale .
Since the machine and its variants account for 75 per cent of all MP3 players sold in the US ( Apple has shipped 21.8 million iPods since October 2001 ) , the potential financial liability is significant .
Apple rejected Microsoft 's claim . '
Apple invented and publicly released the iPod interface before the Microsoft patent application cited by the patent examiner was filed , ' the company said in a statement .
Microsoft 's claim centres on the work of John C. Platt , a senior researcher in the Knowledge Tools Group at Microsoft Research .
In May 2002 he filed a patent for AutoDJ , ' a system for automatically generating music playlists based on one or more seed songs selected by a user ' .
Platt 's application was rejected in December 2004 , but it was amended and later approved .
Apple 's own request , filed by Steve Jobs and other officials in October 2002 , was rejected by patent officials last month .
For legions of Apple fans , Microsoft 's claim is merely evidence of its competitive character .
Earlier last week Microsoft ' declared war ' on the iPod and promised a series of competing devices .
By next spring , said Erik Huggers , head of Microsoft 's Digital Media Division , ' there is going to be a whole line - up of products that can compete with Apple in industrial design , usability , functionality and features . '
But it is going to take a lot to dethrone Apple , say industry analysts . '
Apple wo n't sit on its laurels and I expect we 'll see another iteration of the iPod for the holiday , ' says Michael Gartenberg , of Jupiter Research . '
Unless Microsoft is really willing to spend the time and effort to get behind a player or a select group of players , it 's not going to happen . '
The iPod sold 6.2 m units last quarter alone and generated over $ 1.1bn in revenue for Apple .
On Friday , a Microsoft spokesman did not rule out the possibility that it might end up licensing the disputed technology to Apple .
He said the companies maintain a ' good working relationship ' ."
2005-09-07,"So , if all the rumours are true , Steve Jobs will tonight announce the long - awaited iTunes - compatible phone which Apple has been making in conjunction with Motorola .
Later on today I 'll be going to a north London satellite link - up with San Francisco , where we 'll hear more details : and I 'll ( hopefully ) be blogging live from the scene .
But forget the hype : has it been too long ?
After all , it 's been more than a year since we knew this was on the cards .
And a host of other music phones have hit the market in the meantime : many of them are quite good , and they 're improving all the time .
In my opinion , Apple 's really going to have to pull something special out of the bag .
While it might look good ( and Motorola 's regained its status as a highly fashionable handset manufacturer , so I expect it to ) , the crucial aspect is going to be who actually wants it , and the restrictions placed on the music on the phone itself .
And here 's the rub , for me at least : mobile networks already place highly restrictive digital rights mechanisms on downloaded music .
Apple 's likely to be enforcing its iTMS DRM on the phone , at a time when there 's little inter - compatibility between songs I 've downloaded on my phone and songs I 've got on my larger music collections .
Add to this the fact that there 's also little inter - compatibility between different manufacturers .
And if I switch phones ( which happens regularly ) , I lose all the music - and all the money I 've spent .
If I 'm going to be persuaded to buy an iPhone , I want all of these issues resolved .
Ease - of - use will be paramount , and it has to be said that iTunes is one of the easiest ways to buy music ... but will that draw in enough new business ?
After all , if Apple 's merely going to succeed in getting people * already * using the iPod / iTunes combo to switch from , say , their underperforming iPod shuffle , then I do n't think it will have been worth the effort .
We want something special ... but can Apple deliver ?"
2005-09-08,"It is already the biggest name in the growing world of digital music , but last night Apple revealed its blueprint for further domination by unveiling a new model iPod and a music - playing mobile phone .
As the latest additions to the company 's range of wildly popular iPod digital music players , Apple 's boss , Steve Jobs , announced the iPod Nano and a mobile phone handset called Rokr .
The Nano , a super - slim music player which can hold up to 1,000 songs , will be available by this weekend .
"" It 's impossibly small , "" said Mr Jobs .
The Nano resembles the iPod Shuffle , the small player released earlier this year , but has a screen , weighs just 42 g and comes in two different capacities .
The long - awaited Rokr E1 handset , also dubbed the "" iPhone "" , will be launched in the UK next week .
But the model , produced in conjunction with the world 's second largest mobile manufacturer , Motorola , has underwhelmed some , with the capacity to carry just 100 songs .
The Rokr is far from being the first mobile phone with the ability to play music , but Apple and Motorola will be hoping to cash in on the success of iPod , which is expected to sell 25 m units worldwide this year alone .
With its striking design and ubiquitous white earphones , iPod has become of the equivalent of Sony 's Walkman for the digital age .
But Apple has one eye on the much larger mobile market .
Looking and behaving like an ordinary phone , the Rokr carries a button which allows users to launch the iPod interface to play stored songs .
And it will be compatible with Apple 's popular iTunes music software , allowing them to transfer music from their computer , or tracks bought from Apple 's music download service .
Critics of the iPhone say it has simply been too long in coming , and no longer offers anything fresh .
News of the link - up between Apple and Motorola emerged as long ago as last summer , and rivals have been quick to release products in the meantime .
Music - playing phones from the likes of Sony Ericsson have already proved popular , and Nokia 's impending N91 - which is said to have a capacity around eight times bigger than that of the Rokr - could make the going even tougher for the little white icon . ""
This device will probably be very popular , "" said Michael Bull , a lecturer at the University of Sussex .
"" But if you 're going to combine two things like an iPod and a mobile phone , it 's really got to do something more than this phone 's going to do .
Until you can construct a seamless experience , it will always be a mobile with a musical toy attached .
"" The device will not go on sale in Apple 's shops in the UK , and for the first two weeks it will only be available on the O2 network , and through the high street retailer The Carphone Warehouse .
It is certainly true that Britain 's appetite for music downloads is rapidly increasing .
Most mobile network operators already offer customers the chance to buy music over their phones , and sales of digital tracks are now incorporated in the official music charts .
Apple already has a dominant position in the market , with its iTunes Music Store claiming an 80 % share of all Britain 's digital music purchases .
The iPhone is seen as a way of securing that superiority , as well as fending off challenges from competitors such as HMV , Virgin and Sony . ""
By the end of the year , there should be around 40 to 50 million music - enabled mobile phones in western Europe , "" said Jerome Buvat , a consultant at CapGemini .
"" By launching this phone , Apple expects to increase its download music revenues as users of Rokr can only buy songs from iTunes . """
2005-09-13,"CNet has an interview with Michael Robertson , who founded MP3.com and launched Lindows / Linspire .
Robertson 's latest target is Apple Computer , whose iPod music player and iTunes software currently dominate the digital music world nearly as successfully as Microsoft controls the PC operating system and office software markets .
In midsummer , he quietly launched a site called BadFruit , which beat Apple CEO Steve Jobs to putting links to podcasts into iTunes with a piece of software called BadApple .
The latest version of the BadApple software available on that site now allows people to use Apple 's iTunes software to sync their music collections with non - Apple MP3 players .
Robertson says he 's pursuing the project -- an offshoot of his MP3Tunes music store , which sells independent music in MP3 format without copy protection -- in order to encourage the development of interoperability between different music platforms ."
2005-09-15,"Apple 's Lilliputian music player punches above its weight ""
It 's impossibly tiny , "" Apple chief Steve Jobs told the world last week , as he unveiled the latest iteration of the iPod .
Despite the clamour that usually accompanies new products from the stylish Californian firm , it was not all hype .
The slim , sleek iPod nano - which is replacing the wildly popular iPod mini - is smaller than a credit card and less than 7 mm thick .
The minuscule size of the unit is hard to express , but the focus is very much on its Lilliputian dimensions and a weight so low it should be seeking doctor 's advice .
The Flash - based player comes in two sizes - 2 GB ( £ 139 ) and 4 GB ( £ 179 ) - and is available in white or glossy black .
The nano is aimed at the fashion - conscious buyer and , perhaps , at encouraging further purchases from those who have bought into the brand already .
Small improvements include the crystal clear colour screen and a stopwatch .
Battery life is improving , though at 14 hours it still lags behind some competitors .
And the finish scratches easily , meaning damage - wary users will need to fork out for a "" tube "" case for extra protection .
In all other respects , nano is an ordinary iPod - except for the name .
A legal battle with music - player rival Creative is potentially be on the cards , since it too has a "" nano "" branded player .
Observers say a court case is unlikely , though While it has certainly attracted attention , Jobs ' latest baby has worried fans of the incredibly popular iPod mini , which now demands vintage status .
Others are taking Apple to task for the features the nano lacks ( no radio , no voice recording ) as well as those it includes , such as the lock - in between iPod and iTunes , and the digital rights mechanism on tracks downloaded from the iTunes Music Store .
But while there are many players with more features , and with less restrictions , there is no doubt that iPod nano works .
Small and stylish , it stays with a successful formula while turning the screws on the competition - and as a fashion player , there is nothing in the market that really compares .
With one swoop , the game has changed completely : iPod may have shrunk , but the challenge for Apple 's rivals seems bigger than ever ."

2005-09-20,"Arrived here in Paris yesterday afternoon for Apple 's autumn show in France , Apple Expo .
And so far , things are going well : the floor has only just opened , and I 'm going to be taking a tour around - and blogging - later on .
And , despite the fact that there 's no keynote speech , this morning I was invited along to a Q&amp;A session with Steve Jobs and a selection of top Apple execs .
More soon ..."
2005-09-22,"In a parallel world , Steve Jobs could have been a poker player with a reputation as a cool hand .
After three decades at the top table of technology , all the required skills are there : patience , self - belief , bravado - and , most importantly , the ability to ride a streak of luck . ""
Some people thought we got really lucky with the iPod , and we did , "" says Jobs .
But , he adds , real winners do n't just enjoy the breaks , they exploit them .
It is necessary to stay on top , especially when everybody 's out to get you .
As he puts it : "" We have world - class competitors trying to kill us . ""
So far , the competition is not doing a great job .
Apple 's hand in the home computer market might be weak , but it holds all the cards in digital music .
Thanks to phenomenal sales of the iPod over the past few years , the company is at an all - time high and its dominance of music downloading is almost total .
More than 6 m iPods were shipped in the past three months , underpinned by a pervasive marketing campaign and growing consumer awareness .
No wonder , then , that Jobs is in confident mood .
Dressed in the regulation outfit of a Californian intellectual - black , black and more black - he is upbeat about the future of Apple , the company he founded almost 30 years ago in his parents ' garage .
He believes that central to the company 's success is Apple 's vision - his vision - of making technology simple .
"" There 's a very strong DNA within Apple , and that 's about taking state - of - the - art technology and making it easy for people , "" he says .
Jobs 's targets are busy , modern consumers ; "" people who do n't want to read manuals , people who live very busy lives "" .
Ultimate salesman
There are certainly a large number who buy into that concept .
But while many are drawn in by the slick advertising and fashionable branding , those who stick around are often motivated by the man himself .
On stage , and with an audience to play with , Jobs is the ultimate salesman .
His speeches are famous for generating the "" reality distortion field "" , a sense of devotion to the cause that most rival technology bosses would kill for .
Some fans will go wild for each new product that Jobs delivers , and his enthusiasm and charisma pour out across the stage .
In person , though , he is quiet , determined and relatively inscrutable .
It is as if the qualities that make him a great showman turn inside out when put under the magnifying glass ; a bluff worthy of any hardened Las Vegas gambler .
Despite his value on stage , Jobs did not make a keynote speech at Apple 's annual Paris expo earlier this week , and for one simple reason : there was nothing new to announce .
The company had unveiled its autumn product , the iPod nano , two weeks before .
The other big news , the iTunes - compatible ROKR phone from Motorola , is being re - aligned as little more than a test run .
Jobs blames speculative media interest for imagining it was anything more than "" dipping our toes in the water "" .
Apart from nano - which , as a replacement for the best - selling iPod mini , is a major move for the company - Apple 's cupboard is fairly bare .
It is a low point in the product cycle , with much of the behind - the - scenes work focusing on the Intel - based computers due next summer .
But new iPods are on the way , and Jobs promises "" a lot of new things in the pipeline "" .
This relative downtime is giving Jobs a chance to promote Apple itself , and the company 's wider beliefs .
It is an important time : while the long - standing computer business remains just as important as the newer focus on music - he wonders whether anyone would ask which of his children was more important to him - it is clear that Apple is changing .
Lifestyle brand
At the centre of it all , Apple is now a lifestyle brand , rather than a technology company .
Each iPod comes inscribed with the words "" designed in California "" , a seemingly throwaway statement that gives a fundamental insight into the company 's outlook .
The message is straightforward : we are innovators , we are cool , we are friendly .
It 's an extended new age mantra that betrays Apple 's west coast roots and has proved crucial to its image - both good and bad - over the years .
Remaining friendly in the eyes of consumers is at the heart of Apple 's motivations .
Green issues , for example , are becoming a real concern .
With so many units being shifted across the world , like many other computer firms , Apple has come under increasing scrutiny about its environmental policies .
Jobs is clear that reducing the footprint of products is important , but it should , he feels , be put into context . ""
One automobile is , I 'm sure , greater in impact than 100,000 iPods , "" he says .
"" The one part of consumer electronics that you have to worry about is the battery .
I 'm glad we got rid of cathode ray tubes , because they were horrible , full of lead .
Flat displays are much better .
The batteries ...
you have to watch .
But you can bring your iPod into an Apple store and get it recycled , and we run a battery replacement scheme . ""
Even our packaging reflects these concerns .
It is dramatically smaller these days , and we have removed styrofoam and such things . ""
The image might be soft , but it is clear that nobody gets to be the chief executive of such a large company without a killer instinct .
Part of the Jobs mystique is that he simply does n't give up .
He bounced back from a boardroom fight that saw him leave the firm in 1985 , returning triumphantly in 1997 .
He also bounced back from a financial and commercial precipice , launching a series of iconic products including the iMac and iPod .
And he even bounced back from death , beating a rare form of pancreatic cancer last year .
Ease of use might be in Apple 's DNA , but there is grit and determination in there as well .
There is a cruelty , too , about the dismissive way in which the company treats its fresh lineup of competitors , or the way Jobs relates to those he disagrees with .
Part of it is executive braggadocio , of course , but there are clearly subjects - and people - he does n't like .
Questions about his feelings on hackers attempting to "" improve "" Apple 's operating system , for example , are batted away with a wide - eyed stare .
"" You 're asking me whether theft is a good idea ? "" he responds , incredulously .
"" If people want to change our software , then they should come to work at Apple ...
We might choose to give it away , but it should be our choice to make . ""
Shrewd politician
It 's clear that ownership is important to Jobs .
He might not own Apple , but as the public face of the company he does lay claim to the firm 's image , and understands the necessity of being seen as "" the good guy "" .
For instance , when it is suggested that record labels might look to increase their income by bumping up the price of iTunes downloads , he brings in the spectre of illegal downloading . ""
Music companies make more money when they sell a song on iTunes than when they sell a CD , "" Jobs says .
"" If they want to raise prices , it 's because they 're greedy .
If the price goes up , people turn back to piracy - and everybody loses .
"" This is how things work : with a swift shuffle , he asserts Apple 's ownership of the music download market , and distances it from the messy decisions .
It is clear , he says , that a price bump will be a terrible move made by a music industry only interested in short - term profits .
It is the kind of subtle statement that suggests Jobs would be a shrewd politician - something that has been suggested , and his links to the Democrat party in the US are good : last year he offered himself as an advisor to the campaign to elect John Kerry as president , while former vice president Al Gore is on Apple 's board .
But even if Apple 's stereotypical users - young , fashionable and metropolitan - are sympathetic to his personal views , he insists that his politics are n't important to the company 's strategy .
"" We 're not trying to sell belief - we 're just who we are .
Apple has values we care about ; Apple cares about tolerance .
We are not a political company , but a company with a set of values . ""
And over the years , Apple has had the perfect foil for those values , in the guise of the unfriendly giant Microsoft .
It is something that has benefited the Californian firm , even if it would be loathe to admit it .
As the perennial underdog in a round of high - stakes poker , it has learned how to play its cards with enough skill to survive .
Now , entering into new markets , Apple has discovered that it 's a much better player than it ever realised .
Not even Jobs would claim that this was winning a 30-year - long bet .
But it is a gamble which is paying off , for now at least .

It 's happening next Wednesday night , September October 12 .
"" One more thing ... ""
, it said , echoing the characteristic announcement catchphrase of Apple boss Steve Jobs .
But as usual , Apple are keeping their lips sealed over what it 's going to be .
So what do you think they 're going to unleash ?
Speculation in the comments box , please ."
2005-10-13,"Apple , which revolutionised the market for portable music with its fashionable iPod player , promised last night to do the same for Hollywood studios and TV broadcasters .
Unveiling a new version of its iPod which is capable of showing movies and television , Apple chief executive Steve Jobs said he hoped it would be one of its biggest - selling products ever .
"" This is the best music player we have ever made , "" he said during an announcement in San José , California .
Mr Jobs - who has previously been sceptical about the market for portable video - also announced that new iPod owners would now be able to download videos , including TV shows such as Desperate Housewives and Lost from America 's ABC network , using the company 's iTunes program .
He said he hoped the new device would capture the public 's appetite for portable video in the same way that it had with digital music .
The new iPod - which comes in both white and black - will be able to store up to 150 hours of video and is set to retail for between £ 219 and £ 299 , depending on storage capacity .
Although fans are expressing mixed feelings about the muted nature of the launch - Mr Jobs said video was "" a bonus "" - the ability to watch film seems likely to add fresh impetus to the burgeoning online video market .
In the past Mr Jobs has said it was "" not clear "" whether there was demand for video devices , but the announcement has been one of the most anticipated moves in Apple 's history .
The company has already supported and promoted video on its desktop computers , and Mr Jobs has close links with Hollywood in his other capacity as chairman of Pixar , the animation studio behind hit films including Toy Story and Finding Nemo .
Apple clearly believes it now has the right formula , but the new iPod is far from being the first handheld video device to reach the market .
Rivals , including mobile phone companies , have already created a number of devices that can show television and movies on the go , but the idea has yet to grab consumers .
Mr Jobs is hoping that Apple 's stranglehold in music - achieved through a mixture of technical innovation , marketing and trend - setting designs - can translate to new areas .
Critics , though , are saying that the firm could struggle without large - scale content deals with movie studios .
The announcement came as part of a range of new product announcements , including a slimmer desktop iMac , a multimedia manager called Front Row and a remote control device .
This week it emerged that 6.5 m iPods had been sold worldwide in the past three months ."
2005-10-17,"Interesting story emerged out of Korea this weekend , with Samsung officials letting reporters get wind of a failed $ 3.8 billion deal with Apple .
The proposed venture , according to Reuters , was meant to be a joint investment to make flash chips .
That makes perfect sense for Steve Jobs and co , since they 're already buying something like 40 % of Samsung 's flash memory ...
But Apple pulled out .
"" We had had some talks with Apple earlier this year but it did not work out due to differences over terms , "" said the Samsung spokesman by telephone , adding they had dropped the joint investment talks "" at a very early stage .
"" Some are taking this as Samsung coming out punching against Apple for leaving it in the lurch .
But I suspect that this is actually a story about South Korean politics , which is n't quite as sexy .
After all , Samsung is not having a great time of it on the home front .
As this LA Times story documents , the relationship between government and one of its biggest businesses is testier than ever .
Samsung Group 's reclusive chairman , 58-year - old Lee Kun Hee , South Korea 's richest man , with an estimated fortune of $ 4 billion , has come under fire , accused of running the corporation like a feudal lord .
Civic groups comprising scores of lawyers , professors and accountants have mobilized and filed lawsuits to push Samsung to operate more transparently and give minority shareholders a greater say in the company 's affairs .
Government officials called for an investigation of Samsung 's campaign activities after revelations in July that company representatives paid more than $ 10 million in bribes to candidates in South Korea 's 1997 presidential elections .
The scandal led to the resignation of South Korea 's ambassador to the United States , Hong Seok Hyun , Lee 's brother - in - law and a former newspaper publisher who is said to have delivered bags of cash personally to at least one candidate .
That 's one way to try and take on your rivals in government : tell them - and the Korean public - that they just lost out on $ 4bn .
Samsung bods are laying down their hand : jobs and money are at stake and that pesky stuff about bribes is getting in the way ."
2005-11-01,"Customers of Apple 's iTunes music store have downloaded more than 1 m video tracks in the three weeks since it introduced video in the US .
The Apple chief executive , Steve Jobs said the results for the service , which from October 12 let users download music videos and TV shows , proved there was a market for legal video downloads .
The company said the top - selling downloads were music videos from Michael Jackson and Fatboy Slim and episodes of ABC 's hit TV shows Lost and Desperate Housewives . ""
Selling 1 m videos in less than 20 days strongly suggests there is a market for legal video downloads .
Our next challenge is to broaden our content offerings , so that customers can enjoy watching more videos on their computers and new iPods , "" Mr Jobs said in a statement .
When the service launched , Disney and Mr Jobs ' Pixar Animation were the only two studios to offer content .
Though ABC shows and Pixar shorts such as Boundin ' were among the most popular downloads , a lack of additional content is seen as one reason why iTunes video was performing less strongly than the original music store .
When Apple introduced its iTunes music store in April 2003 it ratcheted up sales of 1 m songs in its first week , going on to notch up 8 m sales in eight weeks and 70 m in is first year .
Apple offers around 2,000 video downloads on the iTunes store compared with over 2 m music downloads .

The line at which corporate presentation becomes a ritual is not crossed too often but Steve Jobs , the CEO of Apple , is now safely over the other side .
His addresses are events in their own right - bookended by the chatter of new product speculation on the net and the point at the close of the speech when Jobs utters the words "" one more thing "" .
This is where he unveils a product Apple devotees will usually hail for its revolutionary brilliance .
Sometimes that even turns out to be the case .
And so it surely will be this time around when the annual Macworld conference and expo hits its high point in San Francisco .
A Washington Post report has the strange mix of business and folklore about right : "" As predictably as Santa Claus on Christmas morning , Apple founder Steve Jobs will bring us something new today . ""
For the more maniacal Mac fans , Jobs is indeed the Father Christmas of northern California , albeit one who charges for his offerings and wears a black turtleneck with faded jeans .
Reports on sites such as Apple Insider , Mac Rumours and Think Secret ( sued by Apple in 2005 for revealing the Mac Mini and iPod Shuffle ahead of the keynote ) try to answer that all - important question : what will he bring ?
The majority of forecasts centre on a revamped laptop line using Intel processors , a new piece of software called iWeb ( no one is sure what it is , but a link appeared all too briefly on the Apple website ) and a huge flat - screen television with a computer built in .
If that is Jobs 's big announcement , expect lots of reports enthusing about media convergence in the living room .
One that already is , observes that the new products at Macworld are "" always a generation ahead of the competition , even if Apple did n't invent the product category "" .
The other area Apple leads in is marketing , which is as important a part of the keynote experience as the products .
A real - life story from one of Jobs 's little helpers in last week 's Technology Guardian details the hundreds of hours of work behind the "" sophisticated blend of sales pitch , product demonstration and corporate cheerleading , with a dash of religious revival thrown in "" .
Put like that , it begins to sound less rather like consumer electronics than a political rally .
It makes you wonder what Jobs would be doing if he was not selling computers ."
2006-01-12,"Apple has announced its first computers using Intel chips , unveiling new iMacs and a professional laptop - the MacBook Pro - based on dual - core Intel chips .
Chief executive Steve Jobs said the machines would run between two and four times faster than the PowerPC - based iMacs and Powerbooks they replace .
Speaking at the MacWorld event in San Francisco , Jobs also unveiled an upgraded suite of consumer - level applications , called iLife 06 , and a remote control and separate FM tuner for the iPod digital music player .
He announced that Apple has so far sold a total of 42 million iPods since their inception in 2001 - of which 32 million were sold last year alone - and 8 million videos since October 12 .
The new computers are based on Intel 's Core Duo chip , originally codenamed Yonah .
These have two processors on the same chip , allowing for almost twice the performance of a single chip .
The chips in the new iMacs run at 1.83GHz and 2.0GHz ( in the 17-inch and 20-inch screen versions respectively ) , and are priced at £ 929 and £ 1,229 inc VAT respectively .
The MacBook Pro has a 15.4-inch screen and comes in two versions , one with 1.67GHz processors and another running at 1.83GHz , priced at £ 1,429 and £ 1,779 inc VAT .
During his speech Jobs welcomed Paul Otellini , chief executive of Intel , who came on stage dressed in a clean - room suit like those used by workers in chip plants .
The introduction of the new Intel - based Macs had been widely rumoured , despite Apple only having committed itself to delivering them by June .
The move is the third major shift for the Macintosh in recent history .
In the early 1990s , it moved from Motorola 68000 chips to the PowerPC architecture .
In 2001 , it introduced a new operating system , the Unix - based OS X.
And last June , Jobs said that Apple would move all its hardware over to Intel processors by the end of next year because its existing chip suppliers , Freescale ( an offshoot of Motorola ) and IBM could not - or would not - meet its needs for faster chips .
Each transition has required developers to rewrite their applications to run "" natively "" at full speed .
In the case of the Intel - based Macs , that process is still underway , and many key professional applications - such as Adobe 's Photoshop - are not yet available in "" universal binary "" formats that can run on both PowerPC - based Macs and the new Intel - based ones .
In the meantime , Apple is offering the Rosetta emulator , written by the British company Transitive , which can run programs written for PowerPC machines on Intel chips .
However , there are no independent benchmarks on how quickly programs run under Rosetta - although they may arrive soon , as the new Intel - based iMacs are on sale immediately .
The MacBook Pro machines will be on sale from next month .
But the introduction of the new iMacs and laptops may also provide answers to a crucial question that has been unanswered since Apple said it would move to Intel chips last June : how the company will prevent hackers from copying its OS X operating system and installing it on other Intel - based machines .
Over the past six months , hackers have repeatedly cracked the developer versions of OS X and installed them - against Apple 's wishes - on Dell and Sony computers .
If that happens more widely with the commercial version of OS X for Intel , it could undercut Apple 's financial model , which relies on profits from selling hardware to offset the billions of dollars it costs to develop its own operating system and applications .
Last September , Jobs said : "" Do n't use the [ hacking of the ] developer version as a proxy for the final version , "" implying that there would be stronger security around the commercial release than for that given to applications developers who were trying to create universal binary versions of their applications .
The developer systems searched for a special chip before they would run , but there has been speculation that the Intel Macs will use up to a gigabyte of Flash memory , which stores data without power , to store an encrypted version of OS X.
This would be decrypted as the machine ran - thus serving the user while defeating hackers .
Other rumours ahead of the announcement had suggested that Apple would unveil a large - screen plasma TV , perhaps with some computer functionality .
Some had expected a provision for full - length movie downloads through its .Mac subscription service , as part of a concerted push to make Apple a key player in the living room .
Both expectations turned out to be hollow .

2006-01-13,""" Most brand - name PCs that use Intel processors take part in the ' Intel Inside ' program , which gives the computer makers marketing dollars for displaying the chipmaker 's logo on their products and in their advertising .
But Apple decided not to sign on to the program with the lineup of Intel - based Macs that CEO Steve Jobs introduced Tuesday , "" says Ina Fried at CNet .
"" We chose not to take part in the Intel Inside campaign , "" Phil Schiller , Apple senior vice president of worldwide product marketing , said in an interview at the Macworld Expo here .
So , no bongs in Apple 's MacIntel advertising either ....
Later , the story says : Along with forgoing the Intel Inside program , Apple is also not a part of Intel 's latest marketing push , Viiv , which is centered on entertainment - oriented PCs .
For now , that program is limited to PCs with Microsoft 's Windows XP Media Center Edition , though Intel Vice President Deborah Conrad said Apple had a chance to take part in Viiv .
"" They looked at Viiv , "" Conrad said in an interview .
"" We were very up - front with them ...
It 's not like they were surprised or that they could n't have been part of it if they had wanted to . ""
Comment : Not only could Apple have signed up for Viiv , it could have supplied its PCs with Windows XP Media Center Edition , which is openly available for licensing ...."
2006-01-14,"It was always a safe bet that Apple would be first to ship notebooks with Intel Core Duo ( Yonah ) chips , given the bargaining power Apple boss Steve Jobs got by defecting from the PowerPC to its hated rival .
How Michael Dell feels about this is anyone 's guess but The Inquirer reckons some of his customers are a tad disgruntled : One major corporate buyer told the INQ : "" Am I the only IT person who finds it odd that Intel 's favourite brand has not introduced or announced Core Duo Latitudes and Inspirons ?
I am ready to begin purchases for 2006 and would love to be able to get my hands on these , but they do n't exist .
I do n't recall Dell ever missing a new CPU launch from Intel .
"" It 's a publicity stunt that could end up costing Intel heavily .
Dell is expected to sell around 40 million PCs this year , and so far it has been Intel 's biggest and most faithful supporter .
We can assume it already gets some sweet deals for not using AMD chips , and its Core Duo prices could now be even sweeter than usual ....
Update :
I withdrew this post for reconsideration and would now do it differently , if at all .
Apple may not be the first to ship Core Duo chips in notebooks ( the Apple Store says February ) though it may be the first to ship Core Duo chips -- one blogger is expecting one today -- which is what I 'd expected .
My mistake -- as pointed out by Jonathan in a comment -- was that I missed Dell 's announcement of Core Duo notebooks , for which my apologies .
As The Inquirer quote shows , I 'm not the only one ...."
2006-01-16,""" It may not be the last laugh , but on Friday afternoon , after the close of the stock market , Steve Jobs , the chief executive of Apple Computer , shared an e - mail chuckle with his employees at the expense of Dell , a big rival .
The message was prompted by the 12 % surge in Apple 's stock price last week , which pushed the company 's market capitalization to $ 72.13 billion , passing Dell 's value of $ 71.97 billion , "" reports The New York Times .
In 1997 , shortly after Jobs returned to Apple , the company he helped start in 1976 , Dell 's founder and chairman , Michael Dell , was asked at a technology conference what might be done to fix Apple , then deeply troubled financially .

Dell said to an audience of several thousand information technology managers .
"" I 'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders . """
2006-01-17,"Newsweek magazine has a short "" web exclusive "" interview with Apple co - founder Steve Jobs , evidently from MacWorld .
The interesting bit is at the end :
Q :
At the Consumer Electronics Show last week , there did n't seem to be any iPod killers .
A : The problem is
, the PC model does n't work in the consumer electronics industry , where you 've got all these companies and some does one thing and
another does another thing .
It just does n't work .
What 's going to happen is that Microsoft is going to have to get into the hardware business of making MP3 players .
This year .
X - player , or whatever .
Comment :
Microsoft has certainly had a taste of Apple - style "" controlling the experience "" with the Xbox , where MIcrosoft did the servers , software , online service , hardware devices , marketing and branding ( but has yet to make any money out of it ) .
This was a straightforward play because Microsoft tried all the device manufacturers and could n't get multiple sources to support a games console -- not surprising when the market requires standard consoles to launch at loss - making prices .
It 's not straightforward when there are a dozen or more companies making Microsoft - based portable players , including Creative , Toshiba and LG Electronics .
Unless done co - operatively , a Microsoft X - player could put some important noses out of joint , or worse , spook its all - important PC manufacturers .
( Music players are small beer compared with the $ 250 billion PC business . )
"" We 've got a lot of work to do , "" Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said in an interview with CNET News.com .
"" On the PC , our stuff is still the most popular stuff out there .
It 's not true in the portable device space , and I think we have to do some stuff to simplify the experience . ""
Sure , but what ?"
2006-01-20,"Walt Disney , which has been struggling to inject life back into its animation studio , is said to be in talks to acquire Pixar , the hit - making firm behind Finding Nemo , Toy Story and The Incredibles .
The company is reported to be discussing an all share deal that would pay a modest premium to Pixar 's current market value of $ 6.7bn .
If the deal went through , it would make Steve Jobs , Pixar 's chairman and the founder of Apple Computers , Disney 's biggest individual shareholder .
The report in the Wall Street Journal appeared to confirm months of speculation .
Robert Iger , who took over as Disney chief executive from Michael Eisner in October , has made restoring the firm 's reputation in animation his number one priority .
Under a seven - film deal , Disney co - funded and distributed Pixar 's computer animation movies , also taking a share in their profits .
By some estimates the Pixar relationship generated $ 1bn in profits for the company , more than half the Disney film studio earnings over the same period .
But when it came time to discuss renewing the deal , Mr Jobs and Mr Eisner had a public and acrimonious falling - out .
In June 1994 , Pixar said it would open talks with other studios .
Pixar 's next film , Cars , is the last under the Disney deal .
There have been signs lately that relations between Mr Jobs and Disney have been thawing .
At the end of last year , Mr Iger struck a deal allowing Disney - produced shows including Desperate Housewives and Lost to be made available for download on Apple 's iPod devices .
Pixar 's first film , Toy Story , was an unexpected hit .
Released in 1995 , it was the first full - length computer animated feature and even its producers were uncertain of the audience reaction .
It became the highest grossing film of the year and Pixar has proven reliable since .
The studio 's other hits have included Toy Story 2 , A Bug 's Life and Monsters Inc.
Meanwhile , Disney 's traditional hand - drawn animation business , which had undergone a renaissance with the likes of The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast , went into an apparently terminal decline .
The company suffered a string of flops including Treasure Planet , Atlantis , Brother Bear and Home on the Range .
At the end of last year , Disney released its first home - grown computer animated film , Chicken Little , which had a lukewarm reception by critics and was a modest box office success .
It made a better - than - expected $ 40 m at the US box office in its opening weekend , but still fell far short of The Incredibles ' $ 70 m .
Had Chicken Little been a more resounding success it might have taken some of the pressure off
Mr Iger to do a deal with Pixar .
In the last quarter Disney reported a $ 313 m loss at its film studio , the result of a poor performance by its Miramax subsidiary and low DVD sales .
Mr Iger said at the time it was vital to get the animation division back on track .
According to the Journal , the talks are still at a sensitive stage .
If Disney did take over Pixar , however , it would further broaden the influence of Mr Jobs , already one of the world 's most powerful media tycoons .
He would likely join the Disney board while John Lasseter , who directed Toy Story , would take an expanded role looking after the Disney animation studio .
However , the two could still settle on a scaled - down distribution agreement .
Disney declined to comment ."
2006-01-22,"Who says irony is dead ?
On Tuesday , 10 January , Apple 's chief , Steve Jobs , launched a new range of laptops and desktop computers powered by the Intel processor that also drives the IBM PC range .
Plans to move to the new processor had been announced ages ago , so there was nothing new in that ; but few had expected the switchover to be so quick and apparently effortless .
Yet there it was - sleek new Macs running the chip that fuels Satan 's empire , aka Microsoft .
And some ( the desktop machines ) were available to buy on the day .
( Those desiring laptops will have to wait a month or so . )
The quiet efficiency of the switchover obviously impressed Wall Street , because Apple stock rose appreciably during the day .
But the irony came with the closing price - $ 80.86 .
This may not seem unduly interesting , but to geeks it is amusing because the Intel 8086 processor was the progenitor of the silicon family which launched the IBM PC and has been its computational engine ever since .
But wait , there is more !
Apple 's share price continued to rise through the week after the launch .
Last Friday , employees were intrigued to receive an email from Jobs himself . '
Team ' , it read , ' it turned out that Michael Dell was n't perfect at predicting the future .
Based on today 's stock market close , Apple is worth more than Dell .
Stocks go up and down , and things may be different tomorrow , but I thought it was worth a moment of reflection today .
Steve . '
The reference to Dell ( founder and chairman of Dell Computers ) represented the settling of an old score .
In 1997 , when Apple was in deep trouble and Jobs was returning to rescue it , Dell was asked at a technology conference what might be done to fix the company . '
What would I do ? '
he said to an audience of several thousand IT managers . '
I 'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders . '
The decision to adopt Intel processors would have been unthinkable in 1997 , when it was a point of honour in Apple to do nothing that even vaguely resembled the PC .
Apple computers were then based around PowerPC processors made by IBM .
But last year Jobs failed to persuade IBM to continue the development of the PowerPC line to give more speed and lower power consumption .
Rather than risk falling behind the PC on performance , Jobs pragmatically climbed into bed with the enemy .
The result is new machines that are blazingly fast but retain the elan of the Apple brand .
The move to Intel processors takes Apple into uncharted territory .
For the first time it will be possible - with a little bit of tweaking - to run Windows natively ( without going through a software emulator ) on a Mac .
The prospect of so - called ' dual - boot ' Apple computers - ones that can run both Microsoft and Apple operating systems - now seems real .
This could be good news for people who run PCs , not because they love them but because an application essential for their business only runs under Windows .
It 's more difficult to see what the upside of this would be for Apple .
It might mean that it sells more computers and finally penetrates the corporate marketplace - hitherto a Windows - only zone .
But the impact on Microsoft would be negligible , because people will still need Windows licences if they wish to run a dual - boot machine .
More troubling for Apple is the prospect that its operating system and applications software can now run natively on ( much cheaper ) PC hardware .
The company is set against this , but already programmers have hacked it and it is difficult to see how Apple could stop the practice .
If it catches on , Apple might see sales of its computers decline as those who admire Apple software but dislike its hardware prices get the best of both worlds .
If Apple is ambivalent about the future , you should see Intel 's smouldering fury as the implications of the launch dawned on it .
Not only did Jobs decline to go along with the ' Intel inside ' mantra embossed on most Windows machines , he authorised a television ad that left the company 's executives speechless . '
The Intel chip ' , it burbles . '
For years , it 's been trapped inside PCs , inside dull little boxes , dutifully performing dull little tasks , when it could have been doing so much more .
Starting today , the Intel chip will be set free and get to live life inside a Mac .
Imagine the possibilities . '
How do you spell ' chutzpah ' again ? john.naughton@observer.co.uk"
2006-01-25,"Walt Disney , the media and entertainment group , put animation back at the heart of its strategy when it announced the $ 7.4bn ( £ 4.1bn ) acquisition of Pixar , the company behind Finding Nemo and Toy Story last night .
The all - share deal makes Steve Jobs , the head of Pixar and founder of Apple computers , the largest single shareholder in the theme park and media group with an estimated 7 % stake .
He also gets a seat on the Disney board .
His position is expected to help drive Disney 's ambition to unite its old media properties with new media technology .
Although last night 's acquisition does not involve Apple , analysts expect further collaboration between the two companies .
In recent years Disney has failed to produce the sort of blockbuster animated movies on which it built its reputation .
In contrast , in its 22 years under the control of Mr Jobs , Pixar has led the way in computer - generated animation with films such as the Incredibles , Toy Story and Monsters Inc.
Yesterday 's deal , which was first mooted several months ago , marks a coming of age for Bob Iger , the Disney chief executive who was promoted last October .
Under his predecessor , Michael Eisner , Disney and Pixar feuded with Mr Jobs looking for other finance and distribution partners .
Mr Iger has said that a strong Disney depends on a strong animation department .
The other planks of its revitalisation strategy include new media platforms and international expansion .
Last night , he said : "" The addition of Pixar significantly enhances Disney animation , which is a critical creative engine for driving growth across our businesses . ""
In a statement , Mr Jobs said : "" Disney and Pixar can now collaborate without the barriers that come from two different companies with two different sets of shareholders .
Now , everyone can focus on what is most important , creating innovative stories , characters and films that delight millions of people around the world . ""
Analysts welcomed the deal , which was first leaked last week , but some have voiced concerns about the impact on Pixar .
The culture of the company , which is based in Emeryville , northern California , is more akin to the Silicon Valley ethos of Mr Jobs 's Apple than its Hollywood rivals .
In a conference call last night , directors from both sides sought to play down these cultural differences .
Mr Iger "" welcomed and embraced Pixar 's unique culture "" while John Lasseter , the creative director behind most of the Pixar 's successes , said : "" For many of us at Pixar , it was the magic of Disney that influenced us to pursue our dreams of becoming animators , artists , storytellers and filmmakers . ""
Mr Lasseter , a former Disney employee , will become the chief creative officer of the combined animation studios , as well as principal creative adviser at Walt Disney Imagineering .
Pixar 's president Ed Catmull will become president of both studios , reporting to Mr Iger .
The relationship between the two companies goes back 15 years with a joint financing and distribution deal that led to Toy Story , the first fully computer animated film and the highest - grossing film of 1995 .
History in the making Pixar goes back to 1984 when animator John Lasseter left Disney to join the special effects group run by Star Wars film maker George Lucas .
Two years later the computer graphics division was spun off and purchased by Steve Jobs of Apple fame .
For four years it concentrated on commercials and the odd award - winning short .
In 1991 , a deal was struck with Walt Disney Studios to produce three animated features .
In 1995 , as Toy Story was released , the firm floated on Wall Street .
Toy Story raked in $ 362 m worldwide .
Disney extended its deal : Bug 's Life , Toy Story 2 , Monsters , Inc , Finding Nemo and , most recently , The Incredibles .
Next blockbuster will be Cars - Lasseter returns to the director 's chair for a tale of animated cars getting their kicks on Route 66 ."
2006-01-25,""" The Walt Disney Co on Tuesday said it would buy Pixar Animation Studios in a $ 7.4 billion deal that gives Pixar animators creative control over the world 's most famous cartoon studio and makes Pixar CEO Steve Jobs one of Disney 's largest shareholders , "" reports Reuters .
"" The deal gives Jobs a stake in Disney worth some $ 3.7 billion . """
2006-01-27,"One imagines that when rumours about Disney buying Pixar first began whistling around that folk up in Microsoft 's headquarters in Redmond began to feel uneasy .
The reason : as Disney 's biggest shareholder , Steve Jobs ( CEO of Pixar and of course of Apple ) is surely going to give Windows Media a hard time .
And while Disney does n't lead the studios in content distribution , it does have a voice in the development of digital downloads .
What if Disney said that it would prefer Apple 's formats over Microsoft 's ... ?
Microsoft does , or did , have a relationship already with Disney :
this deal signed in February 2004 seemed to be about to open the floodgates .
Except ... nothing seemed to come of it .
As Joe Wilcox , the Jupiter analyst , points out , there had already been a deal with MSN and Disney in 2002 .
Again , little seemed to come out of it .
However , conspiracy theorists should consider this .
Jobs in his role on Disney 's board will be constrained by the same code that constrains any board - level executive in a publicly - owned company : the things they do must be intended to increase shareholder value .
( That was always the mantra of the characters in Neil Stephenson 's Cryptonomicon , and that 's because that 's what they have to do - or at least say they 're trying to do . )
Things that can be interpreted as not encouraging the company to grow can lead to lawsuits .
Very expensive lawsuits .
The question is , does it increase Disney 's shareholder value more if it ties up a distribution deal with Microsoft , or with Apple ?
Here 's the problem for Jobs .
If he votes for a measure in which Disney ties up with Microsoft , stockholders in Apple could claim that he has acted in a way that does n't increase their shares ' value .
They could sue him .
If he does something where Apple gets the nod , to the exclusion of Microsoft , Disney shareholders might claim that by siding with the minority company , he has failed to increase their shareholder value .
( And as Jobs will be the largest single shareholder in Disney , he could even sue himself . )
The situation seems impossible , to be honest .
But it 's hard to imagine that there wo n't be some maneouvring behind the scenes to .. encourage Disney towards licensing Apple .
At the very least , you could expect that Apple will get an easier listen than it ever might have .
So this is n't a death knell for Microsoft 's Windows Media format .
But it must surely be a significant leg up for Apple 's Quicktime format , even though it seems to lack the strong DRM that the Hollywood studios like that is found in Windows Media Video .
And what 's weirder is that all these shenanigans could make Bob Cringely 's oddball prediction from June 2005 -
"" That 's the story as I see it unfolding .
Steve Jobs finally beats Bill Gates .
And with the sale of Apple to Intel , Steve accepts the position of CEO of the Pixar / Disney / Sony Media Company "" - come at least half true .
And half true is better than nothing , as any journalist , or blogger , will tell you ."
2006-02-01,"That 's what it costs Larry Ellison -- boss of the Oracle software company , and buddies with Steve Jobs -- just to get by , according to a series of emails released by San Mateo County Superior Court Judge John Schwartz and picked up by The San Francisco Chronicle . ""

2006-02-24,"Apple Keynote Bloopers at Tauquil 's Blog Despite what some may have you believe
, the famed Steve Jobs Apple Keynotes do n't always go to plan .
Behind the effortless veneer goes a lot of preparation but even the most orchestrated and well rehearsed show suffers from the occasional mishap .
This wonderful video by Macintologist , shows just that .
Fantastic compilation video of things not going right .
I think I 've seen them all but for the Phil Schiller one .
Worth waiting for the 10 MB download .
( You are on broadband , right ? )"
2006-02-28,"No video iPod , no magic home media system ( unless you count the updated Mac mini ) , no movie downloads over the web ..
if you are one of those people who believes all the rumours ahead of an Apple event , you 'll have a familiar feeling after Apple 's latest announcement .
So what has Apple done ?
Shifted the Mac mini to an Intel - based version , both single- and double - core , which Steve Jobs claimed are respectively between 2.5 - 3x and 5.5x faster than their PowerPC ancestors .
Prices however have gone up slightly .
Jobs also said that Apple is on track to convert its entire line of Macs to Intel - based processors by the end of the year .
Since there 's only the iBook ( MacBook ? ) and PowerMac ( if the PowerBook became the MacBook Pro , will this become the MacMac Pro ? ) to go , and it 's not yet March , that seems to leave some headroom .
And on the iPod front , you can - now try to stay calm - get an Italian leather case for your video iPod and iPod nano ( funny how much Apple is into cases for the iPod since all that scratching stuff ) .
Plus , ahah , Apple has itself put a toe into the $ 1 billion ( reckons the New York Times ) market for iPod accessories , launching the iPod Hi - Fi , which Jobs called a "" reinvented home stereo "" .
It 's a single - unit white system with three speakers and an iPod dock on top ( which accommodates all iPods apart from the shuffle , which can use an auxiliary input ) .
There 's also SPDIF optical audio in ; and it can run on batteries .

2006-03-30,"Today 's NewsBytes ( in the printed edition ) noted that Avadis "" Avie "" Tevanian , Apple 's chief software technology officer , is leaving at the end of the month .
Tevanian worked on Mach OS at Carnegie Mellon University , where he declined Microsoft 's job offer and was hired instead by Next 's Steve Jobs to create the NextStep operating system .
He then became part of what amounted to a reverse take - over when Apple paid $ 400 m to buy Next , to get a replacement for Mac OS .
Next 's founder , Steve Jobs , became Apple 's chief executive , Tevanian took over Apple 's software , and Next 's hardware guy , Jon Rubinstein , got control over Apple 's hardware , including ( later ) the iPod .
Pretty good going for refugees from a small , failing workstation company !
Rubinstein had already announced his retirement ( he 's not old enough , but he 's certainly rich enough ) and it was something of a surprise when Tevanian decided to leave at the same time .
It 's certainly possible to imagine that the two events are somewhat related , but who knows ?

"" Rhapsody will be offered for both Intel - based PCs and Macs , so users will no longer need to buy an Apple computer to run the next generation of Macintosh software , "" I was told .

Rhapsody was basically NextStep , the Yellow Box is now known as Cocoa while the Blue Box became Classic .
And while the Intel beta versions of Rhapsody disappeared very quickly , we now know that NextStep 's processor - independent features were carefully preserved , allowing Apple to switch Mac OS X from PowerPC to Intel x86 .
Not everybody has been entirely happy with everything about the Tevanian regime .
For example , some people think the Dock , inherited from NextStep , is a bit of a usability disaster ( and the Expose kludge does n't altogether fix that ) , and that the NextStep Finder is n't as good as the Mac OS original .
But 10 years after , we can see that Jobs , Rubinstein and Tevanian did save Apple , and it will be interesting to see how well Jobs manages without them ."

2006-03-30,"It was an icon of the 60s taking a bite out of a defining image of the 21st century : the Beatles ' record label , Apple Corps , yesterday claimed the US computer giant Apple "" flagrantly violated "" an agreement not to use its logo to sell music .
Seeking millions of pounds in damages and an injunction that would wipe the apple trademark from the iTunes Music Store , Apple Corps , still owned by the former Beatles and their heirs , claimed Apple Computer Inc broke a $ 26.5 m ( £ 15.3 m ) settlement in which the company founded by Steve Jobs agreed not to use its apple trademark "" in connection with musical content "" .
Neither Jobs nor Sir Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr were present but the companies that symbolise the past and the present of popular music faced each other in a courtroom bristling with flat screens , laptops and even an iPod .
The judge , a self - confessed iPod owner , described his visits to iTunes as a barrister downloaded and played the disco classic Le Freak to a small army of corporate lawyers .
Geoffrey Vos QC , for Apple Corps , accused Apple Computer of trying to "" drive a coach and horses "" through the 1991 agreement , hammered out after more than 100 days in court after an acrimonious dispute sprung up following the creation of the all - conquering computer company 30 years ago .
Mr Vos told the court that Mr Jobs had been inspired by the example of the Beatles ' company when he founded Apple Computer in 1976 .
Despite refashioning the distinctive logo modelled on a green Granny Smith by taking a bite out of it , Mr Jobs 's company met the Beatles in court in 1981 .
Agreeing a strict "" field of use "" for the apple trademark , Apple Computer accepted it could not use its trademark in the music business .
Ten years later , Corps allowed Computer to use its apple trademarks for computer "" delivery systems "" - including equipment for recording and reproducing music .
The Beatles ' company , which has sold 24 m copies of the Beatles compilation One but still refuses to allow the band 's music on iTunes Music Store , retained an exclusive right to use its trademarks in connection with music .
What the 1991 settlement did not foresee , the court heard , was the digital revolution , the rise of downloads and the hugely successful iTunes Music Store , which has sold 1bn songs .
Apple Corps said Mr Jobs approached Neil Aspinall , the Beatles roadie who became the company 's managing director , and offered to buy the name Apple Records for $ 1 m in March 2003 , the month before the launch of iTunes Music Store .
Corps , owned by McCartney , Starr , Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison , George Harrison 's widow , refused . ""
Although the word ' apple ' was deliberately not included in the name iTunes Music Store itself , ' apple ' marks were and have been used on and in connection with the website itself with great prominence , "" said Mr Vos .
"" The music store marked a radical change of direction for Computer ...
For Computer to go into the business of selling recorded music itself was quite new . ""
Demonstrating the store on a laptop wired to big screens at the high court in London , Mr Vos said the repeated presence of the "" brushed aluminium "" Apple logo on the website was "" used as closely as it is possible to imagine in connection with the sale of music "" .
He claimed Apple Computer 's argument that iTunes Music Store is simply a conduit for music between record company and music fan was a "" perversion "" of its agreement to remain a computer "" delivery system "" .
While the 1991 settlement barred Computer from using its logo in "" physical media "" such as CDs , Mr Vos said it also covered "" tangible or intangible "" means of recording and communicating these works .
For an agreement forged in the pre - internet age , this successfully anticipated the rise of digital downloads , he said .
"" Permanent downloads are the new CDs .
It can not be credibly suggested that they are materially different to other forms of recorded music delivered to the public in permanent form . ""
As the 1978 disco anthem Le Freak rang out in court , Mr Vos said iTunes Music Store did not simply pass on pre - recorded songs but offered tracks in a unique form of compressed and encrypted files .
Citing PJ Harvey and Elvis Costello , he said iTunes also offered exclusive recordings by popular artists and its unique digital "" box sets "" such as a 579-track Stevie Wonder collection for £ 139.99p .
Coldplay also stepped into the court - in video form - as Mr Vos played an advertisement for iTunes Music Store in which the band performed Speed of Sound before the apple logo appeared on screen .
"" That apple is as flagrant a violation of this [ 1991 ] agreement as it is possible to imagine , "" he said .
The case continues .

2006-03-31,"It is a bit odd to be celebrating the 30th birthday of a computer manufacturer but the fact is that hardly any have survived to reach 30 years .
Nearly all the first movers have long since departed this world , replaced by a new wave of companies .
Apple , the flamboyant pioneer of personal computers , very nearly went to an early grave itself some years after co - founder Steve Jobs was kicked out following a power struggle in 1985 .
Jobs returned 12 years later to pull Apple from the brink of oblivion to engineer one of the most spectacular turnrounds in corporate history .
After revamping the product line with beautifully designed iMac desktop computers and iBook portables , he then revolutionised the music world by launching the iPod digital music player which soon became a must - have gadget even spawning a sassy label for its users , "" the iPod generation "" .
However , despite the hype in the media , a revitalised Apple still has barely 3 % of the global market for personal computers .
But its iPod has around 70 % of music downloads prompting one commentator to remark that its iTunes music store is becoming one of the most powerful retailers ever .
That may be overdoing it .
Apple remains an over - secretive company run by a brilliant if erratic businessman which may well get its comeuppance if its increasingly monopolistic presence is challenged by newcomers .
In that event , though , you would still expect Steve Jobs to bounce back .
It is in his genes ."
2006-04-03,"The squabble between Apple and the music industry over how much iTunes downloads should cost is one that 's been going on for some time .
Last year , at a press conference in Paris ( and later in an interview I did with him ) , Steve Jobs said the result of variable pricing would be more piracy .
"" If they want to raise prices , it 's because they 're greedy .
If the price goes up , people turn back to piracy - and everybody loses . ""
Now a note on the PaidContent blog suggests that the debate between music labels and Apple over variable pricing is unlikely to be resolved soon .
The AP 's thesis -- "" any moves to abandon uniform pricing will test whether music fans are willing to pay more to download music that many only a few years ago acquired for free "" -- tracks Jobs ' contention that variable pricing only encourages piracy .
Analysts give Apple 's market share the edge in this debate .
Variable pricing is a big issue , and labels are lobbying hard to change the iTunes model .
They say it will let them sell music at a lower price .
Of course , the converse is also true : selling in - demand music at a higher premium is really what the industry is after .
Flogging off cheaper niche tracks is just a fringe benefit .
Last year a thought - provoking piece by Joel Spolsky also referred to this issue .
In it , Spolsky said that variable pricing should n't be adopted because it implies that the cheaper product is worse .
Pricing sends a signal .
People have come to believe that "" you get what you pay for .
"" If you lowered the price of a movie , people would immediately infer from the low price that it 's a crappy movie and they would n't go see it .
If you had different prices for movies , the $ 4 movies would have a lot less customers than they get anyway .
I think he 's wrong in many ways .
Most cinemas do charge different prices for movies ; usually dependent on the time , or the nature of the show ( for example I went to a two - for - one double bill last weekend of His Girl Friday and
Some Like It Hot at the Curzon - both genuine classics , but I saw both for £ 6.50 . )
Similarly , if I walk into a high street music shop , I do n't expect to see every CD on sale for £ 9.99 ( in fact , I 'm bombarded with variable prices ) .
But Spolsky 's argument does raise an interesting point , because ultimately variable prices rely on supply and demand .
It does n't take an economics professor to realise that popular tracks would increase in price and unpopular ones would decrease .
But because we 're not dealing in physical formats , why should higher demand mean higher cost ?
After all , there 's no scarcity of stock for popular music sold on iTunes : in theory , it can be downloaded by an infinite number of people ( indeed , this week 's top - selling single was download - only ) .
Similarly , selling less popular downloads for a lower price is about making a sale full stop , not about selling existing stock .
We should n't naively expect that variable pricing would keep prices at the same mean price - but would such a change be worth it for you ?"
2006-04-07,"Cover artistry ...
what 's your favourite version of a Beatles song ?
Thanks for all your suggestions about food - related songs .
This week , let 's take a cue from the fact that Steve Jobs and the Beatles ' estate are at it again over the use of the brand Apple .
Of all the fruit in all the world , they both had to pick that one .
That 's one reason , alongside the notorious preciousness of Apple Corps boss Neil Aspinall , that the Beatles remain aloof from the download throng .
However , the holders of their publishing rights ( including one M. Jackson ) have always been less discriminating and the cover versions are plentiful .
As a change from recent broad themes such as plants and food , I 'd like to collect 10 of the most interesting Beatles covers , from the cheesy to the sublime .
Post - split solo material also counts and they do n't all have to be available to download .
And if Stelios could please refrain from posting his CV on the blog this week that would be peachy .
Deadline for recommendations is Monday 1 pm .

Here 's how it works ."
2006-05-11,"Do n't hold your breath .
Although Neil Aspinall , manager of Apple Corps , which manages the intellectual property of the Beatles said during the recent court case - in which his company sued Apple Computer over the use of an apple logo and the existence of the iTunes Music Store - that the Beatles ' music is being digitally remastered , and although Steve Jobs ( chief executive of Apple Computer ) then extended an iPod - shaped olive branch by saying : "" We have always loved the Beatles , and hopefully we can now work together to get them on the [ store ] "" , this could have some way to run .
A spokeswoman for Apple Corps told us this week that there is "" no date planned for the downloads ; it 's one of many projects Apple [ Corps ] is working on "" .
She said the timing wo n't have anything to do with the appeal , announced by Aspinall directly after Mr Justice Mann ruled that the iTunes Music Store had not infringed a 1991 agreement between the two companies .
But as the case has already cost each side £ 1.5 m ( and the loser will have to pay all the fees ) , one might think it would make sense for Apple Corps to garner a bit of revenue from the organisation it has tried to sue , as well as other music download or subscription sites , too .
But instead they may just try to get by with a little help from m'learned friends .
As it has taken since September 2003 for this latest round in the dispute ( probably Apple Computer 's oldest , dating all the way back to 1978 ) to be settled , we 're not holding out much hope of a resolution before next year .
Meanwhile , the only legal download of a Beatles song performed by a Beatle is Paul McCartney , aided and abetted by U2 , singing Sergeant Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band at last year 's London Live8 concert , which took just 45 minutes to go from recording to download , a world record confirmed by the Guinness Book of Records .
The judgment hinged on the question of whether the iTunes Music Store , and its use of Apple Computer 's logo , constitutes trademark infringement .
Unfortunately for Apple Corps , part 1.2 of its 1991 agreement allows Apple Computer to indulge in "" ... data processing services , data transmission services ... "" while barring it from "" any current or future creative work whose principal content is music and/or musical performances ; regardless of the means by which those works are recorded , or communicated , whether tangible or intangible "" .
The key word there is "" creative "" .
Is the iTunes Music Store "" creative "" ?
As "" swissfondue "" commented on the Technology blog , "" Apple Computer is as much a record label as Amazon is a book publisher "" .
Which is pretty much the view Mr Justice Mann took .
( Or vice - versa . )
You can read Justice Mann 's judgment online at http://tinyurl.com/fwykm
- we recommend it if you ever want to understand , in plain English , how the iTunes store works .
And we liked his joke : "" Both parties submitted that the position is simple and straightforward , which is a pretty good indication that it is not .

2006-06-21,"The tiny screen of an iPod might not seem the best medium for enjoying the sweeping landscapes of The Lord of the Rings trilogy , or the breathtaking action scenes from Titanic .
But such appears to be the goal of Steve Jobs , chief executive of Apple , who is in negotiations with most of Hollywood 's big studios to make feature films available for download via the firm 's online music software , iTunes .
The company , which already controls more than 75 % of the music - download industry , hopes to introduce a service that would allow users to download films for $ 9.99 ( about £ 5.40 ) each by the autumn .
If it followed the pattern of Apple 's involvement in music , it would launch in the US , and might not prove quite such a bargain when it arrived in the UK . ""
Steve wants to get this done , and the studios want to reach an agreement , too , "" one person with knowledge of the negotiations was quoted as saying in the New York Times .
Disney , on whose board Mr Jobs sits , is expected to be the first studio to make its films available .
The path to any deal , however , is likely to be difficult .
The fact that films have different release dates in different countries will exacerbate studios ' fears about piracy .
They are also understood to have defeated Mr Jobs 's attempts to impose a single purchase price for all movies , with the studios receiving a 70 % wholesale rate .
"" We ca n't be put in a position where we lose the ability to price our most popular content higher than less popular stuff , "" one executive told Forbes magazine .
The Apple founder won a similar battle with the music industry , but has less power in the field of movies delivered over the internet than he had at that time in the field of music .
In the US , several websites already offer subscription - based access to movies online .
The smallness of the iPod 's screen has not prevented Apple from successfully marketing some music videos and , in the US , television shows , via iTunes .
But the files are of too low a resolution to be watchable when expanded to the size of an Apple computer screen .
That could prove an obstacle to the success of downloadable films - or it might suggest that Apple is fashioning a deal that would allow films to be watched on ordinary screens .
That would lend support to rumours that the company is planning to launch a "" living room device "" , combining television and downloadable movies and music in a single delivery system .
The new generation of Mac computers can already be used , with a remote control , to act as a jukebox and DVD player .
The iPod , meanwhile , faces potential competition from a rival device reportedly being planned by Microsoft and developed in collaboration with Amazon ."
2006-06-30,"Apple has become the latest US company to admit that it may have mishandled the handing out of potentially lucrative executive stock options during the dotcom boom .
The Californian maker of computers and the iconic iPod music player said late yesterday it had brought in independent counsel to carry out a thorough review of the handing out of options between 1997 and 2001 , including a batch for chief executive Steve Jobs , after an internal inquiry found potential "" irregularities "" .
Share options have played an important role in remuneration at Apple .
Mr Jobs is paid just a $ 1 annual salary with the company instead rewarding him through other means .
He was once , for instance , given a Gulfstream jet .
Almost 60 US companies are involved in a scandal over the pricing of options during the boom .
Stock options - known as share options in the UK - are given to executives to tie their interest in a company 's future more closely with that of shareholders .
If the share price goes up , the options could be worth millions ; if the share price falls , they are worthless .
When awarded share options are set an "" exercise price "" at which the executive can buy the stock after a certain date in the future .
The idea being that if the stock has risen by then , the executive can buy up all the shares by exercising his options at the pre - set lower price .
He can then sell them all in the market at a healthy profit or sell as many as he needs to cover the cost of buying them all , and keep the rest of the shares just like any other shareholder .
If the stock falls , the shares are termed "" under water "" and there is no point in the executive buying them because the pre - set asking price is more than they are worth in the market .
Options are also set a time limit of several years , after which they lapse .
The US markets regulator , the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , is investigating whether companies artificially boosted potential gains by backdating the award of share options .
During the dotcom boom , technology stocks were rampant and could jump more than 10 % in a day so the timing of allotment could be crucial .
The US Justice Department is also investigating the matter and has subpoenaed information from several companies about stock options .
The options packages being scrutinised in Apple 's investigation include a batch received by chief executive Steve Jobs when he took up the post on January 5 2000 .
When he stepped up to the top job , he was gifted one of the largest options grants in US corporate history , but the actual option price was set a week after he joined , by which time Apple 's share price had dropped 16 % .
He was given the option to buy 20 m shares at $ 87.19 each and the company reckoned they would be worth $ 548 m if Apple 's stock increased 5 % annually for the next decade .
A few days after the grant , Apple 's shares were back at $ 113.50 but that strong performance was not to last and the award to Mr Jobs was ultimately worthless as Apple 's stock slid as the dotcom bubble burst .
In March 2003 , Mr Jobs surrendered all his controversial share options in exchange for five million actual shares in the company .
In fact , back dating stock options is not illegal but may cause other problems with a company 's accounts , including having an impact on tax payments if not properly reported .
"" Apple is a quality company , and we are proactively and transparently disclosing what we have discovered to the SEC , "" Mr Jobs said .
"" We are focused on resolving these issues as quickly as possible . """

2006-07-09,"You may remember a brief frisson when Steve Jobs , Apple 's chief executive , announced that the company was switching from IBM processors and would put Intel processors in Apple Macs .
Some devotees regarded this as akin to a religious betrayal ; more detached folk regarded it as inevitable .
IBM had refused to develop the PowerPC processor line any further and it would have been nuts for Apple to go into the chip business .
That left only Intel .
QED .
Now Apple computers come with Intel 's Dual Core processor inside .
This columnist is the proud owner of one such machine .
For the most part , it is indistinguishable from its predecessor , except that it runs much faster .
Naturally , it runs OS X , Apple 's operating system .
It also runs almost all of the applications created for the earlier processor architecture , so I have n't had to upgrade anything .
So far , so banal ; now comes the interesting bit .
I downloaded a program called Parallels Desktop .
It 's an example of ' virtualisation ' software .
When installed , it popped up a window asking if there were any other operating systems I 'd like to run on my machine .
I happened to have a disk with the latest distribution of Ubuntu Linux , so I popped it in the drive , and lo !
It began to install itself on my hard drive .
Parallels had created a ' virtual machine ' inside my physical machine .
And Linux runs on that virtual machine as if it owned the computer .
So I can switch instantly between OS X and Linux .
At this point , dear reader , I know what you 're thinking .
However fascinating this ' virtual machine ' nonsense may be to geeks , it 's of no interest to normal human beings .
You may feel as Mrs Dave Barry did when her husband , the Miami Herald humorist , took her for a spin in a Humvee and proudly explained that the vehicle could inflate and deflate its tyres while in motion .
Why , she asked , would anyone want to do that ?
So what 's the point of virtualisation ?
Simply that it provides a vivid illustration of the most disruptive attribute of digital technology - its capability to break the link between an application and a physical platform .
Once upon a time , if you bought a PC it ran Windows , and if you bought a Mac it ran Apple 's operating system .
But now Macs run Windows , and IBM ThinkPads - which have the same processor - can run OS X ( though of course Apple is doing its best to head off that possibility ) .
And Linux runs on everything .
This disconnection of application/ service from hardware is happening all over the place .
For example , ' radio ' used to mean a physical device .
Now radio has gone digital and can be received on phones , the web and via digital , satellite and terrestrial television receivers .
DAB radios have screens .
And TV signals are now being streamed to 3 G mobile phones .
Similarly , telephones were once heavy Bakelite devices tethered to the wall .
Then they went mobile .
Phone calls can now be made by sitting in front of a computer running Skype and just talking out loud .
The same thing is happening to computing .
A ' computer ' was once a giant mainframe machine tended by legions of white - coated attendants .
Then it became the ' personal ' computer on your desk .
To use it you installed programs that turned it into a word processor , spreadsheet calculator , drawing machine or whatever .
The ' platform ' was the computer .
Then came the net and the web and , later , broadband , enabling the provision of computing services over the network .
Why keep your photos on your hard drive when you can store them online ?
Why run a program on your computer to handle email when you can access your mail anywhere using Hotmail or Gmail ?
Why buy Microsoft Word when you can do your word - processing online using Writely ?
The day will come when most people 's needs will be met not by buying a computer , but by accessing those services via whatever device they are using at the time .
The network is becoming the computer .
And the moral ?
If your business is platform - specific , diversify .

Salary : $ 1 2005 ranking : 6 Jobs transformed the music industry and in the process created a whole new demographic - the "" iPod generation "" .
Launched just five years ago , the ubiquitous music players have gone from being the preserve of the early adopter to a part of our everyday language .
Having transformed the way we consume music , Jobs is now doing the same for television with the launch of the video iPod , capable of showing films and TV programmes downloaded from the net .
Hit shows such as Lost , Desperate Housewives and the American version of The Office are already available in the iTunes store .
A next - generation video iPod and a new iTunes movie service are expected to launch later this year .
Broadcasters ignore the new technology at their peril .
With around 70 % of the market , the one billionth song was downloaded on iTunes this year - Coldplay 's Speed of Sound , appropriately - prompting some observers to suggest that Apple was on the verge of becoming the most powerful retailer ever .
The phenomenon of podcasting , meanwhile , gave a voice to millions of would - be broadcasters around the globe .
It turned newspapers into radio stations , and radio stations into audio and video - on - demand services .
Put simply , the old definitions and barriers to entry simply do not apply any more . ""
There is not a media boardroom in the world that Jobs could not walk into , "" was one panellist 's verdict .
"" Everyone is trying to second guess what he does next .
He is influencing everyone 's thinking .
"" Jobs rises four places in this year 's list , keeping Rupert Murdoch in the No 3 spot for the second year in a row - although last year , Murdoch was behind joint top dogs Mark Thompson and Michael Grade .
Apple was co - founded by Jobs in 1976
and this year won a trademark battle with the Beatles over the use of its apple logo on iTunes .
Jobs was kicked out of the company following a power struggle in 1985 , but returned 12 years later to resurrect its fortunes with the iMac and the iBook .
But the biggest Apple revolution was still to come .
Apple reported its best - ever quarterly results in the last quarter of 2005 , with a net profit of $ 565 m on revenues of $ 5.75bn .
Over the past six months it has generated more than $ 10bn in revenue , with earnings of almost $ 1bn .
Meanwhile , Jobs became the biggest single shareholder in ABC parent Disney this year following its $ 7.4bn acquisition of his animation studio , Pixar , responsible for hit films such as Toy Story , Finding Nemo and The Incredibles .
With an estimated 7 % stake in the company , he also sits on the Disney board .
Jobs ' story is a remarkable one .
A college dropout , he was worth more than $ 100 m by the time he was 25 , and is now a self - made billionaire .
But what chance an Apple backlash ? ""
Apple remains an over - secretive company run by a brilliant if erratic businessman which may well get its comeuppance if its increasingly monopolistic presence is challenged by new- comers , "" said a Guardian leader in April .
"" In that event , though you would still expect Steve Jobs to bounce back .
It is in his genes . """
2006-07-17,"His company has turned the music industry on its head and made a sliver of plastic and chrome one of the most desirable consumer items on the planet .
Now Apple founder and chief executive Steve Jobs is shaking up the established order in the media industry , with the annual MediaGuardian 100 power list today showing him leapfrogging News Corp mogul Rupert Murdoch into second place .
The top spot is taken by BBC director general Mark Thompson , recently in the news for his £ 619,000 salary but also for his radical restructuring of the corporation .
He is axing thousands of jobs to raise £ 355 m a year to spend on remodelling the BBC for the digital age .
Last year he shared first place with his chairman , but in 2006 Michael Grade has dropped to seventh in the annual barometer of media influence after taking a back seat role during a charter review from which the BBC emerged with the licence fee guaranteed and clutching a largely favourable government white paper . ""
The BBC is on the front foot in TV , radio , online and in the regions ...
Everyone is thinking and fearing what the BBC does next , "" said judges .
The highest placed on - screen talent was Jonathan Ross , who was handed a new £ 18 m contract by the BBC but could have earned even more by jumping ship .
Ross was a new entry at 19th , and comedian Ricky Gervais debuted at number 33 based on his successful podcasts .
This year 's list was dominated by the digital media revolution .
Not only does Mr Jobs , ousted from Apple in 1985 only to return 12 years later to oversee the rise of the iMac , iPod and iTunes , ascend to second place but Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page rise to fourth .
Even well - placed figures in "" old "" media , such as Mr Thompson and Channel 4 chief executive Andy Duncan , who rises 14 places to fifth , earned their position through digital strategies .
Mr Thompson 's Creative Future vision and Mr Duncan 's success in expanding Channel 4 into radio and the internet were lauded by the judges , who included Lorraine Heggessey , the former BBC1 controller and now chief executive of Talkback Thames , and media consultant Paul Robinson .
Microsoft founder Bill Gates made it to number 9 despite stepping down from day to day management of the company , and Carphone Warehouse chief Charles Dunstone entered the list at 20 .
Richard Littlejohn , who this year moved from the Sun to the Daily Mail , was the biggest faller , while former Today editor Kevin Marsh and departed Daily Telegraph editor Martin Newland fell out of the top 100 altogether .
Three years after topping the list , former BBC director general Greg Dyke crept back in at number 100 by virtue of his failed bid to take control of ITV and the likelihood that he will try again ."

2006-07-17,"Given the trend for this sort of thing , perhaps we should call it the MediaGuardian 100 2.0 .
Never before has new media had such an impact on our annual power list of the industry 's most important players - now in its sixth year .
Half of this year 's top 10 either embody the digital revolution ( Apple chief executive Steve Jobs , Google co - founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page ) or have been quick to grasp the opportunities it has to offer , such as Channel 4 chief executive Andy Duncan .
It was the year when we stopped talking about watching TV on the web , and started doing it .
But top of this year 's MediaGuardian 100 is the man Duncan succeeded at Channel 4 , BBC director general Mark Thompson .
New media is at the heart of Thompson 's long - term vision for the corporation , based around the delivery of content on MP3 players , mobile phones , interactive TV and the web .
The director general claimed that the BBC is the only European brand that can take on Google and AOL .
Much to the chagrin of its UK commercial rivals , it asked for an inflation - busting licence fee hike to fund it .
Thompson and chairman Michael Grade successfully negotiated the tortuous process of charter renewal , avoiding the twin threat of external regulation and "" top slicing "" of the licence fee , putting the corporation in a stronger position than it has enjoyed for decades .
Or , in the words of one of our panellists : "" In TV , radio , online and in the regions , everyone is thinking and fearing what the BBC does next . ""
Thompson shared top billing in last year 's list with Grade .
This year , having stamped his authority on the channel with his far - reaching Creative Future review , and doggedly followed through the biggest single round of job cuts in its history , the director general goes it alone .
Rupert Murdoch is in third place for the second year running - although last year this was because of the joint top ranking of Thompson and Grade .
This year , he has been overtaken by the Apple boss Steve Jobs .
Having transformed the way we consume music and turned us into a nation of portable content freaks with the iPod , Jobs is about to do the same with TV .
To be fair , no one has been sounding the death knell for old media barons louder than Murdoch .
Having pretty much ignored the web first time around in the late 1990s , the News Corp chairman and chief executive went on a new media spending spree , buying up community website MySpace and video gaming company IGN Entertainment .
But where he was once a leader , with Sky TV and the Wapping print revolution , Murdoch now looks like a follower , albeit one with a global media empire generating a turnover of nearly $ 24bn .
The ultimate new media success story and the unofficial gatekeepers to the web , Google co - founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page , are in joint fourth place .
They are followed by Channel 4 chief executive Andy Duncan , who finishes ahead of his director of television , Kevin Lygo , for the first time .
With his vision for new media in particular , Duncan - like Thompson at the BBC - has made Channel 4 his own over the past 12 months .
Duncan is one position above his ITV counterpart , Charles Allen .
It was going to be the other way round , but Allen 's announcement of further budget cuts at ITV last month was a setback too far , and the pair belatedly swapped places .
Duncan 's time has come .
Has Allen 's gone ?
Rupert Murdoch is one of only two people to appear in every top 10 since the MediaGuardian 100 began in 2001 .
The other is Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre .
The Associated Newspapers editor - in - chief remains the highest placed newspaper editor , despite a feeling on the panel that his paper is no longer the force it once was .
It has been a tough year for Sun editor Rebekah Wade , who made headlines of the wrong sort when she spent the night in police cells .
But Wade defied predictions of her imminent departure and moves up one place to number 12 .
News of the World boss Andy Coulson , tipped to succeed her , is just one place below .
The highest - rising newspaper editor is the Mirror 's Richard Wallace .
He has enjoyed a string of scoops , from John Prescott to Kate Moss , but these successes have yet to be reflected in the paper 's sales .
It makes a change from last year , when he was the biggest faller .
That accolade this time round goes to Richard Littlejohn , who is in danger of becoming just another columnist at the Daily Mail , something you could never have said about him at the Sun .
It was also a bad year for Express proprietor Richard Desmond .
Not financially - his personal fortune is said to have grown from £ 1.3bn to £ 1.9bn - but for his newspapers , which were among the biggest losers in the circulation war .
He falls 22 places to number 49 .
Elsewhere in publishing , Times editor Robert Thomson rises 23 places to 41 , leapfrogging the original compact champion , Independent editor - in - chief Simon Kelner , who is up two places to 53 .
All change at the Telegraph group , where editor - in - chief John Bryant is a new entry at 52 .
Such is the BBC 's ascendancy that it has 16 executives on this year 's list , plus on - screen talent including Jonathan Ross ( 19 ) , political editor Nick Robinson ( 48 ) and the man who masterminded the return of Doctor
Who , Russell T Davies , at number 28 .
The corporation provides three of the four top - placed women in the list .
Director of television Jana Bennett - tipped for a big role in Thompson 's reorganisation , which is expected this week - is the highest placed woman at number eight , followed by director of radio Jenny Abramsky at 11 and director of news Helen Boaden at number 17 .
There are 18 women on this year 's list , up three on last year and five more than 2004 .
New entries include Virgin Radio chief executive Fru Hazlitt , Kudos joint managing director Jane Featherstone , Sunday Telegraph editor Patience Wheatcroft and Green Wing creator and producer Victoria Pile .
It was a good year for people called Richard - there are six in this year 's Media Guardian 100 - but a bad year for black and Asian media , without a single representative in this year 's list .
ITV 's big winner of the past 12 months is Simon Shaps , appointed by Charles Allen to the newly - created role of director of television .
He is joined by two of the recruits to his new - look ITV commissioning team , director of entertainment and comedy Paul Jackson , at number 59 , and daytime and factual chief , Alison Sharman , at 85 .
In a difficult year for commercial radio , its highest - placed representative is Emap chief executive Tom Moloney , down 11 places to number 27 .
GCap chief executive
Ralph Bernard is also down 11 , to number 40 , reflecting troubled times at the group .
In advertising , Bartle Bogle Hegarty chief executive Nigel Bogle is the highest new entry at 54 after his agency snatched the prestigious British Airways account from M&amp;C Saatchi , whose chief executive David Kershaw is 10 places lower at 64 .
This year 's highest placed casualty is Ofcom chief executive Stephen Carter , who will step down in October .
Also out are former ITV director of programmes Nigel Pickard , who left ITV to join independent RDF ; David Mansfield , who parted company with GCap with a £ 1.13 m pay - off ; and Today editor Kevin Marsh , who quit to head the BBC 's college of journalism .
Three national newspaper editors in last year 's list left their jobs - Martin Newland from the Daily Telegraph , Sarah Sands from the Sunday Telegraph , and Andrew Gowers , who parted company with the Financial Times because of "" strategic differences "" with its owner , Pearson .
But back to new media .
Other new entries in this year 's list include Carphone Warehouse boss Charles Dunstone , who caught the industry napping with his "" free "" broadband offer , and Richard Branson , who finally broke into the TV big league when he sold Virgin Mobile to NTL .
Sky is due to unveil its long - awaited broadband offering this week .
BSkyB chief executive James Murdoch , in the year that Freeview is forecast to overtake Sky , falls four places to number 15 .
Ricky Gervais is another newcomer at 33 .
Nothing to do with Extras or The Office - he is there because his record - breaking podcast broke the age - old relationship between talent and broadcaster .
When you can put your self - made show directly on the web - and pocket the proceeds - who needs commissioning editors ?
Gervais was the first big star to do it , but he will not be the last .
A familiar name props up this year 's MediaGuardian 100 .
Three years after he toppled Rupert Murdoch from the top spot , Greg Dyke is back .
The former BBC director general 's fortunes over the next 12 months are likely to be inversely related to those of his old foe , ITV chief executive Charles Allen , whose job Dyke wants .
The ex - DG is in good company - the number 100 spot was previously filled by the likes of Lord Birt , the ITV Digital Monkey , and the ghost of Lord Reith ."
2006-07-24,"Hey , this could mean processors at dawn .
John Siracusa , the man who writes possibly the most in - depth reviews of Apple operating systems seen on this earth , has posted ahead of next week 's Apple event , where Steve Jobs is expected to unveil , oh , new Intel - based desktop pro Macs , an iPod or two ( mebbe ) and show off the next version of OSX .
And what 's he posted ?
A Keynote bingo card .
Regular readers may recall that we 've already done this - back before this year 's Macworld keynote .
And I myself thought that I kicked off the Steve Jobs keynote bingo meme wayyyy back in January 2005 .
A Google on "" keynote bingo "" brought up the link to the latter at the top , at least this morning .
While imitation is the sincerest form of flattery , and Ars Technica 's one does have the snazzy design at the top , we 're obviously wondering whether the idea exploded full - blown into his head , or whether he , you know , sort of heard about it .
It would be nice to feel the Guardian 's reach goes that far .
( Actually , "" thief "" is the wrong word .
You ca n't steal a meme , can you . )
And what about the content ?
Well , apart from having the absolute certainties - stuff like "" Boom ! ""
and "" One more thing ""
( he seems to have left out ""
Oh - that was n't meant to happen "" )
, it 's stuff that you could pretty much expect - perhaps new video iPod , new iPod nano , demo of Leopard , movie rental service ..
Precisely the stuff that Apple is going to have to do if it 's going to stay ahead of Microsoft 's Zune thing .
Update :
John emails - and posts - to point out that he 'd been doing this privately for years for WWDC keynotes .
But he graciously acknowledges that the examples above seem to have been the first on public view , though of course "" buzzword bingo "" has been around for years ( examples : an Al Gore commencement address ; a Frasier episode where they had a drink while watching Antiques Roadshow every time someone said "" veneer "" ) .
The more interesting question he raises is why Apple does n't publish the sessions from the Worldwide Developers ' Conference online or as a DVD or similar .
That would help people who ca n't or wo n't go to the show but want to develop stuff - and surely Apple needs more of those people , not fewer .
Those who can afford get the hands - on detail .
Those who ca n't watch videos .
Except - no videos if you 're not there .
Why ?
We 'll ask .."
2006-07-27,"A Skype press release hit the wires the other day , announcing Skype 1.5 for Mac OSX .
Eagerly we scanned it , and found ..
no mention of video calling .
This seemed strange ( well , maybe not ) since Skype for PCs has had video since December , and Steve Jobs has been showing off video chats over iChat since June 2003 ( and boy , does n't that one get boring quite quick ) .
It 's not that we have a lot of use for video chat , you understand .
Just that it would be nice to feel Mac users had something approaching feature parity .
( Personally , I 've made two video calls over iChat .
Both were to confirm that the thing worked - once for the stuff on my end , the other time for the stuff on the other person 's end . )
However a little ferreting by the Powerpage has turned up the link to the "" preview release "" ( can nobody say "" beta "" anymore ? ) of the Skype video version for the Mac . ""
So you 've found the Video Preview of Skype for Mac , "" the page admits , as if sighing .
So download it with glee , noting the warning that The Video Preview of Skype for Mac is only recommended for experienced users and should not be used on a production system that you depend on which you just know is the sort of lingo they use to mean "" Hey , easily - flattered !
Come over here and try our new stuff !
"" We should also note that Ed Parsons ( of Ordnance Survey ) has pointed out Routebuddy , for the Mac - surplused and GPS - deprived .
Nice one , Ed ."

Engadget
As usual , Engadget has done a great job covering a live keynote , in this case , Steve Jobs at Apple 's World Wide Developers ' Conference .
The good stuff includes a G5-replacement professional Mac with two 64-bit Intel Xeon ( Woodcrest )
Core 2 Duo chips -- the expensive ones designed for workstations and servers .
Well done Apple for not shipping a 32-bit Core Duo version and almost immediately making it obsolete ....
While highlighting the fantastic success of Apple stores , Jobs also acknowledged the strength of build - to - order in the professional Mac market .
Of course , he did n't say Apple was copying Dell 's approach .
His Holy Steveness probably believes Apple invented the idea .
The next version of OS X is scheduled for early 2007 , so it could still ship around Windows Vista time ( not counting any more Vista delays ) .
However , it 's probably not "" late "" -- did Apple ever pre - announce a date ?
The new features include Time Machine back - up , which seems to be something like a combination of Roxio 's GoBack and Centred 's Second Copy .
There 's also a virtual desktop feature , which is old hat
but -- as you 'd expect -- looks nicely done .
Since it will be bundled with the operating system , it should get more use than , say , Xerox 's Rooms for Windows .
One amusing graph showed the rise and rise of OS X , which Jobs claims now has 19 million active users .
Naturally he did n't say this was equivalent to roughly 10 weeks of Windows XP users .
He also failed to enhance the graph by contrasting the rise of OS X with the rapid delcine of , say , Windows 98 , which has now been abandoned and is fading into insignificance with only 70 million or so users .
One point picked up in several comments to Engadget 's coverage is the childish and immature sniping at Microsoft which , goodness knows , continually manages to do more damage to itself than even a megalomaniac Jobs could imagine .
Example comments include : Wow , is apple a little testy ?
I mean , their banners are like a children 's playground of badly formed insults .
amd
Pathetic , Apple , Just Pathetic , Is Apple so insecure that they have to rely on childish name calling ?
Oh , I forgot , they have a tool at the helm , Captain A - Hole - Steve Jobs .
Perhaps Jobs merely intended to "" feed the failthful "" , but it makes Apple 's management look like a bunch of jerks , it alienates potential switchers , and it just invites those who have n't drunk the Kool - Aid to snipe back .
It 's well past time you grew up , Steve .
We can snipe at least as childishly as you can , and there 's nearly a billion of us out here ."
2006-08-09,"Just went to Steve Jobs 's blog , The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs , Aged 51 1/2 , to get the facts about his underwhelming WWDC performance ( even Wired 's top Apple Cultist Leander Kahney wrote Has Steve Jobs Lost His Magic ? ) only to find that all the earlier content has disappeared .
The blog has been renamed In Memorium and just says : "" RIP .

2006-08-10,"Some people think Apple 's Steve Jobs would n't have a clue what a blog was unless he wanted to sue one , but that 's not true .
He 's been secretly writing a blog famous for its unanticipated level of honesty , and although we were recently mourning its disappearance , The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs is back !
( Many thanks to Paul Waite for providing the link in a comment to my earlier post . )

One of those involved is Iceland 's Hans - Olaf Gutmansdottir , who has an Open Sores blog at http://hans - olaf.blogspot.com/.

2006-08-18,"The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs has been hysterically funny since its recent return from death / move to a new address .
There have been four posts today about Apple 's use of chld labour in iPod manufacturing .
Yesterday we had lawyer - proof razor wire going up around the Apple campus , and the promise that armed guards would shoot journalists on sight .
There 's also been a lot of riffing on the stock options situation that has led Apple to delay its next Securities and Exchange Commission filing .

2006-08-24,"One question has been bugging me for the past couple of weeks .
Why has nobody told Steve Jobs , who earlier this month previewed the next version of Apple 's OS X operating system , named "" Leopard "" , that there is no way Microsoft could add anything he showed off then to Vista in time for its release around ( let 's be generous )
January next year ?
I ask because Jobs claimed that the Leopard demonstration ( online at http://tinyurl.com/fc8o2 or read Engadget 's report at http://tinyurl.com/qanbn ) was abridged to give the people in Redmond no more chances to copy Apple .
That , he claims , is what has been happening as OS X has moved forward in the past five years - that the folk in Microsoft just mimic whatever comes out of Apple 's Cupertino campus .
As if .
Sure , a chief executive should talk up the company 's products , but the reality is that Vista is , as they say , "" feature - complete "" , and all that 's happening now is tweaking around the user interface edges and ironing out bugs .
As I write , the first "" release candidate "" of Vista - a version meant to be almost good enough to box and sell - is hotly expected by many news sites .
Once you get to that stage , you do n't add anything .
There was no chance of doing that in the week since Jobs spoke .
As anyone who 's done any programming knows , you can not add things to an operating system just because you saw it on TV .
If it were that easy , we 'd be controlling computers with a wave of the hand , like Tom Cruise in the film Minority Report .
After all , that came out years ago .
So why did n't Jobs show off more of Leopard ?
Three possibilities come to mind .
First , it 's so unfinished - buggy , crash - prone and ugly - that it would turn people off .
This is highly unlikely , since every attendee at Apple 's Worldwide Developer Conference got a copy of the beta of Leopard ( which has duly appeared on BitTorrent , and is being blogged in detail at http://impulsivehighlighters.blogspot.com/ ) .
Or second , there is n't much else to Leopard ; it 's a consolidation release , and the "" secret features "" are twiddles that make no difference .
Third , it 's a ploy to keep Apple fans bubbling with excitement into January , when Jobs is expected to give another keynote at MacWorld in San Francisco .
Then , he 'll be aiming to divert attention from Vista 's imminent release by showing off some real ( and perhaps even interesting ) new features .
Knowing Jobs ' talent for marketing , one has to feel that the answer contains some of the third option .
Vista will come with a huge marketing blitz ; Apple has been up against that before , when the first update to OS X appeared in late September 2001 , a month ahead of Windows XP .
But the second option has some weight .
What was shown of Leopard did n't thrill .
Time Machine , a sort of automated backup - and - restore system , might look good on a stage , but those trying it are discovering all sorts of caveats .
Tabs in iChat for instant messaging and multi - user calendars are hardly revolutionary either .
But I 've learnt , in five years of using OS X , that I rarely end up using the stuff Jobs shows off in keynotes .
I do n't use Expose , rarely use Spotlight or Dashboard ( the "" widgets "" substratum , like Yahoo 's Konfabulator ) , nor Automator , nor iChat , nor Safari .
For me , the single must - have feature Apple 's engineers could build into Leopard would be speed .
But somehow I doubt that 's one of the "" secret features "" under lock and key in Cupertino .
Meanwhile , Apple fans will keep bubbling , wondering what the "" secret "" is .
Sometimes , it 's that there is no secret .

2006-09-12,"Steve Jobs has spoken - wearing , unusually , not a black turtleneck but a burgundy ( we think , from the pictures at Engadget ) shirt with buttons - and the summary is : new iPods ( bigger drives - 30 GB or 80 GB , brighter but not bigger screens , searching via scrolling ) new iPod nanos ( made of aluminium , in colours but not white - hmm ) , up to 8 GB games such as Pac - Man to play on your iPod , at $ 4.99 each an aluminium iPod shuffle that 's even smaller than the first free album art if you do n't have it on your ripped music , providing you have an iTunes account biggger ( 640x480 ) TV shows , not that that means a lot to UK and European users , who would like the chance iTunes 7 , which has a new layout , and offers movies from Disney , Pixar , Touchstone and Miramax ( ie all distributed by Disney ) .
They 'll cost $ 12.99 for pre - orers , and other films are $ 9.99 .
( No word yet on whether they 'll be available in the UK . )
Jobs says it 'll be about 30 minutes to download a movie on a 5Mb / s link . ""
One last thing "" : the "" iTV "" ( "" we need a better name "" ) which will be for wireless streaming of your films from your computer to your TV .
This will apparently be "" introduced in Q1 2007 "" .
Comments ?
Well , it 's pretty much everything that had been forecast ahead of time ; sources have clearly been massaging expectations just right to get the maximum media buzz .
( See the Guardian tomorrow . )
Expect it to garner very much more ink than Amazon 's woeful launch of Unbox .
Not a sign or a hint of the "" iPhone "" ; it was a year ago that the Motorola ROKR was launched ( and simultaneously upstaged by the iPod nano ) , and that sank like a stone .
Movies ?
In 640 by 480 , it 's a giant leap forward to 1985 , and VGA , is n't it ?
Jobs called it "" near DVD quality at 640x480 resolution "" .
Yes , but the average TV screen roughly equates to 1024 x 768 .
Anything less is n't "" near "" DVD .
It 's a quarter the size .
The rights will be the same as the TV shows - so no burning to disc .
It 's hardly terrific for a backup strategy .
We think that at those prices , the likes of Netflix - and indeed Amazon - can sleep easy .
When the physical product is cheaper than the virtual one , it 's only a contest where people wo n't travel .
And even then , the file - sharing networks have n't gone away .
The video streaming has been such an obvious product for so long that it is truly amazing that Apple is n't launching it now .
( I thought , back in October 2001 , that the "" music - related product "" Apple was going to introduce would be a wireless music and video streamer .
So , only off by a few years ... )
Quite what the point in dangling it before the masses is we do n't know , unless it 's to let down the people at Elgato - whose EyeHome product has been doing this , except without the wireless bit ( or the HD output bit ) , for years .
In all : sure to give iPod sales a surge ; sell a few more old movies ; and leave some people gagging for the iTV ( hmm , EyeTV .. iTV .. did we mention that the head of Apple Germany used to run Elgato ?
Anyway ) .
But the iTV does n't do much that you ca n't already do , if anything ; Microsoft 's Media Centre , which is included in all PCs sold now , will do your beaming of content if that 's what you want .
Though possibly not from iTunes .
It seems pricey though just to watch a film at 640x480 ."
2006-09-13,"It looks as though Steve Jobs , boss of Apple , might need a charisma download after what many people thought was a lacklustre performance - by his own high standards - at the company 's much hyped media conference jamboree in San Francisco yesterday .
Actually , since he had hardly anything new to say , he did n't make a bad fist off it .
What other company announcing a series off minor upgrades to an existing product ( the iPod ) , a film download service with an initial library of only 75 films , plus a new home entertainment product for next year , could have attracted such headlines around the world ?
Make no mistake , these are going to be difficult times for Apple .
Jobs 's resuscitation of the company after it nearly collapsed , is one of the great corporate turnarounds of US business history .
But gratitude also belongs to history .
From now on , Apple faces stiff competition on all fronts .
The iPod is still a wonderful product and will continue to have a big army of devotees but it has largely saturated the market of people who need 5,000 songs in the palm of their hands .
It simply ca n't maintain the phenomenal growth of recent years ( indeed sales have dropped for two successive quarters ) .
Statistics that still give Apple well over 75 % of the music downloads market do n't include mobile phones which now embrace increasingly big and sophisticated music players .
The mobile phone is now the most popular music player with a far wider base than the iPod , as people opt for one , rather than two , devices .
Apple is hoping that downloaded films will take over from music as a big revenue driver .
They might but if all that Mr Jobs can rustle up to start off with is less than a hundred films all related to Disney , of which he is the biggest single shareholder , then there is still a lot to play for in what is becoming an increasingly crowded market place .
You would think that an iPod - sized device would be much more suited to watching short videos from web sites such as YouTube , rather than full - length feature films , even though the resolution is , as Apple rightly claims , near DVD standard .
We shall see .
Finally , Apple announced a forthcoming device called iTV , available next year , that among other things , will be able to transmit video from a computer to a living room television screen .
Leaving aside the question of why we need an extra intermediary to get films to our television sets , the mere fact that he announced it at all , was a sign of weakness .
It was done to prevent people buying a rival device from Microsoft .
Or whoever .
This is an inversion of the normal paradigm whereby Microsoft announces unfinished products , months in advance , while Apple maintains complete secrecy until it is ready to ship .
Could it be that this was introduced because otherwise the new products would have looked very threadbare indeed ?
Meanwhile , Apple is hoping that its user friendly iTunes infrastructure will enable it to be a natural host for the video revolution .
It may .
No one should ever write off Apple 's amazing ability to reinvent itself .
But this time it is leading from the rear .
Shareholders may have to console themselves with the fact that Apple is now a much more balanced company than it used to be , firing on a number of cylinders including computers , music and video and is no longer a one - product company .
But its high - flying days may be taking a vacation ."
2006-09-13,"Writing about Steve Jobs ' cabaret act last night , my colleague Bobbie Johnson remarks of the forthcoming iTV that : "" even at an inflated $ 299 price point , it 's a damn sight cheaper than buying a media center computer . ""
Well , I guess it depends on your definition of "" heck of a lot ""
but I 'd be surprised if you could n't get a Media Center PC for something close to $ 299 -- though it wo n't be the latest and greatest model .
Wal - Mart , for example , offers the eMachines W3115 for $ 398 .
That 's $ 100 more , but the PC also includes a computer with 120 GB hard drive , keyboard , 17 in screen and speakers .
Alternatively , you could easily build your own : all PC users are free to do that .
And , of course , Media Center capability is built into Windows Vista , so most standard PCs next year will be Media Centers too .
But , obviously , the iTV is n't anything like a Media Center PC : it 's a set - top box that performs the same function as Microsoft 's old Media Center Extender idea .
Indeed , the iTV looks pretty much like , say , the Linksys Media Center Extender that came out in 2004 .
( MCE 's usually run Windows CE , which is also used in handhelds like the iPaq -- which predates the iPod -- mobile phones and other devices . )
However , today , the Media Center Extender of choice is the one built into the Xbox 360 games console , which is not a heck of a lot more than an iTV , but does a heck of a lot more .
In the UK , you can get an Xbox "" core "" system for less than £ 200 .
Wired editor Chris "" Long Tail "" Anderson is one of the many enthusiasts , and as he says , "" Apple is playing catch - up "" .
No doubt there is some amusement value in Steve Jobs 's bullshit about how Microsoft has done nothing but struggle with Vista for five years while Apple has produced a stream of $ 99 upgrades to Mac OS X.
But by the time iTV gets going , millions of homes could already have PCs running Vista beaming movies to Xbox 360 consoles attached to TV sets , synchronising with portable media players ( Archos , Creative etc ) , PDAs and Windows Mobile phones , among other things .
Maybe even the odd Tablet PC !
The one thing you can bet on is that most of these users wo n't be paying Steve Jobs - style prices to download movies ."
2006-09-13,"Coming to a small screen near you ...
Steve Jobs outlines his plans .
Photograph : Justin Sullivan/ Getty
If Steve Jobs gets his way , the phrase "" big screen "" may soon rival "" high concept "" as cinema 's most misleading expression .
The Apple chief executive yesterday outlined plans to move into full - length movie downloads for iPods to an audience of eager techies in San Francisco .
The service is starting off in a modest enough way , with just 75 films on offer .
Regular new offerings are promised , though at the moment - thanks to Mr Jobs ' other job as a company director there - it 's just the Disney studios supplying new releases .
Both Apple and Hollywood could use a boost , with sales of iPods and DVDs flattening out , but iPod cinema seems rather an outside bet .
Who , really , wants to watch a film on a screen the size of a matchbox ?
It sounds to me like a frankly unpleasant experience , but then I 'm growing old and Luddite .
And looking around at young folks , they do seem to be spending an awful lot of their time squinting at titchy screens of one sort or another , whether on phones or game consoles or indeed their iPods , as they scroll through their unnecessarily vast libraries of MP3s .
So perhaps the world is ready - in a way that it was n't when pocket TVs like Sony 's "" Watchman "" came on the market - for miniature movies .
If it does catch on , presumably there 'll be a knock - on reduction in the scale of "" big screen "" productions .
There 's not much point in filming a scene with thousands of extras if such epic details are going to shrink to pixel dimensions .
Other genres face similar challenges : you 're going to struggle to make a thumbnail - sized King Kong or Hulk look anything other than cute .
And if vulgar thrills and spills are going to lose much of their power , so is classy cinematography .
And forget about arthouse fare with subtitles .
There is a small upside to this kind of future : it might just cure the studios of their attachment to supposedly spectacular explosions - which are exactly the same in every movie - if viewers can build bigger blazes by lighting matches .
And while it 's obviously hopeful news for Tom Cruise at a difficult time , the rest of us should probably be a little alarmed - should n't we ?"
2006-09-14,""" Apparently , every copy of Mac OS X comes with a Cognitive Dissonance add - in .
This feature allows Mac cultists to loudly accuse Microsoft of ripping off features when it 's convenient , and to blindly miss the ripoffs that go the other way , "" reckons ZD Net 's Ed Bott .
Well , Steve Jobs 's presentation on Tuesday filled a lot of Windows users with feelings of deja vu .
As Bott points out , "" Apple 's new Cover Flow interface "" looks a lot like what Windows Media Center has had for four years , and the WMP interface in Vista .
( Actually , Windows Explorer did browse by album cover or artist even before that .
In any case , CoverFlow is just a third party application that Apple bought in . )
And as I pointed out yesterday , the iTV looks like an old Windows Media Extender .
Bott says : I have three Media Center extenders in this house , two first - generation models and an Xbox 360 .
On any of these extenders , I can play my entire music collection ( browsing it by album cover ) through my home theater system using a wired or wireless connection to my Media Center computer .
But unlike Apple 's device ( which wo n't be available until January 2007 )
the Xbox 360 also streams live or recorded TV and downloaded high - definition content .
It plays games and DVDs in full 5.1 surround sound .
And in January , when Vista ships , I 'll be able to get a CableCARD - equipped Media Center that will stream HDTV programs over the network to my Xbox 360 with no extra charges .
So , will someone please tell me why I want to replace my Xbox 360 with an Apple - branded device that only plays tunes from one music store , allows me to pay $ 15 for a movie encoded at 640 by 480 that looks like crap on my widescreen HDTV , and is unable to record or stream TV programming ?
Similarly , former Microsoft geek blogger Robert Scoble asks Is Apple copying Microsoft ? , and compares one of his UI videos with Jobs 's presentation .
Another of Jobs 's slides showing how Apple was in the den , in the car etc and the whole strategy sounded just like one of Bill Gates 's old Comdex speeches .
( Anyone still remember Windows Automotive ? )
This comes after Apple has paid Creative $ 100 m for copying elements of its patented interface , and other accusations of copying concerning Spotlight , Dashboard , Time Machine ( see Roxio 's GoBack 3 ) , and Front Row .
( Note : I 'm making no comment on whether the accusations are correct , only that they have been made . )
Now , in a rational world , nobody would care about all this -- it benefits everybody if companies learn from one another , and the whole free software movement encourages it .
( Firefox supporters can say things like : "" Hey , Microsoft ripped that off from us ... and we ripped it off from Opera ! "" )
But there are two problems here .
The first is Apple 's marketing , along the lines of "" Redmond , start your photocopiers "" .
It 's childish , stupid , and makes Jobs look like a jerk ...
but then you run into the second problem :
Jobs is playing to a crowd of vocal Mac users who also behave , en masse , like jerks .
Perhaps the old slogan Intel Inside , Idiot Outside was n't an observation but a prediction .
The zealots are , obviously , a tiny minority .
Almost all Mac users are intelligent , good looking , and have much better dress sense than the jerk in Apple 's TV ads , played by talented actor Justin Long ( OK , Ellen Feiss was worse ) .
But they can seem almost invisible .
Browse some of the talkboards or comments on sites such as CNet and ZD Net , and it 's hard not to get the impression that Mac users are , at best , somewhat unhinged .
Like other zealots , they presumably think they are being helpful in trying to convert people to "" the one true cause "" .
But actually , it tends to put people off .
In some cases , this Macidolatry is helping Linux , particularly Ubuntu .
In July , Bryan O'Bryan posted something about Why I ditched my Mac for Linux ( in Google 's cache ) where his number 1 reason for defecting was "" The Mac Community "" .
O'Bryan says : "" It has been my experience that the Mac ' community ' ( ie , the most vocal and active of the Macintosh enthusiast and power users ) tend to be incredibly negative and expect much more than they deserve . ""
Other software houses agree , he says : "" they do n't act like users of other platforms when they get upset .
They get ... mean .
Personal attacks .
Outrageous demands .
"" He was struck by the difference when he started "" co - hosting a Linux - centered podcast recently .
Myself and the other host are amateurs .
We are learning as we go .
And what was the response ?
Overwhelmingly positive .
Heck , even the criticism we received was good natured and constructive ( unlike what we received when attempting to run a Mac free website ) .
"" Of course , there 's another side to the story , and every system has its share of zealots .
As one of the comments to O'Bryan 's post said : "" Look , I 'm the lead developer of a high profile OSS project and your moment of ' grass - is - greener'-itis is just hilarious . ""
But Linus Torvalds sets a different tone to Steve Jobs , and there is an even more fundamental difference with Ubuntu .
Ubuntu comes with a Code of Conduct that says : Ubuntu is an African concept of "" humanity towards others "" .
It 's "" the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity "" . and goes on to quote Archbishop Desmond Tutu 's No Future Without Forgiveness .
Ubuntu 's Code says you must be considerate , respectful and collaborative , among other things .
Nobody thinks this is going to wipe out OS zealotry overnight .
But still , it gives a lead from the top that 's different from the one that comes from Steve Jobs 's keynotes and Apple 's advertising , and that has been a long running sore since EvangeList .
Even if Apple has never ever copied anything before , Ubuntu 's code of conduct would be a good place to start ."
2006-09-14,"It had to happen .
People are already downloading movies on to their computers and even their phones illegally , as blithely as earlier generations taped the Sunday night top 40 off the radio , in flagrant contravention of the 1949 Wireless Telegraphy Act .
Now Apple CEO Steve Jobs proposes to sell movies on the net through iTunes .
As with Napster and music , the worlds of movies and software are making common cause to normalise film downloading - at a price .
But do we want to watch movies on our iPods ?
This new techno wheeze might just go the way of miniature TVs , which , despite razor - sharp pictures and lightweight technology , are somehow only to be seen on the counters of late - night off - licences and kebab shops .
Would it be possible to appreciate The Lord of the Rings on iPod , when millions of orcs are sweeping across a plain no larger than a postage stamp ?
Admittedly , in - flight movies are shown on mini - screens on the seat - back or armrest , but watching these can be a dispiriting experience , especially as you get distracted by other movies on screens just centimetres away .
Yet for long plane journeys , you might want to carry your favourite film aboard in your tiny iPod , whose size does not pose a security problem .
Letting the children watch a DVD in the back of a car during a long journey can be a boon , but when the screen is iPod - tiny , it will kick off mighty squabbling as two or three infant heads clash to watch The Incredibles or Finding Nemo .
Tube journeys ?
Train journeys ?
These could be too short and too crowded to allow for anything like watching a film .
Perhaps people will prefer to watch segments of their own digital home movies , or perhaps in future they will download their favourite clips from YouTube .
But the question of iPod movies may be a red herring .
It 's more a question of digital storage .
Already , renting and buying DVDs over the web is causing the disappearance of the high - street video store .
Now , just as iPods are eroding the number of music CDs , and home TV systems such as Sky
Plus and TiVo put paid to VHS cassettes , movie downloads stored centrally will challenge the old - style Digital Versatile Disc .
As it is , rental DVDs are notoriously vulnerable to scuffing , rendering the disc likely to freeze five minutes before the end of the film - something the humble videocassette never did !
People will download movies to their iPods - but not necessarily watch them on this medium .
They will output them to their computer screens , their high - definition plasma TV screens , or even their digital projectors and watch a huge picture on the wall .
Whether this can upend the DVD market would depend on offering all that a disc offers in terms of extras , and having more than a few movies might just take up too much space on an iPod or hard drive .
It all depends on the technology .
But the way in which we consume , collect and watch movies is changing at a dizzying pace ."
2006-09-20,"The gloves are off ... almost .
After months of waiting , the first real volleys have been fired in the long - anticipated digital music war between Apple and Microsoft .
It kicked off with Apple , as Steve Jobs unveiled revisions to the iPod range and added some extra features .
He finally lifted the curtain on the heavily - trailed movie download service , offering American customers downloaded Disney - produced films such as Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man 's Chest and Cars .
Though there is still no British content a year after TV shows hit iTunes , the company promised something here in 2007 .
There was , unusually , a preview of a set - top box system , temporarily called iTV , which will stream media files sent wirelessly from a Mac or PC to a TV set .
Such a gizmo is not a new idea - but where others flopped , industry watchers say Apple could have the market muscle to push forward where predecessors have feared ( or failed ) to tread .
At the event in London last week for the launch event , Apple 's product manager Christi Wilkerson was visibly excited by the link between the iPod 's small screen and the living room TV , despite iTV 's launch still being months away .
Turning the iPod into the heart of a true multimedia platform will take a long time ; no matter how the $ 299 iTV ( there is no UK price yet ) fits into Apple 's wider plans , it will not be available until next year .
Hardware geeks had to get their fix from the miniscule new shuffle and the nano 's revival of the iPod mini 's popular candy colour schemes .
Brown study Microsoft , meanwhile decided it also needed a splash of colour - and , somewhat bizarrely , plumped for brown .
It waited until the day after Apple 's announcements to lift the lid on Zune , its own attempt to break the music market open .
Zune , which will reach US shops by Christmas but still has no confirmed price , exposed itself as a revised version of Toshiba 's Gigabeat player with a bigger screen and smoother looks .
But it 's what 's on the inside that counts - and there are a couple of features Steve Ballmer will hope can lift Zune above the crowd .
It offers wireless connectivity , though shared files ( only of purchased songs , not those ripped from your own CDs ) with a very limited lifespan - three days or three plays , whichever is first .
Some say Microsoft 's restrictions are likely to seriously limit any real impact of the feature , despite indications that young users are increasingly interested in sharing music via their mobile phones .
Someone on our Technology blog summed it up succinctly .
"" I 've often wished I could somehow share full - length sample tracks of select songs , "" remarked Pauldwaite .
"" Thank goodness
Microsoft is here to help at last . ""
The other difference inside Zune could be the crucial one , however .
In a remarkable change of direction , it ditches Microsoft 's long - held faith in the digital rights management ( DRM ) system that it developed and has promoted for previous Windows - only players .
Despite the heavy promotion given to the PlaysForSure format , used by services such as Napster , the Zune for sure wo n't play tracks protected by that DRM .
Instead , it will ape Apple 's closed system , hooking into a specific download store for purchases while offering support for unprotected Windows Media Audio ( WMA ) ,
MP3 and AAC files - the latter meaning that iPod owners can find a new home for any music ripped in Apple 's default format , though not any tracks direct from the iTunes Store .
The news was a punch in the gut to many companies supporting PlaysForSure , and even J Allard , the Microsoft vice president who helped mastermind the rise of Xbox and now oversees Zune , struggled to explain the U - turn . ""
PlaysForSure is still a program we 're going to invest in , we still have a lot of partners there , and for a class of consumers who want to have a handcrafted media experience and maximise their choice , we have an answer , "" he told the Engadget blog ( tinyurl.com/ksgqd ) .
"" There 's another class of consumers that just want digital media , and they just want to be able to go to one store and have it all just plain , dead simple , and do n't want to know what a codec is . ""
Vendors who had lined up behind PlaysForSure believing it was that simple solution - among them Napster , MTV 's Urge , Creative and Samsung - may have been surprised .
While Microsoft 's decision to pitch into the digital music hardware market - a move as guaranteed to irritate its numerous partners as if it began making PCs - will not have been taken lightly , this battle plan has clearly been coming together for some time .
When a parody video about Microsoft packaging the iPod ( tinyurl.com/ks8m8 ) circulated online this year , it drew laughs ; now it is obvious the film ( leaked from inside the company ) underlined a new strategy to fight fire with fire .
Ballmer confirmed the development program in an interview with Fortune magazine in March .
Taking sides The Zune announcement led to domino - like reactions and repercussions in the industry .
On Monday , Real Networks announced a partnership between its Rhapsody service and device maker SanDisk , to try to create another end - to - end solution and include preloaded content on players .
The profitless Napster , meanwhile , hired investment bank UBS to find a "" major strategic partner "" or buyer - early rumours suggested player makers Creative or Samsung , or phone maker Motorola as possible suitors .
It 's every man for himself , as music providers hammer out deals with manufacturers to stop Microsoft swiping customers .
Rumours indicate other interested parties as diverse as Nokia , T - Mobile and Sony are poised to follow suit .
Mark Mulligan , an analyst with Jupiter Media , says Redmond 's decisions are based on long - term fear that Jobs will turn the iPod and its ecology of add - ons into a much wider platform .
"" Microsoft does n't want Apple to develop a strong position in the media player business , and that includes PC , "" he says .
"" At a strategic level , they 're probably not that concerned at making revenue from music ... but the problem is that Apple is beginning to squeeze into Microsoft 's digital home strategy . ""
And while Microsoft closes ranks , some of the features added to the new iPods indicate expansion , albeit limited , of Apple 's vision .
Aside from iTV 's obvious charge into the living room , the addition of games for the iPod , on sale via the iTunes Store in the same way as audio or video content , marks a watershed .
Games are software ; if non - Apple companies write software for the iPod , it begins to resemble a platform .
As Microsoft understands , platforms can emerge where business happens , and vice - versa ; it 's a virtuous circle .
With the battle focused heavily on music , the danger is that this could be the start of a very painful transition .
Despite rapid growth in recent years , digital music accounts for just 6 % of music industry revenues , and a scrap between two bloody - minded and well - funded rivals could spell trouble for everybody else caught up in the fight .
"" There is n't an infinite market in digital music , "" Mulligan warns .
"" But either way , we 're a long , long way from the digital home : we 're not talking about the Jetsons ...
this is still the Flintstones . ""

Universal studios says Blu - ray is dead Steve Jobs blooper reel : It 's pretty awesome when it works Sony slashes PS3 price in Japan"
2006-09-28,"The Web 2.0 frenzy has done wonders for media executives ' air miles accounts as hordes of Brits have streamed across the Atlantic on "" fact - finding missions "" .
It 's one of the peculiarities of the supposedly virtual digital age that its proponents feel the need to spend most of their time flying around the world to meet in person at conferences and in Silicon Valley .
Last year BBC director general Mark Thompson flew to see Apple 's Steve Jobs and the Google guys while a couple of months later director of new media and technology Ashley Highfield stood on a podium in Las Vegas alongside Microsoft chairman Bill Gates and showed off a version of the imminent iPlayer optimised for the much - delayed next generation of Windows .
So it was no big surprise when the trio met up in Seattle this week to sign an ambiguous - sounding "" memorandum of understanding "" over the US computer giant 's role in the corporation 's digital plans .
As outlined in Thompson 's Creative Future vision earlier this year , he anticipates the BBC entirely reinventing itself for the so - called Web 2.0 age .
That means completely overhauling its website to accommodate more audio and video - a huge technical undertaking in itself - and introducing a range of new services that allow users to create , share and repurpose content around their own communities and areas of interest .
At the centre of this are two equally pivotal and hugely ambitious projects , one of which is an online digital archive that will allow access to potentially tens of thousands of programmes , some of them free and some of them at a price .
More imminently , the BBC will ( subject to Trust approval )
early next year launch the long - awaited iPlayer , giving access to any BBC programme from the previous seven days .
Partnership deals with technology firms and infrastructure providers , which will be rubbing their hands at the potential windfall , will increasingly become vital to delivering these new services .
The BBC , of course , has a commitment to universality and it will be interesting to see if the partnership extends to using Microsoft 's rights management software for its download and sharing services .
That software was recently in the news after Sky suspended its movie download service because it had been cracked by resourceful hackers .
At present , it 's also incompatible with most Apple Macs - favourites of early adopters .
The BBC was quick to point out that today 's partnership is "" non - exclusive "" but that wo n't stop Microsoft 's rivals watching it like a hawk for signs of favouritism .
But this agreement is about much more than merely software .
Both Thompson and Highfield are committed to putting technologists at the heart of the creative process ( which is partly what the recent "" 360-degree commissioning "" reshuffle was all about ) .
Part of that involves a vision for a British version of the hugely influential MIT Media Lab in the US , which has combined academia and commerce with the help of billions of pounds of corporate investment , around the proposed new technology wing in Manchester .
That will also require serious investment from US technology companies .
Thompson , who appears to have undergone a road to Damascus conversion to the possibilities of the internet since his Channel 4 days , is equally convinced that only the BBC can provide a serious British rival to the likes of Yahoo ! , Google and Microsoft .
Yet , as is typical in the 2.0 world , the BBC will at once be rivals and partners to these US giants .
They will need its content , the BBC will need their distribution networks .
And as Highfield today pointed out , Microsoft is not only a key supplier of software and services but increasingly provides a gateway to audiences through hardware like the new breed of X - Box and its Media Centre .
Today 's Microsoft announcement was the most visible example yet of the increased partnership and openness mantra that Thompson has been espousing ever since the publication of his Building Public Value manifesto in 2004 .
The next , long - anticipated , stage of convergence will see high - speed internet lines linked to our television sets and that 's why the BBC has to get into bed with the big beasts of the technology world fast .
At every level - from outsourced HR to the WOCC - the BBC is having to learn to face outwards rather than inwards .
This Microsoft announcement , and others that are sure to follow with other companies of similar stature , are the latest expression of that on a global level .
While out in the US , Highfield and Thompson are also meeting with IBM , Real Networks and Linden Laboratories , the company behind the popular Second Life virtual online world , while further meetings with Google , Apple and others are on the horizon .
Yet for UK rivals already fretting about the BBC 's possible effect on the growth of nascent web 2.0-style ideas in the UK , the sight of Mark and Bill clutching a partnership agreement is unlikely to bring down their blood pressure . ·

2006-10-02,""" Internet search leader Google Inc has added a landmark to its rapidly expanding empire -- the Silicon Valley home where co - founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin rented a garage eight years ago as they set out to change the world , "" reports AP .
In fact , they bought the house as well .
The company 's astounding growth has imbued its birthplace with the same kind of mystique attached to other hallowed Silicon Valley spots like the Palo Alto garage where Hewlett - Packard Co. started in 1938 and the Los Altos garage where Steve Jobs and his partner Steve Wozniak first began to build Apple computers in the 1970s .
Google asked AP not to publish the address of the garage , but as the story points out , you can find it using Google ...."
2006-10-05,"The founder of the Apple technology empire , Steve Jobs , was cleared of personal misconduct but was obliged to issue a humbling public apology yesterday over the company 's conduct in a long - running share options scandal .
Apple announced that an independent investigation into its remuneration policy had uncovered 15 occasions in which share options were granted to executives at backdated prices - a practice generally considered unethical and legally dubious .
Although Mr Jobs was not among the recipients and he did not gain financially , Apple said he had been aware of the favourable terms of several of the grants , which were made between 1997 and 2002 .
The company added that it had "" serious concerns "" about the conduct of two unnamed former officers .
"" I apologise to Apple 's shareholders and employees for these problems , which happened on my watch .
They are completely out of character for Apple , "" said Mr Jobs in a statement .
"" We will now work to resolve the remaining issues as quickly as possible and to put the proper remedial measures in place to ensure that this never happens again . ""
Apple is the highest profile of more than 115 companies caught up in a furore over the pay policies employed by Silicon Valley firms to capture talent at the height of the dotcom boom .
Criminal charges have been filed against executives at two companies and regulatory inquiries are under way into many others .
The incident is likely to taint the reputation of Mr Jobs , who has long been seen as one of corporate America 's most original entrepreneurs , responsible for successes such as the iMac and the iPod .
Auditors are reviewing the findings from the investigation , which may not be sufficient to satisfy regulators .
Fred Anderson , a long - serving lieutenant of Mr Jobs who served as chief financial officer during the period in question , yesterday resigned from the company 's board saying it was in the "" best interests "" of Apple for him to depart .
In August , Apple told investors that it could no longer vouch for the reliability of its earnings statements dating back to 2002 .
Share options are routinely used by companies as an incentive to directors to improve stock market performance , with rewards set according to future stock prices .
In cases of backdating , directors are granted options pitched at a level below the prevailing price , which means they get an instant windfall of cash without achieving any improvement .
Investigators have filed criminal charges against two companies - Brocade Communications and Comverse Technologies - in connection with such practices .
Comverse 's millionaire former chief executive , Kobi Alexander , has become a cause celebre by fleeing to Namibia to avoid arrest .
When the case against Comverse was outlined in August , America 's deputy attorney general , Paul McNulty , delivered a broadside against backdated options , saying : "" Investors take risks and do their best to see into the future when picking companies in which to invest .
We can not allow corporate leaders to operate under different rules , using 20 - 20 hindsight to line their own pockets .
"" The issue of backdated stock options came to light this year through research by an Iowa academic , Eric Lie , who found that a disproportionate number of grants had been made on dates which , with hindsight , appeared highly fortuitous .
A congressional committee has joined the securities and exchange commission in investigating just how often laws were broken by technology firms ."
2006-10-08,"It 's a question that comes up fairly often , but I 've yet to see any good suggestions -- at the moment , it 's between Richard Branson and William Shatner .
Bloggingstocks is the latest to raise the idea .
This list includes the best man who will never get the job , Bill Campbell , who founded the Claris software company that Apple bought .
Of course , there 's always Carly Fiorina , who tried to turn Hewlett - Packard into an Apple clone ."
2006-10-14,"The press has given Steve Jobs a pretty easy ride during the current options scandal , but at Bloomberg News , Graef Crystal has made a few points in his personal opinion column .
Graef says that "" In January 2000 , Jobs was granted what was , and I believe still is , the largest option grant on a single day .
It covered a staggering 40 million split - adjusted shares . ""
The stock went down so Jobs was awarded even more shares : "" He was given a second grant covering 15 million split - adjusted shares in October 2001 . ""
However , the stock went down again so these options were also "" under water "" ,
Then in March 2003 , Jobs ' ' voluntarily cancelled '' all 55 million option shares , according to the company 's proxy statement .
That cancellation is the basis for Apple 's statement that he did not benefit from these options .
But hold on .
In its report to shareholders that year , Apple 's board compensation committee noted the voluntary surrender of the options and then disclosed that ' ' in exchange for his cancelled options '' Jobs had been given 10 million split- adjusted shares .
At the time the shares were worth about $ 75 million .
The free shares were restricted from sale for three years .
When the restrictions lapsed on March 19 , 2006 , they were worth some $ 640 million .
It 's hard to think of any Apple shareholder -- or anyone else for that matter -- who would n't welcome such
a non - benefit . Comment :
Graef is suggesting that Jobs should give back $ 85 million , which is roughly the difference between the $ 640 million he was given and the $ 557 million he would have got if the options had been set at a "" fair "" ( average ) price rather than the price on a date chosen to benefit Jobs .
( Apple cleared Jobs in an internal enquiry , telling the SEC : "" In a few instances , Apple CEO Steve Jobs was aware that favorable grant dates had been selected , but he did not receive or otherwise benefit from these grants and was unaware of the accounting implications . "" )
Alternatively , Jobs could use his free $ 640 million to replace faulty MacBooks , except that would n't be anywhere near enough ....

2006-10-23,"One of the founders of Apple Computer has called for the company to compensate shareholders hit by a scandal over stock options .
Steve Wozniak , who started the pioneering computer firm with the current chief executive , Steve Jobs , 30 years ago , said Apple must repair the damage caused when it backdated share prices for staff .
"" I think that there are ways that the stock option programmes basically leave other shareholders treated at a disadvantage , and that 's illegal , "" he told the Guardian .
"" I think Apple 's going to have to correct that for what they 've done . ""
Mr Wozniak still owns a stake in the firm that made him a millionaire .
But he said Apple , which announced record quarterly profits of $ 546 m ( £ 292 m ) last week , needed to put things right .
"" They 're going to have to go back and make up some of the money themselves that employees with stock options got , "" he said .
In admitting a series of "" accounting irregularities "" , Apple has become the most high - profile US company involved in backdating stock options .
Most of the problems revolve around the fudge of backdating share prices offered to senior staff .
By picking artificially low prices , some employees were able to buy undervalued stock at the expense of other investors and sell it at a huge profit .
Apple has said it may need to restate accounts stretching back as far as 1997 as a result of the discovery , and some financial analysts have claimed it could cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars .
Two weeks ago an internal investigation into the affair said Mr Jobs had known about a series of issues , but had not acted to stop the abuses .
The FBI confirmed last week that it was investigating 55 companies over the allegations . ""
Corporate executives by virtue of their position should n't be able to bet on a horse race that has already run , "" said an FBI spokesman ."
2006-12-28,"The stock option scandal which has caused turmoil at Apple is drawing closer to chief executive Steve Jobs , it appears .
According to reports which emerged yesterday , it seems that five years ago Jobs received a bundle of 7.5 m stock options without the proper approval of the Apple board .
Richard Waters at the FT says this morning : Records that purported to show a full board meeting had taken place to approve Mr Jobs ' remuneration , as required by Apple 's procedures , were later falsified .
These are now among the pieces of evidence being weighed by the Securities and Exchange Commission as it decides whether to pursue a case against the company or any individuals over the affair , according to these people .
Previously Jobs has said he did not receive any of the dodgy benefits .
Famously , of course , he gets a salary of just $ 1 but there are perks given to him along the way from the company .
If you have n't been following the stock option probe , then here 's a primer : it basically involves executives at a company being given share options that have their price backdated to a point in time .
So I might have been given the option on a million shares which are worth $ 1 each today but were worth 50 cents a month ago .
Profit bonanza !
Of course , in order to do this , documents and accounts must be falsified .
It 's a practice that has engulfed more than 160 US companies , many of them in and around Silicon Valley .
Earlier this year Apple 's other Steve , Steve Wozniak , told me that Apple needed to make up for the damage that they 'd caused in backdating .
And Jobs has previously apologised for irregularities , but indicated that he had not been involved in any way .
This brings things a little closer to home , although it could have been be even worse news for him - after all , it seems that he did not exercise the options in question .

2006-12-28,"Those of you who buy the paper will have noticed there 's no Technology section today .
It 's because we 're digesting our Christmas lunches .
But we 'll be back next week with all your favourite things , including an insider 's look ahead to what could be in Steve Jobs 's keynote speech at Macworld coming up the week after ."
2006-12-29,"The Apple stock options story gets , if anything , less clear following the publication of the company 's internal probe into how Steve Jobs received a number of apparently backdated stock options .
In a 10-K filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission , Apple says it is taking a $ 21 million hit on its earnings for the fiscal years 2004 , 2005 and 2006 ( respectively $ 4 m , $ 7 m and $ 10 m ) plus an $ 84 m "" non - cash charge "" ( that would be a charge against stocks , then , as Apple has zero debt ) as a result .
( You can find the documents on Apple 's site too , under investor relations . )
What 's intriguing is that there was clearly wrongdoing .
Here 's the extract : CEO Grants
—
During the relevant period , the Company made two grants to CEO Steve Jobs .
The first grant , dated January 12 , 2000 , was for 10 million option shares .
The second grant , dated October 19 , 2001 , was for 7.5 million option shares .
Both grants were cancelled in March 2003 prior to being exercised , when Mr. Jobs received 5 million shares of restricted stock .
So , Jobs did n't exercise ( cash in ) the options .
With respect to the grant dated January 12 , 2000 , the Board on December 2 , 1999 , authorized a special "" CEO Compensation Committee "" to grant Mr. Jobs up to 15 million shares .
The evidence indicates that the CEO Compensation Committee finalized the terms of the grant on January 12 , 2000 , although the Committee 's action was memorialized in a UWC transmitted on January 18 , 2000 .
Because the measurement date is the originally assigned grant date , the Company has not recognized any stock - based compensation expense from this grant .
If the Company had determined that the measurement date was the date when the UWC was executed or received , then additional stock - based compensation would have been recognized .
Here 's an interesting question : who was on the CEO Compensation Committee in January 2000 ?
The report does n't say .
Apple 's website does n't say .
A search for "" ceo compensation committee 2000 "" on Apple 's site throws an error .
It tells you who is now - Bill Campbell , Millard Drexler and Al Gore - but we 're not sure they were on the board then .
*
The grant dated October 19 , 2001 was originally approved at a Board meeting on August 29 , 2001 , with an exercise price of $ 17.83 .
The terms of the grant , however , were not finalized until December 18 , 2001 .
The grant was dated October 19 , 2001 , with an exercise price of $ 18.30 .
The approval for the grant was improperly recorded as occurring at a special Board meeting on October 19 , 2001 .
Such a special Board meeting did not occur .
There was no evidence , however , that any current member of management was aware of this irregularity .
The Company has recognized $ 20 million in stock - based compensation expense for this grant , reflecting the difference between the exercise price of $ 18.30 and the share price on December 18 , 2001 of $ 21.01 .
Our emphasis added on the board meeting that did n't occur .
Now , the question is : whose name is there signing the grant ?
Were they just confused about whether the gathering was a special board meeting , or a CEO compensation committee meeting ?
The implication of the phrasing there is that a former member , or members , of management knew of the irregularity .
Since 2000 , a number of people have retired from Apple 's board , including Fred Anderson , the longrunning chief financial officer .
We wonder if he was on the CEOCC , and whether he 's been interviewed by the people who compiled the report ?
Apparently they interviewed more than 40 "" current and former directors , officers , employees and advisors "" .
The board says that everything is hunky dory , because the options were cancelled in 2003 , and that Steve Jobs did n't exercise them ( ie cash them in ) .
But it also says that he knew the date favoured him : Apple said in the filing that while Jobs and other managers recommended or were aware of certain inaccurate grant dates , they did not financially benefit from the grants as the Washington Post puts it .
David Sobotta , formerly head of federal sales for Apple , says that he 's not surprised .
In Apple 's above the law attitude , he says that It seems that Apple is trying to put the spin on this story that it is all about departed executives .
Well it 's a good time of the year to believe in fairy tales , but the climate of being above the law is well ingrained in Apple executives ....
[ later in ] one of my last acts , which might have contributed to my exit .
A senior system engineer reported to me a conversation that he had with a vice president ( still at Apple ) .
The vice president told him that Apple was going to hold back some billings in order that their next weaker quarter would look better .
Being a director of a publicly held corporation , I reported this to HR and requested an investigation .
Less than a month later I was no longer working for Apple .
Anyone that thinks that Apple 's problem with executives believing that they are above the law has disappeared with departed executives will likely believe almost anything that comes out of the Apple spin machine .
We 'll await with interest to see whether Steve Jobs offers any mea culpa over the fact - as suggested by the committee - that he knew he was getting favourably backdated options .
After all , it does n't make it right that he did n't exercise them ; nor that lots of other companies ( at latest count , around 200 ) were doing it too .
*
Bobbie adds : Things become incredibly confused looking back on Apple 's board and its compensation committee in the early 00s .
On the compensation committee in fiscal year 1999 were Edgar Woolard and Gareth Chang , though it is not clear whether that is the same as the special committee to resolve the CEO 's pay .
And between April 2000 until August 2001 it appears that the company did not have a comp committee at all , with responsibilities taken by the board itself ."
2006-12-29,"Apple is expected to give further details today of the share options scandal that has enveloped it .
Shares in the Silicon Valley heavyweight dropped yesterday on reports that records of a crucial board meeting which approved a controversial share option scheme for the chief executive Steve Jobs were falsified .
Coupled with talk that Mr Jobs has hired his own lawyer , the man who represented the disgraced Wall Street banker Frank Quattrone , concerns about Apple 's stock option practices saw shares in the company lose 5 % in early trading yesterday .
A spokesman for Apple refused to comment , merely repeating what the company said in October when the results of its own internal inquiry were released .
"" We said at that time and we still say that we are providing all details regarding the investigation to the SEC , "" he said .
Apple is one of more than 160 US firms that have come under scrutiny for backdating stock or share options .
The scandal of backdating , by which the exercise price of share options was set with the benefit of hindsight at favourable levels , has already led to the exit of several senior executives .
Apple carried out its own review of its stock option accounting using a committee made up of outside directors with independent counsel and accountants .
Having sifted through 650,000 documents and interviewed present and former executives and advisers , the investigation essentially exonerated Mr Jobs , saying it found no misconduct by any present member of the management team .
The committee 's report said Mr Jobs was aware that favourable grants had been selected "" in a few instances "" , but "" he did not receive or otherwise benefit from these grants and was unaware of the accounting implications "" .
The 7.5 m options under review were given to Mr Jobs in October 2001 .
He surrendered the options before they were exercised .
According to press reports yesterday , however , Apple has discovered that records of the full board meeting authorising those options were falsified .
Apple will update Wall Street on the situation with the release of its annual report , which was originally scheduled for December 14 .
It must be published by the close of business today ."
2006-12-30,"Apple Computer yesterday admitted that records of the board meeting that handed chief executive Steve Jobs 7.5 m share options were fabricated .
But the independent committee investigating the illicit backdating of stock awards cleared Mr Jobs of wrongdoing .
Apple shares have been depressed during the week on fears that the company 's annual report , which was delayed by the options investigation , would contain new information which might damage Mr Jobs 's position .
In its report published yesterday Apple reiterated the independent committee 's findings from October that , while Mr Jobs "" was aware or recommended the selection of some favourable grant dates , he did not receive or financially benefit from these grants or appreciate the accounting implications "" .
In a separate statement , the chairman of the special investigative committee , former presidential candidate Al Gore , and the head of Apple 's audit and finance committee , Jerome York , said : "" The board of directors is confident that the company has corrected the problems that led to the restatement , and it has complete confidence in Steve Jobs and the senior management team . ""
Apple is one of more than 160 US firms that have come under scrutiny for backdating stock or share options .
The scandal of backdating , by which the exercise price of share options was set with the benefit of hindsight at favourable levels , has already led to the exit of several senior executives .
Apple said yesterday that the mis - dating of 6,428 different share options packages awarded on 42 dates between 1997 and 2002 has cost it $ 105 m ( £ 53 m ) on a pre - tax basis .
Two option grants to Mr Jobs were scrutinised by the committee , which has handed its findings to the securities and exchange commission .
While there was nothing untoward about the grant of 10 m options on 12 January 2000 , the paperwork governing a second tranche - of 7.5 m granted on October 19 2001 - had been falsified .
The approval for the second grant of options "" was improperly recorded as occurring at a special board meeting on October 19 , 2001 .
Such a special board meeting did not occur , "" Apple said in its annual report .
"" There was no evidence , however , that any current member of management was aware of this irregularity . ""
The 7.5 m options were given an exercise price of $ 18.03 on October 19 but they should actually have been dated December 18 at which time Apple 's shares were trading at $ 21.01 .
In fact both sets of options were cancelled in March 2003 before they were exercised .
Apple said in its report the committee 's investigation "" raised serious concerns regarding the actions of two former officers in connection with the accounting , recording and reporting of stock options "" .
It did not name the two people ."

2007-01-04,"Apple 's internal investigation might have expressed "" complete confidence "" in him and the management team , but there 's still the little matter of the separate inquiry into options backdating at Pixar , where he was chief executive until Disney bought it last May.
At worst , he could be barred from acting as a director of any public company .
Options are the chance to buy shares in a company at the price they were on a specific date , and sell them - if you want - some time in the future on the open market .
If the stock price rises enough between the two dates , the holder can make easy profits .
Setting a favourable start date makes them even more profitable .
Backdating is n't illegal , but not accounting properly for it is .
Some think that Jobs 's work at Pixar - where he was part of the compensation committee - could prove an achilles heel .
There , high - flying staff such as John Lasseter , the creative genius behind films such as Toy Story and A Bug 's Life , have seen question - marks raised over backdated options he was granted in February 1997 - just before Pixar signed a distribution deal with Disney which boosted the stock price by 50 % - and in 2000 , just as the stock price was at its lowest for the whole year .
Disney ( where Jobs is now a director ) has begun an independent review of the grants .
Between 1997 and 2004 , options were handled by Pixar 's board , which included Jobs .
If the accounting was n't done right , Jobs might be snared by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) - which might then have to mull "" whether he knowingly participated in creating option irregularities ( at either Apple or Pixar ) which could lead the SEC to take legal action against him , including potentially barring his ability to serve as a director , officer , or financial reporting executive of any public company , including Apple , "" says Richard Farmer , an analyst at Merrill Lynch .
And if the worst came to the worst , and Jobs were barred from serving on the board of Apple and Disney ?
We 're sure he 'd find something to do .
Why , those companies would need an independent consultant who could advise them .
And he would have plenty of time on his hands ...

2007-01-04,"Next week , Steve Jobs will stand on stage in San Francisco to make his keynote speech at the Macworld show , to unveil new - much - rumoured - products .
Here 's something I discovered in my 22 years at Apple : some of the toughest competition for the best seats , or the first of those new products , comes from former Windows - centric executives who Steve has personally sucked into his "" reality distortion zone "" in face - to - face executive briefings .
You want to go to one ?
You want to meet Steve Jobs to persuade him that Apple should build a tablet computer , or an iPhone ?
Then besides having a big purchasing budget and persuasive reasons , you 'd better bring a big ego .
In the spring of 2002 , I had been at Apple for nearly 20 years and had risen through the ranks to become its national federal sales manager .
I joined a delegation from the prestigious National Institutes of Health , the pre - eminent US federal agency for medical research , for an "" executive briefing "" at Apple 's Cupertino headquarters with Steve Jobs .
Most people have n't heard of NIH ; but its 2007 budget will be around $ 28.6bn ( £ 14.6bn ) .
NIH also happens to be one of Apple 's premier scientific customers .
Nine key NIH people attended the meeting , including its two highest - ranking technology officers .
Setting up an executive briefing at Apple is a bizarre process that takes a couple of months ; if you also want Steve to grace the briefing , add another six weeks to run a formal request up the chain of command , including just about every detail but the DNA of the people who want to meet him .
With luck , and if Steve happens to be in town , you will get the commitment that unless something else turns up , he will drop by and stay as long as he feels necessary .
Horror stories
Once you have your ironclad guarantee that Steve might come by , the management chain starts telling horror stories about how the best thing is for Steve not to come .
That if he does come , he 'll talk about whatever he has immersed himself in recently , whether it is iTunes or Garageband .
That whatever Steve has to say might or might not have anything to do with what the customer wants to hear .
For a salesman , that 's disconcerting ; your customers normally only come to these executive briefings to understand where Apple executives stand on key issues .
And they 're customers , are n't they ?
They 're the ones who pay for it all , the ones who are always right ?
Yet it 's an amazing experience to take part in a briefing with Steve .
Stories about him reprimanding customers are true .
Once , when renegotiating a Pixar distribution deal with Disney , he humiliated Disney 's chief information officer in front of his staff .
Steve pointed to a couple of recent Disney flops , and told the attendees that they could expect more of the same as long as the CIO was stupid enough to keep Macs out of the creative process .
An executive briefing always looks , on paper , like a clash of titanic egos .
From what I saw , most wilt quickly in Steve 's presence .
And customers ' reverence for him usually overwhelms any hostility .
In fact , it does n't really matter who is presenting or what is being discussed .
When Steve enters a room , everything stops and attention turns to him .
When he walks in you get the feeling that he has sucked all the other thoughts out of the room .
As for quoting him precisely - you do n't take notes if you want to live .
( At Apple 's most recent sales briefing , nobody was allowed to have a notebook , phone or computer out while Steve spoke . )
I 've checked these recollections with an NIH attendee .
Steve did show up wearing shorts , sandals and a few days ' stubble .
Everyone else was in east coast business casual - sports coats and khaki pants .
He also brought his brilliance but not , that day , the arrogance you often hear about .
The NIH delegation wanted to know whether Apple would build a tablet computer that would work in their clinical situation .
Actually , more than that : they wanted to convince Steve to make a tablet .
After all , Bill Gates had launched one the year before at CES in January , boldly saying "" within five years , I predict that it will be the most popular form of PC sold in America "" .
Tablets were the future - were n't they ?
Not like those music players that Apple had launched the previous October .
Pod - somethings ?
But as Apple 's then vice - president of hardware , Jon Rubenstein , once told me : "" Customers do not know what they want to buy .
We have to tell them . ""
Steve had not been forewarned about the tablet question , but it became obvious he had given the topic serious consideration .
He listed a number of reasons why Apple was not interested .
And they provide some of the best insights into why Apple does or does not do a product .
The tablet situation First , he said , tablet computers were not a big enough market for Apple to spend its limited resources chasing .
And even if the market grew , it would not reach a size to be of interest .
The form factor was all wrong .
Apple was more interested in defining markets than trying to catch other companies that were busy trying to create a market for questionable products .
Still , some of the NIH scientists pressed the issue .
Steve 's follow - up answer was the most impressive I had heard him give .
First , he said , the wireless bandwidth for huge images , plus the security needed to successfully do what NIH wanted , was just not on the horizon .
( Apple staff had been notably fuzzy earlier in the briefing about wireless standards after 802.11b . )
Plus , tablets ' screen resolution was nowhere near that required for NIH 's high - quality medical images .
Finally , any product designed to work in the medical field would attract significant liability .
The hint was that Apple was n't interested in anything with that kind of potential liability .
That pretty well shut down the issue .
So , no tablet .
But NIH at the time had more than 2,000 BlackBerry users .
The NIH CIO wanted Apple to push RIM for better compatibility .
Tough
: Steve basically said it was another niche product , and that while there would be convergence of computing and phones , the BlackBerry was not that product .
He did not see that compatibility as an area where Apple should spend any effort .
So what will the converged product - what is being called the "" iPhone "" ( even though that 's a Cisco trademark )
- look like ?
He said the really converged , ubiquitous devices would have to fit in your shirt pocket , and be better than either a phone or a computer by itself .
That was 2002 .
But let 's examine the rumours that Apple will next week unveil a tablet computer or iPhone in light of Steve 's comments that day .
The market for a converged computer and phone should be very attractive : Gartner forecast last year that 986 m mobiles would be sold in 2006 .
And there 's an "" Apple gap "" :
mobile phone users often find their interfaces confusing , even within the same brands .
Apple 's unique ability to simplify while innovating looks like a good fit there .
Plus Apple 's deal with Samsung means it is well placed for anything that needs lots of flash memory .
It has played around with unique relationships with phone manufacturers : Jobs used a Sony Ericsson phone to demonstrate Bluetooth capability in July 2002 , and showed off the Motorola ROKR , the first to play iTunes , in 2005 .
This fits Apple 's pattern of learning what it needs to know through partnership before jumping into a market .
Significantly , the first Powerbooks , in 1991 , involved Sony .
Now the companies ' laptops compete , although Sony still makes the batteries .
Logically , Apple will make its own phone if it is holding true to pattern .
But a tablet computer ?
Most analysts would agree the market is growing only slowly , mostly in the healthcare and other specialised industries , and that these models will make at most 5 % of the laptop market by 2009 ( they account for 1 % now ) .
Even Dell does n't make its own tablet .
Furthermore , the tablet was championed by Bill Gates .
I do n't see Steve stepping up to the plate to help Bill 's reputation as a forecaster of computer trends .
I believe there are other reasons why Apple wo n't make a tablet computer .
Even before the iPod gained momentum , Apple executives had a theory that the route to success will not be through selling thousands of relatively expensive things , but millions of very inexpensive things like iPods ; and not necessarily computers .
Tablet computers remain expensive .
Yet the mobile phone market is almost perfect for Apple strategy .
There is no real market leader , and it 's ripe for simplification .
Plus it 's worldwide , and engineers from the network operators would be available to do localisation .
Apple might even be able to do a Java - based phone platform which could integrate into current systems .
With a focus on simple mail and contact integration with its online .Mac
( mac.com ) service , Apple could provide advantages for early adopters while making its .Mac service better value ( because it is n't right now ) .
Few non - technical people consider doing anything other than transferring numbers to their new mobiles by typing .
On anything other than a Mac , the process is just too complex .
Apple already knows how to make this easy .
It just needs to convince people to buy an Apple phone and a Mac .
Also anti - tablet is Apple 's sales force , which often spends so much of its time forecasting what it 's going to sell in a given quarter
there 's precious little time left to actually sell anything .
Right now they sell everything from iPods to Xserve RAIDs .
However , an Apple phone would n't need a new sales force .
The network operators ' sales force could handle it - probably cutting Apple sales people out of any new commission revenue for phones , much as they have done for the iPod .
Even if Apple partners only with a single national carrier it will get an immediate , huge retail presence .
What about a more targeted tablet - perhaps to control all the devices in your home entertainment stable ?
Traditionally , Apple stays away from markets where it can not define all of the standards , so I really do n't think Steve will devote resources to make non - Apple stuff work together .
Even the vertical markets like healthcare suffer from this problem : too many pieces in a very complex puzzle .
So next week , I 'm sure we wo n't see any kind of tablet computer from Apple .
I am 99 % confident we will see an Apple phone , with enhanced music capabilities and maybe a few computing features such as email and contacts synchronisation with Macs or through .Mac .
Steve 's ability to know where consumers and technology will intersect often creates a road paved in gold .
That 's why he 'll focus his energy on mobiles .
The potential there that only Steve can see could well turn into another must - have product for the legions who do n't even know they are part of Steve 's army .
They have n't met him across a table .
But they 've met the products of his thinking . ·

2007-01-06,"What exactly does Steve Jobs , the Apple chief executive , have up his sleeve ?
Is it a phone ?
Another iPod ?
Or something else entirely ?
That is the billion - dollar question as the technology industry gears up for one of its biggest weeks .
Apple has media pundits and bloggers frenzied with speculation over what products it might be preparing to unveil .
Many are convinced that the long - awaited iPhone - a mobile handset that incorporates iPod functions and design - could be on the menu when Mr Jobs takes to the stage at his annual showcase in San Francisco next Tuesday . ""
Apple waited several years to enter the MP3 market , "" says Gene Munster , an analyst with the investment bank Piper Jaffray , who believes that an iPhone is imminent .
"" We believe the company is well - positioned to enter the phone market now that early music - enabled handsets have tested the waters . ""
Mr Jobs 's speeches have become a must - see event in the technology industry , with the crowd - largely comprised of adoring followers - screaming and whooping their way throughout .
Even the most minor announcements are met with a mania that leaves his strait - laced rivals baffled .
Despite such cultish devotion , the Apple phone has been a rumour for so long that it has developed into a standing joke .
However , technology experts remain convinced that it is a necessary step if the company wishes to convert its iconic status into a truly global force .
Despite the iPod 's success - so extensive that its designer , Jonathan I ve , has just been granted a place in
Who 's Who - few think it is infallible .
Mobile companies such as Nokia and Sony Ericsson have started putting iPod - like capabilities into their phones .
And with sales of mobiles expected to pass 1bn in 2007 , the threat is growing .
Confident ""
I am 99 % confident we will see an Apple phone , with enhanced music capabilities and maybe a few computing features such as email , "" David Sobotta , a former manager at the company , wrote in the Guardian this week .
"" The mobile phone market is almost perfect for Apple strategy . ""
Other suggestions include iPod enhancements such as a touch - sensitive screen or the ability to connect to the internet , as well as the final launch of a television set - top box codenamed "" iTV "" .
This device could record TV shows and download programmes from the internet but has yet to materialise on the high street after being previewed last year .
Even if Apple unveils something substantial next week it will still have to compete with a host of rivals .
Monday marks the start of one of the most frenzied periods in the technology calendar , with Apple 's exhibition vying against the massive Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) in Las Vegas .
Considered one of the world 's premier showcases for new technology , CES features a large number of heavy hitters ready to outpunch their rivals with big announcements .
The Microsoft chairman , Bill Gates , will be making the opening address tomorrow night , and has his own point to prove .
His company is under pressure to deliver on its promises , and is expected to make several announcements about so - called ultra - mobile computers - a sort of halfway house between a laptop and a handheld computer .
Mr Gates will also be trumpeting Vista , the new version of Windows , which is due to be launched later this year .
Sony is another major corporation with a point to prove .
After a terrible year of delays , manufacturing problems and public - relations disasters , executives have pinned their hopes on the new PlayStation 3 video games console .
Consumer reaction to the machine - which will be launched in Europe in the spring but is already available to American and Japanese shoppers - has so far proved lacklustre .
Analysts say the coming week will be critical for a swath of companies across the technology industry .
"" We are looking at a crunch period not only for Apple , Microsoft and Sony , "" says Paul Jackson , an analyst with Forrester Research , "" but also for all those guys who make LCD televisions and DVD recorders and are n't making any margins .
""
He believes that the success of video - sharing ventures such as YouTube will increase the emphasis on digital video this year , as well as encouraging greater competition .
"" Look for even more presence from IT firms like IBM and Intel , who see video trends as giving them more of an ' in ' to gadgets and consumer living rooms , "" says Mr Jackson .
Events in Las Vegas could have influence in other ways , too .
Mr Jobs does not need a hit merely in order to outmanoeuvre Apple 's competitors but also to divert attention away from a share options scandal that has embroiled his company .
Wrongdoing Two senior executives have already resigned after it emerged that the Apple board had backdated share options to profit from stock market fluctuations .
And although Mr Jobs is not implicated in any wrongdoing , he would appreciate the relief brought by positive headlines .
For some , though , next week is about technology , not boardroom politics .
Steve Wozniak , who co - founded Apple with Mr Jobs in the 1970s but left a decade later , says the announcements should prove "" exciting and fulfilling "" .
For competitors looking to scoop the iPod announcements , "" it is not so much a matter of catching up as getting on the right track , "" he told the Guardian .
Bobbie Johnson reports live from Las Vegas and San Francisco all next week Comeback kid
After a decade away , Steve Jobs rejoined Apple in 1996 and found the business close to ruin .
The firm 's co - founder put an emphasis back on the brand , design and marketing and pushed for something that would be as startling as the original Macintosh had been in 1984 .
The first iMac , encased in translucent blue plastic , was launched in 1998 followed by the white iBook laptop in 1999 .
But it was the launch of the iPod , the digital music player , that really kickstarted Apple 's revival in 2001 .
Apple had long regarded itself as a premium product , aimed at a small but wealthy niche .
With the iPod , it has rediscovered its appetite for the mass market .
In recent years , it has launched products such as the Mac Mini , stripped - down hardware that can be used with cheaper screens , and Boot Camp , software that allows users to load Windows on to their Macs , in the hope of reaching a wider market .
Cheaper iPod versions have also been launched , including the Shuffle .
In its latest quarter , the company sold 8.7 m iPods , up 35 % on the same period a year earlier , defying sceptics who forecast a slowdown .
The iPod is also having a positive impact on sales of other Apple products .
The firm sold 1.6 m Macs - a 30 % rise on the previous figures .

2007-01-09,"People going to Steve Jobs 's Macworld keynote speech can , once again , play Keynote Bingo using a card printed out from Ars Technica .
The site says : Experienced keynote bingo - ers may notice that some squares left unmarked at WWDC are carried over to the new card .
This is as it should be , I think .
A square that remains plausible enough to be on a bingo card , but is eternally left unmarked , says something important about the interplay between what Mac fans want and what Apple chooses to produce .
And yes , there 's a square for both "" iPhone "" and "" No iPhone "" because , at this point , either one is a story .
It 's not all about products .
For example , one square is for Steve Jobs saying "" boom "" .
You can also compare this with a pioneering Stevenote version from our own Charles Arthur from 2005 ."
2007-01-09,"The biggest surprise of Steve Jobs ' keynote came right at the start .
The Apple chief executive was already expected to continue Apple 's push into the world of showbiz with a glitzy launch of a television set - top box , and a new mobile phone .
Only the audacious execution of the phone plans , of which more later , raised a further eyebrow .
But what really caught seasoned Apple - watchers out was Jobs ' turtleneck ; it was brown , not black .
In all my encounters with Jobs - I reported on the company for several years from 1998 -
I never saw him not wearing his trademark black turtleneck , blue jeans and sneakers .
Maybe I pay too much attention to a middle - aged man 's dress .
Maybe his sartorial arrangements were all a sensible precaution , to make sure the sleek black frame of the beautiful new iPhone would show up properly in the photographs , rather than be lost in the folds of Jobs ' top .
There will , after all , be many photographs of this new , beautiful thing .
In a mobile phone world that , in recent years , has seen precious little innovation in form , beyond Motorola 's beautiful but functionally clumsy Razr range , Apple 's iPhone stands out for shunning most of what 's gone before .
There are no keys .
There 's no aerial stub at the top .
You communicate with it not through pushes or stabs , but strokes and touches .
We can hope - even assume - the device will buck the Motorola and Nokia trend , and be responsive and easy to use .
With its multimedia functionality , it should be a strong introduction for Apple into the mobile market - a market that 's much larger , and more valuable , than that for MP3 players .
Of course , ahead of actually seeing one - they go on sale in the US in the summer , and in the UK towards the end of the year - I 'll have my concerns , same as with any first generation Apple product .
The battery might not last too long , especially with heavy use .
That touch keyboard might look lovely , but might be a bit rubbish if you have fat fingers .
As with Sony 's sleek PSP , maybe we 'll fret about accumulating fingerprints and gunk on its sleek plastic skin .
Who knows .
But Apple is deadly serious about putting its new baby to work .
It intends the iPhone to give it huge presence in a new market , just as the iPod did after its launch in 2001 .
You can tell because Jobs rolled out the tech industry equivalent of a 12 gun salute - the bosses of Google and its great rival , Yahoo - on the stage in San Francisco .
Eric Schmidt ( of Google ) and Jerry Yang ( of Yahoo ) were n't there to talk of any great technical breakthrough - the iPhone 's integration with their web portals is easily done .
What was significant was that they putting aside their rivalries to give the iPhone their blessing .
They appeared , they gushed , they sent a message : Apple is partying with the net 's celebs , in a triangle it sits atop - its device , supported and made more valuable by Yahoo 's content and Google 's information .
This kind of partnership , each party looking after its own bit of the business , mutually beneficial , is the way of the web .
Compare and contrast with the scene unfolding hundreds of miles away in Las Vegas a couple of days before .
Bill Gates , for all his philanthropic good deeds , is - on a good day - a charisma - free zone with patchy scriptwriters .
He tried his best , talking of Microsoft 's ambitions to connect with you wherever you are , in the home , in the car .
But it 's a message he 's been selling for years .
His latest partnership : with Ford , soon to be America 's third biggest car maker ( down from second ) who 'll make it easier to connect gizmos up while on the road .
His pitch was interesting , technically , but not a compelling reason either to buy a Zune - Microsoft 's appallingly received iPod rival - or a Ford car .
The kids of America are in a Toyota or BMW , it seems .
Because Gates was talking concepts , not individual products , he struggled to make his vision sound real , let alone something to take over the world .
On stage in San Francisco today , Jobs was waving the thing , the dream made reality , around his head , even if he was proposing to take only a modest 1 % of the mobile phone market - or around 10 m phones - by next year .
Do n't be fooled .
Back in 2001 , he said Apple wanted only 5 % of the MP3 player market , and now he has three quarters of it , stoutly defended by a built - in iTunes software / store lock - in .
Looking back , there was never any question that Apple wanted more , from day one .
Lest we get too misty - eyed about Apple 's free - wheelin ' California spirit , let 's remember this is a ruthlessly effective and increasingly huge business .
It would be hard to imagine Apple refusing a device monopoly in this new world , of the kind Microsoft had in operating systems in the PC era .
That 's why the stock markets reacted so strongly to Apple 's moves , pushing its stock up 8 % to a market capitalisation of nearly $ 80bn ( at the time of writing ) within hours of the iPhone 's arrival , just as it wiped roughly the same percentage from the stock of Research in Motion , makers of the suddenly rather ungainly - looking Blackberry handheld .
Jobs , recently cleared of wrongdoing after an investigation into stock option grants at Apple , will be overjoyed .
Apple shareholders of any standing are raking it in .
Three years ago , when I wrote this piece , Apple 's stock languished at $ 15 a pop .
And , even of that skimpy valuation , their cash pile at the time was worth $ 11 a share .
An analyst soberly told me the product pipeline - the line - up of upcoming products - was rubbish , and Merrill Lynch told its investors to sell AAPL .
Those who held their nerves may have chosen to switch merchant bank , but are a lot richer for their stubbornness .
These days the stock tops $ 90 , after a two for one stock split .
Back in the day , had I ignored the analyst 's advice and mortgaged the house to buy Apple stock , I maybe would n't be paying such close professional attention to the attire of a balding , middle - aged man .
The mortgage would be paid and , instead , from a distant beach I 'd be raising a glass to Steve Jobs ' mighty strategic skills .
I did n't make the investment - our professional ethics forbid that and , besides , I 'm too much of a coward to make a good gambler .
Not so Jobs :
his skills have transformed Apple from being an intriguing fringe act to a star show that can command performances from technology 's biggest names , wheeled onto Apple 's stage to dance to Jobs ' iTunes ."
2007-01-09,"Apple chief executive Steve Jobs has confirmed the company is to launch the iPhone , a touchscreen handset combining mobile phone , internet access , and iPod music and video playback features .
The internet - ready iPhone will use the Apple OS X operating system and allow users to watch movies , download songs and store photos , as well as offering email , calendar and contacts software found in rival products such as the Blackberry .
Speaking at the MacWorld Expo in San Francisco , Mr Jobs described the iPhone - which uses patented touchscreen technology instead of traditional buttons - as a "" leapfrog "" product .
He said it would revolutionise the mobile phone market the way Apple revolutionised personal computers with the Macintosh in the 80s and more recently opened up the music download market with the iPod .
However , Mr Jobs did not explain how Apple is able to use the name iPhone , the rights for which are owned by technology company Cisco .
Mr Jobs claimed that the software capability of the iPhone puts it five years ahead of any other product in the mobile market , describing rivals ' mobile technology as "" baby software "" .
He also revealed that the company 's television set - top box , codenamed iTV , would be called Apple TV .
Apple is launching the box in February in the US at a price of $ 299 ( £ 154 ) .
"" This is a day I 've been looking forward to for two and a half years , "" said Mr Jobs .
"" Every once in a while a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything .
"" One is very fortunate if you get to work on just one of these in your career .
Apple has been very fortunate that it 's been able to introduce a few of these into the world . ""
The iPhone rates as one of the slimmest smart mobile handsets around at 11.6 mm thick .
It also includes a two mega - pixel camera and will run with the Safari internet browser and access to products such as Google Maps .
Google 's search bar will be built into the iPhone browser , while a deal with Yahoo ! will see a free email product offered to users .
The battery life of the phone will allow for five hours of talk time , video and browsing , and 16 hours of audio playback .
To protect the iPhone Mr Jobs said the company has filed more than 200 patents .
A 4Gb model will be available for $ 499 ( £ 257 ) and an 8Gb model for $ 599 ( £ 309 ) .
The iPhone will be available in the US from June , in Europe by the end of the year , and in Asia in 2008 .
Mr Jobs also confirmed that Cingular , the largest mobile operator in the US , has been chosen as the exclusive iPhone partner in America .
Apple shares were up more than 5 % following the iPhone announcement , while Research In Motion , which makes the Blackberry , was down by just over 5 % . ·

Apple 's been very fortunate because it 's been able to introduce a few of these - in 1984 the Macintosh changed the whole computer industry .

2007-01-09,"David Sobotta , the ex - Apple employee who wrote last week 's section front page article , ""
What Steve Jobs told me on the iPhone "" , has sent us his comments on today 's announcements : "" The biggest transition for Apple has not been the move to Intel processors , but the movement from a computer company to a high end consumer gadget company .
The iPhone is without a doubt the most elegant of gadgets , but I get the feeling the reflection you see in the shiny surface might well be the high water mark for Apple .
Time will tell if the iPhone will live up to euphoria that seems to have gripped the Apple world today . ""
The most overdue announcement was taking ' Computers ' out of Apple 's name .
There is some sadness from seeing that actually happen .
At one time Apple produced the computer for the rest of us .
That seems to be flipped on its head these days even as Apple 's market share grows .
My guess is that in spite of the iPhone and the other i - products , history will still look on Bill Gates more favorably than Steve Jobs .
Then again , "" One Laptop Per Child "" might surpass them both . """
2007-01-10,"Photo from Engadget 's live blogging of the keynote
During his Macworld keynote , launching the iPhone , Steve Jobs announced what sounded like a modest target : to sell 10 million phones in 2008 .
With a world market of 957 million phones in 2006 , Apple was only looking for a 1 % market share .
Easy , right ?
If you could go into any store and buy an unlocked SIM - free iPhone then it probably would be easy , even at $ 499 and $ 599 a pop .
However , in the US , you will only be able to get the phone from Cingular , apparently on a two - year contract .
Frankly , if I was going to sign a two year contract with a UK network , I 'd expect to get a $ 600/£300 smart phone free .
So to start with , Apple is not trying to get 1 % of the billion unit cell phone market : it 's limited to roughly 60 million Cingular users , plus the number of extra customers Cingular can handle .
( A lot of Mac fans are going to switch to Cingular . )
Will iPhone be available to other networks ?
It 's not clear .
In the Time magazine article , Apple 's New Calling : The iPhone , Lev Grossman writes : Jobs demanded special treatment from his phone service partner , Cingular , and he got it .
He even forced Cingular to re - engineer its infrastructure to handle the iPhone 's unique voicemail scheme . ""
They broke all their typical process rules to make it happen , "" says Tony Fadell , who heads Apple 's iPod division .
"" They were infected by this product , and they were like , we 've got ta do this ! ""
What makes sense to Cingular may not make sense to other network providers , even if Apple gives them the option .
In particular , some network providers aim to make money from selling high - priced music and movie downloads direct to their mobile phone users .
It 's a safe bet that the iPhone ( like the iPod ) will be incompatible with those services , and iPhone users will get their content from Apple instead .
( Update : the iPhone gets its music via a PC or Mac , not over the air . )
In other words , adopting the iPhone means a network is obliged to hand over to Apple some of its most profitable business opportunities .
In doing that , it will also reinforce Apple 's monopoly of the copy - protected download market .
Cingular can make that trade - off because it does n't have a music service and because it has an exclusive on the iPhone .
It is willing to give up business opportunities and , ultimately , control of its own customers .
Other networks may think differently .
If the iPhone takes off like the iPod , however , other networks may be marginalised .
Remember , Apple is a wholly proprietary company . ""
Think different "" does not mean letting a thousand different flowers bloom .
It means "" Think exactly what Steve Jobs tells you to think . ""
Does that worry you ?
If not , why not ?"
2007-01-10,"The iPhone looked amazing when Steve Jobs demonstrated it in his Macworld keynote , but how will it survive in real life ?
At least a couple of reports have appeared .
Gizmodo 's Brian Lam got 15 minutes to play with one , and "" First thing I did ?
I called my mom . ""
He says : Keyboard : The softkey , on screen buttons are small .
Think index finger , not thumb .
Maybe I was n't doing it right .
The keys pop up when I put my finger down on the keys , but do you think the proximity sensor knows when I get close ( but before I touch ) , and if I hover with my digit , it 'll blow up the keys so they 're easier to hit ?
( Am I making sense ? )
David Pogue , a big Mac fan from The New York Times , had meetings with Jobs and Schiller and says : "" I basically played with the iPhone the entire hour . ""
Among other things , he says : Typing is difficult .
The letter keys are just pictures on the glass screen , so of course there 's no tactile feedback .
Software helps a lot .
You can afford to make a lot of typos as you muddle through a word , because the software analyzes which keys you * might * have meant and figures out the word you wanted .
Its best guess appears just under what you 've typed ; if it 's correct , you tap the Space bar to accept it and continue .
I typed a couple of e - mail messages with lots of typos but eventually 100 percent accuracy , thanks to this auto - correct feature .
( My testing did n't involve proper names , however . )
Also , he says "" The Web browsing experience is incredible .
"" I 'm a heavy keyboard user , so this is a critical issue for me -- but not necessarily for everyone else !
However , if you go back to the days of the Compaq iPaq , there were PDAs and PocketPC - based phones much like the iPhone , and they had touch screens and handwriting recognition rather than keyboards .
The RIM BlackBerry reversed that market trend .
People who had abandoned keyboards suddenly brought them back -- including Palm / Handspring with the Treo .
Meanwhile , Jupiter Research analyst Michael Gartenberg has a short note on what 's missing .
He says : "" It 's not extensible by third parties , only Apple .
The means at the moment no RSS readers , no Slingplayers "" ; and "" There is no support for Microsoft Office attachments . ""
There 's also no 3 G support , which may not be important in the US market , where the slow and clunky 2.5 G EDGE provides a substitute .
I expect a few other people will get hands - on experience of the iPhone .

I 'd be particularly interested if someone could provide info about what 's inside the iPhone .

2007-01-10,"With the launch of its new iPhone , Apple may not only have prompted hysteria in gadget lovers across the world but also have brought an end to one of the longest running feuds in music after the unmistakable sounds of Lovely Rita ( meter maid ) were heard as backing music at the Macworld conference in San Francisco yesterday .
After years of legal squabbles between the technology company and the Beatles ' company , Apple Corp , over who owns the rights to the distinctive name - a fight that has left Apple 's online music store iTunes unable to sell The Beatles music , despite being the world 's leading legal digital music site - it appears a truce may soon be at hand .
As well as playing Lovely Rita during his keynote address , Apple chief executive Steve Jobs was seen flicking through artwork from albums Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band and Abbey Road on a monitor as he presented his new device to the audience .
These little gestures were enough to start the rumour mill turning and a source familiar with the dispute between the two Apples told Reuters today that ongoing meetings between the two Apple companies continue to take place and that , "" It would make sense that the Beatles would bring their music online and it 's safe to assume that something sooner rather than later will happen .
"" This is not the first hint that the fab four 's music could soon be available digitally .
At an industry conference last November head of EMI 's North American division David Munns told audiences that The Beatles ' music would be available for download "" soon "" .
No official comment has been made by either Apple companies on a settlement , but with every minutiae of a Jobs address pored over by the Mac loving public , anticipation that some kind of resolution might be on hand is certainly growing ."
2007-01-10,"I 'm not one to get excited about gadgets , nor do I believe that Steve Jobs is bigger than Jesus , but still , I want an iPhone .
It looks like a technological marvel , combining a mobile phone , an internet communications device , an iPod , a camera and , er , a paperweight , in one slick , slim little box .
The iPhone does n't necessarily do anything other products do n't do already , but it 's the way it does them that gets me excited .
It looks like it lets you access all those features through a big doorway rather than the tiny keyhole current devices seem to offer .
In true Apple style , it has all been stripped down to something that 's beautifully simple - and therefore looks beautiful .
No ugly , poky little fingernail keyboards .
Instead , a smooth , black screen rimmed with silver that bears as much resemblance to your average mobile as an iPod does to a Walkman .
And there 's just one button !
All the other buttons are on the touch - sensitive screen , which means you can match the keyboard to what you need it for - typing , dialling numbers , navigating music , etc .
You can do useful things like select which voice message you want to hear , rather than having to roll through them all .
Added to which , there 's a whole new vocabulary of futuristic commands to learn , involving swiping your fingers across the screen , a bit like Tom Cruise in Minority Report .
Actually , if we 're talking movies , I think Jonathan I ve and the Apple designers are really channelling Kubrick 's 2001 .
This is the nearest thing we 've yet achieved to the black monolith : its minimal , sophisticated , and less highly evolved beings will have no idea what it does or how to use it .
So when you slap it on the meeting room table amidst all those BlackBerrys and Nokias , what you 're really saying I
: , "" I am looking down at all you scum from a higher branch of the evolutionary tree .
"" Who does n't want that ?
There are sure to be plenty of teething troubles and techie shortcomings I have n't thought about : low memory , short battery life , some glitch whereby you end up taking pictures of your ear while sending all your phone numbers to U2
( here 's a link to some ) .
But I 'm not planning on exchanging my phone or iPod for anything else .
Or have I just been seduced by the Jobs ' seer - salesman shtick ?"
2007-01-11,"Steve Jobs stumbled a couple of times , calling it "" iTV "" - the codename given when the product was flashed before an audience last September - but on Tuesday he finally showed off the "" Apple TV "" .
It 's a device that will stream content from up to five computers in a house to a high - definition TV set , either through an Ethernet connection or wirelessly using the new ( and barely complete ) 802.11n standard , which gives data transfers of up to 540 megabits per second over roughly 50 m .
The biggest buzz , of course , came with the long - awaited launch of the "" iPhone "" - which apparently retained that name despite Cisco and its Linksys subsidiary already having a trademark of the same name .
That is not due to appear in the UK before the autumn , though its considerable drool factor - a touch- and gesture - controlled phone / iPod / Wi - Fi device - will probably see many Britons visiting the US to buy it for bragging rights alone .
But the Apple TV , with its built - in 40 GB hard drive , puts the final piece in place of Apple 's "" digital hub "" concept , first enunciated by Jobs five years ago at the same Macworld venue in San Francisco .
The Apple TV also offers internet connectivity , linking to Apple 's site to show film trailers .
The US price will be $ 299 , with shipping there planned to start in February ; for the UK the price is £ 199 ( including VAT ) , with shipping also scheduled for February .
The product , though , will face competition in the US from Netgear , which announced a similar product at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , while Sling Media announced its Slingcatcher , which will work as a remote receiver for streamed TV sent over the net .
In the UK , too , there are already well - placed rivals including British Telecom , with its BT Vision service , which includes a 160 GB drive , two digital TV receivers , and video on demand via broadband .
Sky , too , has a broadband service which it aims to expand to video on demand .
Meanwhile , with a number of analysts and bloggers having questioned how well the iTunes Store was faring at selling music , Jobs told the Macworld audience that it has sold 2bn songs , and was now the fourth - largest seller of music in the US - ahead of Amazon : "" We are now selling over five million songs a day .

2007-01-11,"Apple 's CEO , Steve Jobs , presents the new iPhone .
Photographer : AP Photo / Paul Sakuma
The launch of the new Apple iPhone may "" reinvent the telecoms sector "" , as Steve Jobs has been repeatedly quoted as saying , but , for me , its innovation is less apparent in the physical makeup of the new product than it stands to be in the service innovation that will be essential to the product 's success ( as with the iPod in the past ) .
The product 's design , technology and breakthroughs in software - full - blown Mac OSX and the patented new interface system , Multi - Touch - disguise the true innovation behind it .
Just as the iPod 's long - run differentiating factor was the availability of iTunes , a better service than all other MP3 players could muster , it will be the business model for the phone service that people can receive that will determine the product 's success and industry impact .
No one will want an iPhone , however nice to look at , if they can only use the advanced features by paying per kilobyte to download or alternatively only get poor - quality music , or if they get hit with massive , or massively variable , bills .
Success here means that Apple will need to innovate across its organisation as it has in the past .
The innovative business model being hammered out by the legal and sales teams will be at least as important as the leaps made in the research and development lab over the past ten years .
If UK businesses are to learn from Apple 's success , it will be through an increased understanding of the need to combine product and service innovation in the 21st century ."
2007-01-11,"As soon as I saw Steve Jobs demonstrating the iPhone , I suspected it did n't have an Intel x86 or IBM PowerPC chip inside : they 'd probably consume too much power , and get far too hot .
So during the keynote , I wrote : It 's also hard to imagine doing this on an Intel or PowerPC chip -- even a slow one .
Has Apple ported OS X to the ARM chip ?
( The ARM was used in the Apple Newton and Apple was one of ARM 's founding shareholders when it was spun out of Acorn . )
If not , have you got a better suggestion ?
The two most likely options seemed to be a Transmeta chip -- those have not been very successful -- or an ARM .
The ARM seemed the most likely candidate because ARM - compatible chips dominate the handheld market -- they are used by RIM , Palm ( Treo ) , and all the Windows Mobile phones -- and because of the tie - in with the Newton .
( And I certainly know the ARM can run Unix because I still have an Acorn Archimedes workstation in my loft , from the 1980s . )
The irony is that it could still be an "" Intel "" chip , if Apple used the Intel XScale version of the ARM .
The point is that ARM does not make chips , it licenses technology .
However , back in the days , one of the licensees was Digital Equipment Corp , which developed the StrongARM processor .
But Compaq bought DEC , and Compaq did n't want a chip division , so the StrongARM guys were acquired by Intel .
There , they developed the StrongARM into the XScale , which was a success .
So it all might seem straightforward : Apple dumps the PowerPC line and moves to Intel , which offers both x86 and ARM - compatible Risc processors .
But it does n't .
Here 's another irony .
For whatever reason , Intel offloaded its ARM division to Marvell Technology Group in June "" for a purchase price of $ 600 million plus the assumption by Marvell of certain liabilities "" .
The Marvell press release says : Intel intends to continue manufacturing products currently sold by this business for handheld devices and embedded applications , and to manufacture products that are being designed into upcoming devices .
This arrangement is expected to continue while Marvell arranges other manufacturing resources .
Intel and Marvell do not anticipate disruptions in the supply of these products due to this planned sale .
But if Intel knew that Apple was designing XScale chips into what could be a blockbuster product , would it have flogged off its XScale division ?
There 's another possibility .
Apple used to get chips from Motorola ( 68000 , then PowerPC ) .
Motorola spun off its chip division as Freescale , with Apple as a customer , and Freecale is also an ARM licensee .
The iPhone development could therefore have started with an ARM - compaitble chip from Freescale .....
So is it Freescale , Intel , Marvell , or someone else entirely ?
It could even be Apple , because Apple could license the ARM core directly , just like anyone else .
However , unless Apple did this , we can be sure it 's no use asking ARM .
Footnote :
I forgot this , but EE Times was quick to post a list of the chip companies expected to benefit from the iPhone .. but it does n't include the processor ."
2007-01-11,"The launch of Apple 's iPhone sent shockwaves across the rest of the technology industry yesterday as the race started to bring the Silicon Valley giant 's latest gadget to Britain later this year .
Fears that the touchscreen handset seriously threatens major mobile phone brands such as Nokia , Motorola , SonyEricsson and Palm led investors to sell shares across the telecoms sector following the unveiling of the combined music player , mobile phone , email and internet device by Apple 's chief executive , Steve Jobs , on Tuesday .
Even the usually restrained American news magazine Time seemed to lose its head , proclaiming that "" Apple 's new iPhone could do to the cellphone market what the iPod did to the portable music player market : crush it pitilessly beneath the weight of its own superiority "" .
While the blogosphere was filled with discussion of the iPhone , UK mobile phone networks and at least one high street retailer began the process of trying to clinch a deal with Apple to bring the iPhone to this side of the Atlantic .
Four mobile phone companies - O2 , Orange , T - Mobile and Vodafone - as well as the UK 's largest independent mobile phone retailer , Carphone Warehouse , are interested .
Carphone 's chief executive , Charles Dunstone , said : "" Anyone would like an exclusive deal with Apple on this
and we are as close to them as anyone .
"" Being the only place in the UK where people can buy the iPhone , even if only for a few weeks , would be worth millions to a company like Carphone .
The mobile phone companies , meanwhile , are looking for a British version of the deal that Apple has signed with America 's largest mobile network , Cingular .
Mr Jobs is understood to have held talks with senior executives from across the European mobile phone industry .
Last night there was growing speculation that O2 could secure the deal after reports in Spain that its parent company , Telefonica , has snatched a deal for its home market .
Whoever gets the deal , the iPhone will transform the mobile phone market , according to Mr Dunstone .
"" There 's going to be an enormous scramble , "" he said .
"" Nokia , Motorola , SonyEricsson , everyone is going to have to come out with their iPhone - beating products before the iPhone itself comes out .
As usual , Steve Jobs has raised the bar for everyone .
"" The iPhone will be out in the US in June , with a UK launch scheduled for the last three months of the year .
Handsets
The biggest impact of the iPhone is likely to be on makers of multi - media mobile phones .
The handset industry has jumped on the digital music bandwagon , which itself was set rolling by the iPod , and a third of new mobile phones now contain a music player .
Nokia is heavily advertising its N series , which includes the N91 , with a 4 GB memory , the same as the basic iPhone ; SonyEricsson has 11 phones in its Walkman range ; and there are a host of other handsets such as LG 's Chocolate that include MP3 players as standard .
There has already been one iTunes - compatible mobile phone - Motorola 's Rokr - but it could only store 100 songs and got poor reviews .
Motorola now has a range of music phones that can store many more tracks and recently announced the MotoRizr Z6 , which , though half the capacity of the iPhone , can accept music from 200 online retailers - though not iTunes .
To date , transferring music on to a phone has been laborious and sometimes frustrating .
Moving music from iTunes to the iPhone , in contrast , will be as easy as it is to "" sync "" an iPod .
The size of iPhone 's impact will be tempered by its price , says Stuart Jeffrey , analyst at Lehman Brothers.""In order to materially impact Nokia , Motorola , SonyEricsson et al , the iPhone would likely need to fall significantly in price . ""
MP3 players Steve Jobs himself described the iPhone as "" the best iPod ever "" when he launched it on Tuesday and Apple is looking to the phone to strengthen its lead over other makers of MP3 players .
Apple hopes that combining the iPod with a phone will give it an edge against Microsoft 's recently launched Zune and Creative 's Zen .
Even before Jobs spoke in California , Microsoft said it had looked at adding phone functions to Zune but that was not "" the number one thing we are focused on "" , suggesting Apple was wasting its time .
Apple , however , hopes the iPhone will represent a new wave of mobile music growth .
It already dominates the digital player market - in the UK iPod ownership outstrips other MP3 players two to one - but sales of standalone players have slowed .
Bloggers were yesterday debating whether the iPhone will cannibalise sales of the iPod .
But Martin Garner , director at telecoms and technology consultants Ovum , reckons : "" Apple has positioned the iPhone as an upgrade to the iPod and many of the early buyers will be iPod users .
"" The music industry is hoping that the iPhone will provide a further boost to music sales .
Richard Gooch , of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry , said : "" Digital music is in large part about convergence , portability and mobility .
Apple 's iPhone seems to hit all these sweetspots .
""
Mobile email
For many people in business the BlackBerry has become a status symbol - the mobile email device , made by Canadian company Research
In Motion , represents the importance attached to them by their companies .
But there are an increasing number of devices that bring mobile email and even web browsing to the many , and the iPhone represents a major challenge to the rest of the market .
With the ability to synchronise easily with most email services and alert the user when new messages arrive , Apple is attacking the market also occupied by Palm , Motorola 's Moto Q , the Sidekick from T - Mobile and Nokia 's E62 .
The big difference is these competing devices have small keyboards , while Apple has gone for a touch screen .
How resilient the screen is to scratches and knocks remains to be seen .
The iPhone is also thinner than its rivals and includes a full - blown Mac internet browser rather than the pared - down browser usually found on a mobile device .
The 3.5 inch display allows whole web pages to be easily viewed , which can be tricky on some other devices .
But the mobile network technology the iPhone uses could make web browsing slow unless you stay in one place and use the phone 's wi - fi .
Analysts reckon BlackBerry 's corporate customers are unlikely to switch en masse , but Palm could see sales suffer .
Camera phones The camera phone has turned everyone into a potential paparazzo .
More are sold worldwide than digital cameras , and technology research house Gartner reckons that half of all handsets sold last year included a camera .
But photographers are unlikely to abandon their cameras for Apple 's new gadget .
At just two megapixels resolution , the iPhone ranks as only a mid - range camera phone and is still well below digital camera standards ."
2007-01-11,"The launch of Apple 's multi - million dollar iPhone has been marred by a dispute over the name with Cisco Systems , which last night sued Apple in a San Francisco court .
Cisco claims that Apple 's use of the iPhone name violates a tradermark Cisco took out six years ago .
The two companies had been in talks to recolve the dispute and Apple chief Steve Jobs had been hoping to secure agreement before the high - profile launch of the new phone with music player and camera .
Apple shares jumped to an all - time high on Wall Street yesterday as analysts raised their share price targets for the group today on the back of prospects for the iPhone .
Consumer reaction has been enthusiastic and it is expected to be an instant sell - out when it arrives in shops in the United States in June .
It will launch in Europe later in the year .
Apple spokeswoman Natalie Kerris told Associated Press the Cisco 's lawsuit was "" silly "" and said there are already several other companies using the iPhone name for different products .
She said : "" We believe that Cisco 's US trademark registration is tenuous at best .
Apple 's the first company to use the iPhone name for a cell phone .
And if Cisco wants to challenge us on it , we 're very confident we will prevail . ""
Apple shares closed yesterday at $ 97 ( £ 50 ) , up $ 4.43 , but fell 40 cents to $ 96.60 in after - hours trading following news of the legal action .

2007-01-11,"Cisco has filed a lawsuit against Apple to prevent it using the name iPhone for its much - hyped new iPod - meets - smartphone device due out later this year .
Business systems group Cisco has filed a lawsuit in the US district court for northern California to "" prevent Apple from infringing upon and deliberately copying and using Cisco 's registered iPhone trademark , "" the company said in a statement .
Steve Jobs , the chief executive of Apple , unveiled the eagerly anticipated hybrid product - and its iPhone brand name - earlier this week at the Macworld Expo in San Francisco .
However , Mr Jobs did not address the issue of how Apple had secured rights to use the name , which was obtained by Cisco in 2000 when it acquired Infogear .
Infogear originally filed for trademark protection in 1996 .
Linksys , a division of Cisco , has been shipping a family of iPhone products since early last year .
In December last year Linksys launched additional products in the range . ""
Cisco entered into negotiations with Apple in good faith after Apple repeatedly asked permission to use Cisco 's iPhone name , "" said Mark Chandler , the senior vice - president and general counsel at Cisco .
"" There is no doubt that Apple 's new phone is very exciting , but they should not be using our trademark without permission . ""

2007-01-13,"Days after revealing his new iPhone to an admiring world , Apple 's chief executive Steve Jobs has come down to earth with a thud .
The computer boss is facing fresh questions over his involvement in the alleged manipulation of share options .
It emerged yesterday that federal authorities are focusing on backdated options awarded to Mr Jobs in October 2001 .
The date of the award was adjusted months later to make it worth an estimated $ 20 m ( £ 10.4 m ) more .
The securities and exchange commission , together with federal prosecutors in San Francisco , want to know why Apple 's records showed that the award was approved at a special board meeting - when no such meeting took place .
As further details of the scandal leaked yesterday , Apple 's shares dropped by 2.1 % to $ 93.76 - reversing gains made when the company unveiled its phone at this week 's Macworld conference .
Analysts are concerned about Apple 's future if the furore claims the scalp of Mr Jobs , who is the company 's charismatic driving force and main inspiration .
Wall Street experts say Apple could lose a fifth of its market value at a stroke if Mr Jobs left .
Charles Golvin of Forrester Research said : "" I believe the impact on Apple would be very severe and quite negative . ""
A California legal publication , The Recorder , has revealed that a young Apple lawyer , Wendy Howell , created false documents to cover up changes to Mr Jobs ' options .
She was fired last month but her lawyer says she was acting on the orders of Apple 's former general counsel , Nancy Heinen .
Ms Heinen , in turn , has pointed the finger further up the ranks .
Investigators want to talk to both women and to Apple 's former chief financial officer , Fred Anderson , who resigned when the remuneration saga began in October .
The company maintains that even if his options were manipulated , Mr Jobs did not benefit financially because he never exercised them .
Critics disagree , pointing out that he exchanged the options for $ 75 m of restricted stock in 2003 .
In an interview this week , Mr Jobs told CNBC that the company had investigated the issue thoroughly : "" We did find some things we wish had n't happened .
I , as CEO , am to some extent responsible . ""
When asked whether his job was secure , he said : "" I serve at the pleasure of the board and shareholders .
As long as they want me , I 'd like to continue doing the job . """
2007-01-13,"Cartoon posted on Wednesday by Hugh Macleod of http://www.gapingvoid.com/
With the effects of Steve Jobs 's "" reality distortion field "" fading fast , people are starting to wonder how many users really want to pay maybe $ 3,000 ( including contract ) for a locked - down phone where you ca n't even change the battery .
( In fact , can you even change the SIM ?
Anyone know ? )
Over at The New York Times , John Markoff has compared the iPhone to the original Mac , launched in 1984 : Despite its high price of $ 2,495 , the Macintosh initially sold briskly .
But Mr. Jobs 's early predictions of huge sales ( on Tuesday , in a similar fashion , he set a goal for the iPhone 1 percent of the world 's cellular phone market , or 10 million phones a year , by the end of 2008 ) failed to materialize .
The Mac 's stumble was in part because of pricing and in part because Mr. Jobs had intentionally restricted its expandability .
Despite his assertion that a slow data connection would be sufficient , the gamble failed when Apple 's business stalled and Mr. Jobs was forced out of the company by the chief executive he had brought in , John Sculley .
The Mac was overhyped like the iPhone so it immediately sold to the True Believers who did n't much care about the fact that it was both underpowered and crippled -- no graphics slot , no hard drive , no way to expand the memory etc .
But after that initial splash , Mac sales collapsed , and Apple ended up closing factories and laying off staff .
Jobs got the boot and eventually Apple came out with the redesigned three - piece "" open "" Mac II , with expansion slots .
Jobs had designed his locked - down proprietary computer as an appliance , on the same principle as ( to use Jobs 's own example ) a Maytag washing machine .
The iPhone appears to be even more locked down and the thinking seems to be the same : it 's an appliance designed for the bubblehead market .
( It "" just works "" -- now open your wallet and say "" help yourself "" . )
But that does n't mean the iPhone will fail .
There were n't many bubbleheads buying high - priced personal computers in the early 1980s , but today , the majority of the mobile market is for phones that are appliances .
I 'd guess there 's only a small minority who actually want a phone they can control ...."

Lights go down , roof retracts to lower Mr Jobs , seen reclining on a large , green velvet Victorian chaise longue suspended on wires .
Audience whoops and hollers .
Chaise longue touches the stage floor .
Mr Jobs gets off , stands up and shouts : ' Compress chaise longue ! '
At this point , the chaise longue flips in on itself many times to fold into a small , sleek , oblong , hand - held device , which Mr Jobs picks up .
Jobs ' Hellooooo technology experts ! '
Crowd ' Hellooo King of Glory ! '
Jobs '
Tonight , we make history as I present to you the new Apple iPhone .
[ Audience cheers . ]
The iPhone , as you have just seen , can fold out into a chaise longue .

Yes , my friends , the days of not being able to recline on your cellphone are over !
[ Audience stands up and sings ' Thank you , Lord God , for your gracious gifts ' to the tune of ' She 'll be Coming Round the Mountain

' So now let me take you through the superb array of functions the iPhone can bring into your life .
First , enhanced picture quality .
I simply point my little finger at this icon here and a screen appears on the phone .
Now , what 's this ?
[ Grainy , green video footage appears on the phone and is projected on to a large screen at the front of the hall . ]
Why , it 's the notorious video - phoned footage of Saddam Hussein 's hanging .
This footage sent shockwaves throughout the world .
Many people were appalled by what they saw .
I was appalled .
[ Meaningful pause ] .
I was appalled at the poor picture quality of the images !
[ Audience laughter , which lasts for three minutes . ] '
Surely , in this day and age , it must be possible to come up with a cellphone that can film the execution of vicious heads of state in a resolution greater than 1,200 x 800 pixels !
A death - cell phone , if you will !
[ The laughter causes cracks in the roof . ] '
See here , I simply wink at this icon at the bottom and the Saddam footage is now 10 times clearer .
[ On the large screen , the mushy footage has now been transformed into high - resolution images of a man with spit in his beard having his neck snapped . ]
You can see the angle !
[ Audience yelps like ruptured wolves . ] '
Now , of course , it would be wrong to film anything and everything .
We are all entitled to our privacy .
And the iPhone knows when to stop .
For example , here is a photograph of Prince William of England 's girlfriend , Kate Middleton . '
Now , here 's what happened earlier this week when I tried to film her coming out of her house .
[ The screen shows footage , beamed from the iPhone , of a front door of a house . ]
The door starts to open and , just as a young woman is about to emerge , the screen freezes , and a caption saying STOP !
THIS IS WRONG !
flashes over it .
The audience gasps for air , applauds loudly and then kisses each other . '
Yes , the iPhone knows when to stop .
But it also knows not to spoil your fun .
Of course , it 's wrong to film Kate Middleton of England , but it 's not wrong to speculate on what it would look like if we had filmed her .
So the iPhone has an inbuilt bank of 14,000 images showing what Kate Middleton would look like if you had carried on taking photos of her for years to come .
[ Waves his nose at the phone and a series of images come on to the screen . ]
Here she is looking as if she 's running away ; here she is looking like she 's crying ; here she is looking like she 's been filmed though a window shouting at William of England and William of England 's father who 's trying not to look at her , and here she is as if she were taking tranquillisers .
[ General silence from audience , as if in simple adoration . ]
' The iPhone has many more functions there simply is n't time to talk about today , though if you click this icon here , you actually get extra time .
The iPhone can work out a solution to the Middle East crisis , prove to all doubters that there was a Holocaust and plant a hedge in the Amazon jungle [ Polite applause ] but what I will finally reveal now is its best function , the ability to unblock drains !
[ Applause that only a sun god gets . ] '
Apple has done a deal with the makers of Mister Muscle to ensure that wherever you go , whether at home or in the office or on board a train with ridiculous plumbing , if you happen to have a blocked drain in your vicinity you can deal with the menace with one squirt of the iPhone .
[ Jobs squirts his iPhone and a jet of Mister Muscle shoots out , unblocking a large , clogged plughole . ]
The audience screams : ' Mister Muscle !
Mister Muscle !
You Do n't Tussle With Mister Muscle ! '
'
As the powerful liquid dissolves clogged hair and food grease , my iPhone can film the obliteration of mess and beam the pictures back to my children I am the Lord of all Things , the Master of the Universe and Tomorrow is my winged Steed . '
Jobs disappears into his iPhone , which ascends into the roof .
The people fling off their clothes in rapture .
A voice is heard saying ' The iPhone is on sale for $ 499 ' and the audience shouts : ' That 's too much ' and hurriedly leaves ."

2007-01-18,"If it reaches a court , even a judge might have to flip a coin on this one .
You never would have thought that people went into the world of trademark law to live on the edge amid a swirl of stories and rumours , but that 's been the tale of the "" iPhone "" ever since Steve Jobs uttered the word on Tuesday last week in San Francisco .
People were stunned partly because the subject had been researched to death , and all the trademark databases suggested that Linksys , and its subsequent parent Cisco , filed for the "" iPhone "" name some time ago - 1996 in the US .
( Have a look on uspto.gov under "" Trademarks "" . )
And generally , with trademarks , the first one in wins .
Talks between the two companies which would have ceremonially handed the iPhone name over to Apple stalled the night before Jobs 's speech because Cisco wanted to work with Apple on "" interoperability "" .
Quite why Jobs found this unpalatable is n't clear , but perhaps that 's why he paused perhaps a touch longer than usual when next day he said ""
And we 're calling it ... ""
Apple subsequently suggested there was no trademark overlap , because it is the only one using it for a mobile phone .
Unfortunately , its description of the trademark 's use contains the phrase "" computer hardware and software for providing integrated telephone communication with computerized global information networks "" - identical to Cisco 's .
But wait !
To retain a trademark , you must use it .
Cisco had six months to use or lose "" iPhone "" , at least in the US , last May ; it put out a product in December , seven months later .
Could Apple squeeze in ?
Stay tuned !

2007-01-24,"Apple 's boss Steve Jobs has been questioned by US government investigators about the company 's alleged misuse of stock options , which has become the subject of a flurry of litigation .
It emerged yesterday that Mr Jobs was interviewed last week by the US Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Mr Jobs was granted 7.5 m share options in 2001 .
Apple has since admitted that the options were backdated by two months to make them more valuable - and that the records of company board meetings were falsified .
A New York pension fund has stepped forward as the primary plaintiff in a potential class action by Apple shareholders who say the company 's mishandling of executive options diluted the share price .
The New York City Employees Retirement System , which manages $ 89bn ( £ 45bn ) in investments , has filed proceedings in a Californian court .
The suit names directors of Apple including Mr Jobs and the former US vice - president Al Gore , who is heading a committee investigating the scandal .
Apple is the highest profile of more than 150 companies caught up in a furore over the way share options were granted at the height of the technology boom at the beginning of the decade .
Mr Jobs has apologised to shareholders but maintains that he did not benefit personally .
Others disagree , pointing out that he swapped his options for $ 75 m of restricted stock in 2003 .
The Washington Post this week questioned why Mr Jobs had taken nine months to file a regulatory report .
Other Apple directors typically submitted their filings within weeks .
Apple 's chief financial officer , Peter Oppenheimer , told analysts that the company continued to "" voluntarily and pro - actively "" inform government investigators about its findings on the affair ."
2007-01-24,"Bloomberg is reporting that Apple 's chief executive , Steve Jobs , has been questioned by SEC investigators looking into backdated stock options .
Does that mean he 's guilty of anything ?
Of course not .
But it does mean that the Securities and Exchange Commission people are nagging away at a question that an internal report led by Al Gore said had been answered satisfactorily .
Valleyway has "" five reasons to fear for Steve Jobs "" ( which for some reason reminds us of Wired 's 1996 issue in which it had 100-odd suggestions for the between - Jobs Apple to save itself from destruction ) .
They boil down to : ( 1 ) the SEC does n't give up just because Apple had a good quarter ( 2 ) Jobs did benefit from the backdating , because the options were swapped for shares ( 3 ) board meeting records were faked ( 4 ) Apple has moved kinda slowly on all this ( 5 ) if the SEC bears down on him , Apple will have to pay out to keep him ( and his presence is estimated to add $ 20bn to the company 's capitalisation ) , and that payout to the SEC could be really big .
Jobs is n't alone in all this stock options anti - joy , of course .
The Wall Street Journal has a scoreboard of who 's under what in the options mess .
Last update was yesterday , but we 're sure they 'll add this detail on Apple in a moment .
And we have n't even mentioned Pixar ... where Disney is still carrying on an internal review after acquiring the company that , um , who used to be the chief executive ?

In his latest -- and possible last -- post , the anonymous Fake Steve says : Well my friggin lawyers are advising me that I will have to shut down this scandalous old blog .
Details not worth going into here .
Someday I 'll be able to explain .
Maybe I 'll write a book or something .

2007-02-05,"Apple has settled a decades - long trademark dispute with the Beatles ' company , Apple Corps , over who owns the rights to the name and logo , in a deal that could pave the way for band 's songs to be available to download legally for the first time .
Under the new agreement Steve Jobs , Apple 's chief executive , will own all of the trademarks related to the name and license certain trademarks back to Apple Corps for continued use .
The two parties agreed that the ongoing trademark lawsuit between the companies would end with each covering its own legal costs .
Download service iTunes will continue using the Apple name and logo .
Bookmaker William Hill has already moved to offer odds of 10/1 that the Beatles will have all the top 10 tracks in the official UK charts at the same time at some point this year , with the expectation that they will soon be available via iTunes and other music download services .
The bookmaker also has "" Hey Jude "" as favourite , at 8/1 , to be the first Beatles song to hit number one in the digital era .
"" We love the Beatles , and it has been painful being at odds with them over these trademarks , "" said Mr Jobs in a joint statement .
"" It feels great to resolve this in a positive manner , and in a way that should remove the potential of further disagreements in the future . ""
Neil Aspinall , the manager of Apple Corps , added : "" It is great to put this dispute behind us and move on .
The years ahead are going to be very exciting times for us . ""
"" We wish Apple Inc every success and look forward to many years of peaceful co - operation with them . ""
The official chart was overhauled earlier this year to allow legal digital downloads to count towards rankings , regardless of whether the song is available to buy as a CD or vinyl single .
Rumours of a resolution to the Apple trademark row have been circulating since Mr Jobs unveiled the iPhone at the MacWorld Expo in San Francisco last month when a Beatles track was played , and cover art from one of the group 's records seen , during the presentation .
The dispute dates back to 1980 when the late George Harrison noticed an advertisement for Apple Computers in a magazine and argued there was a potential for trademark conflict with Apple Corps .
Apple Computer , as the company was then called , and Apple Corps reached an initial deal in 1981 .
However , the companies clashed again in the late 80s , resulting in a new deal thrashed out in 1991 that kept Apple from entering the music business .
The Beatles ' Apple Corps filed a further trademark suit against Apple Inc in 2003 arguing that the iTunes music store and iPod MP3 player violated the 1991 deal .
Last May a court in London ruled in favour of Apple Inc , with a judge ruling that iPod and iTunes did not breach the deal because they only conveyed music and did not create it .
Apple Corps ' appeal was scheduled to be held later this month .
The new deal struck today replaces the 1991 agreement . ·

2007-02-06,"Hold your jaw before you read .
Steve Jobs , Apple 's chief executive , has posted a not - inconsiderably long chunk of "" thoughts on music "" in which he offers three alternatives for the music industry to move forwards in its move to the online world .
And his favoured solution is not to protect music any more .
1 ) keep on with DRM .
Apple keeps winning .
Through the end of 2006 , customers purchased a total of 90 million iPods and 2 billion songs from the iTunes store .
On average , that 's 22 songs purchased from the iTunes store for each iPod ever sold .
Today 's most popular iPod holds 1000 songs , and research tells us that the average iPod is nearly full .
This means that only 22 out of 1000 songs , or under 3 % of the music on the average iPod , is purchased from the iTunes store and protected with a DRM .
The remaining 97 % of the music is unprotected and playable on any player that can play the open formats .
Its hard to believe that just 3 % of the music on the average iPod is enough to lock users into buying only iPods in the future .
And since 97 % of the music on the average iPod was not purchased from the iTunes store , iPod users are clearly not locked into the iTunes store to acquire their music .
2 )
Apple licenses its FairPlay DRM system ( which the record labels obliged it to develop ) .
Nope , ai n't gon na happen :
However , when we look a bit deeper , problems begin to emerge .
The most serious problem is that licensing a DRM involves disclosing some of its secrets to many people in many companies , and history tells us that inevitably these secrets will leak ...
Apple has concluded that if it licenses FairPlay to others , it can no longer guarantee to protect the music it licenses from the big four music companies .
Perhaps this same conclusion contributed to Microsoft 's recent decision to switch their emphasis from an "" open "" model of licensing their DRM to others to a "" closed "" model of offering a proprietary music store , proprietary jukebox software and proprietary players .
3 ) Get rid of the DRM .
Imagine a world where every online store sells DRM - free music encoded in open licensable formats .
In such a world , any player can play music purchased from any store , and any store can sell music which is playable on all players .
This is clearly the best alternative for consumers , and Apple would embrace it in a heartbeat .
If the big four music companies would license Apple their music without the requirement that it be protected with a DRM , we would switch to selling only DRM - free music on our iTunes store .
Every iPod ever made will play this DRM - free music .
Why should they , though ?
The simplest answer is because DRMs have n't worked , and may never work , to halt music piracy .
We 'd have liked to have noticed this while we were working on this week 's front page for the printed Technology section ; for some reason Steve ( we just call him "" Steve "" ) did n't call us as he normally does before putting out 2,000-word manifestoes about the future of digital music .
Oh well - you 'll have to read about how the music companies view it .
Reaction ?
There 's plenty .
Nick Carr , one of the columnists in the section , has a similar take to my own : that much of the drive here is to get the European countries that are trying to prise open FairPlay , or get Apple to license it , to stop doing that and start asking the record companies - many of whom , Jobs points out , are European - why they insist on DRM :
For Europeans , two and a half of the big four music companies are located right in their backyard .
The largest , Universal , is 100 % owned by Vivendi , a French company .
EMI is a British company , and Sony BMG is 50 % owned by Bertelsmann , a German company .
Convincing them to license their music to Apple and others DRM - free will create a truly interoperable music marketplace .
Apple will embrace this wholeheartedly .
And besides embracing it , would breathe a big sigh of relief .
Meanwhile , style points ( which any Guardian sub would have pointed out ) : he says The solution was to create a DRM system , which envelopes each song purchased from the iTunes store in special and secret software so that it can not be played on unauthorized devices .
I think the labels wanted Apple to envelop the songs in DRM , not "" envelope "" them .
Has he been too long reading our letters page ?"
2007-02-07,"Major record labels are expected to start stripping copyright protection from their music downloads within the next six months after Apple chief , Steve Jobs , forced the issue with an open letter to the industry .
Mr Jobs called on the big four major labels - Sony BMG , Universal , EMI and Warner Music - to abandon their policy of requiring Apple and other online retailers to package music downloads in digital rights management software that controls which devices it can be played on .
Apple , under fire from some consumers and record label executives for only allowing tracks downloaded from its iTunes store to be transferred to its market - leading iPod player , placed the blame squarely at the door of the big labels .
Mr Jobs , on the Apple website , argues that abandoning digital rights management was "" clearly the best alternative for consumers "" and said Apple would embrace such a move "" in a heartbeat "" .
Major label executives had privately hoped to force Apple to make both the iPod and iTunes Music Store , which uses its own proprietary format called Fairplay , interoperable with other players and online retailers .
But Mr Jobs said the only way forward was to remove the technology altogether "" because DRMs have n't worked , and may never work , to halt music piracy "" .
Analysts said Mr Jobs was hoping to force the major labels into action .
Most independent labels already make their music available in the non - restricted MP3 format .
"" Given what we are seeing with music companies and how they have insisted on this in the past it will not happen suddenly , it will be a gradual erosion as people like EMI play around with DRM - free tracks , "" said Paul Jackson , principal analyst at Forrester .
EMI has experimented with DRM - free releases by Lily Allen and Norah Jones .
A spokesman said today : "" The lack of interoperability between a rapidly expanding range of platforms and devices is definitely becoming more and more of an issue for music fans and we have been working with and will continue to work with our various partners to find a solution . ""
The other major labels refused to comment but privately take a similar line , putting the onus on technology companies to come up with a solution that will make it possible to play downloads on any portable player but also allow them to maintain control .
Peter Ruppert , founder of consultancy Entertainment Media Research , said : "" He 's just said the right thing at the right time , it 's great for his branding .
He 's going to announce a deal with some big major and they are going to get rid of DRM along with everyone else .
I think it 's going to be very sudden . ""
John Kennedy , head of international music industry group IFPI , said he was pleased that Mr Jobs now wanted to address interoperability , "" but he appears to be saying that interoperability has draconian side effects .
We do n't believe that that need be the case . ""
"" After such a long period without interoperability , it seems to me that the right thing to do would be for Steve Jobs to sit down with the industry and say ' I believe these are the consequences if I allow interoperability ' and for the industry to explain how we believe that some of the side effects that he believes are inevitable are not inevitable . ""
Until now Steve Jobs has not advocated interoperability ; perhaps now the door is open to find a combination of interoperability and DRM to have a win / win scenario for Apple , the music industry and the consumer . """
2007-02-07,"Apple chief executive Steve Jobs has called on the major record labels to sell digital music without anti - piracy technology , a move that he says could see it open the iTunes music store to media players other than just iPods .
Mr Jobs made the call for the abolition of Digital Rights Management on music sold online in a 1,900 word open letter , called Thoughts on Music , posted on Apple 's website .
He used the essay to deflect mounting criticism of Apple by European governments and consumer groups onto Universal Music , EMI , Sony BMG and Warner Music , which distribute about 70 % of the world 's music . ""
Much of the concern over DRM systems has arisen in European countries .
Perhaps those unhappy with the current situation should redirect their energies towards persuading the music companies to sell their music DRM - free . ""
For Europeans , two and a half of the big four music companies are located right in their backyard ... convincing them to license their music to Apple and others DRM - free will create a truly interoperable music marketplace .
Apple will embrace this wholeheartedly . ""
Last month , Norway said that Apple must open what it sees as the "" anti - competitive "" iTunes store to other media players or face legal action .
Consumer rights and protection groups in Denmark , Finland , France , Germany , the Netherlands and Sweden have also lodged complaints over Apple 's proprietary FairPlay DRM system .
"" DRM has been a really useful tool for Apple to lock - in customers but all they are really about is selling iPods , now the time has come where dropping DRM may be the best route to help them sell more , "" said Mark Mulligan , the vice - president and research director at JupiterResearch .
"" In addition , the deal with the Beatles ' Apple Corps will enable them , if they so choose , to pre - load music onto iPods . Pre - installing music could make the iTunes music store DRM issue less important . ""
In the essay , Mr Jobs looks at three different alternatives for the future of the digital music market .
The first is to continue on the current course where the likes of Apple , Microsoft 's Zune and Sony all compete with proprietary systems .
The second is for Apple to license the FairPlay system to other players .
Mr Jobs rules this out because licensing inevitably involves "" disclosing some of its secrets to people in many companies , and history tells us that inevitably these secrets will leak "" , the result being the cracking of the DRM system .
Instead , Mr Jobs favours the abolition of DRM entirely . ""
Imagine a world where every online store sells DRM - free music encoded in open licensable formats , "" he stated enthusiastically .

2007-02-07,"Record companies should consider dropping the anti - piracy restrictions they impose on music downloads , the Apple chief executive , Steve Jobs , has said .
Mr Jobs said consumers and companies would benefit if music downloads were sold without the addition of restrictive anti - copying software .
Digital rights management ( DRM ) software was only used because "" cautious "" labels demanded it , he said in an unexpected broadside at both music industry bosses and European regulators . ""
In such a world , any player can play music purchased from any store , and any store can sell music which is playable on all players , "" he wrote on Apple 's website .
"" This is clearly the best alternative for consumers , and Apple would embrace it in a heartbeat .
"" If the big four music companies would license Apple their music without the requirement that it be protected with a DRM , we would switch to selling only DRM - free music on our iTunes store .
Every iPod ever made will play this DRM - free music . ""
Apple currently uses its so - called Fairplay mechanism to prevent music downloaded from iTunes being copied or played on non - iPod devices .
Opening up the system to provide "" free "" downloads might further boost the digital music market , which has grown quickly but still accounts for only a fraction of music sales , he said .
It would also serve to reinforce Apple 's dominance in digital music , allowing the company to sell to any customers , not just iPod owners .
The company 's system has come under threat from a number of directions , most notably from European legislators who are concerned that Apple is unfairly using DRM to lock customers into the iPod / iTunes combination .
Countries such as Norway have started legal proceedings against Apple in an attempt to force the company to break the link and give shoppers more choice .
Because songs sold on the iTunes store are only compatible with the iPod , regulators have said it is an unfair use of power and Apple should license its right management technology to third parties .
"" On the surface this seems like a good idea , since it might offer customers increased choice now and in the future , "" Mr Jobs said .
However , he added that "" much of the concern over DRM systems has arisen in European countries "" . ""
Perhaps those unhappy with the current situation should redirect their energies towards persuading the music companies to sell their music DRM - free , "" he said .
"" For Europeans , two and a half of the big four music companies are located right in their backyard .
"" It is not the first time that Mr Jobs has attacked the music industry .
In 2005 , he described record bosses as "" greedy "" for wanting to sell music for more than the flat 79p rate imposed by iTunes .
His comments came days after Apple finally agreed an end to its long - running trademark dispute with the Beatles ' Apple Corps , which will finally mean the band 's music can be sold online .
A growing number of industry executives are putting their weight behind the idea of selling unrestricted downloads in the hope that it will encourage faster growth in digital music .
David Goldberg , the head of Yahoo Music , has repeatedly called for music labels to drop rights management , and online stores such as eMusic - which sells unrestricted MP3s - are growing in popularity among consumers ."
2007-02-07,"During Steve Jobs 's Macworld keynote on January 9 , I asked : Now what 's inside an iPhone ? : "" Has Apple ported OS X to the ARM chip ? ""
It 's a significant issue because getting software running on an iPhone is a different matter if it has to be recompiled for a processor that 's incompatible with both the Intel and PowerPC versions of OS X.
Now , Information Week reports : Warren East , president and chief executive officer of ARM Holdings plc , has confirmed that "" at least three "" processor cores developed at his company are present within the iPhone from Apple Inc.
"" ARM is in 90 percent of the world 's [ mobile phone ] handsets ; we 're in Wi - Fi , baseband processors and applications processors and most of the world 's MP3 players .
So it 's at least three , "" East said .
Given the history of Apple and the ARM chip ( see Oh the irony -- the iPhone , ARM , Marvell and Freescale , below ) , this is not a surprise .
Indeed , Dario Bucci , an Intel executive in Italy , pointed to an ARM from Marvell in an interview dated January 18 .
Bear in mind that ARM does n't supply chips , it just licenses intellectual property to third parties : it 's not a direct source .
But still , you really would n't expect it to divulge details of a customer 's products before they 've even shipped .
Especially when the customer is known to be as tyrannical about secrecy as Steve Jobs ."
2007-02-08,"Record labels are expected to start stripping copyright protection from their music downloads within the next six months after Apple chief Steve Jobs forced the issue with an open letter to the industry .

2007-02-09,"Warner Music has reported a 74 % drop in profits , down to $ 18 m ( £ 9.2 m ) in the last three months of 2006 , from $ 69 m in same period in 2005 , after poor album sales by artists such as My Chemical Romance .
Warner and other music groups have struggled in the move to online music , with copy protection digital rights management ( DRM ) software failing to stop piracy .
Steve Jobs , chief executive of iPod maker Apple , has called on the music majors to drop DRM saying it would boost sales .
Warner chief Edgar Bronfman said his view was "" without logic and merit .
We will not abandon DRM . """
2007-02-12,"' DRMs have n't worked and may never work to halt music piracy . ""
These are not my words - although I have said much the same in the past - but those of Steve Jobs last week in an open letter called "" Thoughts on Music "" .
It had all the politics , implicit threat and grandeur of a papal pronouncement ; let 's call it the Jobs Bull .
It was also not really what it seemed on the surface .
Jobs ' statement that Apple would abandon Digital Rights Management - the protection system that prevents tracks sold on iTunes being played on devices other than the iPod - "" in a heartbeat "" , if only the music companies would let it , was a headline - grabbing diversionary tactic for a man whose clippings file must be disturbingly empty recently given the low - profile launch of the iPhone and the deal with the Beatles .
Edgar Bronfman , top man at Warner Music , predictably described Jobs ' statement as "" completely without logic or merit "" .
Now let 's be reasonable here .
You might take issue with Jobs ' argument - and certainly with his motives - but it has both logic and merit , and saying it has neither does no one much credit .
If you look closely at Jobs ' Bull , it has got some decent points .
If you 're having DRM at all - which is a big if - you need at least to have one that has a slight chance of working , some of the time .
He hints that the status quo ca n't work in the long run .
He also says that making Fairplay - Apple 's Newspeak for DRM - interoperable would be too costly to maintain - which is also probably a decent line .
Hence , the story goes , let 's give up DRM .
Jobs is on thin ice , though , when he claims that Apple only did DRM in the first place because the nasty labels forced it to .
I 'm sure DRM was a big part of the negotiation
but Apple is a company , like others in high - tech industries , which regularly uses DRM technology to lock consumers into its hardware , including the new AppleTV .
You have to wonder why someone whose public pronouncements are n't what you would call "" off - the - cuff "" has suddenly decided to say all this .
Just before Christmas , Bill Gates - another man not known for winging it - said he thought DRM was "" unworkable "" .
Have they just figured this out ?
Of course not , they have known it all along .
It 's just not been in their interests to say it before .
So what 's changed ?
Well , for a start , some pesky Europeans have started threatening Apple with legal action because consumers are unhappy with being locked into proprietary hardware and paying more for content as a result .
The Norwegian regulator - not normally someone of whom Apple counsel live in fear , I imagine - has picked up on German , French and other activity and told Apple to do something about it by October - or else .
Jobs has tried to shift the blame on to the music labels - two and a half of whom are European .
It 's unusual , to say the least , to hear a major CEO asking for regulation and it makes me wonder why .
After all , when the French made dangerous noises about all this last year , Apple made a veiled threat to close iTunes in France .
Maybe Jobs has shrewdly judged that the time is up on the "" walled garden "" model that has served him so well - and he 's concerned that his beloved iPhone will have trouble if it 's tethered to the exact same restrictions that have worked so well for the iPod market .
The iPhone needs to behave like an internet device if it is to leap over the proprietary approaches of mobile network operators .
It needs to get direct into the consumer 's pockets .
To do this , it has to offer services which are n't currently available ; or else it will just be a pretty gadget rather than a revolutionary approach to mobile media and communication .
Doing the rights deals to make that vision possible would make the battle for iTunes seem like a piece of cake ; get rid of DRM anyone ?
Apple 's , and Jobs ' , abiding skill has been to position themselves in the lead in making technology human .
They do this by going with the flow of what we need as people .
The fact is that people are starting to need something new .
One example of this is that the in - home network is becoming a reality for many and a nightmare for most - including me .
This was the week , incidentally , when an official diploma was launched in the UK for "" digital plumbing "" .
People have a close personal relationship to their content ; it 's my music , not the record label 's and not Apple 's .
I thought , briefly , we were on the way in the heady early days of the iPod
and I 've bought a fair few downloads but - and here 's the shamefaced admission
- I 've gone back to buying CDs since I got a home media network .
You see , it 's the only way I can quickly and easily share my media - and I do n't mean with loads of dodgy pirates on Limewire ,
I mean with myself and my family round the house on our Sonos .
If Jobs ' Bull raises questions which might make this better , then it will have done a service ; all media folk , especially those in TV and video - on - demand , should watch what happens next very carefully .

While this would introduce interoperability - so music would be playable on any device - the music majors fear it would lead to an explosion in piracy .
Instead , they want Apple to open up its iTunes service so it can accept a variety of DRM technologies . ""
DRM and interoperability are not the same thing , "" stressed Mr Bronfman .
"" We believe very strongly in interoperability .
Consumers want it , consumers should have it .
"" From a DRM perspective I think we can all agree and we should all agree that intellectual property deserves some measure of protection . ""
"" I do n't agree that intellectual property should have no protection from piracy but that is distinct from the issue of interoperability .
I would also say , however , that there can not be so much protection that you create a poor consumer experience and we need to work to find a better balance than exists today . ""
He was , however , complimentary about Apple 's forthcoming iPhone , saying that the rest of the handset industry will have to develop similarly attractive products to compete with it . ""
Before it has even hit the market the iPhone has effectively raised the bar of what people expect "" from mobile music , he said .
The mobile music market is forecast to be worth $ 9bn ( £ 4.6bn ) this year , rising to $ 32bn in 2010 .
But many mobile phone users find it hard , or believe it is prohibitively expensive to download music onto their phones .
Only 8.5 % of people who have music - enabled phones actually use them to download tracks .
"" The opportunity for mobile is huge , it 's remarkable that we are selling as much music as we are on mobiles given how difficult it is to access on a mobile phone today .
The average ringtone download session is two - and - a - half minutes and takes 20 clicks ( to get to ) .
If you could make that two or three clicks if you could make that 10 seconds , my goodness the amount of revenue that would unlock is extraordinary "" .
"" I do n't think the $ 32bn by 2010 is unrealistic if if we get about making a great experience that 's affordable and easy to access on the device , if we can do that I think the sky 's the limit and if we ca n't we will be leaving billions of dollars of profits unrealised "" . ·

2007-02-14,"One Newly Asked Question ( below ) is "" Would Steve Ballmer or Bill Gates have written Thoughts on Music ? ""
And the answer is , pretty obviously , no .
Steve Jobs may have a cult following
but I 've heard Gates say more than once :
"" we 're only plumbers "" .
In other words , Microsoft 's job is to provide the infrastructure support that enables its partners to do what they need to do to make money ( which is how Microsoft makes money ) .
Quite often that means "" protect bits "" .
There 's a good interview at Gizmodo where Gates is asked if he thinks DRM is "" helping people protect their money "" eg in the record industry .
He replies : "" That 's what they think . ""
Gizmodo :
That 's what the artists think , you 're saying ?
Gates :
Yes .
There are artists who want the software to remind people of rights boundaries .
Are those authors wrong or right ?
That 's up to them .
We do n't take a position on that .
What we want is to have as much content as possible available .
And available in the most convenient , easy - to - use form .
So Microsoft 's job is to make content available , while enabling rights holders ( not Microsoft ) to control the terms on which their content is made available .
Gates says later : We have your interests totally in mind , but that includes having ... if there 's content that can only be there if it 's rights protected , we want to be able to have that content available to you .
And so all we 're doing ... in no sense are we hurting you , because if they 're willing to make the content available openly , believe me , that 's always the most wonderful thing .
It 's the simplest .
Gates also points out that the issue is not really about music .
What about "" like if there 's a medical record that has somebody 's AIDS status in it
, "" should that be protected or should it be available to everyone ?
Gates claims : "" It 's not different .
It 's identical technology .
It 's the same bits ! ""
The DRM we put into these systems is used to protect medical records , and it 's used to protect things people want to protect .
And so it 's hard for me to say , ' No , because it might be used for media for a way in some people do n't like
, I wo n't put it in there for medical records . '
This is a platform that people can use in any way that they choose .
So , for example , if Sony requires HDCP to protect Blu - ray movies , Microsoft has a choice : it can support HDCP and enable users to play Blu - ray movies , or refuse to put it in , so users can not ( legally ) play Blu - ray movies .
( Apple obviously has the same options -- which is presumably why Apple is strangely quiet about adding HDCP support to OS X , even though it 's been on the Blu - ray board for ages . )
Now , that does n't mean either Gates or Microsoft supports Sony 's decisions on Blu - ray : in fact , Microsoft opposed them , and campaigned for "" managed copy "" and other features .
( Clearly it is in Microsoft 's best interests for users to be able to play a Blu - ray movie on a PC and watch it on a TV via an Xbox 360 , for example . )
But in the end it boils down to : Do we provide the plumbing or not ?
Microsoft 's view is that that 's its job .
When it comes down to Gates 's personal views , he clearly does n't think DRM , as currently implemented in the music industry , is good for users .
His advice , in an interview with bloggers , was "" People should just buy a CD and rip it . ""
( That 's my advice too , and I gave it before Bill did . )"
2007-02-15,"Apple co - founder Steve Jobs caused a stir this month by publishing Thoughts on Music , a 1,900-word essay on digital rights management ( DRM ) .
Apparently he 's against it , and so are we .
However , there has been a backlash , with people suggesting Jobs start practising what he preaches .
At the Inquirer , for example , Charlie Demerjian called Jobs "" the lowest form of hypocrite "" , pointing out that "" the Mac , the iPod and the upcoming iPhone all are DRMed to the gills "" .
Actually , it seems Jobs was simply reacting to pressure from Europe , particularly from Norway , France and Germany .
Last summer , Forbrukerradet , Norway 's consumer council , lodged a complaint with the Consumer Ombudsman against iTunes Music Store Norge , and last month got a ruling in its favour .
Torgeir Waterhouse of Forbrukerradet told the Outlaw.com website : "" FairPlay is an illegal technology whose main purpose is to lock the consumers to the total package provided by Apple by blocking interoperability . ""
FairPlay , Apple 's relatively liberal DRM , prevents people from playing songs they 've bought from the iTunes Music Store on other music players , while the iPod can not play DRM - encumbered songs bought from rival online music stores .
Note : this is not the same as complaining that you ca n't run a PlayStation 2 title on your Nintendo , because each version of a game has to be created for a specific machine .
With music files , the DRM plays no part in the music 's or the file 's creation : it is simply added later .
There are two separate issues here , as Edgar Bronfman , chief executive of Warner Music Group , was quick to point out : copy protection and interoperability .
All four music majors insist on copy protection , which is implemented by DRM .
However , they also want interoperability , because they think this would lead to a bigger market and because it might also reduce Apple 's power .
In particular , they want to vary prices so that some songs are expensive while others are cheap .
Jobs wo n't let them .
There are three obvious ways to achieve both interoperability and DRM .
The simplest and quickest is for everyone to adopt the system that dominates the market .
But Apple would have to license its proprietary FairPlay DRM to other companies , and it wo n't .
An alternative would be for everyone to agree on an open industry standard DRM .
That is n't likely because it would take a long time to implement , and because everybody wants to make money out of DRM .
The third option is for companies to work together on interoperability , so that when songs are transcoded from one format to another , the DRM is preserved .
Jobs does n't even mention this idea .
He specifically rejects licensing FairPlay because he says its secrets will leak out if it 's spread around , and it will be hard to patch when many companies use it .
But he may be exaggerating .
Microsoft 's proprietary but openly licensed DRM has been cracked less often than FairPlay , even though it 's licensed to dozens of companies .
Is Jobs saying Microsoft can do this but Apple ca n't ?
Apple does have a real problem .
It is perceived to be operating anti - competitively by some European governments and by some consumer councils .
The best solution for consumers and , says Jobs , for Apple , would be for the music majors to abandon DRM altogether .
Since I boycott all forms of music DRM , I 'd prefer that , too .
But until it happens , the pressure on Apple is only likely to get stronger .

2007-02-16,"Cisco has given Steve Jobs ' Apple until next Wednesday to respond to its lawsuit over the use of the name iPhone .
Cisco launched a lawsuit against Apple to prevent it using the name iPhone after Steve Jobs announced the launch of the much - hyped iPod - meets - smartphone device at the MacWorld Expo last month .
In a statement today Cisco , which acquired rights to the name in 2000 when it acquired the company Infogear , said : "" Apple has asked Cisco for another extension on the deadline for Apple to respond to our lawsuit .
Cisco has agreed to give Apple an extension until Wednesday , February 21 . ""
Steve Jobs had , unsuccessfully , tried to secure the rights to the name ahead of the announcement of the iPhone - destined to hit shelves in the US in June and Europe by the end of the year .
Cisco markets a number of products under the brand name through its LinkSys division .
Apple then went on the offensive suggesting that there was no trademark overlap because it is the only one using it for a mobile phone .
At the time the lawsuit was filed in January , Apple spokeswoman Natalie Kerris told Associated Press that Cisco 's lawsuit was "" silly "" and that its US trademark registration was "" tenuous "" at best , adding that the company was "" confident it would prevail "" if it was challenged .
The dispute appears to have become more amicable : Cisco 's statement today finishes by saying that it "" is fully committed to using the extra time to reach a mutually beneficial resolution "" .

2007-02-17,"Macrovision Corporation 's chief executive and president Fred Amoroso has now responded to Thoughts on Music , from Apple 's iPresident Steve Jobs with an open letter To Steve Jobs and the Digital Entertainment Industry .
Macrovision , founded in 1983 , is the company that provides the copy protection system used for VHS tapes and most DVD movies , so it would not win any popularity contests .
Also , since it makes its money out of DRM ( digital rights management ) , there 's no doubt about its ambitions : the more DRM there is , and the more DRM Macrovision controls , the more money it stands to make .
If you do n't like DRM ( and which of us does ? ) , then Macrovision is DRM 's Public Enemy Number 1 .
All this makes Amoroso 's letter pathetically easy to bash , so if you think it 's fun to watch people shooting fish in a barrel , there are plenty of sites doing it .
Cory Doctorow does a very fine job at Boing Boing with Macrovision sends pretty lies to Steve Jobs , a post that is both brief and to the point .
Also , Doctorow has the huge virtue that he actually practices what he preaches .
But if you bear in mind that Amoroso is just a capitalist out to make a buck , he does score a couple of hits .
He is , for example , exactly right in pointing out that "" DRM is broader than just music "" -- it ca n't be restricted to the little box that suits Steve Jobs and his apologists .
He also says that "" DRM needs to be interoperable and open , "" and neatly skewers Steve Jobs by claiming : Truly interoperable DRM will hasten the shift to the electronic distribution of content and make it easier for consumers to manage and share content in the home - and it will enable it in an open environment where their content is portable across a number of devices , not held hostage to just one company 's products .
This is not , of course , to say that Macrovision is either interoperable or open .
Hence Amoroso , unlike Doctorow , is easily hoist with his own petard , and that provides a cheap but effective way to distract attention from the point .
But that does n't make Amoroso wrong .
In fact , as long as content owners require DRM , he 's dead right .
As I pointed out here last June , Interoperability and DRM are NOT mutually exclusive .
There are already several groups working on interoperable DRM , including Coral and the Digital Media Project .
Indeed , the Coral Consortium also published an overlooked Letter to Steve Jobs inviting him to join them .
It says : We think that your engineers will find it very straightforward to integrate this framework into your iTunes service .
This technology would enable you to interoperate immediately with Microsoft based Janus devices and services , and with OMA ( Open Mobile Alliance ) based devices and services .
Of course the secrets in Fairplay remain safe -- adopting the Coral technology does not require you to share them with anyone else .
Macrovision offers another solution , which is that Jobs should just sell or license Apple 's DRM , called FairPlay , to Macrovision .
Jobs claims that Apple is n't technically capable of protecting , licensing and maintaining FairPlay ( which Microsoft seems to manage perfectly well with its own DRM ) , so Macrovision will fill the breach .
Amoroso says : Should you desire , we would also assume responsibility for FairPlay as a part of our evolving DRM offering and enable it to interoperate across other DRMs , thus increasing consumer choice and driving commonality across devices .
Shuffling off the DRM burden would free Apple from the odium of being one of the world 's biggest suppliers of DRM ( Macrovision can apparently absorb odium in unlimited amounts ) and would also get European consumer councils and competition departments off Apple 's back .
Apple would also make money from licensing fees without doing any work .
What 's to lose ?
Well , maybe Apple would lose control of the anti - competitive lock in that
helps it restrict competition in a market where it has a monopoly share , through the closed proprietary chain of the iTunes Music Store , iTunes software and iPods .
And just maybe that 's what Apple cares about .
I 'm certain that Apple 's fans will argue that the sheer superiority of its offerings would enable Apple to maintain or even increase market share even if it stopped artificially restricting competition -- and of course I believe them .
Why not prove it ?
So how will Steve Jobs respond ?
Is he going to open up or not ?
Regardless of logic or financial or consumer benefits , 32 years of ultimate control freakery says not ."

2007-02-23,"Self - described "" lifelong Apple fan boy "" ( but defecting to Linux ) Cory Doctorow of Boing Boing ( and also a novelist and an Electronic Frontier Foundation Fellow ) has now appeared in the almost - forgotten Salon with a piece on Steve Jobs ' iTunes dance .
He says : I doubt Jobs ' sincerity .
I suspect he likes DRM because it creates an anti - competitive lock - in to Apple .
I think he 's trying to shift blame for the much - criticized DRM to the music industry
Like many if not most people who are not Apple apologists , Doctorow suspects Jobs is just a hypocrite .
He writes : Actions speak louder than words .
Artists have asked -- begged -- Apple to sell their music without DRM for years .
From individual bestselling acts like Barenaked Ladies to entire labels of copy - friendly music like Magnatune , innumerable copyright holders have asked Apple to sell their work as open MP3s instead of DRM - locked AACs .
Apple has always maintained that it 's DRM or nothing .
These artists believe that the answer to selling more music is cooperating with fans , not treating them as presumptive pirates and locking down their music .
And , he adds , "" Apple even applies the no - copying measure to audio released under a Creative Commons license ( for example , my own podcasts ) , which prohibits adding DRM . ""
Then there 's the matter of the movies and TV shows sold through the iTunes Store .
The first adopter of this marketplace was Disney / Pixar .
Jobs is the single largest shareholder in Disney / Pixar .
Apparently , he forced himself to add DRM to his Pixar movies , turning a deaf ear to his own impassioned arguments to leave the DRM off .
The argument that iPod owners do n't have quite enough brainpower to cope with the iTunes Music Store selling both DRM and non - DRM content is also disposed of : But if this is so , how is it that Apple currently offers DRM - free podcasts alongside DRM'ed , pay - for - use podcasts in the selfsame store ?
Jobs 's arguments against licensing his DRM -- which DRM - cracker "" DVD Jon "" Johansen described as "" bogus "" -- also fall , because it only takes three minutes for any iTMS release to appear on a peer - to - peer network .
I 've already written about this in Why Steve is n't going to upset the DRM Apple cart , but the debate is going to run and run ...."
2007-02-23,"Experts predict that the iPhone will help break the smartphone market out into the mainstream - but despite Steve Jobs ' claim that Apple 's handset is five years ahead of its competitors , there are already plenty of interesting options available .
Last week we looked at the Blackberry Pearl and this week it 's the turn of Palm 's flagship .
£ £ £ From free
The blurb Palm is one of the companies with a lot to lose as the smartphone market starts to expand rapidly .
In the past it was one of the biggest players in the PDA market , but it 's already faced a pretty tough time over the last few years as Nokia , Blackberry and others take it outside .
The Treo 750 is an attempt to bring the Treo brand - beloved of many hardcore biz - tech nerds - into a wider circulation and get some cash in the door .
The company is attempting to appeal to more new users through its interface , using Windows Mobile instead of Palm OS to get things done .
The stats This candybar model runs Windows Mobile 5.0 , and has wide - ranging network support - GPRS and 3 G as well as EDGE for US customers .
128 MB on board memory , with Mini SD slot for memory upgrades .
Two inch 240 x 240 pixel screen , Bluetooth , 1.3 megapixel camera and full Qwerty keyboard .
Weighs in at 154 grams .
The test Using the Treo was a doddle ; setting up email accounts and using documents was easy and relatively intuitive .
Browsing over 3 G was a speedy and relatively enjoyable experience , and the touchscreen ( although small ) was responsive and well - defined .
The software did n't crash once in the weeks
I used it , and most applications worked smoothly .
However , there were weaknesses .
I found the reception quality patchy ( I was using Vodafone , normally no problem ) and sometimes when it lost connectivity completely I had to manually bring it back into the world rather than just let it get back on the network .
Windows on board means that Mac support - traditionally terrible on Palm anyway - is now almost non - existent .
And such a powerful device was let down a little by the lack of Wi - Fi connectivity .
The most irritating thing , however , was the keyboard .
I much prefer the Qwerty layout to the Blackberry 's "" two letters per key "" system , but the Treo 's keys were just too small and too close together , which lost it points and meant I had to use the touchscreen keypad .
What it gains from being in candybar format it loses from trying to squeeze too much into the small body .
Thumbs up Smooth , quick , generally well - designed and with the benefit of running Windows - Palm fans should be able to move on easily .
Thumbs down Keyboard too tight for big hands , and a few behavioural tics mean it 's not for everyone .
Not as weighty as other comparable smartphones , however ."
2007-03-14,"When is Apple going to announce a release date for 10.5 ( aka "" Leopard "" ) , the next version of its operating system ?
Speaking last year , Steve Jobs said vaguely that "" We think we 're going to get it out next spring ""
( which could mean the Australian spring .. ) .
But yesterday Apple released the last - well , it would make sense for it to be the last - update to its current OS version , with the release of 10.4.9 ( 10.4 is the branch of the operating system ; the .9 is the point update , so this is the tenth iteration of 10.4 ) .
There 's an air of finality to x.9 releases in the Apple world ; for the past two versions of OS X , that release has meant that a formal announcement ( or even launch ) is imminent .
So : 2003 October 3 : 10.2.8 released October 8 : release date for 10.3 ( "" Panther "" ) announced October 23 : 10.3 ( "" Panther "" ) in the shops 10.3 then chugged along , reaching 10.3.8 ... 2005
April 12 : release date for 10.4 ( "" Tiger "" ) announced April 15 : 10.3.9 released April 29 : 10.4 in the shops
And now 10.4 has chugged along ..
2007 March 13 :
10.4.9 released The question is , where 's Leopard ?
Where 's the announcement ?
Of course , there 's a difference now from those other releases : Microsoft is pushing Vista .
But with Apple 's advertising starting to ramp up generally , one gets the feeling of something around the corner .
Given that in the past the .9 release and the annoucnement of the next version have followed pretty closely , it seems reasonable to expect something - not the product , but the launch date - before the end of this month .
That gives us a fortnight to be wrong .
Anyone want to start a sweepstake on the precise day of the announcement - and of the release ?"
2007-03-24,"When the iPod was launched back in 2001 I doubt even Apple 's CEO Steve Jobs could have predicted that , less than seven years later , they would have sold almost 90 million of them .
Perhaps even more extraordinary is that despite its ubiquity the iPod remains one of the most desirable gadgets on the planet .
Much of this has , of course , to do with its design and ease of use .
But a good deal of its success is attributable to the advertising .
Two such ads are presently doing the rounds .
One shows the top of the range model , using leaping silhouettes , and is backed by the Fratellis .
The other sells the iPod Shuffle and features figures of boys and girls morphing into one another .
The slogan is deliciously simple : "" Put Some Music On "" .
Both are horribly irresistible .
So much so that they should come with a health warning .
When I first saw the ad for the Shuffle , I stared miserably at my 60 gigabyte model and decided it looked like Soviet fridge .
I immediately invested in the Shuffle , deciding that this was the perfect thing to take to the gym with me .
A nd this despite the fact that the only exercise I have had in the last 10 years is coughing in the morning .
When I happened to catch it again I went out and bought an orange Shuffle .
And very good it is too even if it is identical to my other Shuffle .
You might say this makes me a credulous cretin .
And you would probably be right .
But as it turns out I am just one of 30 million credulous cretins , all of whom are now two - pod homes , so to speak .
I sincerely hope the guys behind these ads never get to flog us anything with health implications .
They could slaughter thousands ."
2007-04-02,"In a major change of policy for a record label , EMI announced today that it will begin selling songs without copy protection through Apple 's iTunes music store .

"" It 's clear to us that interoperability is important to music buyers and is a key to unlocking and energizing the digital business , "" said Mr Nicoli .
Mr Jobs explained said the songs will cost 99p , compared with the 79p charged for DRM - protected versions .
They will be encoded at 256kbps , making them better quality instead of 128kbps used for the standard songs .
In February Mr Jobs called on the music labels to stop using this technology , called Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) , saying that he wanted iTunes to only sell DRM - free music .
EMI is the first label to heed Mr Jobs 's call .
DRM is controversial because it restricts how a song that has been legally purchased can be played .
For example , a track bought on iTunes and encoded with Apple 's FairPlay DRM will work on an iPod but not on rival digital music players .
News of EMI 's press conference sparked speculation that music by the Beatles may finally be available online .
Unlike almost all other major acts , the Beatles have so far declined to offer their songs for sale on the web .
However , this position does not appear to have changed ."
2007-04-02,"For the past few years the biggest noise in the music industry has not been some doe - eyed singer - songwriter or unnecessarily muscular boy band , but a balding 52-year - old who works in IT .
With his trademark black turtleneck and stonewashed jeans , Steve Jobs looks less Top of the Pops than Top Gear .
But as the man behind the iPod , he has as much influence on how people listen to music as any band or label .
Just what a star turn Apple 's CEO has become was underlined yesterday in a press conference called by Britain 's EMI .
Yes , Eric Nicoli , the company 's boss , made the opening remarks and , sure , Damon Albarn sang -
but this was all a preamble for Mr Jobs , who had , reporters were told , flown to the UK just for this .
If EMI 's presentation gave surprising prominence to Apple , so does the deal the two companies announced .
Under it , tracks by Norah Jones and other EMI artists will be sold on iTunes without copyright protection .
This means that consumers will be able to copy their tracks as many times as they like .
The new format will sell at a 20p premium on the current iTunes rate of 79p , but the compensation will be much higher sound quality .
Who gains from this deal ?
Well , the public does - a bit .
Until now , what are called digital - rights management
( DRM ) restrictions meant that you could buy an EMI track from Apple 's music store - but you did n't really own it .
Some will not be happy at paying a premium for the privilege , especially as many smaller labels and online shops already sell music free of copy protection - and cheaper , too .
Mr Jobs has only recently joined the chorus calling for DRM - free tracks , but this deal makes him look like a consumer champion .
Apple probably will lose some sales from iTunes , but its iPods are the real money - spinner .
And , as Jupiter Research has pointed out , the format the unprotected tracks will be sold in is not supported by many digital - music players .
Mr Jobs was very keen yesterday to point out that DRM - free music can be played on non - Apple machines .
But that requires other manufacturers to license the technology first .
So the iPod , which has already sold 90 m worldwide , keeps its chokehold on the music industry for now .
This is a huge gamble for EMI .
Record labels used to prosecute those who copied their music .
Now one of the big four labels is offering a lot of its back catalogue to be copied at 99p a time .
But EMI , which has recently delivered more profit warnings than memorable albums , has long struggled to find a business model for a digital age .
The deal 's details may have been unclear yesterday , but the imperative behind it was not .
Still , EMI , like many other old - media companies , is taking a leap into the unknown ."
2007-04-02,"Following on from our post last night , today 's Wall Street Journal says that EMI is going to drop DRM from its online songs : In a major break with the music industry 's longstanding antipiracy strategy , EMI Group PLC is set to announce today that it plans to sell significant amounts of its catalog without anticopying software , according to people familiar with the matter .
The London music company is to make its announcement at a London news conference featuring Apple Inc. Chief Executive Steve Jobs .
EMI is to sell songs without the software -- known as digital rights management -- through Apple 's iTunes Store and possibly through other online outlets .
The article , EMI to Sell Music
Without Anticopying Software , is however behind the WSJ 's paywall at present .
Selling tracks without DRM might take some of the heat off Apple , which has been pressured by some European countries to "" open up "" - that is , license - its FairPlay DRM to others .
Apple has n't budged on that one .
Anyway , wait another three hours or so ..."
2007-04-02,"So , as seemed widely predicted this morning , EMI and Apple have announced their initiative to make DRM free music available on iTunes .
I went to the press conference this lunchtime - held in the staff canteen at EMI 's headquarters in Kensington - and saw both EMI boss Eric Nicoli and Apple honcho
Steve Jobs reel off the news .
The basic thrust is that EMI is making a new version of its tracks available to download , without any DRM and with 256Kbps encoding ... for a price .
The "" first "" partners will be iTunes , which will offer the music in 256 K AAC for 99p per download ; albums will cost the same as they do right now .
But you 'll still be able to buy DRMd , lower - quality tracks for a lower price - and quite how it will work in practice is yet to be seen , but Jobs did n't seem moved by my questions about how confusing this might be for customers .
There was an interesting sidenote for Jobs watchers , in that he read from a piece of paper rather than simply .
Anyone who has seen him make a speech before will realise that he 's usually incredibly well prepared and knows his script .
I suppose it 's part of his on - stage charisma ... with notes , not so much .
So what are your thoughts ?
Personally , I think we have to see this initially as a story about record labels rather than Apple .
It 's certainly something that EMI , keen to portray itself as an innovative , was happy to take the initiative on .
Jobs , as we saw with his "" thoughts on music "" , is under pressure to act ( even if he claims its not Apple 's duty to enforce this stuff ) , but at the same time Apple is n't quite going the whole hog - it 's continuing to sell EMI 's tracks as 79p downloads with DRM and lower audio quality , as well as the premium product .
And that point is certainly a backtrack from previous positions struck by Apple , where we 'd heard them blast record labels for being "" greedy "" by wanting different pricing structures .
This time around Jobs said this was a great chance for everyone to get what they wanted ( more money for corporates , better product for fans ) .
But Jobs was certainly bullish about the way the industry would fall behind EMI , suggesting that half of all iTunes 5 million - song library would be offered in this manner by the end of 2007 .
That 's more than just EMI , and we 'll most likely see plenty of people get behind the move in the near future .
Still , a few questions linger .
Is this a Trojan horse for a price hike ?
What will sales be like ?
And why bother with two versions ?"
2007-04-03,"Music group EMI yesterday scrapped copy protection on all its digital tracks in a move that was immediately hailed by Apple chief executive Steve Jobs as "" the next big step forward in the digital music revolution "" .
For the first time , downloads by artists including Robbie Williams , Coldplay and Joss Stone purchased from any online music store will be playable on any digital music player , including the market - leading iPod , with no restrictions on their use .
Until now , owners of digital music players have been restricted to buying downloads from certain stores , depending on the make of their device and the sort of copy protection it could handle .
Now owners of devices other than the iPod can buy songs from the iTunes music store , and the tracks will be available with higher quality sound .
Conversely , iPod owners will be able to choose from a wider range of stores .
The announcement by Apple and EMI was tempered by news that the companies may face an investigation into anti - competitive behaviour .
The European commission has sent formal charges to major record companies and Apple , alleging that they are restricting music sales in Europe , a commission spokesman said last night .
The spokesman said agreements between Apple and the record companies face an antitrust inquiry which will investigate allegations that consumers in different European countries are charged varying prices and barred from downloading tracks from foreign websites .
The inquiry was triggered by a complaint from Which ?
that the UK version of iTunes was more expensive than other European countries ' .
Yesterday Mr Jobs , who this year published a letter calling on the music industry to open up its operations , said he expected half of all the 5 million tracks available through the iTunes store to be free of copy protection , or digital rights management ( DRM ) , by the end of the year .
EMI chairman Eric Nicoli , under pressure following two recent profit warnings and feverish takeover speculation , was keen to deliver an upbeat message : "" These new products will allow fans to buy tracks from any retailer that stocks them and , crucially , listen to those tracks on the device of their choice . ""
But the move could backfire on the company , with some immediately suggesting it was a clever way of record labels and digital stores raising prices .
The breakthrough was seen as an admission that the troubled music industry had misjudged its approach to piracy in recent years by attempting to control how consumers could transfer songs they had bought between different music players .
Their insistence on persisting with technology that prevented tracks being played on a range of devices had , some believe , stymied growth .
The announcement by Mr Nicoli was also seen as part of a wider move by the record industry to show it is embracing the digital future amid fears that the younger generation is falling out of the habit of buying music altogether .
This week Sony BMG said it would no longer accept demo tapes or CDs from prospective new signings , encouraging artists to sign up to a MySpace - style blogging network instead .
Yesterday 's move is expected to invigorate the market for music downloads , which currently account for about a 10th of all music sales .
While download sales are increasing at a rapid rate , they are not doing so fast enough to compensate for declining CD sales .
EMI 's decision to remove digital rights management software from its entire back catalogue and new releases is expected to signal similar moves by other major labels .
But consumers will have to pay extra for the new "" premium "" features .
The DRM protected tracks will continue to be available for 79p each , but in order to buy the new unprotected versions playable on any device and with higher sound quality they will have to pay 20p per track more .
In an effort to boost sales , the price of complete albums sold in the new format will remain at £ 7.99 .
Existing customers of the iTunes Music Store who want to upgrade tracks they have already purchased online will be able to do so for 20p a track .
Mr Jobs denied the move was a price increase by another name .
"" We 're not increasing the price .
We 're adding another product that is priced higher and offers more features .
The features that it offers are higher sound quality and hassle - free interoperability .
If you think those things are worth it , you can pay the extra 20p .
If you do n't think it 's worth it , you do n't have to , "" said Mr Jobs .
Apple 's iTunes Music Store is by far the most popular online music store having sold more than 2.5bn tracks globally .
EMI experimented with offering the new files late last year , using Lily Allen , Relient K and Norah Jones tracks .
Mr Nicoli said the research showed consumers "" overwhelmingly "" prefer to pay more for better quality tracks and that in trials the more expensive option outsold the cheaper version by 10 to one .
Analysts hailed the move as another PR masterstroke by Mr Jobs as he reaped the plaudits for a decision that could have appeared detrimental to Apple 's ambitions .
Some warned that , with sales of the iPod levelling off and iTunes tracks now open to all , it could give impetus to the company 's rivals .
But others said that with the better quality tracks taking up twice as much hard drive space , it would also drive sales of new larger iPods .
What happens next ?
FAQ Digital rights management
How will it affect what I can do ?
The new 99p downloads available through iTunes will not only be higher quality audio , but will also be free of any copy protection .
This means you wo n't necessarily need an iPod to listen to them , and you will also be able to share tracks with friends in the same way you would with a CD .
What happens to the songs I 've bought on iTunes already ?
All of your existing tracks will still be playable , but if you have bought songs by EMI artists such as Robbie Williams and Gorillaz through iTunes you will be given the chance to upgrade them to the higher - quality , unprotected format for 20p per track .
Will other record labels follow suit ?
Steve Jobs has hinted that other labels would follow in EMI 's footsteps , predicting that some 2.5 m songs would be available without copy protection by the end of this year .
However , it is not clear whether smaller labels - some of whom have previously asked Apple for the ability to sell unprotected files - will be able to do so .
What about other download services ?
There are a selection of smaller services which have already tried to pioneer the approach followed by EMI and Apple .
It is likely that other stores will do the same , but subscription services such as Napster - which rely on DRM - are unlikely to join in .
What if I do n't have an iPod ?
Although Apple 's chosen audio system - known as AAC - is not as widely used as the popular MP3 format , it is being used in an increasing number of gadgets .
Unprotected iTunes tracks can now be listened to by owners of Sony 's Walkman players and phones , Nokia 's N - series phones and the Microsoft Zune .

2007-04-03,"Beware geeks bearing gifts : ( l - r )
Eric Nicoli , CEO of EMI , Damon Albarn and Steve Jobs , CEO of Apple Good old Steve Jobs .
Yesterday he managed to sound like a champion of consumer choice when he and Eric Nicoli of EMI stood up and said "" hey guys , you can buy our music digital rights management - free through the iTunes store ! ""
On the face of it , this is fantastic news .
Apple 's boss , who recently blogged that he thought DRM was a failed technology , and one of the biggest music publishers in the galaxy , have decided to drop the technology that stops you copying a track between computers , MP3 players and your mates .
You can burn a track to a million CDs , you can upload it via torrents to the interweb and generally make free with it .
Not that people were n't doing all that stuff already : most DRM technology is laughably weak .
It only thwarts the technologically illiterate who do n't have the know - how to get around it and did n't stop the pirates from sharing left , right and centre .
But hang on a minute .
There 's a catch .
First , you 'll have to pay more for the privilege of having an unencumbered music track - 20p more .
This makes me wince a bit , and doubtless it will make European competition commissioners wince a bit , too , as they 're already probing the price iTunes charges punters in various corners of Europe .
However , there 's another really straightforward catch too , which most of the coverage missed yesterday in its slavish praising of Jobs ' move .
iTunes sells tracks in the AAC format - which plays on only a very few devices , including ( guess what ) the iPod .
AACs will play on some phones and the Zune , but not on most MP3 players .
Not quite so benevolent , eh , Steve ?"
2007-04-03,""" During a press conference on Monday , Apple chief executive Steve Jobs announced that iTunes will soon begin selling DRM - free music tracks from record label EMI and later fielded questions on the prospect of DRM - free videos , the affect of higher bit - rate tracks on future iPod capacities and more .
A full transcript of the Q&amp;A session that followed the formal presentation has been transcribed by AppleInsider .... """
2007-04-05,"The wired world , so they say , moves faster than meatspace .
In that case , one month , three weeks and five days might seem like an awfully long time to the digerati .
But that 's how long it took between Steve Jobs publishing his Thoughts on Music - an open essay telling the recording industry to drop copy protection - and EMI 's announcement this week that it was going to offer downloads without Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) .
Jobs , reading from a script rather than delivering his sermon with the usual practised polish , took the stage in London alongside EMI boss Eric Nicoli to hail the decision as breaking new ground .
Campaigners breathlessly welcomed the death of copy protection , and digerati around the web began wildly dancing on the grave of DRM .
Are they right ?
At first glance , it seems like a situation where everybody wins : the record label can sell to customers without worrying about interoperability ; iPod owners can buy from new outlets ; Apple can sell to non - iPod users ; other retailers can offer downloads from a big label .
And , crucially , customers can ( hopefully ) stop worrying about interoperability .
EMI said its entire catalogue would be available as unprotected tracks for any retailer who wants to sell them - on iTunes , these higher quality tracks will cost 99p , while lower - grade , DRM - laden versions will still cost 79p .
Jobs was bullish about what this would mean for DRM overall , predicting that other major labels will follow suit shortly , and that half of the iTunes Music Store 's 5 m tracks would be available as unprotected versions by the end of the year .
It is the first step to vindicating the long - held views of anti - DRM campaigners - and download stores such as Wippit and eMusic that have lobbied tirelessly against copy protection - and was generally welcomed by music sellers .
Wider reach ""
This is great news , because we can sell a really significant amount of music to people we could n't reach before , "" said Ben Drury , founder of download service 7Digital .
As well as reaching iPod owners with unprotected MP3s , Drury says it allows many stores to reach previously troublesome markets .
"" We can also sell EMI 's tracks to Mac users - Microsoft 's WMA DRM does n't work on them - and to people using Linux .
It 's a significant minority . ""
Some were more sceptical , however , and questioned whether Apple 's move really opens iTunes up to everybody . ""
The DRM - free tracks on iTunes are in AAC format , which is n't supported by the majority of digital music players .
Jobs has played a very smart game , "" says Mark Mulligan , an analyst with Jupiter Research .
"" Apple has dropped the proprietary DRM but still have the customer lock - in due to AAC . ""
But not everybody believes this to be the case .
Although AAC might not have the ubiquity of MP3 , it is far from being exclusive to Apple .
The iTunes store was the first system to popularise the format , but other adopters include Sony , Nokia , Microsoft and Real .
And , say audiophiles , it is significantly better quality than most other popular formats .
An independent survey by Canada 's Communications Research Centre showed that AAC was higher quality than most of its rivals , even when encoded at the same bitrate .
But there were certainly some politics at play , as iTunes and its FairPlay DRM system had become something of a hot potato around Europe .
Norway , in particular , has been getting itchy with allegations that iTunes benefits from an anti - competitive link with the iPod , and pressure was building on Apple to avoid a drawn - out court battle - a situation that clearly influenced Jobs ' open letter in February .
And although the EU this week announced that it had sent a Statement of Objections to the major labels and Apple over cross - border restrictions , it seems likely that the EMI deal will have soothed the brows of many critics .
There were other , less travelled aspects of the announcement that could have positive impacts in the long term .
For example , if entire catalogues from big labels begin to go DRM - free , some of the hidden costs of restricting rights could also disappear - time spent doing multiple encoding , working on new rights schemes and supporting customers who discover the music they 've bought wo n't play on their desired device .
Experimental credentials EMI 's motivations for the move were more than simply benevolence - business has been tough for the company , despite a roster of high - profile artists such as Robbie Williams , Coldplay and Lily Allen .
And although the label also hosts digital refuseniks such as the Beatles and Radiohead ( who only relented after several years of lobbying by fans ) , it is keen to promote its experimental credentials - Monday 's press conference saw a performance from Damon Albarn 's latest project , the Good , the Bad and the Queen , for example .
The deal also covers music videos , which will be opened up in the same way , showing how video and audio are coming closer together .
And it puts a premium on albums , too , offering bulk purchases at a lower wholesale price .
The implications may be many and varied , but it is likely to take some time for all the wrinkles to shake themselves out .
Not every record company is going to simply fall behind the idea , and not every customer is going to get exactly what they want .
But nearly all observers agree it is a step in the right direction .
"" There 's no doubt about it , this is an interesting and potentially quite encouraging move , "" said Dan Cryan , an analyst with Screen Digest .

2007-04-09,"Do n't get me wrong , I think it 's tremendous that one of the five music majors , EMI , last week took the decision to release their entire digital repertoire without so - called "" protection measures "" , by offering consumers a "" non - DRM "" option ( without digital rights management copyright protection ) .
Steve Jobs , announcing that iTunes would be the first to offer the inventory , described it as "" the next big step forward in the digital music revolution - the movement to completely inter - operable DRM - free music "" .
For the first time , downloads by EMI artists purchased from any online store will - theoretically - be playable on any player .
But take careful note of the phraseology ; "" the next big step "" , Jobs said .
After all , EMI is only one of five majors and they ca n't get the Beatles to release online even with DRM .
This is a long way from over and DRM is a pawn in the game , not the whole game .
Firstly , why EMI ?
Eric Nicoli , EMI 's great survivor and now executive chairman , is , in my opinion , leading the most innovative digital team of any music major .
They 're going about their business with creativity , pragmatism and commitment .
But I 'm also fairly sure that one of his other big strategic issues - namely the ongoing merger / acquisition saga with Warner Music - is also intermingled in the thinking .
It may now either hit the buffers or , alternatively , be accelerated if Warner were to join suit on DRM .
Next , how is this going to affect the consumer ?
Well , that 's where it gets more tricky .
What Apple and EMI have actually done is to say that they 'll charge more for tracks that do n't have DRM - which will also incidentally sound better .
You 'll need to pay an extra 20p for the privilege of not having DRM .
This is being positioned as added value .
There 's another way to look at it .
At least , people who 've laboriously scraped the DRM off their iTunes tracks just to be able to play them on non - Apple players or wireless home music systems can now put a value on the time it took them to do it .
And is the coming nirvana of interoperable music actually as simple as just removing DRM in any case ?
What about different file formats ?
The iTunes Music Store still sells only AAC files - which do n't play on many players .
Could it be that for many consumers the lock - in to Apple hardware will remain , even though the DRM has gone ?
And what of the iPhone - the business model for that looks damaged with DRM attached , so it makes sense to dispense with it .
Might Mr Jobs be trying to have his cake and eat it ?
Of course he is - and here 's another example .
When asked at the press conference about whether his new love of protection - free content extended to video , Jobs said no .
It should be remembered at this point that he 's also quite a big cheese in the land of Mickey Mouse - so beware double standards . ""
Video is pretty different than music right now , "" he said , "" Video do n't distribute 90 % of their content DRM - free .
I would n't hold the two in parallel at all . ""
The only problem with this line of argument is that it is complete nonsense .
Movie studios could barely stand behind a statement like that even if they actually believed that they make most money by selling tickets in cinemas and from DVDs .
The problem is they do n't and they know that the moment content hits television , it 's gone .
It 's recorded on a hundred million PVRs , swapped in playgrounds on DVD .
Freeview is pretty DRM - free .
The truth is that the old way of protecting this business model , the concept of release windows that delay the availability of content based on either the country you live in or the platform you 're viewing on , increasingly thwarts the expectations of consumers ; hence many of them circumventing protection measures in the first place .
This idea of windows - and DVD regions - has to go and DRM as a lock goes with it .
Content owners need to shift their model , from preventing someone from getting access to content to enabling that access .
Getting to this position will involve some new ways of tracking and sharing out value - for instance , by making use of content 's ability to sell advertising .
But I 'm certain that what goes for music goes just as well for video .
Jobs must already be thinking about this over at Disney .
He knows that , in this area at least , content is content .
Nonetheless , he 'll logically be doing just what the music majors have done - namely protecting it like mad - until it makes sense to flip the model and take off the DRM .
The only questions that really remain are when this will happen and how he 'll present it to make him look like the saviour of movies . ·

2007-04-11,"This week Apple puffed out its chest and proudly announced that it had sold 100 m iPods .
In five years , the little white box has become a phenomenon , reviving Apple 's fortunes and making the company a household name for the first time in a generation .
This sudden rise to prominence is n't without its problems , though - not least for Steve Jobs , who has built his career , his image and his business around designer - label technology .
Critics have long abused the brand for making expensive , over - designed products that place as much emphasis on fashion as they do on utility .
Apple 's legion of dedicated fans reject this claim vociferously .
Apple , say Macolytes , is like BMW : its products are more expensive , better made and smoother to use ; other computer manufacturers are the Fords of technology , creating mass - produced machines lacking in personality .
The iPod , however , is a break with that pattern .
For all its design and engineering heritage , the world 's most popular MP3 player is pretty competitive on price and does n't boast the greatest range of features .
It is , in many ways , the exact reverse of the normal Mac mindset .
So what happens now ?
Well , growth continues to ratchet up for the iPod , but Apple 's next big project is clear .
This summer the much - vaunted iPhone will launch in America , another gizmo that claims to be years ahead of its rivals .
But naysayers already have a barrage of objections : that it is too expensive , too restricted and too fashionable to be usable .
Defenders say it is an innovative , well - designed , premium product .
Sounds familiar ?
From a position of strength , and entirely of its own volition , Apple is choosing to assume the pose that it is most used to : the outsider .
Jobs says he wants to shift 10 m iPhones in the first year .
Executives at Nokia , the world 's largest phone manufacturer , would hardly get out of bed for such relatively paltry numbers .
The iPod , both popular and populist , rocked the boat for Apple and sailed it into unfamiliar waters .
Just as Microsoft , the Manchester United of technology , loves to be hated , so Apple hates to be loved - at least by the hoi polloi .
In a couple of months ' time , with the iPhone , Apple will be back in its comfort zone as the world 's most successful underdog .
Order is restored ."

I wrote to them and they told me it was n't their fault but the production companies insist on something called DRM .
Desperate of Dorchester ( Alastair Nisbet )
You could write to Apple 's Steve Jobs and suggest he licences WMV ( Windows Media Video ) and the companion DRM ( digital rights management ) from Microsoft .
Even small Asian companies seem to be able to manage this .
Anyway , I assume Apple is going to license VC-1 , which is a version of WMV that has been adopted as a standard option for Blu - ray and HD DVD movies .
( It 's possible
Macs will be unable to play all high - definition movies , but I doubt it . )
Alternatively there is hope on the horizon with Microsoft 's new Silverlight browser plug - in , formerly known as WPF / E ( Windows Presentation Foundation /

Microsoft is doing a version for Mac OS X that will play WMV movies , and it includes a DRM option ( microsoft.com/silverlight ) .

Comment :
I 'm sure most of you can think of another answer ...."
2007-04-25,"Fred Anderson , the former chief finance officer at Apple who left rather abruptly when the stock options scandal blew up , has alleged that in January 2001 he warned Steve Jobs , the chief executive , that backdating options would have to be charged against its profits ( which Apple did n't do ) - and also that Jobs "" misled "" him about the board 's approval for the options by saying it had approved them when it had n't .
According to the Wall Street Journal , Apple has acknowledged backdating options grants , and said Mr. Jobs helped select dates for some of the backdated grants .
But the company has steadfastly contended that he is n't guilty of any wrongdoing , in part because he did n't "" appreciate the accounting implications "" of backdating options .
The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday said it was taking no action against Apple itself because of its "" extraordinary cooperation "" in the agency 's investigation .
Anderson , who saw the company through some of its tightest financial times during the reign of Gil Amelio , has paid the US Securities and Exchange Commission $ 3.5 m in a settlement of its charges without admission of guilt or wrongdoing .
That leaves Nancy Heinen , formerly Apple 's chief counsel , in the crosshairs of the SEC over her alleged part in backdating options and falsifying company records to conceal the fraud .
The upshot ?
It 's still a mess , but Steve Jobs is showing a Teflon coat that , as Nancy Banks - Smith might say , would make Ronald Reagan whistle .

2007-04-26,"The board of Apple made a public declaration of support for its embattled founder Steve Jobs last night who has been accused of misleading colleagues about his role in a stock options scandal .
In a statement released as rising profits sent Apple 's shares soaring , independent directors , including former US vice - president Al Gore and Google 's chairman , Eric Schmidt , said they had "" complete confidence "" in Mr Jobs ' integrity and leadership of the company .
Two former Apple executives were charged by the securities and exchange commission this week with manipulating share options .
One of them , former chief financial officer Fred Anderson , accused Mr Jobs of lying to minimise his involvement in the furore .
Apple 's independent directors said Mr Jobs had been cleared by an internal inquiry and had not been charged .
"" We are not going to enter into a public debate with Fred Anderson or his lawyer .
Steve Jobs cooperated fully with Apple 's independent investigation and with the government 's investigation of stock option grants at Apple , "" the directors said .
In common with more than 100 other American companies , Apple is facing a criminal inquiry into the way it backdated share options to pitch them at favourable points when the company 's stock was at its lowest .
Mr Jobs has apologised to investors but insisted he had no idea Apple was doing anything wrong .
But Mr Anderson maintains he warned Mr Jobs that the practice would require a special accounting charge .
He also claims Mr Jobs erroneously told him Apple 's directors had approved details of the options scheme .

Independent artists have been complaining for years that Apple was deaf to their requests to include their music at the iTunes Music Store without applying digital rights management ( DRM ) software .
Apple CEO Steve Jobs said in his February 6 essay Thoughts on Music that the company had no choice but to use DRM to protect songs sold via iTunes because the record companies insisted on it .
Complain , he said , to Universal , Sony BMG , Warner and EMI , who control 70 % of the world 's music .
No answer , still , to the artists who wanted their music released DRM - free .
A few weeks ago , EMI blinked and agreed to release its catalogue in near - CD quality ( 256kbps AAC format ) , DRM - free , via iTunes for a premium price ( 99p per track ) .
The DRM - free offerings will be available next month .
Just like that .
Was that difficult to implement ?
Apple declined to discuss the decision , the technical complexity involved , or anything beyond Jobs 's essay .
Scott Cohen , founder of the digital distribution service
The Orchard , says the change is "" not technically complicated "" .
What is complicated , he says , is the many different versions required to service digital stores , from iTunes to mobile phone downloads .
There are only three basic file formats in use - AAC , MP3 and WMA - but , he says , details like bit rates and the metadata identifiers are different for each store .
There are 63 variants for mobile devices alone , and overall there are hundreds .
Cohen notes , though , that the really hard work is marketing the music .
The reversal makes it even less understandable why independent artists who want to release their music via iTunes but without DRM have been unable to do so . '
We do n't need DRM ' The biggest example is CDBaby , an Oregon - based company started in 1998 by musician Derek Sivers to sell his own CDs and those of a few friends .
The friends now number in the thousands , and CDBaby 's "" long tail "" business has expanded from selling physical CDs ( including mine ) to supplying digitised versions to the subscription download services .
CDBaby supplies 1.5 m songs , or about a third of the iTunes catalogue .
All these files are supplied in an open format ; Apple then wraps them in its Fairplay DRM .
Sivers says that when Jobs 's essay came out , "" We sent our contacts over there an email saying , we do n't need DRM , we never asked for it , and we 'd be glad to do without it . ""
The response , he says , was pretty much : "" We 'll let you know . ""
Now that EMI has agreed to DRM - free downloads , he says , CDBaby 's catalogue will also be available on iTunes without DRM .
In CDBaby 's experience , artists ( as opposed to the big labels ) tend not to be concerned about releasing unprotected files - they just want their music in as many channels as possible .
To the few who ask for DRM , Sivers explains that applying DRM at source limits their outlets because the services ' DRM systems are not interoperable .
Stanford law professor Lawrence Lessig - one of the founders of Creative Commons , which promotes public access to culture - says that these two options already existed because the iTunes U educational service includes DRM - free content : "" Stanford insisted upon it . ""
Artists ' wishes More to the point , he could n't understand why Jobs did n't at least make it possible for Creative Commons - licensed material to go out DRM - free , respecting the publicly expressed wishes of artists such as "" geek musician "" and singer - songwriter Jonathan Coulton and Colin Mutchler . ""
On an album like mine , "" says Mutchler , "" legally , users are allowed to do certain things with the music that technically the DRM is not allowing them to do .
"" To be fair , Apple was not the only company blaming the record labels .
Microsoft Zune spokesman Jason Reindorp provided this statement : "" Consumers have started asking for unprotected music content and if our music label partners decide to open their content up , then we would happily move in that direction . ""
The Zune automatically applies DRM to unprotected files received from another Zune user without regard to those files ' source or licensing arrangements .
Protected files bought from the Zune Marketplace can only be shared if the DRM says they can .
Karl Heymann , founder and owner of the classical label
Naxos , which streams its catalogue unprotected and also sells through iTunes and eMusic , says that 48 % of its income is from "" non - physical "" sales . ""
The artists just want to have representation on every possible digital service provider , "" he says .
"" Jobs says DRM was forced on him by the major labels to get their content and I tend to believe him . ""
This from a man who , before the EMI announcement , predicted : "" Two years from now there will be no DRM . ""
David Pakman , the CEO of DRM - free eMusic , the world 's second largest digital music service , agrees : "" We think that consumers are voting with their dollars and their feet , and they have tended towards non - DRM . ""
Meanwhile , as Pakman points out , European government pressure on Apple has been increasing ; many think removing DRM is at least partly a response .
Norway has ruled iTunes 's lack of interoperability illegal , and Germany , France , Finland and the Netherlands all want Apple to open up iTunes to hardware rivals .
Nicolas Jondet , a PhD student at the AHRB Research Centre in intellectual property and technology law at the University of Edinburgh , notes that France has created a body to ensure that DRM respects users ' legal rights and is made interoperable .
Jondet reasons regulatory problems are n't in Apple 's interest , and Jobs would rather get rid of DRM if it 's going to create them , so he placed the ball in the music companies ' court .
The fact that independent artists who wanted their music distributed DRM - free had to wait until one of the four majors gave the nod shows the extent to which the business is controlled by those companies .
In the end it 's the musicians who bear the brunt .
John Buckman , founder and CEO of Magnatune , an online record label that sells music both to consumers and for commercial licensing , says : "" Musicians are barely scraping a living together .
The real issue for DRM is the battle for the hearts of music lovers and can an offering be put together that entices the majority of people to pay for it . ""
If , as Jobs says , less than 5 % of the music on the average iPod is bought through the iTunes store , Apple is "" probably not doing a very good job of compelling people to buy digital music "" .

2007-05-02,"The trick about blogging is to do it regularly .
Steve Jobs , chief executive of Apple , seems to be getting the habit : now he 's written about Apple 's environmental record and plans .
( Bobbie also raised some of the related issues when he interviewed Jobs in September 2005 . )
Apple has faced plenty of criticism from Greenpeace , principally , for its environmental ...
well , is it its record , or its announced plans , or what ?
Here 's the chart , but as you 'll see , it 's more complex than it seems .
Jobs leans back and then jabs with a punch : Upon investigating Apple 's current practices and progress towards these goals , I was surprised to learn that in many cases Apple is ahead of , or will soon be ahead of , most of its competitors in these areas .
Whatever other improvements we need to make , it is certainly clear that we have failed to communicate the things that we are doing well .
British readers might feel a certain deja vu : it 's not the policies , it 's the presentation !
But there 's then a long list of chemicals and what Apple does and does n't do .
Investigating precisely what the situation is .
There are some interesting lines : Apple plans to reduce and eventually eliminate the use of mercury by transitioning to LED backlighting for all displays when technically and economically feasible .
Note the "" where .. feasible "" .
So it 's sort of a promise .
Another kicker : In one environmental group 's recent scorecard , Dell , HP and Lenovo all scored higher than Apple because of their plans ( or "" plans for releasing plans "" in the case of HP ) .
In reality , Apple is ahead of all of these companies in eliminating toxic chemicals from its products .
There 's also a useful graph of recycling : A note of comparison — the latest figures from HP and Dell are each around 10 % per year , and neither company has yet disclosed plans to grow this percentage in the future .
By 2010 , Apple may be recycling significantly more than either Dell or HP as a percentage of past sales weight .
There 's more , plenty more - "" Today is the first time we have openly discussed our plans to become a greener Apple .
It will not be the last "" - and you can even download it as a PDF .
There 's also a deconstruction which delves into it in more detail .
One suspects that for those willing to dig , there is a great deal to be found out about just how "" green "" all sorts of products are .
But would n't it be easier just to have a "" Steve 's blog "" page ?
It might even be as good as the Fake Steve one ."
2007-05-03,"PC World magazine 's multi - award - winning editor - in - chief Harry McCracken has quit , reportedly "" because the company 's new CEO , Colin Crawford , tried to kill a story about Apple and Steve Jobs , "" reports Wired News .
Apparently the spat was about a "" whimsical "" ( usually a synonym for "" worthless "" ) article called Ten Things
We Hate About Apple , which will no doubt get a much higher readership than it deserves when it 's leaked via someone 's blog .
However , Wired News says : Apparently Crawford also told editors that product reviews in the magazine were too critical of vendors , especially ones who advertise in the magazine , and that they had to start being nicer to advertisers .
This would be as good as a death sentence for PC World , as Crawford ought to know .
Is it possible that he does n't ?
Crawford was former CEO of MacWorld and only started at PC World about a month ago .
According to the PC World source , when Crawford was working for the Mac magazine , Steve Jobs would call him up any time he had a problem with a story the magazine was running about Apple .
Whether or not that 's the case , it 's impossible to imagine a similar dispute about an article called , say , Ten Things
We Hate About Microsoft .
However , Apple 's media coverage often seems to lean towards the sycophantic side , whether it 's because of doing exclusive deals with Apple , its advertising clout ( "" Are you running any anti - Apple stories ? "" ) , or simply because so many publications ( including The Guardian ) are run on Macs .
For a recent example , there was a spat at Time , reported in New York magazine , about an exclusive story on the new iPhone , "" in which writer Lev Grossman tweaked Apple CEO Steve Jobs about his secretive access to the product ... and suggested that Apple had ' some explaining ' to do about backdated stock options "" .
It says : When the story hit the Web , Jobs called [ managing editor Richard ]
Stengel to complain ( as it happens , Apple is a major advertiser in Time , and Jobs is a good friend of Huey 's ) .
Stengel reacted by immediately excising the offending paragraphs from the Web ( they have since been restored ) .
Then he had Grossman come into the office to rewrite part of the piece for the print edition .
Grossman was infuriated .
Jobs also responded to a critical book , iCon , by calling Peter Olson , chief executive of Random House , to try to persuade him to stop publication .
When that failed , he banned sales of all Wiley 's titles .
As The New York Times reported : some two dozen popular technical titles , including "" Dr. Mac : The OS X Files "" and "" GarageBand for Dummies "" ( as well as "" Macs for Dummies "" by David Pogue , a columnist for The New York Times ) , were removed from Apple store bookshelves and returned to Wiley 's distribution center in New Jersey .
The New York Times story concluded : "" It is not possible , aside from things unimagined , to damage his reputation , "" said Mitchell Kertzman , a partner at Hummer Winblad Venture Partners in San Francisco .
"" Steve is on such a roll in both of his companies , he 's earned the right to do whatever he wants . ""
Update : on his blog called , with stunning originality , Colin 's Corner , Crawford says : "" IDG and I hold editorial integrity in the highest regard .
PC World , has not been nor will it be influenced by advisers ' [ sic ] pressure "" -- presumably he means advertisers ' pressure .
To which any Cixen would reply : MRDA or Mandy Rice Davies Applies ( meaning "" he would say that , would n't he "" ) ."

2007-05-03,"Apple has pledged to improve its record on environmental issues following an award - winning lobbying campaign by Greenpeace , which wants the company to go even further .
Steve Jobs , chief executive , announced yesterday that the technology giant is taking steps to stop using toxic chemicals in its computers , displays and iPods .
By 2008 , it will have completely removed arsenic from all its displays , and stopped using flame - retardant chemicals and polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) in any products .
It also pledged to stop using mercury in its monitor backlighting , when this becomes "" technically and economically feasible "" .
Greenpeace has accused the tech company of using toxic chemicals that its rivals have already phased out .
But , in a robust defence of the company 's performance , Mr Jobs claimed that it had already been taking the issue seriously . ""
Upon investigating Apple 's current practices and progress towards these goals , I was surprised to learn that in many cases Apple is ahead of , or will soon be ahead of , most of its competitors in these areas , "" he said , implying that the company was guilty of a communications breakdown rather than being an environmental laggard .
Greenpeace , which set up a website called Green
My Apple , had accused the iPod and Mac - maker of endangering children in India and China – where much obsolete technology equipment ends up - by exposing them to dangerous chemicals .
Apple appears to have heeded this call , announcing yesterday that all the environmental waste it collects in North America will be recycled there .
But Greenpeace urged the company to widen this commitment to other countries . ""
While customers in the US will be able to return their Apple products for recycling , knowing that their gear wo n't end up in the e - waste mountains of Asia and India , Apple is n't making that promise to anyone but customers in the USA , "" said Greenpeace .
"" Elsewhere in the world , an Apple product today can still be tomorrow 's e - waste .
Other manufacturers offer worldwide takeback and recycling .
Apple should too ! ""
Green
My Apple won the activism award at the Webby awards this week ."
2007-05-10,"Not judging by the reaction to the latest ruminations from Steve Jobs , Apple 's chief executive , whose latest bit of blogging , entitled "" A Greener Apple "" ( apple.com/hotnews/agreenerapple ) - about the company 's past and future environmental objectives - has drawn noticeably less interest than his previous one , in which he discussed whether online music should be sold with or without digital rights management software .
Compare the number of links to the latter with those to the former and it 's clear that at least in the blogosphere - which for these purposes is probably a sufficiently good proxy for the wider computer - buying public - people get a lot more het up about whether they can play music bought online on their iPod than on what environmental impact that same iPod might have when it 's ditched for something newer .
The blog indexer Technorati reckons there are 6,200-odd blogs writing about Jobs 's take on DRM , compared to 860 or so about greening Apple ; Google 's Blogsearch puts the numbers at 3,300 and 450 respectively .
Could it be that people simply do n't care about their old computers , mobile phones and digital music players , and whether they 're recycled into chain mail suits for seal pups , or instead will pollute vast swathes of China that perhaps made them in the first place ?
Greenpeace applauded "" the enthusiasm with which Apple fans have greeted this campaign "" - which it has been waging against since last August .
Then , it published its "" Guide to Greener Electronics "" , updated in December and again last month .
By those rankings , Apple had slid from being fourth from last to last , ranking about 2 out of 10 on a "" green scale "" .
But Adam Engst of Tidbits ( tidbits.com ) says that "" my impression from talking with Mac users is that Greenpeace 's tactics have generally worked more to polarise than to persuade , with diehard environmental activists becoming all the more vocal about Apple 's ills and longtime Mac users rising to defend the company "" .
Certainly there 's still little indication that people choose between computers or mobile phones or music players based on how they 'll dispose of them .
The European WEEE Directive , which comes into force in July ( What is the WEEE Directive and do I need to care ? , December 14 2006 ) will anyway oblige electronics manufacturers to take back and recycle their equipment from consumers - who currently dump 2 m tonnes of electrical rubbish annually .
So it looks like "" greenness "" will remain someone else 's problem , whether or not Jobs or Greenpeace like it . ·

2007-05-29,"A couple of days ago at the launch of Facebook 's F8 platform - which lets users embed other services inside their page on the popular social networking site - GigaOM 's Liz Gannes said that founder Mark Zuckerberg was "" channeling Steve Jobs "" .
It was n't the first time somebody had linked the Apple founder with the famously casual 20-something .
Such comments have made me think about Facebook , and whether it was going to be a new sort of Apple .
What do I mean ?
Well , on a very basic level , the site clearly values design in a way that few of its competitors do .
But that 's just surface appearance :
really the link I see is that much of Facebook 's value lies in what it is n't - it 's not MySpace .
It 's easy to see a sort of Microsoft v Apple situation by comparing the messy - but - corporate behemoth that is MySpace versus the "" independent "" , smoothness of Facebook .
On the other hand , it 's tempting to think that opening up the site to third parties means that Zuckerberg is actually using the Microsoft model - build an ecosystem of partners reliant on your system in order to create a large community with a vested interest in its success .
But I think the Apple corollary works better , because for all the excitement about F8 , Facebook 's new approach is n't about pushing information out , it 's about bringing it in .
It does n't create a solar system of planets which rely on each other to keep in orbit , but scoops everything up and dumps it onto a closed system ; Facebook becomes my homepage , into which everything else feeds .
What 's the next step for Facebook ?
To become the biggest social network on the web ?
To steal MySpace 's market away from it ?
If that 's the case , then I wonder if there is n't something that Zuckerberg can learn from the successes and failures of Steve Jobs .
Apple focuses its energies on users who are prepared to pay extra for the Apple brand ; as a result it 's never going to be # 1 , and is actually pretty happy and successful in that role , even if some users wish everyone would switch from Windows .
Right now Facebook 's owners look like they dream of becoming the dominant platform on the web ...
but it 's a tough business .
Social networking is increasingly becoming commoditised : for the vast majority of users , it 's becoming a utility .
Trying to make it the start page of choice is a big ideal , but you ca n't be everything to everybody .
So Facebook is gaining traction with older users , those of college age and beyond ( certainly a lot of the growth I 've seen in the past few months is in the 30 + bracket ) .
But will it start to look to the next generation of users too ?
Will they try and get the teenagers inside the site before they become too attached to rivals ?
Well , if Zuckerberg knows that part of Facebook 's appeal is that it is n't MySpace
, then he should also remember that part of the appeal of MySpace for teenagers is precisely because it is n't Facebook .
The users do n't much care that the site is owned by Rupert Murdoch ; it is just part of their evolution on the web .
MySpace is about teenage rebellion ; ugliness and defiantly folded arms .
Facebook is much more popular among those of college age and older - it 's more grown up , and looking at it is n't like pouring acid into your eyeballs .
However it 's always tempting to chase younger people , since they are the ones with more spare time to put into pushing up clicks and traffic .
That 's great news for advertisers , but is actually less valuable than it seems .
Facebook might overtake MySpace , but I do n't see much point in it trying to commandeer the teenage market because it should chase value , not eyeballs .
Being good does n't always make you the biggest kid in school , but that does n't mean you ca n't be successful all the same ."

2007-06-06,"What do you mean , "" again "" ?
They 've never been enemies ; in fact , they 've been friends for decades , and although their get - together on the stage of the Wall Street Journal 's D5 conference last week marked the first time ( and perhaps the last ) that they have been together answering questions on a stage since the 1980s , there has never been any real animosity between them .
In fact in the 1980s , when the PC industry was in its infancy and the soon - to - be - famous pair were n't that far out of it , they occasionally went on "" double dates "" with their women of the moment , until Bill made the move to Seattle .
Since then they 've occasionally met for pleasure ( such as a dinner in 2003 for the same WSJ event ) .
And for business ?
That 's not known .
While their rivalry is intense and consists of much needling , at least from Jobs 's side ( he described the widespread use of the Mac - created iTunes by Windows users as "" like offering a glass of ice water to someone in hell "" ) , it is also marked by an acceptance of who shakes which branches of the tree .
They ceased being true rivals once Jobs was kicked out of Apple in 1985 and headed off to found NeXT Computer .
At that time , Apple was still a bigger business than Microsoft , which only passed it in revenues in 1997 ( see Microsoft 's 10-year revenue chart , and Apple 's , ) building on the success of Windows95 , while Apple was considered a basket case , financially speaking .
That also marked the last year the duo was seen on a stage together , though Gates then loomed huge via a telescreen over Jobs , who was explaining to the non - adoring Mac faithful that Microsoft had bought a $ 150 m non - voting share in Apple .
Well , what are friends for ?
But last week 's appearance marks a peculiar time for the computer industry .
Gates is preparing to step down from Microsoft to focus on his charitable work ; Jobs is a board member at Disney .
A year from now , if they did n't have their common past , it 's hard to imagine a scenario outside a film script in which they 'd come together .
The transcript of their onstage talk is available here and shows Jobs in reflective mood : "" When Bill and I first met each other and worked together in the early days , generally , we were both the youngest guys in the room , right ? ...
And now when we 're working at our respective companies , I do n't know about you , but I 'm the oldest guy in the room most of the time . ""
Their final estimations of each other ?
"" I think the world 's a better place because Bill realised that his goal is n't to be the richest guy in the cemetery , "" said Jobs .
And Gates ?
"" I 'd give a lot to have Steve 's taste ...
The way he does things is just different and , you know , I think it 's magical . ""

2007-06-11,"Steve Jobs is doing his WWDC07 keynote speech in San Francisco , and the early news is that Electronic Arts is going to produce Madden 08 , Tiger Woods and other games for the Mac as well as the usual systems .
There 's also quite a lot of stuff about OS X Leopard , including a new Finder with Cover Flow , a sidebar , and another attempt to fix some of the usability problems with the Dock .
Jobs says Leopard combines 32-bit and 64-bit operations in one operating system .
( Microsoft , of course , has separate 32-bit and 64-bit versions of XP and Vista , and the 32-bit drivers do n't work in the 64-bit versions . )
However , having done 10 things about Leopard , there is still no mention of high - def video support for reading and writing Blu - ray or HD DVD discs , and any clever DRM stuff .
Update :
The biggest surprise is that Apple is doing Safari for Windows .
The announcement was made in conjunction with the "" opening up "" of the iPhone , in the sense that developers will be able to create applications that run in the Safari browser on the iPhone .
If these are in some way Safari - specific , then there might be an advantage in running them in a Safari browser on Windows ( since most iPhone buyers will be Windows users -- unless it flops ) .
Presumably the thinking is that if iPods can help drive the adoption of iTunes for Windows -- and Jobs claims there are half a billion iTunes users on Windows compared with only 22 million or so on Macs -- then maybe iPhones can help drive the adoption of Safari .
If that works , sales of 25 million iPhones could double Safari 's market share ....
But I 'm not yet convinced .
I would n't really miss Safari on my Mac .
Since I already have Firefox and IE on Windows , why would I want a third browser ?
IE is n't going away , so it 's not a compelling proposition ... unless Jobs is out to kill Firefox .

Sure , it 's like shooting fish in a barrel , but thanks for all the hits ."
2007-06-13,"Steve Jobs last month described the Windows version of Apple 's iTunes application as "" like giving a glass of ice water to somebody in hell "" .
This week at Apple 's Worldwide Developer Conference ( WWDC ) he made an audacious bid for the bottled water franchise , launching a version of Apple 's Safari browser to run on Windows - and pointing to it as the window through which external applications for the upcoming iPhone will work .
Observers pointed out that the Windows version of Safari will probably also boost Apple 's income from Google , paid for searches via the browser , already estimated at $ 25 m ( £ 12.5 m ) a year .
Jobs also revisited his demonstration given at last August 's WWDC of the next version of Mac OS X , dubbed Leopard , due for release this October at a price of $ 129 ( in the UK £ 89 , not the £ 65 that current exchange rates would imply ) .
Leopard will sport a redesigned Finder interface for file and network navigation , with graphical depictions of files in "" stacks "" and another that shows them like album covers being flipped .
But it is the iPhone that is clearly the core of Apple 's focus - via Safari .
Apple has huge ambitions for the combined phone , music player and internet device : in January , Jobs suggested an aim of 1 % of the worldwide mobile phone market for next year , which would translate into 10 m units .
With iPhones about to go on sale in the US on June 29 , the company is rumoured to have 3 m ready for purchase immediately .
The presence of Apple - built software on the iPhone raised hopes ahead of the conference that Apple would provide a software development kit ( SDK ) or set of application programming interfaces ( APIs ) to let developers write software to run directly on iPhones .
Those hopes were dashed .
"" We have been trying to come up with a solution to expand the capabilities of the iPhone so developers can write great apps for it , but keep the iPhone secure , "" Jobs told the conference .
His message : write web applications that run on a server ( and work via Safari ) ; iPhone users then will be able to access them through the fully fledged Safari browser on the phone . ""
Do n't worry about distribution , just put 'em on an internet server .
And guess what , there 's no SDK you need ! "" he said .
John Gruber , a Mac commentator who writes the popular Daring Fireball site , said that this "" went over like a lead balloon "" .
He notes on his site : "" It 's insulting , because it 's not a way to write iPhone apps , and you ca n't bullshit developers .
If web apps ... are such a great way to write software for iPhone , then why is n't Apple using this technique ? ""
That question gained added importance as within 24 hours security and hacker sites had discovered malicious exploits that could be used against anyone visiting a site with the Windows version of Safari .
Apple has just two weeks to identify whether those flaws exist in the iPhone version and close them before it goes on sale .
But some think that putting Safari onto Windows will drive Apple 's wedge further into the Microsoft hegemony - the first incursion having been in October 2003 , when Apple released a Windows version of iTunes .
( Jobs characterised the event as "" Hell froze over "" . )
Michael Gartenberg , an analyst for Jupiter Research , commented this week : "" At the moment , iTunes is one of the most downloaded applications .
It will be interesting to see if Apple will leverage that and make Safari a standard part of the iTunes installation at some point .
That act alone would immediately give Safari a big boost .
"" It is unlikely that that could significantly dent Internet Explorer 's market share , which stands at about 78 % , with Firefox on 15 % .
But even a small takeup could be significant .
Safari now has an estimated 5 % share of the overall browser market .
Gruber notes that Apple already receives payments from Google for the use of its search engine via its built - in search box ; he says that generates about $ 25 m a year .
"" If Safari for Windows is even moderately successful , it 's easy to see how that might grow to $ 100 m per year or more . ""
Yet Safari for Windows might also bring another influence to bear on the latter stages of the browser wars , won by Microsoft in the 1990s when it crushed Netscape .
Many sites are still developed so that they look best on IE .
But if developers of web applications want to perform transactions on iPhones , they will write to the Safari standard , which already has some use in mobiles - Nokia 's S60 browser uses the Safari rendering and JavaScript engines .
That would force Microsoft to follow external standards for the rendering engine in Explorer , a situation it has not been in for a decade .

2007-06-28,"Just the Jobs : the Apple CEO brandishing the new iPhone earlier this year .
Photograph : Paul Sakuma / AP .
In January , I was sitting in the Moscone West convention centre in San Francisco when Steve Jobs served up his latest idea .
Alongside me , a host of Apple fans yelped with excitement when he whizzed up a host of ingredients ( iPod , phone , web browser ) and pulled out the iPhone .
Tomorrow , they will be able to get their teeth into the gizmo - dubbed the "" jesusphone "" by some wags - for the first time .
In America , at least , the hype bubble is fit to burst and a range of experts are laying bets on whether it will be a success or a failure .
The Mac - attackers , who lurk around every corner predicting that the company will collapse under the weight of its own hubris , have their knives pre - sharpened .
Some are making ludicrous predictions of total failure , usually a reaction to some perceived arrogance .
In turn , the company 's fans , who sometimes veer towards techno - fanaticism , have crowded defensively around a product they 've never even used in order to explain exactly why the iPhone is "" revolutionary "" .
In reality , as a collection of individual abilities , there is nothing really new about the iPhone .
It makes phone calls , sends text messages , takes pictures , does email : all the things we expect our phones to do these days .
It has Wi - Fi built in , which is common among top - tier devices .
It has a touchscreen - but again , it is n't alone .
It plays music ; it has a web browser ; it has a built - in mapping system .
None of this is revolutionary .
You could even say that gadgeteers expect so much of their phones these days that it is the iPhone 's deficiencies that have taken us by surprise - no 3 G capability , a fairly ordinary 2-megapixel camera that ca n't shoot video , no instant messaging , an inability to use music tracks as ringtones .
But Apple is betting that the whole package will prove a success .
Actually , that 's a bad choice of words , because Apple rarely gambles .
It develops very few products , and tends to concentrate very hard on them .
Compared to the scattergun approaches of rivals like Microsoft and Google , Apple is armed merely with a kitchen knife .
That conservative tendency also means that the company has limited its own success .
Of course , it makes plenty of money - Steve Jobs is a very rich man - but Apple remains dwarfed by rivals who throw their spaghetti against the wall and revel in the glory when a strand sticks .
But that is why every move it makes is more than just an attempt to sell a few high - price machines .
The iPhone is not just a gadget - it is Apple 's attempt to turn defence into attack .
Steve Jobs probably thought it was more dangerous not to build a mobile phone , and has instead chosen to become the mobile world 's luxury brand .
It 's working so far , but these are the earliest of the early days .
He has his recipe : let 's see if he manages to cook up a success ."
2007-06-28,"The first time I heard Steve Jobs being asked "" What is the iPhone ? "" was in September 2002 , at a press conference in Paris .
His reply then was an incredulous "" Whaat ? "" , as though he 'd been asked how often he 'd had the yeti as a dinner guest .
With the iPod then not quite a year old , Apple 's focus was just on pulling itself out of its limp financial position - which began to happen once that gadget was made available for Windows .
But the iPod then was n't enough for people ; they thought Apple should be making a mobile phone , and since the iMac and iBook had been cool names , "" iPhone "" was the obvious next step .
So people speculated and dreamed and sketched iPhone designs .
People have been wishing that Apple would launch a phone for so long
that the fact that it actually will tomorrow has created in some people an unbearable tension between dream and bathetic reality , as though it had been announced that aliens had been discovered , but that they wear tweed .
Perhaps uniquely for a product that has not yet appeared on any retailers ' shelves , the iPhone has set some sort of record for prerelease hype - and opprobrium .
Last week ZDNet published an article suggesting people might crash their cars while trying to text on it ( because they 'll have to look at the screen ) , while the Wall Street Journal suggested corporations ' IT departments would stall people wanting to hook the iPhone to corporate email systems because it might be "" insecure "" .
Another writer , Robert Vamosi , stated confidently that "" for the moment , iPhone will be running a version of the current Mac OS 10.4 "" ( tinyurl.com/299hpc ) , which wins my prize for dumbest remark : how could anyone who 's seen both the iPhone display and Mac OS X seriously think that ?
Forbes quoted Andrew Storms of nCircle , a computer security company , who suggested : "" It 's going to be entering enterprise networks whether we like it or not , and it 's a nightmare for security teams . ""
Then then he admitted this was "" largely speculation "" ( tinyurl.com/2huxru ) .
Well , yes , since he has n't used one ... I 'm indebted to John Gruber , whose Daring Fireball site ( daringfireball.net ) has been patiently , and eye - rollingly , noting these little snippets of absurd "" reporting "" .
But what 's behind it all ?
As we wave Tony Blair goodbye , his "" feral beast "" speech - about how the 24-hour media cycle means careful consideration gets left in the dust as news organisations and websites vie to be first with a headline that will attract readers ( tinyurl.com/ynt8rz ) - seems pertinent .
It 's just like that with the iPhone : website editors know well
that the online equivalent of a theatre sign saying "" Free Beer "" is a headline with the words "" Apple "" and "" iPod "" or "" iPhone "" .
( Though "" iPod "" is losing its lustre there . )
So people are writing anything about the iPhone , even though they have n't found out anything new , or met anyone informed .
Partly that 's due to Steve Jobs , who in 10 years has completely reversed the positions of Apple and New Labour .
In 1997 , the latter was the tightest publicity ship you could imagine .
Now it leaks like a rusty boat .
And Apple ?
More tightly sealed than an iPod , unlike the loose - lipped ship of yore .
What I have n't seen written about are the hard questions for network operators and rival designers .
Did it really need Apple to notice that linear voicemail , where you have to listen to each message in strict order , is annoying and incongruous
( you do n't have to ring missed callers in the order they called you ) ?
Or to put text messages into "" threads "" with their sender ?
( Have a look at Apple 's 20-minute guided tour at tinyurl.com/2hlaow . )
I do n't know if I 'll buy an iPhone , because I have n't seen the European specification .
It might acquire 3 G , and GPS ; I 'm hypothesising .
Still , Apple helped to drive the PC industry from command - line systems to the graphical user interface ; if it can get mobile phone operators to start thinking about better services , rather than just pushing shoddy subsidised phones at us , then all that hype wo n't have been wasted .

The pair defend the Edge network , with Jobs saying : "" EDGE will be faster than people have read in the reviews .
Some of the criticism of EDGE is more theoretical .
Blackberrys use EDGE , and in many cases is slower , because our software is better . ""
There 's also the question about whether the iPhone will change Apple .
Jobs replies : I hope it does n't change Apple too much , we like it the way it is .
We 've got two strong legs on our chair today -- we have the Mac business , which is a $ 10 billion business , and music , our iPod and iTunes business , which is $ 10 billion .
We hope the iPhone is the third leg on our chair , and maybe one day Apple TV will be the fourth leg .
Trivia point :
In the transcription , Jobs refers to the operating system as "" OS10 "" .
For the many Mac users who ca n't pronounce and ca n't spell the name of the Mac 's operating system , the correct format is "" OS X "" .

PC and Mac ( or David Mitchell and Robert Webb as they 're sometimes known ) .
Photograph :
Yui Mok / PA Back in 1984
a young programmer said that the difference between working for Microsoft 's Bill Gates and Apple 's Steve Jobs was that the first made him feel like an engineer while the second made him feel like a poet .
The notion that PCs are serious machines while Apple Macs are , to quote the most recent Mitchell and Webb ad , "" for artsy fartsy creative types "" has pretty much stuck since then .
The distinction is a little silly , as anything that can be done on a PC can be done on a Mac and vice versa .
The important point of difference is ease of use ( Macs are far easier to use ) and that a Mac can run Windows ( NT or Vista ) , whereas PCs can only run Windows ( and in many cases not even Windows Vista ) .
Well , the battle between these two rival operators is hotting up as Apple 's share of the home computer market rises to a still very modest 5 % .
So here , to illustrate just how passionate people feel about binary coding , is a rap , done in loud , boastful gangsta style .
It is a fairly decent parody of the "" I 'm a Mac , I 'm a PC "" campaign and will , like them , doubtless infuriate just as many as it amuses ."

Whether RSJ thinks the same is , of course , open to speculation , but he would n't put it as rudely in public or , probably , as well .
The fact that the music download industry was actually pioneered by people like musician Peter Gabriel with On Demand Distribution ( OD2 ) -- launched in 1999 , compared with the iTunes Music Store 's 2003 -- is incidental .
Apple was late into music players , music libraries and music software , but it was the first company to put all three together and commercialise the result in a profitable way ."

2 In the beginning was the iPod .
Then there was the iPod mini , the nano , the shuffle , Apple TV and now the iPhone .
Steve Jobs keeps on innovating and the bubble shows no sign of bursting just yet .
The Apple co - founder and chief executive transformed the way we buy and consume music with iTunes and the iPod , launched in 2001 .
Rarely has a product become so ubiquitous and yet maintained its image as the cool "" must - have "" gadget .
Jobs is also a master marketer .
But will the iPhone live up to the hype ?
The touchscreen handset , which combines a music player , mobile phone , video , email and the internet launched in the US last month and is due to arrive in Europe by this end of the year .
Jobs described it as a "" leapfrog product "" that would "" change everything "" , while Time magazine predicted it would "" do to the cellphone market what the iPod did to the portable music player market : crush it pitilessly beneath the weight of its own superiority "" .
Not everyone on our panel was so convinced .
"" There is a lot of scepticism about the iPhone , "" said one panellist .
"" This could be the year when we see a lot of reaction against the Apple brand . ""
Jobs already suffered a backlash over Apple 's use of digital rights management , or DRM , which means songs downloaded from the iTunes website can only be played on an iPod .
Jobs responded by laying the blame firmly at the door of the big record companies , and signed a deal earlier this year with EMI to offer DRM - free music , albeit at a higher price , on iTunes .
Only a brave man bets against Steve Jobs .
Apple 's quarterly profits broke the $ 1bn barrier for the first time at the end of 2006 , on the back of record revenue of $ 7.1bn .
More than 21 million iPods were sold in the three months , up 50 % on the same period in 2005 .
Its success has boosted sales of other Apple products - the so - called "" halo effect "" - with sales of Macintosh computers up 28 % over the same period .
Apple 's iPod is the defining product of the digital music revolution , the modern day equivalent of the 1980s Sony Walkman .
The iTunes music store - 2.5 billion songs sold and counting - was supplemented with a video download service launched last year , selling full - length feature films over the internet .
With another new product , Apple TV , viewers can watch them on their high definition TV set .
Jobs co - founded Apple in 1976 but was kicked out of the company in 1985 following a power struggle .
He returned in 1997 to almost single - handedly rescue it from the brink of disaster with the launch of the iMac and the iBook .
But the biggest Apple revolution was yet to come .
In between , he founded Pixar , the Hollywood animation studio behind Toy Story and The Incredibles , which he sold to Disney in 2005 in an all - share $ 7.4bn deal , in the process becoming Disney 's biggest shareholder . ·

"" Hope you feel good about yourself , you mangina .
One bright side is that at least I was busted by the Times and not Valleywag . ""
I really , really enjoyed seeing those guys keep guessing wrong , "" Lyons said .
"" For six months Dr Evil and Mr Bigglesworth put their big brains together and could n't come up with the answer .
"" Guy from the Times did it in a week .
So much for the trope about smarty - pants bloggers disrupting old media . ""
Both Apple chief executive Steve Jobs and rival Microsoft boss Bill Gates have admitted reading the blog , which has been turned into a book due for release this autumn .
Few figures were spared being lampooned by Fake Steve , including U2 singer Bono and Larry Ellison , chief executive of tech firm Oracle : "" What is up with this plastic surgery ?
Larry , you 're 61 years old and you look like friggin Keanu Reeves . ""
"" So Bono calls me last night , "" he posted last summer . ""
Hammered .
Of course .
And sobbing .
Says he 's just seen this stupid Al Gore movie about global warming and he 's freaking out . ""
Oh , Steve , he says , you should see the poor polar bears .
Drownin !
We got ta do sumfin , like have a concert or whatever . ""
The Fake Steve Jobs blog will move to the Forbes site from today .
Forbes editor Richard Karlgaard , who had been one of those trying to work out the identity of Fake Steve Jobs , said the blog was a brilliant caricature and that he does not hold a grudge against Lyons - despite once offering an iPod to anyone that could identify the author .

2007-08-06,"The anonymous amanuensis of Apple tycoon Steve Jobs , pictured , who for months has baffled web watchers and created a cult industry among technophiles , has been outed by the New York Times as Daniel Lyons , technology editor at Forbes magazine .
His blog , called The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs , has ruthlessly satirised Apple , its boss and American celebrity culture , posing as the notes a chief executive would write if he or she were saying what they really thought .
Lyons claims to be pleased that it was an old - fashioned newspaper journalist who outed him , rather than a blogosphere thruster , but he told the paper : "" You 've ruined the mystery of fake Steve , robbing thousands of people around the world of their sense of childlike wonder .
"" Jobs himself has not taken offence apparently , admitting to reading the blog , as has his old rival Bill Gates , presumably to find out what they really think .
There are plans for a book and a film .
Also being made into a film is a similarly unlikely subject , the bestselling Dangerous Book for Boys .
The book , part - manual instructing boys how to build treehouses and fold paper airplanes and part - reteller of the stories of national heroes such as Captain Scott and Lord Nelson , was the dreamchild of former London teacher Conn Iggulden and his theatre director brother , Hal , and has sold 1 m copies .
Disney , which has won the rights following a bidding war , plans to turn the book into a story about a father raising his sons "" and balancing a natural instinct to shelter them from harm with their natural desire for adventure "" , according to Variety .
Rylstone Women 's Institute members in North Yorkshire , whose nude calendar eight years ago spawned a film , are being immortalised in chocolate as well .
William Whitaker , a chocolatier in Skipton , is bringing out boxes of chocolates modelled in the shape of the calendar girls .
A small donation from each box sold will go towards boosting the women 's leukaemia charity .
The Today programme 's John Humphrys , long a scourge of politicians , has fallen foul of evangelical Christians .
The cause of their official complaint to the BBC was a throwaway remark during an interview about reducing crime "" at approx 8.43am on Thursday , 19 July "" that people had been "" trying to do that since God was a boy "" .
They have complained that "" Humphries "" ( sic ) blasphemed on air by taking the Lord 's name in vain . ""
More importantly , God was never a boy and it is offensive to Him to suggest such a thing . ""
Pity the complainants neglected to spell the presenter 's name right .

2007-08-06,"RIP , Fake Steve Jobs .
He really was the Job 's bollocks when it came to wringing the tech egos of Silicon Valley , but canny New York Times reporter Brad Stone did some digging and then compared his writing to that of Forbes ' tech editor Daniel Lyons .
Lo , the faker was revealed .
To be fair , Lyons has already ' fessed up to his Forbes colleagues because he felt bad , he said , that so many of them were trying to work out FSJ 's identity .
His editor Richard Karlgaard even offered an iPod to whoever could do the unmasking , but I guess once half the Forbes staff knew it was only a matter of time before it leaked out .
If you have n't discovered the delights of FSJ before - and you have the stomach for tech industry nano - humour - do come in .
The water 's lovely .
Illustration one : Friday 's post about the much - blogged photo of an iPhone demo kiosk running Windows in an AT&amp;T store : "" So who got fired ?
I 'm sure you want to know .
Well , it was a guy named Pete Dorn , who works in our supply chain organization at Apple .
No , he did n't have anything to do with the Apple stores .
But somebody had to be fired .
We pulled his name from a hat .
""
Two : Squirrel Boy , aka Google chief executive Eric Schmidt says Jobs is wrong about web TV : ""
So Eric calls me up all pissed off and tells me I 'm suffering from a massive case of recto - cranial inversion on this Internet content thing .
He says he 's the king of the internet and that I 'm a dope for calling all these new internet - only shows "" the Special Olympics version of real TV . "" ...
Eric also says I 'm a chump and a whore for trying to play nice with the Hollywood guys instead of doing battle with them the way Google is doing ...
Well , I do n't know .
I must admit , I 'm so busy up in the JobsPod trying to design beautiful devices that restore a sense of childlike wonder to people 's lives that I do n't have time to keep up with all these internet TV shows .
"" Three : On a pic of Lindsay ( cough )
Lohan with an iPhone : "" Lindsay Lohan is flashing something shiny and slippery again only this time
it 's a friggin iPhone .
Trust me , heads are rolling in the Apple retail division today .
We spent huge amounts of time on this .
We had a weight limit , an age limit , and a list of famous people who were not allowed to have one ...
Harvey Weinstein , Michael Eisner , Yoko Ono , Britney Spears , K - Fed - absolutely not , for fuck 's sake .
This is a classy device meant for discerning and intelligent people who know enough to demand the best ...
It undermines our entire image .
Look at those shorts , for God 's sake . ""
Oh dear .
I 'm talking about him as if he 's dropped off a bridge or something , when in actual fact he 's just moving to Forbes.com .
But will the allure be quite to compelling now that we know who he is ?
I do n't think so .
The mystery was half the fun .
Bad , bad Brad .
FSJ asks if anyone can thinking of cool ways to use the name "" Brad Stone "" as a verb , meaning to party poop , or unmask at the expense of other people 's fun .
FSJ 's blog post was labelled "" filthy hacks "" and "" media whores "" .
So who do we turn to now ?
TechCrunch , paidContent , Engadget and Giga Om are all well enough , but painfully short on salacious ( dare we say fictional ) gossip .
ValleyWag sticks a toe in gossip , but the other foot is firmly planted in news .
Perez , Holy Moly and Popbitch can all titillate , but tickle quite a different part .
Sigh .
Who will be the next Fake Steve Jobs ?"
2007-08-09,"Daniel Lyons .
He invented the friggin ' Secret Diary of Steve Jobs .
Have you heard of it ?
Anyhoo , for the past 14 months "" Fake Steve "" , or FSJ , has been writing a fake blog that last month attracted 700,000 visitors including RSJ - Real Steve Jobs - and The Beastmaster himself , Bill Gates .
Part of its huge appeal has been FSJ 's ability to tell "" the real story "" behind the jargon and stale platitudes the IT industry normally provides .
Another has been the knockabout humour featuring a comic book cast of Uncle Fester ( Microsoft 's Steve Ballmer ) ,
My Little Pony ( Sun boss Jonathan Schwartz ) , Squirrel boy ( Google boss Eric Schmidt ) , The Clintstones ( Bill and Hillary ) , Woz ( Apple co - founder Steve Wozniak ) , Bono , Al Gore and many more .
Last year , Forbes publisher Rich Karlgaard offered an iPod to the first person to identify FSJ and Valleywag , a Silicon Valley gossip blog , made more than one inept attempt .
Eventually , however , Brad Stone from The New York Times assembled the evidence and exposed the real Fake Steve last Sunday .
And amusingly enough , he fingered one of Karlgaard 's writers .
""
Damn , I am so busted , yo , "" responded FSJ , saying the one bright side was that he was exposed by a journalist rather than a blogger .
According to The New York Times , Karlgaard said he had a good laugh and holds no grudges .
"" I think it is the most brilliant caricature of an important part of American culture that I 've seen , "" he said .
"" We 're really proud that he 's one of ours . ""
FSJ 's blog has now been moved from Blogger to Forbes , so Lyons will get paid for writing stuff he wrote for fun .
He says : "" I 'm coming back next week , badder than ever . ""
Whether a Forbes staffer can be as rude and politically incorrect as an anonymous blogger remains to be seen .
Plenty of FSJ fans think Brad Stone just shot Bambi 's mom .

2007-08-09,"Apple product announcements are usually greeted with hyperbole , but this week 's had already been discussed on the net by the time Steve Jobs took the stage at the company 's Californian HQ on Tuesday .
Leaked images of a new iMac keyboard had already laid the foundation for predictions - a new aluminium desktop to replace the big white iMac range .
And so it came to pass .
The new iMac is slimmer than its predecessor , with aluminium and glass replacing the familiar white plastic .
The internals are impressive , chalking up as much as 4 GB of memory and up to a terabyte of hard disk space .
While the 17 in model has been phased out , a new spec 20 in model takes its place and pricing remains relatively consistent : British consumers will fork out £ 799 for the low - end 20 in iMac , £ 949 for the faster 20 in model and £ 1,149 - a £ 200 drop - for the 24 in screen .
With this new look , the iMac now hits its fourth design revision ( five if you include the shift from PowerPC chips to Intel ) but this is much more of a cosmetic change than previous versions .
Jobs played up the green credentials of these new models , clearly reacting to criticism that the company has been doing badly on environmental issues .
"" Aluminium and glass are phenomenal materials , "" he said .
"" This has really been thought through from a recycling point of view .
We 're using really high - quality plastics . ""
But many of Tuesday 's announcements were given over to the new software packages , including iLife and iWork .
The iLife suite was hailed as the biggest move forward in the product 's history , but on the surface it seemed more like a gentle evolution .
The only significant change was iMovie , which has been completely rebuilt .
With iWork , Apple is finally entering the spreadsheet market with Numbers , a product that - like the current Pages word processor - highlights visual impact and intuitive interfaces .
The release is also a tacit admission that some Apple owners may like to do boring things , even if the company does n't really want them to .
iMovie users are also given the option to create iTunes versions of their videos or even upload their film straight to YouTube : a clear sign of support for the hugely popular website .
The YouTube uploading is a minor part of iMovie , but it is indicative of the increasing link between Jobs and Google , forged last year when Eric Schmidt took a seat on the Apple board .
The iPhone already has integration with Google Maps and YouTube , and that has continued across the new applications : iWeb includes drag - and - drop map integration and integrates AdSense straight into web pages .
So what does the new look mean , if anything ?
After a question and answer session with the assembled journalists , Jobs made Apple 's positioning clear : higher - end consumer electronics .
"" We 're obsoleting ourselves because we really care about it , "" he said .
"" There 's some stuff in the industry that we would n't be proud to ship or show to our friends and family .
We ca n't ship junk . ""

2007-08-29,"Among the many sleights of hand perpetrated by Steve Jobs has been the portrayal of the sale on the iTunes Store of music without DRM ( the copy protection that prevents you giving it to a few million of your closest friends without first burning it to a CD and then re - encoding it ) , but at higher audio quality as the only alternative to selling that same music with DRM and at lower quality .
You can get it with DRM at 128kbps AAC ; or without DRM , at 256kbps .
Why is that sleight of hand ?
Because if you draw a square with four compartments in your head , with the columns headed "" without DRM "" and "" with DRM "" and the rows "" lower quality "" and "" higher quality "" , then you 'll see that the iTunes Store is selling music in opposite corners of the square .
It 's not selling in the same row , or the same column .
Where 's the music that 's low - quality and without DRM ?
Alternatively , where do we get the with - DRM high - quality stuff ?
And more importantly , if we accept ( for the purposes of argument ) that the prices for the existing items are correct , how much should we pay for the music in the other boxes ?
We know how much we pay for low - quality DRM music : 79p per track .
( In the US it 's 99¢ , or - at current exchange rates - 50p .
In Europe it 's 99 Euro cents , or 67p .
Amazing how passing across water makes digital goods rise in price . )
For high - quality DRM - free music , it 's 99p .
There 's another data point : we know that people will buy legal DRM - free music from sites like eMusic where the price works out at 30p per track .
We also know that people will download DRM - free music at all sorts of quality via file - sharing for nothing but the incremental cost of their broadband connection , but that 's not a very helpful data point .
Using that as a basis , the whole of our DRM - free column would read "" 0 "" .
Clearly , having DRM added to a track makes it cheaper - the record labels are in effect admitting that DRM degrades the value of the digital product .
And lower - quality audio is also , more obviously , worse .
Anyway , the price of DRM - tinged high - quality tracks must lie between 79p and 99p .
Now , is adding DRM as much of a disbenefit to a track as lower quality ?
That is , how much of the 20p difference should we allocate to audio quality , and how much to the presence of the DRM ?
As noted above , you can get rid of the iTunes DRM by burning the track to a CD .
You ca n't , however , improve its audio quality : once lost by lossy encoding like MP3 or AAC , quality is never regained , only painted over .
Logically , then , we should be willing to pay more for the presence of high quality than for the absence of DRM .
If that were true , then DRM would be the cheapest part of the 20p price difference in our four - squared box .
Less than 10p , perhaps even less than 5p .
That 's what logic says .
Yet the upside of zero DRM is that you can easily move it on to other devices -
and as we 've seen before ( No taste for high - quality audio , August 2 ) , people are n't prepared to pay for better audio quality with DRM ( in SACDs ) ; they 'd rather have convenience .
So zero DRM is more valuable than audio quality .
Which means we have two watertight arguments on the value of DRM which produce diametrically opposed outcomes .
If Apple were to get really inventive , it would let us submit bids on how much we 'd pay for those two missing varieties of song .
Anywhere between 79p and 99p : how much is audio quality worth to you ?

2007-09-02,"Three months ago , Apple launched the iPhone , the device that CEO Steve Jobs proclaimed would redefine the mobile phone industry in the same way that the iPod revolutionised the music business .
US consumers have had a chance to get to grips with the device , so now seems a good time to compile an interim report .
Jobs 's pitch for the phone was characteristically audacious : the device cost an arm and a leg - $ 499 for 4 GB and $ 599 for 8 GB - and that 's just for starters .
Apple had struck a deal with AT&amp;T , which meant that in addition to shelling out for the handset , you had to sign up to an AT&amp;T contract for 18 months .
The phone was locked to the AT&amp;T network - and you did n't even get 3 G connectivity .
In fact , most of the time you got the kind of connection speeds that made one think fondly about dial - up modems .
It 's an odd way to start a revolution , to put it mildly .
The iPhone is a lovely piece of kit - in effect , a sleek , powerful personal computer running an industrial - grade operating system .
It has the capability to be a really disruptive device in an industry that badly needs disruption .
But it comes shackled to an unpopular , low - tech mobile network .
So acquiring one is like buying a Porsche engine and fitting it to your lawnmower .
People figured out quickly that you could cancel AT&amp;T 's inernet service to get its browser to work only via wi - fi ; but you could n't use it on any other mobile phone / data network .
( And still had to pay the 18-month AT&amp;T subscription . )
This was not a fundamental technical limitation of the device , but a technological shackle designed by Apple to drive business to AT&amp;T. We are now starting to see the commercial rationale for the bodge .
It turns out that Apple gets $ 3 a month for every existing AT&amp;T subscriber who has bought an iPhone and $ 11 a month for every new customer .
That looks like about $ 150 per user for Apple , on top of the margin on the phone itself .
So although Apple can make money selling iPhones to anyone , the company gets considerably more if it drives those users to AT&amp;T.
Which is what it is doing .
This makes good commercial sense , but technologically speaking it 's idiotic .
Given the technical capabilities of the iPhone , it ought to be untethered in the way that , say , the Nokia E61 is .
Not surprisingly , this thought has occurred to a lot of geeks and several unlocking methods have appeared in recent weeks .
First of all , a New Jersey teenager , one George Hotz , took a soldering iron to his iPhone , wrote some software and announced that he had used the phone on T - Mobile .
It had taken him , he claimed , about two hours .
This is reassuring evidence of teenage ingenuity , but not everyone is a dab hand with a soldering iron , so the Hotz hack was trumped by news that a quick way of unlocking an iPhone using only software had been found .
A company named UniquePhones launched iPhoneSIMfree.com , announcing a method that left virtually all the iPhone 's features intact .
A representative of the technology site Engadget reported that ' iPhoneSIMfree.com 's software solution completely SIM unlocks the iPhone , is restore - resistant , and should make the iPhone fully functional for users outside of the US ' .
The UniquePhones folks then announced plans to sell licences for their recipe , which seemed a nice way of living off their programmers ' wits .
But then a lawyergram arrived from AT&amp;T making threatening noises about copyright infringement and illegal software dissemination .
This seems like bluff to me , but I 'm no lawyer .
What matters is that UniquePhones took fright , announcing that it was putting the key - release on hold while legal advice was sought .
So iPhone users will have to wait a bit longer before they can escape from AT&amp;T 's walled garden .
While they wait , here are some thoughts to ponder .
First , if the law does indeed say that the iPhone ca n't be unlocked , then the law is an ass .
As the Princeton security expert
Ed Felten puts it : ' The law should hesitate to micromanage what people do with the devices they own .
If you want to run different software on your phone , or want to use one cell provider rather than another , why should the government interfere ? '
Second , note that it 's AT&amp;T 's lawyers who are doing the dirty work , not Apple 's - even though Apple stands to lose quite a lot initially from unbridled unlocking .
Neat footwork by Steve Jobs , eh ?
Third , there is the question of which mobile operator will get the exclusive iPhone deal in the UK .
And - given that the availability of unlocking methods is now a racing certainty - whether it will be worth the paper it 's written on by the time the deal is signed .
Stay tuned ."
2007-09-04,"Is it that time again already ?
Steve Jobs will be ironing his polo neck and buffing up his sneakers in preparation for tomorrow 's press conference which , by the power of Greyskull Cupertino , will be beamed to BBC TV Centre .
But what 's it all about ?
Well , two things .
One is that the poor old iPod - perhaps the most iconic consumer gadget of our time - is in need of a bit of a makeover after being outshined by its sexier younger sister the iPhone .
The iPhone might not hold as much music as the iPod , but it is hailed as the device that will change mobile phones as we know them .
Hence the iPhone generating a level of press coverage that would make Abi Titmuss fume with envy .
From whence , I would not like to say .
I digress .
The likely outcome is a new iPod that will basically be the iPhone without the phone bits : widescreen , touchscreen and a wifi connection that will allow users to connect directly to the iTunes store .
That leaves 5.5 generation iPod owners like me , with our measly 2.5 "" screens , looking a little outdated .
But then that 's the whole idea .
Or , you wait for the iPhone to launch in the UK .
Probably O2 , probably October or November .
I 'll be the one in the tent in Regent Street .
So who 's holding out for an iPhone ?
And who 'll want a new iPod anyway ?
Or , perhaps , you 're resolutely Apple hating and determined to stick with the Nokia / floral fascia combination you 've had since 2003 .
Anyone ?"
2007-09-05,"Steve Jobs with iPod Touch
( Photo : Engadget )
Steve Jobs introduced some new iPods at an Apple event today .
As usual , Ryan Block has provided live coverage at Engadget in The beat goes on .
The iPod Touch has the same interface as the iPhone , along with Wi - Fi and a Safari browser for $ 299 ( 8 GB ) or $ 399 ( 16 GB ) .
It will ship later this month .
This is a great move because it will provide a much bigger target market for iPhone - style Web sites .
Also , it should provide economies of scale to help with iPhone manufacturing .
This is presumably an element in the only big suprise in the event : a hefty cut in the iPhone price .
Apple 's press release says : Apple today announced that it is on track to sell its one millionth iPhone before the end of September , and to make iPhone affordable for even more customers this holiday season , it is lowering the price of the most popular iPhone model with 8 GB of storage from $ 599 to just $ 399 .
The 4 GB model is toast .
Update 1
: USA Today has a post - show Q&amp;A with Jobs where he comments on people being upset because they bought an iPhone at the old price : "" well , that 's what happens in technology . ""
Update 2 : danielwleigh explains how the ( red ) campaign works in comment 676124 below ."
2007-09-05,"Here we go again , dancing to Apple 's tune .
The ritual is that we wildly speculate all day about what will be revealed at tonight 's not - live - but - beamed - across - from - California - at-6pm press conference , and eventually Steve Jobs will appear in the form of a technology deity from the future to drop some white / aluminum cool product bombshell .
Scroll down for updates ...
11:24
We 're expecting a new iPod that 'll be much like the iPhone : widescreen , touch - screen and wireless .
There have also been reports of some kind of digital radio function and music - buying feature , which would be quite a departure .
Bobbie Johnson and I will be trekking to BBC TV Centre via camel this afternoon , so you do n't have to .
17:38
We made it , via the central line , in twenty minutes .
RIP , the Tube strike .
So to set the scene , this is Studio 1 at BBC TV Centre and a couple of hundred journalists , retailers , industry analysts from across Europe ( few of them women , I feel duty bound to point out ) are fidgeting impatiently in thirty or so rows of itchy red woolly seats .
We 're being treated to music by Editors and Amy Winehouse , and a cheesy graphic on the Golden Gate bridge next to a red phone box is hovering next to a couple of large , glowing white apples somewhere in the distance .
At least I think those are apples .
They might be some kind of religious symbol , but then I have n't been to the optician in a while .
The beat - we have been told by Apple - goes on .
Hopefully they are about to tell us exactly what that means .
17:57
Now we can see a live feed of all our colleagues at the Moscone Centre in San Francisco .
How quaint .
Bobbie spots YouTube 's Chad Hurley and Google 's Marissa Meyer in the crowd - what does this mean ? !
Are they just nosey , or does this have some greater significance ?
The lights are going down ...
18:01
And ... it 's Steve Jobs .
He 's on , and it 's a black polo neck !
Whodda thunk it ?
And then I grabbed his head like this and said "" this , Bill , is the future of music ... ""
He starts off on safe ground : iTunes is dominating the market and now has 6 m songs , 550 TV shows ( with 95 m individual episodes downloaded ) and 125,000 podcasts .
Perhaps more of an indication of the influence of Apple , he says , is that 32 % of 2006 US music release were only released digitally . ""
Look how far we 've come , That gives you a feel for how far we 've come in the last few years in this music revolution .
"" There will be a new version of iTunes tonight , the bigger feature of which will be ringtones . ""
That 's Apple moving into a lucrative mobile sub - sector .
The standard cost of a ringtone is $ 2.49 - Apple will do them for 99c on top of the cost of the song .
So that 's $ 1.98 .
It 's a custom ringtone maker built into Tunes , that can then be synced to on the iPhone .
Steve demos how you 'll be able to use iTunes to hack your chosen track into a a snippet for a ringtone , choosing Aretha Franklin 's Respect - "" for when my wife calls "" , he jokes .
Oh Steve .
All very well Steve , but we do n't have iPhones yet .
So what about iPods ?
18:24 :
Every iPod , overhauled Apple has sold 110 m iPods to date and the sales curve is the strongest at Christmas , so today "" we 're going to refresh or replace every product in this line in time for holiday season "" , says Big Jobs .
The Nano , he says , is the best - seling music player of all time .
So what are they doing to it ?
Apple is making it much smaller , much slimmer and aluminium .
The screen is bigger , at 2 "" , and still smaller than the current 2.5 "" video ipod screen .
But this iPod , according to his sales blurb has the highest - ever pixel density of an Apple product yet .
So though the screen is smaller , the picture quality is as good .
Work that out .
The new iPod Nano , complete with greasy finger prints The battery life is better - 24hours of audio and 5 hours or video playback , and it comes in 4 GB and 8 GB for $ 149 and $ 199 .
Twice the memory for the same price .
Cue even more ( slightly sinister and cultish ) cheering .
And now we 're being treated to a Nano video ad with Feist soundtrack , on TV near you soon .
Now what ?

Full metal iPod jacket
The original iPods get a name - the iPod Classic .
And an overhaul , in a full metal design with an 80 GB or whopping 160 G version . ""
This boggles the mind .
When we started five years ago we put a thousand songs in your pocket - this puts 40,000 songs in your pocket .
"" The steely dark grey iPod Classic The price will be $ 249 and $ 349 .
( I 'll get all the UK prices later . )
There 's more ... 18:38 :
The iPod Touch !
Here 's the money shot , finally . ""
When we introduced the iPhone we said it was the best iPod ever .
And it is .
People have been asking when we bring this technology to an iPod .
And this is it . ""
"" It 's the seventh wonder of the world .
"" It 's the iPhone without the phone bits .
The iPod Touch : the iPhone , without the phone bits
It looks exactly like the iPhone , with the same coverflow touchscreen to flick through iTunes and through album artwork , and the same through photos .
Really need photos of this ...
I 'll get you some soon !
He 's plays a bit of Dylan , a few seconds of a movie clip with John Trevolting and flicks through some photos .
Yep , it 's fast and slick and does that clever screen - rotates - with - the - handset thing , but we 've seen all that on the iPhone .
Anything else ?
Wait a minute
- what 's that in the corner ?
It 's an antenna , for wifi .
Some have tried this and failed .
So why will Apple succeed ?
Too many public wifi networks are over - complicated , asking for logic pages .
To get round that , the iPod Touch will have the Safari web browser built in so that users can log in to the network .
And it 's the best web browser on any mobile device he says , but then he would .
Google and Yahoo search are built in , as is a YouTube application - as on the iPhone .
And it 's 8 mm thin .
It 'll be the first touchscreen device that Apple has shipped globally .
Well yes , of course .
Oh , and would there be one more thing perhaps , Steve ?
You get the sense he 's done this a few times .
18:48 :
iTunes Wi - Fi Music Store
It 's a mini version of the iTunes store that you can use , from the iPod , by searching for specific artists or scanning top tens .
The next time you dock your iPod to your computer
it syncs back up to iTunes and joins your main library .
It 'll be in the iPhone as well as the iPod Touch .
So that 's pretty much all as we expected , though not a whiff of all that radio talk .
We suspect that might be some new part of the iPod "" ecosystem "" as they say - a base station with digital radio capability or something .
I ca n't imagine Steve getting all that excited about that though .
18:59 :
And now a word from our sponsors We then entered a realm dangerously near the ridiculous when Steve Jobs started saying how great Starbucks is .
People around me got up and started to leave - even Bobbie , though he insists that was for a phone call .
The shoddy excuse for tacking on some puff from the Starbucks chief executive was an iPod Touch Starbucks application .
I kid you not .
I 'm off to fiddle with the gadgets and make those touchscreens as greasy as possible on your behalf .
More soon ...
19:08 :
Hang on !
iPhone price slashed Their feedback says Apple iPhone users are more satisfied with their products than any other Apple product .
So Steve 's last trick is to cut the price of the top iPhone - the 8 GB version - from $ 599 to $ 299 .
He 's halved the price .
"" We want to put iPhones in a lot of stockings this Christmas . ""
That bodes well for us European types .
Hurrah !
19:20 :
KT Tunstall does a turn We got a couple of songs , and then she said : "" As a musician , Steve Jobs is actually making it more fun to pay for music than steal it , and that 's great . ""
Cheque 's in the post , right love ?
21:07
After the euphoria
Right .
OK .
So we got what we expected : an iPhone - like iPod with wifi and a music store .
And new versions of the Nano and Classic .
UK prices have been confirmed as £ 99 and £ 129 for the 4 GB and 8 GB Nano , and £ 159 and £ 229 for the 80 GB and 160 GB iPod Classic .
And if you 're sold on the iPod Touch , that will set you back £ 199 for the 8 GB and £ 269 for the 16 GB .
Unless you happen to be popping over to the US anytime soon ..."
2007-09-06,"With its eye - catching white plastic design , the iPod has become a landmark of 21st century living in just a few years .
But the music player marked the end of an era yesterday , as Apple 's chief executive , Steve Jobs , finally ditched its emblematic look .
Launching a new range of iPods , Mr Jobs announced the arrival of the new touch - sensitive , wireless - enabled "" iPod touch "" and binned the polished white design that has helped it become one of the most influential brands in the world .
The new widescreen iPod touch , which costs £ 199 or £ 269 , has room for up to 4,000 songs and can show films and TV programmes as well as play music .
It is based on the company 's iPhone , which went on sale this summer in the US .
As well as the touch - sensitive display , the new model comes with wireless internet capability which will allow owners to surf the web through their iPod .
Users will also be able to buy tracks from the iTunes store without having to synchronise their gadgets to a computer . ""
Other people have tried wireless and it 's failed , but we think we know what it takes to make it successful , "" said Mr Jobs , speaking to a crowd in San Francisco .
"" We 're very excited about this ... we think it 's one of the seven wonders of the world . ""
The iPod touch gives equal prominence to watching videos as to listening to music , and takes many cues from the iPhone , swapping the clean , white style for a mixture of aluminium and black , and replacing the pioneering scroll wheel with a touch - sensitive screen .
Starbucks link - up
In a curious marketing twist , Apple will take advantage of the machine 's wireless capability by linking up with the Starbucks coffee chain .
Customers who hear a song they like playing in the cafe will be able to download it immediately at the touch of a button .
The new - look machine - on sale in the UK later this month - is the work of Apple 's lead designer , award - winning Briton Jonathan I ve .
Mr I ve , a former industrial design student from Newcastle , joined Apple in 1992 and rose to prominence with his first major success , the colourful all - in - one iMac computer .
He took on legendary status with his sleek design for the iPod .
Gadget fans will shed a tear as yesterday 's launch marked the end of the iPod 's classic white design , the landmark style that became almost impossible to miss on the streets as it became more successful .
As well as the iPod touch , the traditional white iPod has been replaced by the "" classic "" model , which comes in silver or black and has doubled in capacity to hold as many as 40,000 songs .
The company also announced a new version of the iPod nano .
It now comes with a larger screen which is able to play video .
None of the developments are a radical departure from the company 's recent plans .
Apple has already trialled the features of the new iPods with the iPhone .
The old iPod , meanwhile , has been able to play video since 2005 .
The carefully orchestrated launch , which involved a live satellite link between California and BBC Television Centre in London , followed weeks of intense speculation over the fate of the iPod .
Reports yesterday suggested the possibility of a built - in digital radio , a tie - in with the BBC , or the announcement of a European launch date for the iPhone .
The launches come as the company prepares for what it hopes will be its biggest year ever .
Sales of the iPod have already exceeded 110 m since it launched in 2001 , and the months leading up to Christmas have traditionally provided Apple 's busiest period - more than 21 m were sold at the end of 2006 alone .
Online TV shows It remains unclear whether the public shares Apple 's appetite for even larger video - playing devices .
Sales of TV shows online remain modest , dwarfed by the popularity of downloadable music , and mobile television has proved unpopular with many viewers .
But Apple is hoping that it can convince people to pay to watch TV on their iPods .
Last week the company announced that it was going to let UK users of the iTunes Store download TV shows for the first time .
The initial lineup included a small number of US programmes including Ugly Betty and Desperate Housewives , all priced at £ 1.89 an episode .
News of that announcement was quickly dampened , however , after NBC - the American television network which produces hit shows including Heroes and Scrubs - announced that it was not going to renew its contract to sell programmes through iTunes .
Last night , Apple 's share price in the US dropped by 2 % to trade at $ 141.26 , although it had shot up by more than 4 % the day before in anticipation of the event and on reports about favourable iPod sales .
Rivals
The iPod is by far the most popular digital player in the market , but other manufacturers are cashing in Nokia Price : Likely to be free with contract Many experts see Nokia as Apple 's major rival , and last week the world 's biggest phone manufacturer announced its new N81 music - playing phone .
The N81 can hold up to 2,000 songs and sports an iPod - like wheel , FM radio and a 2.8-inch screen .
Sony Price :
Unannounced Sony 's latest attempt is the button - free "" Rolly "" , which will be in shops later this year .
But the Japanese giant has so far failed to revive the successful Walkman brand , and last week announced that it was closing its online music store , Connect .
Creative Price : £ 280 Heavy - duty player pitched at those thinking of switching from the iPod .
It has a 4.3-inch screen and can hold 7,500 songs or 40 hours of video .
iRiver Price : £ 179
A brand popular among the technologically savvy , iRiver 's flagship product is the Clix .
It is not the cheapest option , but has plenty of fans .
LG Price : £ 139
T54 hopes to cash in on the popularity of LG 's mobile phones .
Has a touch - screen display and video capability , with room for up to 2,000 music tracks or 11 hours of video .
Expected to arrive later this year ."
2007-09-06,"Steve Jobs 's email inbox must have been red - hot .
And he must read very fast .
And having seen how narked early iPhone buyers are about seeing their $ 599 purchase cut in price by $ 200 , he 's acted quickly to try to calm them .
But , you know , in life stuff happens .
Here 's the text of the letter posted on his site and sent to all registered users : To all iPhone customers : I have received hundreds of emails from iPhone customers who are upset about Apple dropping the price of iPhone by $ 200 two months after it went on sale .
After reading every one of these emails , I have some observations and conclusions .
First , I am sure that we are making the correct decision to lower the price of the 8 GB iPhone from $ 599 to $ 399 , and that now is the right time to do it .
iPhone is a breakthrough product , and we have the chance to ' go for it ' this holiday season .
iPhone is so far ahead of the competition , and now it will be affordable by even more customers .
It benefits both Apple and every iPhone user to get as many new customers as possible in the iPhone ' tent ' .
We strongly believe the $ 399 price will help us do just that this holiday season .
Second , being in technology for 30 + years I can attest to the fact that the technology road is bumpy .
There is always change and improvement , and there is always someone who bought a product before a particular cutoff date and misses the new price or the new operating system or the new whatever .
This is life in the technology lane .
If you always wait for the next price cut or to buy the new improved model , you 'll never buy any technology product because there is always something better and less expensive on the horizon .
The good news is that if you buy products from companies that support them well , like Apple tries to do , you will receive years of useful and satisfying service from them even as newer models are introduced .
Third , even though we are making the right decision to lower the price of iPhone , and even though the technology road is bumpy , we need to do a better job taking care of our early iPhone customers as we aggressively go after new ones with a lower price .
Our early customers trusted us , and we must live up to that trust with our actions in moments like these .
Therefore , we have decided to offer every iPhone customer who purchased an iPhone from either Apple or AT&amp;T , and who is not receiving a rebate or any other consideration , a $ 100 store credit towards the purchase of any product at an Apple Retail Store or the Apple Online Store .
Details are still being worked out and will be posted on Apple 's website next week .
Stay tuned .
We want to do the right thing for our valued iPhone customers .
We apologize for disappointing some of you , and we are doing our best to live up to your high expectations of Apple .
Steve Jobs , Apple CEO Is it just me , or is it kinda spooky how he calls it "" iPhone "" , not "" the iPhone "" .
Maybe to the people in Apple the product names are a generic noun , like "" clothing "" ?
"" Clothing is a breakthrough product .. we are making the right decision to lower the price of clothing ... ""
Yup , that must be the mindset ."
2007-09-06,"On the day Luciano Pavarotti died in Modena , Steve Jobs launched his "" iPod touch "" in California .
When a singer dies , a light goes out in heaven , but Apple has ways of keeping its reflection burning .
Pavarotti 's fans may no longer swim , with Shelley , "" upon the liquid waves of thy sweet singing "" , but they can sit in Starbucks and download him from iTunes .
And his record company can still make money .
Or can it ?
Two themes have dominated the entertainment business this summer .
One is the collapsing profits on recordings , the other the extraordinary revival of live performance .
Companies such as EMI and Warner have seen CD sales plummet by 23 % this year , in the face of a rise in far less profitable downloads , pirating and file - sharing .
The same applies to other art forms available on the web .
Any teenager worth his salt can summon The Bourne Ultimatum out of the ether .
The essence of the web is that it is open .
Producers may erect subscription walls , paid - for downloads and other ways of charging for their work .
But whatever is digitised is vulnerable to the nerd in the attic .
As the Chinese and Russians have shown by testing "" e - wars "" on their enemies , and ID card hackers will show in time , there is no such thing as a secure online computer .
It is a contradiction in terms .
This technology has reduced the marginal cost of communicating to zero .
Why buy a CD or a DVD when you can download for nothing - at least if you log off fast enough ?
Who needs to see and hear opera stars in person when their notes are hanging in the air , awaiting only an iPod touch ?
Every year some e - novation ensures wider access , better quality and vaster library back - up .
I have reached the point where I prefer to play CDs because it limits the agony of choice .
By squeezing the communication gap between artist and audience , the internet has drastically cut costs .
The concept of the "" long tail "" - selling less of more in any given market - has reduced the need for economies of scale .
This makes it easier for artists to reach and satisfy minorities without the need for intermediaries such as record labels , film distributors or television companies .
( We have yet to see whether the same applies to newspapers . )
Whereas once broadcasting enabled nation to speak unto nation , it now enables niche to speak unto niche .
This is ostensibly liberating .
Markets shrink and multiply and audiences can be better targeted .
But as costs dive , so does income .
The protection of copyright is undermined and the artist suffers alongside the corporation .
As David Bowie famously said in 2002 , music would soon be "" like running water and electricity "" , available cheap and everywhere .
Once the song has left the singer it is , to all intents and purposes , free as air .
On what , then , will the singer live ?
Pavarotti was the answer .
We wanted him in person and would pay fantastic sums to hear him .
This year we - or some people - wanted Barbra Streisand in person , along with Genesis , the Stones , Spinal Tap and the Who .
Streisand , at £ 100-£800 , could out - charge any opera singer and sell out in 20 minutes .
Tickets for the Stones cost £ 150-£495 , and their recent worldwide tour grossed more than any in history , an estimated £ 220 m .
The Police have been induced to reform , and similar rumours surround Led Zeppelin and even the Spice Girls .
The preferred City perk is now a rock concert ticket rather than a Glyndebourne box .
This is not just a revival of a nostalgia genre .
Demand for live concerts overall is rising by some 10 % a year .
As the music critic Robert Sandall points out in the latest edition of Prospect magazine , you could buy Madonna 's entire recorded output "" for less than half what it cost to see her perform at Wembley Arena "" .
Prince makes no bones about it .
Once he toured to promote his albums ; now he gives away albums to promote his tours .
An artist 's percentage share of a concert ticket can be four times the royalty on a CD .
Nor is this phenomenon confined to concerts - though they are bidding to outdo football in stadium revenues .
Where weekend festivals were once the preserve of hippies and trespassers , they are now an established industry .
The basic ticket to Glastonbury this year was £ 145 , yet 137,000 sold in less than two hours .
There are now some 450 music festivals , supplementing more sober arts and literary events .
No self - respecting municipality is without its annual parade of trilling sopranos , aspiring quartets and authors in search of sales .
While few of these events make money , their popularity suggests a suppressed demand for live entertainment .
Edinburgh , the world 's biggest arts festival , broke all records this year with 1.7 m tickets for the fringe alone .
London 's refurbished dome , O2 , has 150 concerts already booked .
Just as the invention of photography was said to spell the death of painting , so the advent of cinemas , television and records was said to mean the death of live events .
Artists would perform only to cameras and microphones .
The internet in turn was predicted to supplant cinemas , television and records , not to mention bookshops , newspapers and all forms of print on paper .
Swathes of middle men would disappear , as did coachmen with the coming of the train .
It has not been so .
The internet has lowered start - up costs and eased market penetration .
It has aided book sales .
Rather than replacing live performance , it has promoted it .
In his iconoclastic history of science , The Shock of the Old , David Edgerton warned readers not to confuse changes in technological opportunity with changes in human needs .
The internet can not force us to change what we want .
For all the glittering array of micro - technology , most of us still rise , dress , eat , work and play with much the same requirements as we did half a century ago .
Electronic technology has made it easier and cheaper to acquire a better quality of life .
But what we want to do with it is remarkably constant .
E - topia has altered the means but offered no new message .
I find it deeply encouraging that live performance can command ever - rising prices .
It shows a yearning for the real over the secondhand .
From Glastonbury to Edinburgh , from Hay to Wembley , Britons are escaping their screens to spend the value released by the internet on something that electronics can never replace : human contact and the personal services that contact involves , such as holidays , travel , restaurants , clubs and festivals .
After days spent gazing into the depths of cyberspace , my brain wants relief .
It does not find it in another screen at home , alone or with headphones clapped over the ears .
Humans are social animals and crave society .
The popularity of YouTube and MySpace is not as substitutes for social contact but as ways of finding it .
Similarly , live performance offers not just the thrill of the real but the opportunity to congregate with like - minded people .
The internet has not suppressed demand for "" old - fashioned "" cultural experiences but liberated it and aided those ready to meet it .
The message of this summer is that technology may propose but people will still dispose .

2007-09-07,"Apple CEO Steve Jobs apologised and offered $ 100 ( £ 50 ) credits to customers who shelled out $ 599 for the most advanced model of the iPhone this summer , only to have the company unexpectedly slash the price $ 200 in a push to boost holiday sales .
In a letter on the company 's website , Mr Jobs acknowledged that Apple disappointed some of its customers by cutting the price of the iPhone 's 8-gigabyte model in the US and said he has received hundreds of emails complaining about the price cut .
But he added that "" the technology road is bumpy "" and there will always be people who pay top dollar for the latest electronics but get angry later when the price drops .
"" This is life in the technology lane , "" Mr Jobs said .
He said Apple will hand out $ 100 credits for Apple 's retail and online stores to any iPhone owners who are not eligible for a rebate under the company 's refund policy .
The policy covers those who bought their phones within 14 days of the price cut .
An Apple spokeswoman said the company did not have an estimate of how much the credits would cost the company .
For many of the iPhones early adopters , money is not and never was an issue , however .
They were after the gratification of knowing they were among the first owners of something that was cool , even revolutionary .
"" If they told me at the outset the iPhone would be $ 200 cheaper the next day , I would have thought about it for a second - and still bought it , "" said Andrew Brin , a 47-year - old addiction therapist in Los Angeles .
"" It was $ 600 and that was the price I was willing to pay for it . ""
Enjoying that period of being among the first - before the prices drop and reach the masses - is part of the pleasure ,
Mr Brin and others say .
And in much of the tech world , the usual expectation is that six months will pass before there is a major price cut and a year before a next generation of the product - usually an improved version - appears .
"" It 's better than a dog , if you want to meet people , "" Mr Brin said of his iPhone .
Immediately after the iPhone price cut was announced on Wednesday , Mr Jobs ' tone was less conciliatory .
He tartly rebuffed criticism about whether some of Apple 's most die - hard fans would be miffed by the company 's latest actions .
IPhone owners who bought their device that morning
, he said an interview with USA Today , "" should go back to where they bought it and talk to them .
If they bought it a month ago , well , that 's what happens in technology . ""
He then apparently had a change of mind .
The company is making the right decision by lowering the iPhone price , he said in his letter yesterday , but needs to "" do the right thing for our valued iPhone customers "" .
"" ( We ) need to do a better job taking care of our early iPhone customers as we aggressively go after new ones with a lower price , "" he said .
"" Our early customers trusted us , and we must live up to that trust with our actions in moments like these . """
2007-09-11,"Brian Briggs has a funny post at BB Spot , taking off Steve Jobs 's "" Whoops , sorry you feel screwed , have a $ 100 voucher "" .
The story says : People interested in the refund will need to bring in an original receipt showing they bought the Lisa in 1983 and proof of purchase from the Apple Lisa box .
Sales figures from that year show that if all people who bought the computer claim the refund , Apple could be liable for almost $ 70,000 ."
2007-09-17,"Mobile operator O2 is preparing to unveil Apple 's much anticipated iPhone in the UK tomorrow .
But serious questions are being raised in the City about how much ground it has had to give away to Apple in order to clinch the deal .
The UK 's largest mobile operator came from behind at the last minute to seal an agreement with Steve Jobs , Apple 's chief executive , to market the iPhone in the UK , but one other operator described the deal as "" madly money - losing "" .
O2 is understood to have agreed a margin on the retail price - to be confirmed tomorrow - but will return to Apple as much as 40 % of any revenues it makes from customers ' use of the device .
The price of the combined phone and iPod can be changed by Apple at any time , as happened recently in the US .
Out of O2 's share also comes a commission and further revenue share with Carphone Warehouse , which is understood to have secured the right to be the sole independent retailer of the device on behalf of O2 .
Carphone appears to have been drafted in because of Apple 's fears that O2 did not have a big enough presence in the UK even with its sizeable store portfolio which was enlarged by last year 's acquisition of The Link stores .
The rush to secure an exclusive iPhone deal has also been called into question by the arrival of the iPod Touch device , which does everything the iPhone does except make phone calls .
This was not expected by any of the operators involved in negotiations with Apple over the phone .
The current generation iPhone can not receive music from the iTunes store over the air and is expected to appeal mostly to existing iPod users who want to upgrade their device and have been "" wowed "" by the touch screen on the iPhone .
The iPod Touch , however , has that touch screen and twice the capacity of the iPhone .
It can also connect to the internet using short - range Wi - Fi technology .
Throughout discussions over marketing the iPhone in Europe , Apple has played off the UK 's four main networks - O2 , Orange , T - Mobile and Vodafone - against each other .
All of them , at one stage , believed they had an exclusive deal for the British market .
As a result , many mobile phone company executives are unimpressed with the way the Californian computer group has conducted businesses this side of the Atlantic , although similar tactics were used in the US .
Vodafone is understood to have dropped out of the race relatively early as Apple pursued a "" divide and conquer "" strategy and decided against having just one operator stock the phone across the three initial territories of France , Germany and the UK .
The plan is believed to have switched to T - Mobile providing the device in Germany , which will be confirmed on Wednesday , and Orange in France , to be announced on Thursday .
In the UK , the idea initially was for both operators to share the device because the British market is much more fragmented than in either continental country .
Orange and T - Mobile are understood to have signed contracts and at least one had Apple employees helping to implement the device on their networks .
But at the 11th hour O2 snatched the UK deal with an offer that gave such a high proportion of revenues to Apple that none of its competitors could see any way of making any return on the phone , even over three years .
They believed that even if it was treated as purely a loss - leading marketing product , a better return could be had by spending the money elsewhere .
The iPhone contract was apparently signed after Mr Jobs received a visit from César Alierta , the boss of Telefonica , which bought O2 more than two years ago .
O2 will also have to spend a considerable amount of money installing the Edge technology which the iPhone needs to operate on its network , in the run - up to the device 's launch this year .
Neither O2 , Orange , T - Mobile nor Vodafone would comment .
During the long - running negotiations over the iPhone , all signed non - disclosure agreements .
· The following clarification was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Wednesday September 26 2007 .
We said that the iPod Touch device does everything that the iPhone does except make phone calls ; it does n't take photographs either ."
2007-09-18,"The Apple chief executive , Steve Jobs , today confirmed that the company 's much - hyped mobile handset , the iPhone , will go on sale to British customers in November .
At a press conference held at the company 's flagship London store , Mr Jobs announced that the iPhone - a mobile with built - in iPod and internet capabilities - would be available for £ 269 , plus the cost of a contract .
He also confirmed , as expected , that the sole operator in the UK will be O2 .
"" We 're coming to the UK and we wanted to pick the best carrier for the iPhone , "" Mr Jobs told assembled journalists .
"" We were fortunate that we could talk to all of them .
Today we 're announcing that we 're going with O2 and we 're really excited about it . ""
The handset will be available on a number of tariffs from O2 , starting for £ 35 per month and including unlimited internet access .
It will be on sale in O2 and Apple stores as well as through independent retailer Carphone Warehouse .
The 18-month contracts will also include free access to more than 7,000 Wi - Fi hotspots around Britain operated by The Cloud . ""
For customers it 's an 18-month deal , and there 's a fair usage policy on the unlimited internet access , "" said Matthew Key , the chief executive of O2 in the UK .
But Mr Key added that very few users would manage to break the terms and conditions .
"" You need to be using more than 1,400 internet pages per day to break that , "" he said .
The iPhone first went on sale in America in July for between $ 499 ( £ 250 ) and $ 599 , and two weeks ago Apple slashed the prices to $ 399 ( £ 197 ) before tax .
Mr Jobs said he could not guarantee that further price cuts would not happen , but reassured potential buyers that they would be getting the best value for their money .
O2 is believed to have signed an agreement passing as much as 40 % of all revenues from the iPhone to Apple , a high price for victory over other mobile networks .
But fans hoping that the European iPhone would be an enhanced version of the American model , in order to make use of the continent 's higher - speed third generation mobile networks , were disappointed .
The UK iPhone operates only on the 2.5 generation EDGE system , like its US counterpart .
Critics have said that European customers will demand 3 G access on their handsets in order to use higher - speed internet browsing .
However , Mr Jobs said the company had decided against incorporating 3 G because it drained battery life . ""
The 3 G chipsets work well apart from power .
They 're real power hogs .
Most phones now have battery lives of two to three hours , "" he added .
"" Our phone has eight hours of talktime life .
That 's really important when you start to use the internet and want to use the phone to listen to music .
We 've got to see the battery lives for 3 G get back up into the five - plus hour range .
Hopefully we 'll see that late next year . """
2007-09-19,"September has been a momentous month for Carphone Warehouse .
On Monday it will join the hallowed ranks of the FTSE 100 - the top echelon of British business - and by way of celebration co - founder Charles Dunstone spent yesterday in the company of Apple boss Steve Jobs , as his high street chain was named as the sole independent outlet that will stock this year 's must - have gadget , the iPhone , on behalf of O2 .
No sooner had the ranks of technology journalists left the launch event at Apple 's leading London store than Carphone Warehouse 's American joint venture partner , Best Buy , gave Dunstone a resounding vote of confidence .
The group has spent $ 183 m ( £ 92 m ) to acquire a near 3 % stake in his firm .
From its 1989 beginnings in a faceless mansion block off London 's Marylebone Road with £ 6,000 of Dunstone 's savings , Carphone Warehouse has become Europe 's largest independent retailer of mobile phones and the UK 's third largest provider of broadband internet access , with more than 2.4 million customers .
For the 42-year - old Dunstone it has been a meteroric rise .
Leaving his public school - Uppingham in Rutland - with a clutch of poor A - level grades , he spent his gap year working in a computer firm in Cambridge .
He always seems to have had entrepreneurial flair .
At school he sold cigarette lighters and pens to the other students , employing fellow student Johnny Vaughan .
Having got a taste for commerce in Cambridge , he declined his place on a business degree course and ended up at NEC who moved him from selling computers to mobile phones .
Initially irritated by the decision he quickly realised how popular they were becoming and the idea of Carphone Warehouse was born .
He drafted in fellow Uppingham alumnus David "" Rosso "" Ross - who remains non - executive deputy chairman - and set up shop in London .
In the early days he was advised by Ernest Saunders after bumping into the daughter of the disgraced former Guinness boss on a skiing holiday .
It took four years to grow Carphone from the first store to 20 .
Now the company opens one every working day across 11 markets including the US and sells more than 13 million phones a year .
Revenues in that first year were £ 1.2 m - mainly because the price of the early brick - like mobile phones was upwards of £ 800 .
Last year Carphone Warehouse made nearly £ 4bn .
"" I know everyone likes to have humble stories but genuinely we had no possible idea it would get this big , "" admits the genial Dunstone .
"" I can remember nail - biting moments when we were thinking how are we going to make the payroll next week -
but we always found a way .
"" It has not - to use a term from one of workaholic Dunstone 's few hobbies , yachting - been plain sailing .
And now , as the company looks forward to the appearance of the major pension funds and top - notch investors on its share register that come with a place at the City 's highest table , there may be storm clouds on the horizon .
Needing to cut costs as their core European markets become saturated - with everyone already owning a phone - the mobile phone operators are increasingly looking to deal directly with customers .
Carphone Warehouse 's first ever customer - Vodafone - has already taken its contract business to rival Phones4U. O2 has stayed fiercely loyal to Dunstone .
That relationship undoubtedly gave him an edge in the fight to stock the iPhone , a gadget he believes will shake - up the mobile market when it goes on sale on November 9 .
"" It 's an amazing product and Apple uniquely have a way of being able to change markets for ever , "" he said .
"" For us and O2 not only is it an amazing business opportunity but fantastic for our brands to play a part in it . ""
Meanwhile competition in the broadband and home telephony market , which Carphone Warehouse did so much to shake - up with the launch of the TalkTalk brand in February 2003 , and its "" free "" broadband offer three years later , is becoming ever fiercer .
While there has been consolidation - not least with Carphone Warehouse buying out One .
Tel , Tele2 and AOL to give itself scale - new entrants have emerged .
In the past year Vodafone has joined Orange in offering residential broadband to its customers while O2 will follow suit next month .
Sky , from a standing start a year ago , has already snatched well over 700,000 broadband users .
After Carphone 's rocky start in broadband , when its call centre and website were overwhelmed by demand , and the bad publicity , the key is what happens next month when those first TalkTalk "" free "" broadband customers are released from their 18-month contracts .
As for the stores , Dunstone wants them to become a one - stop shop for the multimedia home of the future .
He has even imported the Geek Squad from America , a band of socially adept techies who will visit a customer 's home to get them rolling on the digital superhighway .
The move begs the question how impartial can the advice be from a company that also supplies broadband .
O2 boss Peter Erskine admits that while the outward appearance of Dunstone and his team is affable , they obviously drive a hard bargain .
"" You do n't get to be as successful as they are by being a soft touch , "" he said .
"" And once they agree something , by God do they deliver . ""
Carphone Warehouse has also been able to adapt to changes in one of the fastest moving markets in the world , sometimes leaving the City to play catch up .
When Carphone listed back in July 2000 , traders balked at the £ 1.6bn valuation on what they thought was a pure retail play and when the shares floated at 200p they sank over the following months .
In fact Carphone commanded a higher valuation because of the substantial recurring revenue stream it generates by being paid a slice of ongoing revenues by operators on to whose networks it places contract customers .
Slowdown
Sensing a slowdown in the mobile market in early 2002 , the business started looking for new sources of recurring revenues and brought former Orange boss Hans Snook on board as chairman for help and advice .
The following February TalkTalk was born and the market has never been the same since .
And these are markets that Dunstone still clearly loves with almost boyish enthusiasm . ""
The mobile phone marketplace , even though it is maturing , keeps changing - we have the iPhone coming for instance .
We are now right in the centre of a new , fast growing pioneering marketplace and truth be told no one really knows where it is going to go and where it will end up .
That 's fun . ""
But he remains characteristically understated about the fact that success in this market has elevated Carphone Warehouse into the FTSE 100 .
"" It sneaked up on me actually so I have not got any great plans to celebrate but I 'll have a glass of wine .
Until it happened I had not realised the significance of it .
"" It can not have escaped him now .
Sharing a birthday Other brands born in 1989 Miss Sixty The denim specialist Energie and the Sixty company were established in 1989 , and Miss Sixty - the Italian high street label associated with fashionable 20-somethings - was launched in 1991 .
Since then Miss Sixty has opened 380 stores worldwide and last year added a hotel in Riccione , Italy , to its long list of businesses .
Cobra Shortly after finishing university and £ 20,000 in debt , Karan Bilimori , then a 24-year - old Cambridge graduate , launched Cobra because he found British beer too gassy to accompany Indian food .
Cobra now has a retail turnover of £ 126 m and is sold in 6,000 bars , pubs and clubs in the UK .

2007-09-20,"The Apple computer boss Steve Jobs has been subpoenaed to give evidence about his role in a scandal over the manipulation of stock options , which has prompted the prosecution of two of his former senior lieutenants .
Reports in the US yesterday suggested that the Securities and Exchange Commission has demanded a deposition from Mr Jobs , who is regarded as the inspiration behind the iPod , the iMac and the iPhone .
The news sent Apple 's shares down 1 % to $ 139 in early trading on Nasdaq today .
Followers of Apple fear that if Mr Jobs himself becomes the target of regulatory action , his position could be in jeopardy .
Apple did not respond to requests for comment .
But the newswire service Bloomberg , citing two sources , said the subpoena required Mr Jobs to give evidence against Apple 's former general counsel , Nancy Heinen .
The SEC has accused Ms Heinen of creating fake minutes for an imaginary board meeting in 2001 as part of a fraudulent scheme to suggest that share options were legitimately approved on the most lucrative possible dates for executives .
Beneficiaries of the options included Mr Jobs , who has apologised to shareholders .
He maintains he was personally unaware of the implications of backdating and he was cleared by a special committee headed by former US vice - president Al Gore .
However , Apple 's former chief financial officer , Fred Anderson , who has paid $ 3.5 m in fines and reimbursement to settle with regulators , has since claimed he warned Mr Jobs about backdating .
Apple is one of more than 100 American companies , largely in Silicon Valley , facing investigations over the abuse of stock options at the height of the dotcom boom .
Despite the scandal , Apple has been a stockmarket favourite - its shares have soared by 95 % over the past year on booming sales of iPods and iPhones .
It emerged this week that the iPhone has proved so popular that Apple is almost doubling production in the final quarter of the year from a planned 1.54 m to 2.7 m phones .
The colourful touch - screen devices are due to go on sale in the UK in November .
Investors expressed deep unease about corporate governance , however , at Apple 's annual meeting in May.
An analysis by Silicon Valley 's San Jose Mercury News revealed that 38 of the top 50 mutual funds in Apple voted against the company 's management on at least one issue - and 18 voted against the re - election of at least two directors .
At the time , Mr Jobs emphasised that Apple had co - operated fully with the SEC , which opted not to bring charges against the company .
"" Unless you think there 's a conspiracy with the SEC , I do n't know what to say , "" he told dissenters ."
2007-09-20,"Away from all the foofaraw of the iPhone 's launch on Tuesday , I began wondering about an Apple product that - breaking the company 's usual omertà about "" forthcoming products "" - has been pre - announced for absolutely ages , and shown off more than once , yet which people are barely talking about .
The product is Leopard , the next release of Apple 's OS X operating system .
Steve Jobs showed some of Leopard off in summer 2006 .
And then he showed it off again in June , at Apple 's Worldwide Developer 's Conference .
( We found the latter a bit underwhelming . )
I doubt even the average Mac fan could name more than one or two of Leopard 's new features .
There 's its "" Time Machine "" backup feature , and the "" Spaces "" system that lets you create multiple simultaneous work areas .
After that , off the top of my head , err ...
So why are n't people more excited ?
It 's very different from the buzz ahead of the launch of the present version , Tiger , at the end of April 2005 .
People were excited about the Spotlight search facility , the Dashboard widgets system , Smart Folders to create dynamic views of files or emails , and RSS detection built into the Safari web browser .
And now ?
Peoples ' reactions could so far be summed up as "" meh "" .
Partly because Apple has - unlike Microsoft with Vista - kept the development cycle tightly private ; partly because we 've seen it demonstrated for so long
that we have become distracted by newer , shinier toys .
Anyone want an iPhone ?
But I think too that operating systems are sooo last century .
The interesting stuff is happening on the web : mapping , social networking , mashups .
What of those can you do on a machine alone ?
What of those actually demands regular backups or multiple desktops ?
Increasingly , we let our email live on our computer and in the "" cloud "" , so we have a backup online or offline .
Documents exist in more than one place - usually with the person who sent them , and the receiver .
( And often on both 's webmail . )
Look at the lack of excitement over Vista .
Dell had to re - introduce an option to include XP rather than Vista on new PCs because so many people shunned it .
A year after its completion , people still mutter about device drivers not being ready .
The graphics twiddles add nothing to its usability .
Like sweets , the initial buzz is superseded by a gnawing hunger for something substantial .
But this week 's ruling in favour of the European Commission implies that building too much into an OS puts Microsoft at risk of huge fines and being forced to reveal valuable interoperability codes .
How much simpler just to build a less complex operating system whose core elements are speed , security and stability , and strip extra functionality off into applications that you add as free downloads or access via a browser .
But going down that track would doom Microsoft .
Who would pay to "" upgrade "" to an OS with less apparent functionality than its predecessor ?
You might as well install Linux , which fits the model of the stripped - down function with add - ons for everything .
So despite the incredible pain that Vista caused Microsoft - years late , wildly expensive , still not wildly popular - the company has no choice but to keep baking more stuff into it .
And that means Apple , too , is tied into trying to come up with smarter things to add in to OS X - even if they 're really just pure eye candy .
Its salvation is that it makes most of its money from selling hardware , not software .
So that lack of excitement about Leopard ?
It 's because we do n't need it . ·

2007-10-01,"Kara Swisher at All Things D appears to be dutifully plotting Yahoo 's 100-day turnaround period day by day , and Fridays ' crisis meeting was no exception .
Apple chief executive Steve Jobs appeared to inspire the 300-odd senior Yahoos on how to turn the company around ( he knows a thing or two about turning round under - performing companies ) along with "" touchy - feely "" group exercises , some objective setting and candid admissions from senior executives that Yahoo 's corporate culture is lacking something .

2007-10-18,"In January 2004 when Steve Jobs unveiled a new program called GarageBand , the newest member of Apple 's iLife family of consumer - level media programs , he called it "" a major new pro music tool ... for everyone "" - a loop - based recording suite that "" turns your Mac into a pro - quality musical instrument and complete recording studio "" .
The technical press preferred to call the event a "" snoozeathon "" ; one commentator dubbed the program "" Garagebland "" , and even Mac sites called GarageBand 's 25-minute introduction "" the longest demo on Earth "" .
But for musicians it was big news .
Engineered with the same technology as Logic Pro - the high - end recording suite
Apple inherited after its purchase of German company Emagic in 2002 - and preinstalled on to every new Mac , the software enabled users to mix 64 tracks , record live performances , use 1,000 prerecorded loops and export the fruits of their labours directly into iTunes .
Jobs was adamant that this was no niche market proposition .
In fact , according to Apple , GarageBand encapsulates the company 's long - term goals : to democratise the use of technology and to take creative tasks that were difficult or expensive and make them accessible and easy to use for everyone .
And with 5.6 m Macs shipped last year alone , this "" free "" program has made a significant impression on the music world .
In the 1990s , Apple machines gained huge traction among musicians for their support of MIDI , used to control synthesisers - and that explains too why professional musicians were among the first to adopt the iPod .
But Windows - based machines caught up , and by the time Jobs introduced GarageBand , were snapping at Apple 's heels .
So Apple needed a strategy to get people to buy its machines .
And if that meant a cut - down version of its pro software - why not ?
It certainly seems to have worked . ""
When I started out in the early 80s you had to become a runner in a studio and then work up from there , "" says Dave ' Deptford ' Pine , head of Point Blank music college , whose CV includes work with The Smiths , Massive Attack and Leftfield .
"" That was your only chance .
Now , if you buy a Mac , then out of the box you 've got the opportunity to have a taste of music production or video editing . ""
Explosion of software Using the program is simple enough : having chosen from hundreds of "" loops "" ( perhaps a 4/4 or 3/4 or 5/4 sample of a drum kit ) , you drop it on a track and then drag it along that track to make it play as long as you like .
More instruments ( guitars , orchestral , percussive ) can be chosen , effects ( flange , phase , distortion and more ) added , volumes and stereo positions tweaked , and your own input - instrument or voice - added .
Et voila .
"" I think GarageBand is absolutely fantastic , "" adds Mike Hillier , a writer at Music Tech magazine and engineer at London 's Metropolis Studios .
"" I speak to people who are doing really low - budget recordings all the time .
You go out and see any band now
and they 've got a demo CD , or a CD they made for a couple of quid , and it 's because of the explosion of software like GarageBand . ""
Genres such as techno or grime owe their very existence to specific pieces of technology - whether the Roland TR-808 drum machine , Fruity Loops ( now FL Studio ) or even MTV 's Music Generator game for the PlayStation .
However , combine the availability of entry - level recording apps with the ability to share and distribute music - whether instantaneously posting to a MySpace page , or selling it via a digital retailer - and things get really interesting .
This double whammy , claims Christian Ward of LastFM , is the basis for some seismic changes .
"" People looking for the next revolution in music are actually looking in the wrong place , "" says Ward , who recently launched the Now Form A Band campaign , encouraging budding creators to tap into punk 's DIY spirit and use free or open source software such as Luna Free , Ardour or Kristal Audio Engine .
"" The revolution is the internet .
It does n't matter if the music itself is not groundbreaking - the next revolution is how it 's actually recorded and distributed . ""
A host of established artists - such as Courtney Love , Limp Bizkit , Panic !
At The Disco and Scout Niblett - have used GarageBand to just plug in and sing straight into a Mac 's inbuilt microphone to record instant demos .
Meanwhile , Nine Inch Nails and Erasure have both issued singles as GarageBand files , letting fans remix and mash up original master tracks .
This summer , Rihanna 's chart - topping Umbrella used one of its drum loops ( specifically , Vintage Funk Kit 03 ) to great effect .
But is a wave of GarageBand - enabled artists following suit and storming the Top 40 ?
Well , no , not really .
Kate Nash did use it to record her debut single - although not , according to producer Paul Epworth , her debut album - before signing a major label contract , but examples of others are few and far between .
Flexible friend
One artist championing the benefits of GarageBand is George Pringle .
Already building a significant online buzz , Pringle 's forthcoming single , Carte Postale , was recorded solely on her Mac .
Taking her love affair to more excessive levels , she has also taken to scrawling "" GarageBand Until I Die "" on her body .
"" I think you can parallel it a bit to the time before punk , when there was loads of proggy shit , "" she says .
"" Then you got a whole bunch of people who should n't be musicians , but who were coming out with really great ideas .
If people keep using home software like they are , it could become much more vocal and interesting and diverse . ""
For free software , she says , GarageBand is also surprisingly flexible .
"" You can put it through an amp emulator , you can change the preset sounds , you turn your voice into an instrument , you can plug old beatboxes into it , you can make your own loops .
GarageBand is like an instrument itself - if you know how to use it and play it right , you can make virtually any kind of sound . ""
However , there is no lack of rivals .
In March , Steinberg announced the launch of Sequel - a £ 60 package for PC and Mac offering 5,000 loops and 600 instruments , all compatible with Cubase .
Sony is offering an American Idol version of its ACID software , as well as the £ 50 ACID Music Studio and ACID Xpress - a free , stripped - down version of ACID .
The website ACIDplanet allows users to upload their music and even download free eight - packs of loops .
Similarly , Ableton , Cakewalk ( Sonar ) and FL Studios all offer sub-£100 entry - level recording packages .
This is pretty elementary marketing :
entice mainstream consumers with a easy - to - use version , sell them peripheral add - ons ( such as extra beats or loops ) and then hope that the appetites of the most proficient users are whetted enough to upgrade to the full professional suites .
For all the above , these retail for up to £ 500 .
Leaky strategy Apple has pursued a similar strategy - offering Jam Packs of extra loops for £ 69.99 , and hoping a similar proportion of users will progress to the full - priced experience of Logic Pro 8 ( recently slashed in price to £ 319 ) , or its cut - down incarnation Logic Express ( £ 129 ) .
Intriguingly , this latest version of Logic has also been issued without the copy protection of a physical dongle , leading some to speculate that Apple is in effect allowing its software to leak on to file - sharing systems , safe in the knowledge that downloaders will need a Mac to use it . ""
The dongle will actually become the Apple Mac , "" says musician and Logic user Mark De Clive Lowe .
"" It 's a marketing ploy , just like iTunes is a way to sell iPods instead of music .
Make the software free , but if you want to use it , then buy a Mac . ""
In this wider context , and despite the idealism of putting the tools of production in the hands of the masses , it is perhaps little wonder that such high - end packages still dominate the recording market . ""
GarageBand to me is more like a game , "" says Rinse FM station boss Geeneus , who uses Logic Pro for his dubstep / grime productions .
"" It 's like a demo where someone can have a go at making music , mess around and make a song in their spare time .
There 's not much you can do with it , but Apple uses it to lead you into Logic and Soundtrack and all these other programmes .
That 's the trick with this stuff .
Everything 's there to entice you in . """
2007-10-24,"Where does Apple , iconic maker of iPods , iPhones and Mac computers , go from here ?
It can already claim to be the biggest corporate comeback in US business history .
Since Steve Jobs returned to the company he founded in 1996 ( having been ousted in a boardroom coup a decade earlier )
he has transformed it from a basket case into the darling of designers everywhere and now of Wall Street as well .
Its latest results - profits up 67 % in the latest quarter - are credited with raising the level for the rest of the stock market .
The company is now in a dizzy upward spiral , with rising sales of iPhones , iPods and Macs having a mutually reinforcing effect on each other .
It has the zeitgeist in its operating system .
But for how much longer ?
Apple will continue to make powerful waves and be a hero to people like me , but on its present strategy it is condemned to being a big fish in a comparatively small pool .
Apple has sold over a million phones since it launched into this new market .
That is a fantastic achievement .
But it is a tiny proportion of the total market of a billion phones a year that is dominated by Nokia , with an incredible 39 % global market share ( and rising ) .
Apple 's strategy of linking up with a sole operator in each country boosts profits but will inevitably constrain its expansion plans , as will its decision to control content within its own "" walled garden "" and not open it up to all comers .
Apple gets all the publicity .
But the world 's biggest manufacturer of MP3 players ( and also cameras ) is Nokia .
And what is Nokia doing next ?
It is about to launch its own rival to iTunes , available to all operators or individuals who want to use it .
I do n't know whether this venture ( controversial with some operators , who rightly fear Nokia is after some of their revenues ) will be successful , but it sure as hell will make some people wonder whether it is worth switching to a brilliantly sassy iPhone which does n't have the extras , such as GPS satellite tracking or high - quality cameras , that Nokia and other manufacturers boast .
And Nokia has a huge customer base from which to launch it .
This will be true especially when the novelty of the iPhone wears off .
I am told that in parts of Silicon Valley , where practically all the geeks have iPhones , it is starting to be smart not to have one .
None of this takes away from Apple 's amazing achievement .
You only have to compare it with Microsoft ( which still has around 95 % of the market for computer operating systems ) , despite Apple 's resuscitation and which nearly snuffed Apple from the face of the earth .
The Redmond monolith is so absorbed in defending its monopoly that it does n't seem to have the time or creativity to do the innovative things Apple does so brilliantly .
It is no sin to be a brilliant success in a smallish pool , but it would be nice to think that Apple could take to the oceans .
Think what a Nokia phone designed by Apple would look like ."

2007-11-29,"First , they became Steve Jobs ' biggest eco - critics .
Now , Greenpeace 's most recent report gives Nintendo
it 's worst score ever ,
0 out of 10 , and does n't have much nice to say about Microsoft of Philips either .
While supportive of the goal of greener tech , some people in the tech community have been critical of Greenpeace 's research calling it ' lazy ' and ' flawed ' .
But there is a way to go green with your gear , especially if you do DIY with your computer .
Read on .
Technorati Tags : environment , Greenpeace
, toxics Greenpeace has been evaluating companies on their use of toxics including vinyl plastics ( PVC ) and brominated flame retardants as well as their take - back programmes .
They have monitored the programmes of mobile phone makers and reduced the score of companies such as Nokia because those programmes are n't as robust as the company says in some markets .
Greenpeace says that it monitors the use of toxics because of the increase in e - waste in countries such as India and China .
But people in technology circles are questioning Greenpeace 's methodology .
John Timmer on Ars Technica took a closer look at how Greenpeace came up with its ratings and found the research wanting .
Timmer questioned whether Greenpeace ranked companies based on analysis of the devices or simply on publicly available corporate information .
The research in general appears lazy .
Nintendo 's failing grade appears to be based entirely on this entry in the corporate FAQ , which briefly summarizes some of the steps the company has taken to protect the environment .
Anything that 's not covered there is simply rated "" No Information . ""
Similarly , all of the information on Microsoft originates from press materials and corporate statements on the company 's web site .
Clearly , Greenpeace did not perform an exhaustive evaluation of chemical use through the manufacturing pipeline .
Overall , Timmer hopes that pressure from Greenpeace encourages companies to recycle and eliminate hazardous chemicals from production but says in the final analysis that it 's hard to take the report as a serious indication of companies ' efforts to become greener .
Joel Johnson on popular tech site Boing Boing had similar mixed feelings about the report :
But Greenpeace 's decision to label Nintendo 's "" Chemicals Management "" score as "" Bad , "" giving no points on their scale , instead of "" Partially Bad , "" seems to be an attempt to single out a popular company to better publicize their report as a whole .
Public shaming is a useful tool , but not at the expense of fairness .
How can you find greener gadgets ?
Personally , I 'm a big fan of the reuse part of the reduce - recycle - reuse maxim .
I use and re - use technology until it 's about fall over .
I buy a lot of old gear on eBay although I tend to stay away from re - furbished hard drives .
You can always go the Freecycle route , or there is a site that will buy your old , dead kit .
Recently , I put an older computer back into service as a home server .
It 's more than adequate for our needs , and if we grow out of it , we can always keep the case and most likely the power supply and simply add a new mother board and processor .
Most people keep their computers just an average of three years , but you can extend the life of your computer in a number of ways .
And I 've found that Linux really gives old equipment a new lease on life .
Greenpeace may not measure power consumption in its raitings , but I think it 's worth considering .
( UPDATE : Martin Lloyd says on the Greenpeace blog that they will be including energy consumption in the next edition of the guide . )
The folks at Extreme Tech took a break from building the fastest computer and tried to build the greenest .
As they point out , a maxed out gaming rig built to run the latest games can consume as much electricity as a refrigerator .
Their tips are : Look for an 80 Plus power supply , which uses only the power it needs instead of running full out all of the time .
Use new SATA hard drives because they use less power than older IDE drives ( and they 're faster )
Unlike a few years ago , the newest processors from Intel and AMD use much less power than previous models , in the case of Intel 's Core processors , 40 % less energy .
The new Core 2 processors only use 3 watts in hibernate .
Use a smaller motherboard like a microATX .
There are lots of options to geek out and be green .
If you 've got green geek tips , let us know in the comments ."
2007-12-01,"Who is the greatest living Englishman ?
It would be hard to argue against the merits of Tim Berners - Lee , the sole begetter and inventor of the world wide web , an organism whose initials , www , have ( in some languages , including our own ) three times more syllables than the phrase they 're abbreviating , which is perhaps the only flaw in Berners - Lee 's grand design .
The story of how he devised the hypertext transfer protocol ( http ) and the entire language and structure of the web on a Steve Jobs NeXt computer at Cern in Switzerland in 1990 has passed into legend , though I would certainly recommend reading his own excellent and highly readable account , Weaving The Web .
Sir Tim remains an idealist , passionately committed to an open , free and wholly public web as he guides the W3 Consortium towards an unknown future from his base at MIT in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
Incidentally , that flaw ...
the unwieldy name and initials , www , came about as a result of the inventor 's extraordinary and entirely endearing modesty .
Originally he had come up with the name The Information Mine , but he found the initials , TIM , embarrassing .
No less egocentric ( especially in French - speaking Switzerland , where he was working ) was another thought , the Mine Of Information , so he settled on good old www .
I had the privilege of meeting the great man recently and he showed me the browser equivalent he is working on at MIT for the new Semantic Web ( another time , another article perhaps ) - an application called The Tabulator .
He had failed to notice that his full initials feature prominently in TaBuLator and it was perhaps wrong of me to point it out , but the squirms of self - deprecation were marvellous to watch .
This is a man who could have taken a hundredth of a cent for every commercial transaction for just five years and been rich beyond computation , he could have linked himself with corporations , put his name about in public , branded himself and offered his opinions on everything and everyone .
Instead , he chooses quietly to work on ways to ensure a future web of even greater openness and neutrality in scientific , intellectual and political exchange .
He is what my grandfather would have called a real mensch .
I remember trying to persuade the then deputy director general of the BBC , John Birt , that the BBC should get hold of the domain bbc.com for web and email purposes .
He had no idea , and I do n't blame him , what I was talking about .
This was about 1993 and only sad acts like me had heard of the internet .
About six months later , however , it was too late and bbc.com had been snapped up by a cable - winding company somewhere and so the ill - fated beeb.com and the good old bbc.co.uk were acquired .
Actually , bbc.com now redirects one 's browser to the mother page ( how much did the corporation have to pay for that , one wonders ? ) which brings me to the gripe with which I will leave you .
How come we British are just about the only nation on earth who have to make the tedious and entirely unnecessary three extra keystrokes every time we type a URL ?
I could be stephen.fr in France , stephen.za in South Africa , stephen.ru in Russia , stephen.nl in Holland , etc , etc , but here ?
Oh no , it 's stephen dot co dot
bloody uk .
How annoying is that ?
All right , not very in the great scheme of things , but nonetheless , who was responsible for getting us trapped into it ?
Did they think the nation was getting an extra fancy couple of initials which would lend a commercial gravitas that might be equivalent to America 's .com ?
Well , they were deluding themselves if that 's what they believed .
All they got was the puzzled contempt of other nations .
Let 's fight for a pure .uk , I say .
The BBC can lead the way by becoming bbc.com now that they 've finally bought the domain .
This could be the campaign that finally unites our apparently fractured and broken society .

2007-12-10,"Steve Jobs , Apple 's chief executive , went all John Lennon recently when he delivered his vision of music industry nirvana . ""
Imagine a world , "" he wrote , "" where every online store sells DRM - free music encoded in open licensable formats .
In such a world , any player can play music purchased from any store , and any store can sell music which is playable on all players . ""
He is not alone .
Retailers have started to plead with the music industry to bin the anti - piracy ( or DRM - digital rights management ) software embedded in digital music files on the grounds it was proving a major irritant for the online music lover .
DRM was conceived as a neat technological and legal solution by the music industry to create an income stream for its products from the notoriously lawless internet , as CD sales plummeted and illegal downloading became epidemic .
But despite being embedded on both sides of the Atlantic ( in the UK , thanks to the Copyright and Related Rights Regulations 2003 ) , it has n't worked out that well .
The various forms of incompatible DRM systems are "" stifling growth and working against the consumer interest "" , complained the Entertainment Retailers Association .
A clear sign of a music industry struggling to come to terms with the digital age was the decision by Radiohead to release their latest album online , DRM - free , bypassing record companies and asking fans to name a price .
And according to research by the International Federation of Phonographic Industry and Jupiter , only one in 20 downloads is actually paid for .
"" Music is a troubled industry , partly as a result of the fact it was late coming to the online market with authorised music , "" says Duncan Calow , a partner at DLA Piper .
"" It has always been assumed that DRM would be the way that the distribution of digital media would play out . ""
Not least , for Apple itself , which has used its own notoriously protectionist DRM system , FairPlay , to secure what is reckoned to be 80 % of online music sales .
Intriguingly , Jobs ' vision of a brave new world coincided with the consumer ombudsman in Norway declaring iTunes "" illegal "" , not to mention pressure from consumer groups in France , Germany and the Netherlands .
The Apple boss "" might have wanted to muddy the waters a bit , "" says Calow .
"" DRM only got the support of governments and regulators in the first place on the basis that the content and technology industries would develop open standards .
Yet so far experience suggests that , with a host of vendors ready to promote competing proprietary solutions , open standards initiatives struggle to sustain market momentum . ""
Public ' unease '
According to Paul Garland , head of intellectual property at Kemp Little LLP , the apparent public unease over the use of DRM stems from two issues . ""
First , there is a continuing misunderstanding of what rights a copyright holder has over their work , "" Garland says , "" and , second , the fact that DRM is seen as preventing or controlling more than merely unauthorised copying . ""
As for the first issue , Garland points out that "" there is still a widespread belief in the UK that , having bought a musical track , the owner should be free to make copies for personal use , make back - up copies or convert it into another format .
""
Not so .
That misunderstanding received attention in the Gowers review of intellectual property which included a proposal to introduce a limited private - copying exception to allow consumers to "" format - shift "" music ( in other words , copying music from a legitimately bought CD to an MP3 player ) .
The House of Commons Culture , Media and Sport Select Committee has since published a report that recommended permitting copying within the home for domestic use .
As for the second issue , DRM is accused of imposing excessive controls .
"" For example , someone who legitimately buys a book or CD is free to give or sell it to someone else without restriction - something prevented by most DRM systems in relation to digital downloads , "" says Garland .
"" There is no limit on the number of times you can read a book or listen to a record .
And building up music collections to pass on to your grandchildren might well be hampered by DRM systems that become obsolete or prevent format shifting .
"" The copyright holder is entitled to place these restrictions on its material , but there is a growing perception , particularly in relation to the music industry , that consumers are being turned away from digital downloading by the embedded DRM systems that come with them . ""
Alexander Ross , a music and technology lawyer with Wiggin LLP , sums up the dilemma for the industry : "" The music industry appreciates that the public generally recoils from DRM .
Nonetheless , it must be able to protect its core product . ""
Recent research shows that for one leading online music store ( 7digital.com ) , DRM - free music outsells DRM music four - to - one .
Even the resolve of major record companies to make copyright protection the industry norm appears to be on the wane with EMI having recently announced that it would remove its software when selling music through iTunes .
And last month , Universal followed suit with classics and jazz music .
Imagine :
DRM may yet prove to have been here today , gone tomorrow ."
2007-12-10,"Gracing Europe with his presence this week is celebrity blogger Robert Scoble - currently dealing with a stream of disgruntled readers after he said there are no serious newspapers in the UK .
Scoble has a well - documented hate - hate relationship with Silicon Valley 's gossip blog Valleywag ( as does the brilliant Fake Steve Jobs ) and was trying to make a point about how it fulfills the role that tabloids fulfill in the UK . ""
Now that I 'm over in London
I get to see the media that Valleywag is patterned after .
Over here they do n't have really serious newspapers .
That 's what the BBC is for , after all .
But every store sells these gossip papers that scream at you with huge type .
They go for the most salacious of topics .
Just like Valleywag does .
After all , if Scoble picks his nose , that 's more interesting than what Oracle announced in a press release this morning , right ?
Heh . ""
He goes on explain how to dupe the site into publishing a dodgy story , but judging by the comments on the post , no - one was really interested in that : J Abrams comment : "" Get over yourself and make your new years resolution about creating something or doing something that would actually make you worth talking about beyond silicon valley circle jerk blogs . ""
Does the US have more "" serious "" newspapers than the UK ?
The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are awesome , but
what national papers beyond that ?
We have the Guardian , the Times , the Telegraph , the FT , the Independent , plus the Sundays and the Scottish papers - is that serious enough for you , Robert ?
That aside , there 's the wider point that gossip blogs and British tabloids might appeal to the same base kind of human instincts , but the tabloids are arguably more influential on mass opinion than the "" serious "" papers anyway .
The Sun , according to last week 's ABCs , sold more each day than the Times , Telegraph , FT , Guardian and Independent combined .
Simon Brocklehurst 's comment : "" There are some subtleties to the British tabloid press that might not be immediately apparent to the casual observer .
Do n't be mislead by the headlines -
they 're just there to draw people in .
The idea of these papers is to attract a mass - readership .
Salacious headlines work well for that .
Some of the trashiest tabloids , though , employ serious , heavy - weight political journalists ; journalists that are incredibly well - networked , right to the top - level of government .
The aim , then , is to attract a wide - readership , and use that to : manipulate government ; and manipulate public opinion ...
all to suit the political and social agendas of the newspaper 's owners .
It works .
There is n't a politician in the UK that is n't terrified of upsetting The Sun newspaper , or The News Of The World . ""
Not sure Nick Denton is * quite * that powerful , or if he has the same kind of hidden agenda that some British rags do ... ""

2007-12-18,"No , not the primaries !
The real contest is for Time magazine 's Person of the Year , who will be revealed tomorrow .
Making the short list : Al Gore , Steve Jobs , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Condoleezza Rice , Hu Jintao , David Petraeus , Vladimir Putin , and JK Rowling .
It 's a packed field , with Rowling and Gore currently leading an online survey of Time readers .
But in this year of hard - boiled politics , expect a politician to stand out .
Gore , Rice and Ahmadinejad were all short - listed last year , so any of them could be due for a make - up call .
But Rice has largely withdrawn from the world stage this year , and that NIE report stole all the thunder that a vote for Ahmadinejad would bring .
The safe money 's on Gore .
( Of course , if you insist on focusing on those upcoming primaries , we all remember who won in 2001 . )"
2007-12-23,"Fake Steve Jobs , who writes The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs , appears to have stepped out of character with a post that says : "" I 'm weighing an offer from Apple "" .
He says : Bottom line is I 've received an overture from the Mothership with a mention of a Think Secret type settlement if I 'll stop impersonating Dear Leader on the Web .
Nothing nailed down at this point but frankly , honestly , I 'm tempted to just take it .
The carrot was , however , followed by a stick .
Apple 's "" Rambo attorney "" says he "" feels it is his duty to inform me that Apple 's lawyers have identified at least three posts in my archive that they ' deem to be actionable ' , "" and that "" before I turn this into a public fight by continuing on my current ' course of action ' I should perhaps consider the potentially serious consequences to myself and my family of doing so . ""
And then , I swear to friggin God , there 's a list of my assets with an estimated value for each
and I suppose the implied threat that I stand to lose them .
Which kinda scares the living shit out of me , to be honest , since they 've got a pretty thorough list , which means they 've been doing some research on this and the offer did n't just come out of thin air .
Their lists includes my home address , most recent assessed value of my house and all the information about my mortgage ; a rental property that we own ; my bank accounts and investment accounts , including the college funds for our kids , whose names are used ; and our boat and two cars .
However , in the latest update at the time of writing , FSJ says I 'm feeling a little bit better now .
His lawyer "" was able to find out what the three supposedly ' actionable ' items are , and they 're ridiculous "" .
The problem is deciding whether any of this is true .
It 's entirely believable that Apple would do this .
It could also be Fake Steve 's most daring spoof yet , prompted by Apple closing down the Think Secret blog .
Indeed , FSJ had already riffed on the idea of the EFF "" working on a worldwide program aimed at helping other bloggers obtain similar cash - for - silence settlements "" .
Since the "" real "" FSJ , Daniel Lyons , works for Forbes , you 'd expect one of his colleagues to pick up a true story pretty quickly , even without a tip , and report it .
So far , nothing ....
If it is a spoof , could it backfire ?
The Secret Diary is obviously satirical .
Most readers seem to have been taking the threat seriously .
How many will consider this sort of litigation is n't really a joking matter ?
Anyhoo , for the latest updates to the story on FSJ 's blog , see FSJ shutdown drama .
Epilogue : On the FSJ blog , terry said ... to those who write that we should have known it was a joke
, there 's a point THEY are missing : what FSJ wrote was so close to the truth as to BE genuine .
That 's both what confused people and what made it brilliant satire : it reminded many , many readers that Apple 's image allows what FSJ reported to be believable or on the cusp .
We had to wonder , might apple really have done that ?
And by wondering , we get an insight into how apple operates , or how we think it does ."
2008-01-07,"While the iPhone was certainly not the best spec'd mobile of 2007 , it did have that touch of Apple magic that made it the most lusted - after device of the year .
And it 's the phone to beat for the rest of the world 's mobile handset manufacturers .
One year after Apple chief executive Steve Jobs announced the iPhone at MacWorld , Wired picks out a few rivals that have had a year to size up the best way of competing - Samsung 's F700 and the LG Voyager - and there are plenty more new models being unveiled at CES .
Here 's a few : Nokia Nokia has previewed an 8 GB version of the much - anticipated N95 for North America ; this has ditched the radio included in the European version and has a slightly larger screen ( 2.8 "" compared to 2.6 "" - but who 's counting ? ) .
Engadget points out that the memory card slot was sacrificed for the 8 GB hard drive .
RRP in the US is $ 749 , so that 's a fair chunk under the £ 499 RRP in the UK .
But then we expect that .
There 's also a red N95 , if you are so inclined .
Nokia 's N95 8 GB for North America .

Sony Ericsson was demonstrating the new Z555 ( pronounced "" sheesh "" , possibly ) in silver and black , which has an OLED , 1.3 megapixel camera ; the ultra - thin W350 walkman phone ( just 0.3 "" thick but with 512 MB storage , 1.3 megapixel camera and FM radio ) ; and the W760 - HSDPA web connection , GPS , 3 megapixel camera and video capability .

On the Motorola stand , there 's the Z10 banana slider - designed , as Engadget says , "" to satisfy our insatiable banana phone needs "" .
The ROKR E8 has no 3 G data capability but has tried to do something fancy with a 270-degree navigation wheel and was launched officially as Motorola 's killer musicphone .
LG This LG handset might raise a chuckle ; it 's a handset that wants to inspire people to watch TV on their mobiles .
It 's DVB - H based but only compatible with the ATSC broadcast standard in the US .
That means it can pick up existing TV signals without modification ( oops - was that a tunnel ? )
but also that this handset wo n't work in the UK .
As Ian Morris on CNet points out , it 's not inconceivable that someone will try launching a mobile TV service in the UK using that old analogue spectrum .
But hopefully with some slightly more elegant handsets .

2008-01-09,"Ever since Steve Jobs opened the iTunes Store in Europe ( or Yoorp , as it 's better known to many Americans ) in June 2004 , people - and organisations such as Which ? - have been complaining about the fact that a track which cost 79p in the UK cost € .99 - which was almost always less than 79p .
( And still is , just , as the pound sinks . )
Which ? complained to the Office of Fair Trading about the disparity , and with customary alacrity the OFT referred the matter to the European Commission .
Which grinds slowly , but exceedingly small .
It has threatened Apple with fines ( while also making grumbly noises about interoperability between iTunes Store - bought tracks and other digital music players , which seems like less fertile ground ) .
Interestingly , at the same time as this news , the EC is to drop an antitrust case it was trying to build against Apple and record companies such as Sony BMG , EMI , Warner Music and Vivendi over allegations of unfair pricing and distribution of online music .
From the story : The commission 's investigation centered on European consumers being charged differing amounts , and having access to different iTunes songs , depending on their location .
Both Apple and the record companies were under investigation , though the spotlight was on the record companies for imposing these sales arrangements on the technology company , refusing it pan - European licenses .
Fancy that .
Anyway , Apple now says that within six months it will lower UK prices to standardise prices around Europe .
Well , to be precise , the record labels will lower the price they charge it .
From the press release : [ Apple ] will lower the prices it charges for music on its UK iTunes Store to match the already standardised pricing on iTunes across Europe in Austria , Belgium , Denmark , Germany , Finland , France , Greece , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , Norway , Portugal , Sweden , Switzerland and Spain .
Great , you say .
Apple currently must pay some record labels more to distribute their music in the UK than it pays them to distribute the same music elsewhere in Europe .
Apple will reconsider its continuing relationship in the UK with any record label that does not lower its wholesale prices in the UK to the pan - European level within six months .
Ah .
The iron fist behind the velvet glove .
Talking of which ..
"" This is an important step towards a pan - European marketplace for music , "" said Steve Jobs , Apple 's CEO .
"" We hope every major record label will take a pan - European view of pricing . ""
Note the wording , such as the use of "" major "" :
does that mean that any independents which do n't fall into line ( and who make up about 50 % of music sales in the UK , unlike the US where they have a smaller share ) will get booted off iTunes ?
It 's a victory , of sorts , for consumers , and sort - of for Apple , but it 's going to leave some UK record execs feeling rather bitter , I suspect , at a time when they 're already having enough shakeups - such as that at EMI yesterday ."

16 GB iPhone .

Daniel Jalkut
Some flavour of the much - rumoured subcompact notebook , a stunning new downloadable video rental service and possibly some hints about the forthcoming iPhone / Touch software developer kit ( SDK ) .
Michael Gartenberg

An iTunes Store that enables [ video ] rentals .
I doubt we 'll see any significant software .
Wil Shipley I 'm most excited by the prospect of a possible Apple tablet , but I 'm not sure there 's a market for such a thing beyond über - nerds like me .
I 'd be surprised if they actually did , because the worldwide market for Windows tablets has been confined to Microsoft marketing people .
Gus Mueller Something with a touchscreen .

What has been the smartest and dumbest thing Apple has done in the past year ?
CVR Smartest : the iPhone .
Great piece of hardware , awesome introduction and marketing .
Dumbest : underestimating developer interest in the iPhone and mishandling that demand .
DS Smartest : lowering the price of the iPhone .
It needed to be done .
Dumbest : bricking the iPhone , because it brought such high - profile negative press .
ME Smartest : negotiating revenue sharing from the cell companies for each iPhone contract .
Brilliant .
Dumbest : negotiating revenue sharing , because trying to keep an iron grip on the iPhone 's functionality and software is very customer - hostile .
DJ Smartest : how it has been firing on all cylinders with the Mac
, the iPhone and iPod is all representative of a very smart strategy .
Dumbest : no comment .
MG Smartest : a combination of strong products , strong marketing message , strong retail experience and a strong attention to small details .
Dumbest : the iPhone price cut .
Apple did n't seem to notice that part of the [ iPhone ] buyers were very non - traditional early adopters who were not used to seeing prices fall .
AE
Smartest : announcing a true SDK for iPhone development .
Dumbest : bricking iPhones was pretty darn stupid .
WS Smartest : announcing the iPhone SDK - reversing their closed position .
Third - party applications and games for the iPhone are going to make it the most ubiquitous device in the universe .
Dumbest : trying to sell Ajax as the original iPhone SDK at the Worldwide Developer Conference ( WWDC ) in June .
GM Smartest : the iPhone , no question about it .
Dumbest : the "" Sweet iPhone SDK "" announced at WWDC .
Trying to pull that one on the smartest folks in the Mac developer ecosystem was insane .
Who will be Apple 's most dangerous competitors in the coming two years ?
CVR Amazon :
because the music labels are still looking for someone they can back to reduce their dependence on Apple in the music world , and the video side does n't want to hand Apple the keys the way the music people did .
DS Apple , while not competition to itself , is always its own worst enemy .
DJ As companies like Amazon and Netflix move into the same digital sales areas as Apple , they will be a formidable threat because they seem to be establishing better relationships with media companies .
MG
Those it needs to fear the least are those consortiums that are being created out of a common dislike of Apple .
The enemy of my enemy is my friend is not a business strategy .
AE Google wants to make itself ubiquitous , and projects like Android ( the cellphone platform ) show that at some point Google will want more control over the devices that access its services .
WS Apple 's biggest weakness will be within - trying to manage its growth while still keeping a maverick spirit .
GM Microsoft .
I look forward to the day they pull their head out of their ass , cut out a bunch of fat and ship a real OS .
What would be the best acquisition Apple could make in the next year ?
CVR Adobe .
It would give Apple more control over some core applications that help drive the platform in key market segments ( Photoshop ! ) , plus bring in some interesting new technologies .
A really wild option might be to do something like buy Nintendo .
Or Sony .
ME TiVo .
Apple could completely dominate the television experience ... from providing content to making it accessible in the ways people really want .
DJ Adobe .
If Apple had firm control over Adobe 's applications , it would counterbalance Microsoft 's control over Office .
AE A major recording studio , as a way of splintering the music industry 's attitudes toward pricing and DRM .
GM Besides my company ( for $ 2bn ) , probably some embedded technology .
Think forward to January 2010 .
What do you think will be the biggest difference from Apple right now ?
CVR
I think they 're going to do something about as different as the iPod was from Mac OS X and iPhone was from iPod .
More aggressive in the move into owning the living room .
ME Small touchscreen devices optimised for mobile professionals , automotive systems , home entertainment and control - challenge the prevailing mediocrity .
DJ They will continue to evolve in the public 's perception , appearing more as a general consumer electronics company , and less as a "" computer "" company .
WS I believe the iPhone will be in everyone 's pocket .
It will destroy the Blackberry , and Palm will be a distant memory .
GM I think the Apple Store will be renamed "" The iPod Store "" .
Steve Jobs will have some more grey hairs .
When do you think the next version of Mac OS X will debut ?
CVR Macworld next year .
Figure 18-month cycles now , more or less .
DJ I would guess around two to three years , so let 's say August , 2010 .
MG
I expect we 'll hear something about it no later than this year 's WWDC .
AE October 2009 ; Apple would have hit about 24 months but for the iPhone last time .
WS If we were starting a betting pool on the shipping date of 10.6 , I 'd bet May of 2009 .
GM I 'm notorious at being wrong - but I think it will ship in November of 2009 .
We 'll get a glimpse of it at WWDC .
When and why do you think Steve Jobs will cease to be chief executive ?
CVR
Barring some health problem , I think Steve will be around at least another five years .
I do n't think he 'll go out on his shield , but he 's in no hurry .
DS
By July 2010 , I think Steve will have lost interest .
ME
I believe he 'll keep doing it until he does n't love it as much , and he has a team in place that he believes can lead Apple to even greater heights .
So far , those conditions are not met .
I 'd guess he 'll stay another five years .
DJ I think barring a major change of heart by the board , Steve Jobs will remain for many years to come .
I do n't think he has a better vehicle for following through on his visions , so he has no reason to leave .
MG
As long as he wishes .
I suspect there are still a few things Steve would like to do before he retires .
AE
I ca n't see him stepping down unless there were some health - related reason .
WS It will take an act of God to get him out of office .

I continue to think the Mini is done - but I expect to see a refresh of the Apple TV that both adds significant functionality and moves it into the space the Mini used to own .
There are rumours that Apple will support it and ship readers for Blu - ray .
If they do , that 's the death of HD - DVD , and finally this format war will be effectively over .
And if anyone can market it to consumers as to why they should care , Apple can .
Biggest news will be in the iTunes area , with rentals .
About time ...
Extra bonus points for it to also be a front end for NetFlix , but I 'm not holding out too much hope ( but it 'd honestly make sense for both sides to do that , and the timing of Netflix 's announcements in this space make me wonder if there 's more to their story than just the Set top box ... we 'll see . )
I keep thinking there 's one new piece of software coming out
nobody knows about yet .
iTunes / rentals and new MacBooks and the ultra - portable is a pretty good keynote , but I wonder what the "" one more thing "" is this year ...
I wonder if you 'll see Apple - branded solutions that tie into Time Machine - RAID disks ?
SAN ?
Network server ?
How about an Airport update to go with 10.5.2 to restore backups to an airport disc ?
David Sobotta : I think we will see a laptop update from Apple .
I believe it will be in the MacBook line .
I also suspect it will be Apple 's first laptop without a hard drive .
I do not think it will be an ultra portable .
I doubt that is a large enough market segment for Apple .
Mike Evangelist :
It 's definitely time for new laptops .
A sub - notebook or dramatically slimmer full - size notebook seems most likely to me .
A new Apple TV , probably in conjunction with a much improved movie download ( and/or rental ) system for iTunes .
A network storage system designed for home users - to make it easier to store all the music and video that Apple hopes to sell us , and also enable Time Machine backups for everyone in the house .
16 GB iPhone .
An update to Leopard to smooth out some of its many rough edges .
Daniel Jalkut : I do n't like to speculate too much , since I 'm always wrong !
I pretty much follow the rumours and my ears perk up when I hear something that sounds interesting .
What I 'm hoping for is some flavour of the much - rumoured subcompact notebook , a stunning new downloadable video rental service , and possibly some hints about the forthcoming iPhone / Touch software developer kit .
Michael Gartenberg :
If history is a guide , whatever it is people think Apple will introduce will be wrong .
Because the important things are all in the details : even when folks are right , they 're still wrong .
Adam Engst : In terms of hardware , I do think we 'll see some sort of new portable Mac , or possibly a tablet that has more in common with an iPhone than a Mac ( in other words - a targeted - purpose device that can be extended but does n't rely on a desktop metaphor ) .
I 'd love to see something along those lines that could serve as a better video - viewing device and as a lightweight e - book reader .
We might also see a new Xserve ; that box has n't been updated in a long time .
[ It was updated the day after Engst replied - Ed . ]
Another likely possibility is the second - generation iPhone , with 3 G networking , an improved camera , and videoconferencing .
And lastly , I would n't be surprised to see a second - generation Apple TV with some new functionality .
In terms of services , it 's entirely possible there will be a change to the iTunes Store that enables rentals .
Personally , I think that 's fairly boring ; more interesting would be a subscription service for music , but Apple has resisted that for a long time , and I see no reason they 'd change now .
Wil Shipley : Of the rumours I 've heard , I 'm most excited by the prospect of a possible Apple tablet , just because it sounds like it 'd be so cool , but I 'm not sure there 's a market for such a thing beyond über - nerds like me .
Gus Mueller : It 's really , really hard to predict what Apple will do .
I 'm sure I 'll look like a fool for even trying .
Hardware : something with a touch screen .
Smaller than a laptop but bigger than an iPhone , running some whacked out , stripped down version of OSX .
Probably using new low - power processors from Intel . "" iPad "" .
They 've got the tech , it would make a splash - and they are probably willing to experiment again on something ( like the Apple TV ) .
Software :
Not too much - maybe an update to Aperture .
I could see a general announcement about taking the OS in a general "" lean and mean "" direction now that it 's finding its way on smaller devices .
Plus , they are so ahead of Microsoft at this point ; it would be cool to step back and clean things up .
Services :
A free version of .Mac -
"" .Mac Lite "" or something along those lines .
John Gruber :
Rumours are running strong that they 're set to introduce a dramatically thin sub - notebook .
I certainly hope they do ; it 's been a glaring omission from their line - up ever since they dropped the 12-inch PowerBook G4 .
Judging from press reports , movie rentals from the iTunes Store seem like a foregone conclusion .
Again , in terms of pent - up demand , this strikes me as obvious , too .
Most movies are n't worth watching more than once , and everyone knows it .
That 's why rentals have been so popular for VHS and DVD .
What do you think Apple * wo n't * announce ( but others think it will ) at Macworld ?
CVR : any hardware between the pro tower and the laptop .
The day of the desktop is dying , Apple wo n't keep pushing hardware into that space , instead , you 're more likely to see them introduce something ( like the duo / dock ) to make desktops even less interesting .
I do n't think we 'll see iLife or iWork changes .
ME : 3 G iPhone .
Although Apple has been known to disregard the feelings of early adopters , I think it would be a big mistake to introduce any significant upgrades to the iPhone so soon after its introduction in Europe .
( unless there was an appealing trade - up offer ) .
AE :
I doubt we 'll see any significant software , given the recent updates to Mac OS X , iLife , and iWork .
I pay relatively little attention to rumor sites , so I do n't really know what others have speculated about .
WS : I guess I 'd be surprised if they actually * did * announce a tablet , because the worldwide market for Windows tablets have been confined to Microsoft marketing people .
( True story : I once spotted at Microsoft spy at WWDC because she was using a Windows tablet - I had her ejected . )
GM : I think a "" Media Rental Service "" is out of the question , along with an entry level iPhone .
Most of the predictions I 've seen are pretty obvious - faster machines for instance .
Duh .
What has been the smartest thing Apple has done in the past year , and why ?
CVR : The iPhone .
Great piece of hardware , awesome introduction and marketing .
DS : Lowering the price of the iPhone .
It needed to be done .
ME :
Negotiating revenue sharing from the cell companies for each iPhone contract .
Ongoing revenue from their products is something that has largely eluded Apple in the past .
It 's brilliant .
DJ : I think the way Apple has been firing on all cylinders with the Mac , the iPhone , and the iPod is all representative of a very smart strategy .
They 're expanding on the "" halo effect "" which was first speculated about , and has since apparently been confirmed .
Anecdotally , I am noticing more and more people who were previously unfamiliar with Apple products , gradually adding their computers and other devices to their lives .
MG :
No one thing , that 's what 's important .
It was a combination of strong products , strong marketing message , strong retail experience that made things work for Apple in 07 .
A combination of factors and a strong attention to small details .
AE :
Announcing that it would release a true SDK for iPhone development .
The iPhone is interesting not just for the way it changes the cellphone world , but also because of the way it shows OS X running on a wildly popular consumer electronics device ( the Apple TV also runs OS X , but has n't done much ) .
WS : Announcing the iPhone SDK - reversing their closed position .
The third - party applications and games for the iPhone are going to make it the most ubiquitous device in the universe .
GM : The iPhone , no question about it .
It 's an amazing device , it really changes things .
At least it did for me -
I no longer hate waiting in lines !
I 'll just surf or catch up on email .
JG :
Introducing the iPhone as just two models , 4 and 8 GB , and then quickly dropping the less popular 4 GB one .
It was an enormous product launch , promotionally , but for just one model of one device , when it comes down to it .
And that paid off for them .
What has been the dumbest thing Apple has done in the past year , and why ?
CVR :
Underestimating developer interest in the iPhone , and mishandling that demand .
I think they took a while to get the message straight here and ruffled a bunch of feathers .
Also pushing the first iPhone update too quickly and not doing enough QA .
Overall , though , quality 's been pretty good on all of the products .
DS : Bricking the iPhone , because it brought such high profile negative press .
ME :
Negotiating revenue sharing from the cell companies for each iPhone contract .
These contracts put Apple in the nasty position of limiting what customers can do with their own phones , in order to protect the revenue .
Trying to keep an iron grip on the iPhone 's functionality and software is very customer - hostile ; and I believe this will continue with the introduction of the SDK .
I expect there will be roadblocks to creating some of the applications that people want the most ( iChat , VOIP , Bluetooth data link to a laptop , to name a few ) .
DJ :
No comment .
MG :
Apple misjudged who was buying the iPhone early on and did n't seem to notice that part of the buyers were very non - traditional early adopters who were not used to seeing prices fall .
To their credit , Apple reacted quickly to the issue .
AE :
Bricking iPhones was pretty darn stupid , and Apple 's initial negativity about opening the iPhone to development was n't a good thing .
I was also unimpressed with the Apple TV ; Apple could have made it into a truly interesting device with more TiVo - like capabilities .
WS : Trying to sell AJAX as the original iPhone SDK .
If we wanted to program web apps we 'd do it for Windows computers , duh .
GM : From a developer standpoint - the "" Sweet iPhone SDK "" that was announced at WWDC .
This is the "" just write web apps for Safari / iPhone "" debacle .
Trying to pull that one on a room full of the smartest folks in the mac developer ecosystem , that was an insane idea .
It really lowered the perceived savvy of Apple from a developer perspective .
Every developer knows it takes time to make a stable SDK - so just say so .
We 'll wait , but do n't throw web apps at us .
JG :
Waiting so long to announce that Leopard would be delayed from June to October .
They knew it , internally , at least as far back as a year ago , and if they 'd announced it sooner , it would have gone over better .
( Pretty hard to come up with something "" dumb
"" they did this year , though . )
Who do you think will be Apple 's most dangerous competitors in the coming two years , and why ?
CVR : Amazon : because the music labels are still looking for someone they can back to reduce their dependence on Apple in the music world , and the video side does n't want to hand Apple the keys the way the music people did ( a big reason why video growth has been slower than some expected ) - and Amazon has the operation to actually take Apple on in both spaces and make things interesting .
I 'm not sure anyone else does .
I do n't see anyone taking on Apple in computers -
it 's still the slow shift of people moving from Windows .
Ditto iPod , because of the integration and ease of use .
But iPhone is still vulnerable , if someone can figure out what the next iPhone is going to do and get out there around the same time with something close .
( I 'd love to see Apple move into less expensive phones , too , but we 'll see ) .
I think at some point Apple 's going to make a play for unlocked phones and open networks and try to push the US to the European model of the market - that 'll make it the enemy of the cell companies , who want walled gardens .
This might be an interesting place for Apple and Google to work together , or perhaps Google will go up against Apple .
Watching the upcoming spectrum auction with great interest here .
DS : Apple , while not competition to itself , is always its own worst enemy .
DJ : I think Apple is in pretty good shape for the computer , cell phone , and music player markets .
Where I think Apple will face the stiffest competition is in the iTunes department , where so much of their success hinges on cooperation from major media companies .
It looks like Apple is sort of dropping the ball as far as keeping their partners happy is concerned .
I 'm not suggesting that the partners were entitled to everything they were asking for , but as companies like Amazon and Netflix move into the same digital sales areas as Apple , I think they will be a formidable threat because they seem to be establishing better relationships with media companies .
MG :
It seems everyone is gunning for Apple to some degree or another .
Those it needs to fear the least are those consortiums that are being created out of common dislike of Apple .
The enemy of my enemy is my friend is not a business strategy .
AE :
If I were Apple , I 'd worry most about Google , because as much as the two companies often work together in small ways and Eric Schmidt is on Apple 's board , I think they 're destined to collide .
Google wants to make itself ubiquitous , and projects like Android ( the cell phone platform ) show that at some point Google will want more control over the devices used to access Google services .
And although the two companies seem alike in some ways , at their hearts , I think they 're quite different
- Google uses the shotgun approach , trying numerous services to see what works ( even when they are n't very good to start ) , whereas Apple very carefully prepares a small number of products that offer best - of - class user experience .
WS : Apple 's biggest weakness will be within - trying to manage their growth and while still keeping a maverick spirit , and still making sure that each thing they create is a work of art .
GM : This is going to sound silly to some folks - but I think it 's Microsoft .
I look forward to the day they pull their head out of their ass , cut out a bunch of fat , and ship a real OS .
Maybe two years is too short a time frame for that - but who knows what they have in some sort of skunkworks project .
They need to break things like Apple did with the OS9 to OS X switch .
And I really hope they do because Apple could use some real competition in that arena .
JG :
I have to say I 'm coming up with a blank on this one .
What would be the best acquisition Apple could make in the next year , and why ?
CVR :
The more likely one is Apple buying Adobe .
It would give Apple more control over some core applications that help drive the Macintosh platform in key market segments ( Photoshop ! ) , plus bring in some interesting new technologies .
I 'm actually surprised in a way this has n't happened already .
I 've always felt there was a good match , and that Apple needed better control over Photoshop and how it 's managed on the Mac platform .
Either that , or build a replacement .
But here 's the deal I 'd like to see .
There 's been rumbling on the blogosphere about how Microsoft ought to buy Yahoo .
Imagine , instead , if Apple bought Yahoo .
A really wild option might be to do something like buy Nintendo .
Or Sony .
ME : TiVo , without a doubt .
Combined with what they have already begun with iTunes and Apple TV , Apple could completely dominate the television experience ... from providing content to making it accessible in the ways people really want .
Also Harmony ( remote controls ) -
Although Harmony has generally come closest to making a programmable remote control that 's actually useful , Apple could take it all the way .
And the technology would make it easier to integrate things like Apple TVs into existing systems .
DJ : I have been saying for years that Apple should acquire Adobe .
Most of my friends laugh and think it sounds ridiculous , but I think it would be a perfect combination .
One of the things Microsoft has held Apple on a short leash with over the years has been the Office suite , and the lingering threat that Microsoft might withdraw support for these applications on the Mac .
If Apple had a firm control over the future of Adobe 's applications , it would serve as a counterbalance to Microsoft 's control over Office , while at the same time securing the future of those important applications for the Mac as well .
MG :
With $ 15 billion in the bank , expect Apple to be eyeing lots of folks .
I would n't speculate publicly who they might be .
AE :
I 've been pondering that for some time , since Apple has billions of dollars in cash right now , more than seems entirely necessary .
My best guess right now is that Apple could be thinking about purchasing a major recording studio as a way of splintering the music industry 's attitudes toward pricing and DRM .
WS : They should purchase Delicious Library and build it into the Apple TV !
Aaaaand give me more stock !
GM : Besides my company ( at a price of 2 billion dollars ) , probably some embedded technology or a group of embedded programmers .
But honestly , I have no idea .
JG :
Maybe a handheld game development studio , to produce some really high quality , addictive games for the iPhone .
I do n't think acquisitions are very important for Apple at this point , though .
Think forward two years , to Apple , January 2010 .
What do you think will be the biggest difference from Apple right now ?
CVR :
I think Apple 's going to move into another new market ; not sure what it is , but they 're going to do something about as different as the iPod was from Mac OS X and iPhone was from iPod .
More aggressive in the move into owning the living room ( but not flatscreen TVs ) .
I 'm hoping for endemic EVDO - a move away from needing DSL or a cable modem to "" internet everywhere "" wireless .
Maybe piss off the cable companies by making a play for wireless home internet , which would make sense if they partner or become a cell phone company with a network to plug everyone into .
And once you do that ...
IP based TV ?
ME :
I see them moving even more to ' application - specific computing devices ' and away from traditional general - purpose computers .
Hardware that is highly optimised for certain functions , like listening to music , watching movies , mobile communications , and so on .
iPods , Apple TVs , iPhones are the beginning , but there 's more to come .
Small touch - screen devices optimised for mobile professionals , automotive systems , home entertainment and control are all areas where Apple could challenge the prevailing mediocrity .
DJ : I think the big difference is they will continue to evolve in the public 's perception , appearing more as a general consumer electronics company , and less as a "" computer "" company .
I think this could have some positive effects .
If they continue to hit home runs with products , the halo effect could continue to bring in new customers for them .
But there 's also a risk that as the focus of the company gets spread thin , they will no longer be as effective at hitting those home runs .
MG :
It 's hard to guess two weeks out much less two years .
AE :
I think things will be roughly the same - two years is n't enough time for the industry to shift in truly significant ways .
Apple may have a larger market share , and may have introduced one or more great new products , but it still wo n't be the dominant operating system .
And if my guess is right , we 'll just be seeing the next major Mac OS X update shortly before January 2010 .
WS : I honestly believe the iPhone will be in everyone 's pocket .
It will destroy the Blackberry , and Palm will be a distant memory .
I think this is the device that people have dreamed about for years - the convergence device that allows us to actually have a computer in our pocket .
GM : I think the Apple Store will be renamed to "" The iPod Store "" .
Again , I really have no idea .
Steve Jobs will have some more grey hairs .
JG :
They 'll be selling a range of iPhones , starting at relatively low prices .
The iPhone lineup in 2010 will look like the iPod lineup today .
How important is the Mac computer line to Apple 's future , as the iPod and iPhone generate more of its revenues and profits ?
CVR :
It 's going to continue to be crucial ; Apple will continue to work to be less dependent .
We 're in the early phases of the time when computers stop being a market , and start being an endemic part of the environment we live in - the future is n't the mini , it 's the Apple TV .
But to make Apple TV work , you need iTunes and OS X ; but non - geeks do n't really care , and soon will no longer need to care .
The general consumer wants to buy a box that does something , not an OS .
Apple knows this , and the OS will disappear into the box ( but still be around for us old pharts to use and hack ... )
DS : While people often throw away phones every one to two years , people stick with computing platforms .
If Apple were to lose a significant portion of its computer supporters , it would become just another electronic gadget company .
DJ :
Several years ago Apple started talking about the Mac as the centre of the "" digital hub "" , and at that time we had no idea how many devices might ultimately be circling around that hub .
Although they do n't talk about it so much in those terms these days , it 's clear to most people that whatever Apple device you own , it will be enhanced by using it in conjunction with a Mac .
I think the Mac will continue to be a high profit component of Apple 's product lineup , and something that maintains Apple 's reputation for a unified user experience .
MG :
Mac is critical to Apple .
The PC is still the core hub for the digital home in Apple 's vision .
Macintosh is strategic and not tactical to their business long term .
AE :
Despite the fact that the Mac does n't generate nearly as much attention in the mainstream press in comparison to the iPod and iPhone , it 's still the core of the company .
The iPod and iPhone are , in many ways , still peripherals for the Mac ( though of course they can also be managed from Windows machines nowadays ) .
What Apple 's doing , of course , is building an ecosystem of devices that all work seamlessly with one another , making the purchase of any one of them an encouragement to use the others .
On that basis , and because of the shared development efforts between the Mac ( with Mac OS X ) and the iPhone ( with OS X ) , it makes no sense for Apple to deprecate Macintosh development efforts .
WS :
The Mac is huge .
As the iPod and iPhone become more advanced devices they will grow closer to the Mac - they will continue to inherit software and technology from the Mac platform .
Already the iPhone and iPod touch use Darwin and Core Animation , and the platforms will only grow closer .
GM :
The Mac is still incredibly important , it 's their bread and butter and what they are really known for .
Besides that , the Mac is really the foundation of Apple .
Even if the iPhone / iPod / iWhatever takes over sales , Apple still needs to make a product that allows their customers to Create Something .
Whether it is music with GarageBand , movies with iMovie / iDVD , or just making great playlists with iTunes - you ca n't forget what the core of Apple is about .
Apple at its best is making it easy for everyone with a Mac to create beautiful things and stamp their personality on new media .
JG :
Actually , in recent quarters , the Mac 's share of Apple 's profit has risen .
That might change again for the holiday quarter , but overall , the Mac is as important to Apple as ever .
It 's the foundation of what let 's them build an entire experience that no other competitor can match .
When do you think the next version of Mac OS X will debut ?
CVR :
MacWorld next year .
Figure 18-month cycles now , more or less .
WWDC this year will probably be more for iPhone development and going deep into Leopard .
DJ : I do n't put too much weight in my prediction , I guess because it does n't overly concern me .
But I see the development time between major releases getting longer and longer as the operating system evolves .
I would guess around 2 - 3 years , so let 's say August , 2010 .
MG :
Again , I do n't get into guessing games but I expect we 'll hear something about it no later than this year 's WWDC . AE : October 2009 ; Apple would have hit about 24 months but for the iPhone last time .
WS : Ooof .
Uh , if we were starting a betting pool on the shipping date of 10.6 , I 'd bet , uh , May of 2009 .
GM : This is of course a guess
and I 'm notorious at being wrong -
but I think it will ship in November of 2009 .
The public will get a glimpse of it at WWDC this summer .
JG :
You mean 10.6 ?
Fall 2009 .
Just a pure guess .
When do you think Steve Jobs will cease to be chief executive at Apple ?
Any reason why ?
( Month / year )
CVR :
Okay , barring some health problem , I think Steve will be around at least another 5 years .
I do n't think he 'll go out on his shield , but he 's in no hurry .
And as long as the company has Tim Cook to handle operational details and Jonathan I ve for design , I 'm not terribly worried about it .
Now , if there 's another health scare , you might see Steve decide to step back , but honestly , this is what makes him buzz , why give it up ?
DS : By July 2010 , I think Steve will have lost interest .
ME :
Steve absolutely loves what he does .
I believe he 'll keep doing it until two things happen : he does n't love it as much , and he has a team in place that he believes can lead Apple to even greater heights .
So far , those conditions are not met .
On the other hand , the recent reminder of his own mortality has got to affect the way Steve looks at the relative importance of such things .
Personally , I 'd guess he 'll stay another five years .
DJ : I think barring a major change of heart by the board , Steve Jobs will remain as CEO at Apple for many years to come .
I do n't think he has a better vehicle for following through on his visions , so he has no reason to leave .
Unless he became distinctly uninterested in shaping the future of consumer electronics , which I do n't anticipate , then he 'll be around for a long , long time .
MG :
Steve will continue as CEO as long he wishes .
I suspect there 's still a few things Steve would like to do before he retires .
AE :
Honestly , I ca n't see him stepping down unless there were some health - related reason .
Running Apple these days has to be hugely satisfying for him because he is actually changing the world , and that 's always been his primary goal .
WS : It will take an act of God to get him out of office .
GM : Beats me .
I ca n't even make a fake guess at this one .
JG :
I do n't think it 's worth the conjecture .
My guess is he 'll be there for the foreseeable future .
Strengths / weaknesses / opportunities / threats is a classic way to analyze a company 's position .
What , do you think , are Apple 's ?
CVR :
Strengths : strong vision , driven by Steve ( for strategy ) and Jonathan I ve ; great technology underpinnings that allow the creation of powerful products ; great operational flexibility and power , so they can actually implement and ship product , but not ship too much or too little .
Inventory control is a key part of their success .
IT infrastructure second to none - very efficient , lean IT infrastructure , but one closely tied to the needs of the business ( how often do you see companies that seem to succeed despite their IT team ?
Not at Apple ) .
The retail part .
To think the pundits saw that as a negative at one point ...
But it also means Apple has a place where product can make it to market without worrying about how third parties believe ( or not ) in it and where Apple can control the image .
Weaknesses : the belief by many that it 's All Steve , and that if something happens to him , Apple is done .
No longer true - Apple has people who can step in , but few believe it yet .
Having said that , Steve tends to make decisions based on what he believes , not necessarily what research indicates .
I can pretty much point to one or two gripes per release that can be pointed back to ""
that 's how Steve wanted it "" , to the disgust of Ars Technica and the geeks ( who are many times right ) .
Apple 's on this great run .
Eventually , it 'll flatten .
Eventually , some product will fizzle or fail .
And then you can expect an excessive backlash .
It HAS to happen .
I 'm just amazed it has n't happened yet .
To some degree , Apple 's very good at this : when the primary message did n't strike a chord , it moves the parade in front of a secondary message that did .
Opportunities : lots of places
Apple can step in and create new markets , or take a chunk of an emerging one .
Endemic internet ( via WLAN , EVDO , etc ) is one .
They 're just starting to transform cell phones and the cellular market , and I do n't think the cell phone companies can prevent it .
Cable Companies and satellite companies might be next ; who needs Comcast or DirecTV or Dish when you have high speed wireless into the house and IP - TV channels coming in ?
Any market that is tied to a walled garden , copper into the house , or proprietary protocols is open to being attacked by a company willing to get IP into the house and build services on top of it .
Windows media centre has n't really made inroads into the living room ; neither has Apple TV yet .
But this one looks to be coming down to Playstation / Wii / Xbox360 and whatever Apple does .
The next two years will define the living room , I think .
I think we 're going to see a big move towards having your life / environment everywhere -
things are moving online , to be there when you want them to be .
Threats :
Apple 's been so successful in some areas ( iTunes / music ) that companies are looking for ways to force competition on them .
Amazon is going to oblige in online video , and it 'll make life interesting .
Microsoft simply is n't a serious competitor any more , either you 're locked in or you are n't , and Vista is n't really showing any traction .
Apple is picking off parts of the market as people figure it out .
Another threat is the hacker crowd .
Apple ca n't depend on being too small for the hackers ; antivirus / antispyware may be an important aspect moving forward , although I think Apple 's philosophy is to build in security instead of trying to wall it out later .
Apple 's a high - pressure place to work ; there are a few key people ( Tim Cook , Jonathan I ve ) they ca n't really afford to lose .
They push their staff hard , but it 's a fine line between that and too hard , and Apple employees tend to be heavily recruited .
A misstep here might cost them a brain drain that will hurt .
So far , they 've avoided it
( I do n't think Jerry Yang will survive 2008 as head of Yahoo - and I think Cook would be the perfect person to fix Yahoo .
I just do n't think you can convince him to leave Apple , but if someone does ? make life interesting ) .
All in all , I 'm pretty bullish on Apple .
The worst I see for the next few years is that maybe they 'll slow down and merely be above average to the industry , instead of the last five years of massive transformation of entire industries ...
hey , everyone needs to stop and take a breather ...
I do n't see much chance of a major downfall , although any flattening of the curve will be over - reacted to by the pundits .
DS : Apple 's biggest weakness right now is continuing to try to do everything without significant additional resources .
Products like the latest iPhoto and iMovie which are arguably lacking in certain respects from previous versions show that Apple does not have enough "" A "" team programmers and a strong enough management team to drive software excellence in both phones and computers .
DJ : Apple 's major strength is its commitment to a superb user experience .
One of the reasons this works really well at Apple is because it 's not just an order that comes down from the top of the management chain
, it 's part of the social culture .
So a good number of Apple employees are continuously reminding and encouraging each other to strive for an ideal user experience .
As Apple continues to expand and spreads its talent across a variety of projects , it will also need to hire more and more new talent .
I think a risk in this growth period is they might bring in new talent faster than they can instill that deep commitment to quality .
What passes for excellence in some parts of the industry , and will pass you with flying colours through an interview process , does not necessarily translate into doing what 's ultimately best for Apple .
I hope that as Apple grows and brings in new talent , it 's able to keep up with the task of communicating to these new employees how important it is to stand by the idealistic pursuits that make Apple so great .
WS : Apple 's strength is that its customers and its employees love what it is trying to accomplish - to make computing devices beautiful and simple .
People have finally realised that checkboxes do n't make software , and that usability is paramount , and Apple 's the only company besides Samsung to really understand this at the deepest level .
Weakness : hubris , just as with any other company .
They continually need to be reminded that they are not the ONLY company , and that they need a vibrant market around them .
Opportunities : will remain the same : steal market share from existing cell phones and Windows machines that people hate .
Apple 's biggest threat would be if it closes off its devices - if the iPhone SDK is only available to large companies , for example , so innovation is stifled .
Already we 've seen the Apple TV flop because it 's a closed device
- I believe it would be a huge success if they had made it possible for customers to easily extend .
If the iPhone or any future platform is closed , it creates an opportunity for a competitor to copy Apple 's ease - of - use AND have an open system , and that will always win in the end .
GM :
Strengths :
It 's a cliché , but Apple only hires top - notch folks .
I know a number of people there , and they are all super smart and creative .
I do n't know a single person who should n't be there .
Weakness :
Their inability to control rumours .
Everyone expects some hot new product to come out and then it does n't , and the stock tanks and the news sources talk about "" disappointment "" .
I 'm not really helping with my predictions , am I ?
Our thanks to all who took part ."
2008-01-14,"The usual excitement ahead of Macworld ; and this time to add to all the fun , there 's been a fake keynote leaked ( though not , it seems , by Fake Steve Jobs , even though he 's going to be at Macworld blogging Real Steve Jobs 's Real - ity Distortion Field ) .
The outline seems to have taken in Pocket - lint and even Steve Rubel , but as Techcrunch points out , it 's missing essential elements such as Microsoft Office 2008 ( d'oh ! ) and any mention of DRM .
( Rubel says So come back tomorrow and then either a ) we 'll talk more about what this all means or b )
ya'll make fun of me for being gullible and believing stuff on Wikipedia
Can we start now , Steve ?
Oh , the Wikipedia page , including criticisms .
( Not that this is a criticism of Wikipedia ; it 's a repository for content , even completely made - up content , at times .
In this case , for a very short time . )
Anyway , for a reminder of the process that goes into a Steve Jobs keynote , refresh yourselves with Behind the magic curtain , by Mike Evangelist , who was for some years in charge of Apple 's DVD - making software :
On the day before showtime , things get much more structured , with at least one and sometimes two complete dress rehearsals .
Any non - Apple presenters in the keynote take part on the second day ( although they can not be in the room while the secret parts - the unveiling of hot ticket hardware such as a new iPod or laptop - are being rehearsed . )
Throughout it all Steve is extremely focused .
While we were in that room , all his energy was directed at making this keynote the perfect embodiment of Apple 's messages .
Steve does n't give up much of his personality even in rehearsals .
He is strictly business , most of the time ."
2008-01-15,"Several of the BBC 's biggest studios have been blacked out and Appleised for the fourth time , giving the assembled press and Apple guests the feeling they are at church - with Apple 's illuminated glowing icons humming at the shrine .
We get 10 minutes hard steamrollering of Apple 's achievements in the past 12 months , courtesy of Pascal Cagni , the head of Apple Europe , and then the screens flick to the throng of delegates pouring into the Moscone Centre in San Francisco .
Was that Sergey Brin
we spotted just then ?
Apple wo n't provide wifi until the keynote has finished ; hence 300 journalists all hammering the 3 G connection to within an inch of its life .
It is , therefore , nigh on impossible to ' live ' blog from here .
But we shall persevere .
We start with another PC vs Mac ad .
PC says 2008 will be a great year : "" What - because you 'll copy everything we did this year ? "" says the Mac guy .
Hearty laughs from the Maccy audience .
And - it 's a black polo - neck !
Whodda thunk it .
There 's something in the air today , he says ...
He will talk about four things .
Time Capsule First , Leopard has sold nearly 5 m copies and Microsoft is now shipping Office for Mac on Intel .
But here 's a new product : Time Capsule .
It 's a wifi - connected hard drive - Airport Extreme , basically - and will be available as 500 GB for $ 299 and 1 TB for $ 499 .
iPhone
The second : it 's about the iPhone .
Apple has sold 4 m iPhones to date , or 20,000 per day on average .
In the first quarter of the year , the iPhone achieved a 19.5 % share of the US smartphone market .
SDK , the developers ' kit , will launch in late February but there are some improvements now and these are free for iPhone users as a software update .
As predicted , Google Maps will now have a locate feature , which calculates the phone 's position by ' triangulating ' between the three closest phone masts .
Apple is working with Google on the triangulation system but also with Skyhook Wireless , who are mapping the world 's mobile hotspots .
Jobs makes it sounds like their technique is more accurate .
The iPhone can now send text messages to multiple recipients , and there 's a web clips feature so that web pages can be bookmarked on the desktop .
iPod Touch users can get a software update that will add the Web Clips tool and others - but have to pay $ 20 .
That was met with a disapproving silence .
iTunes Apple sold its 4 billionth song on iTunes last week .
On Christmas Day , Apple sold 20 million songs in one day - a new one - day record .
TV shows : Apple has sold 125 m , and 7 m movies .
That 's more than anyone else online but not as much as Apple expected , Jobs admitted .
So today - iTunes movie rentals - as predicted .
People do n't want to rent music , he said , but will only want to watch movies a couple of times .
All six major studios - 20th Century Fox , Warner Bros , Sony , Disney , Universal and Paramount are all signed up .
More than 1,000 films will be rolled out by the end of February , viewable on Macs and PCs , and at a cost of $ 2.99 or $ 3.99 for new releases .
Buyers will have 30 days to watch them after downloading , and 24 hours once they start watching .
And films can be transferred across devices half - way through .
Apple TV has been overhauled to be designed around film rental , including HD titles , and access iTunes content as well as YouTube content .
( And with perfect timing , my MacBook battery expires .
I continue shortly ... )
The new MacBook Air Picking up a seemingly weightless manila envelope , Jobs opens it and pulls out a new , ultra - thin laptop .
This is , he says , the world 's thinnest notebook - just 0.76 "" thick .
It 's called the MacBook Air , so
now we know why he was bandying around the phrase ""
There 's something in the air "" earlier .
It has a 13.3 "" screen , 1.6Ghz or 1.8Ghz
Intel processor ; Intel 's CEO coes on stage to say how Apple presented them with the challenge of miniaturising their processor size and they did - by 60 % .
There 's all the usual stuff - camera , a not enormous 80 GB hard drive , backlit full - size keyboard and LED backlit screen .
For £ 1799 .
The MacBook Air webcam and mics .
Tiny .
Green stuff Apple made a rare green gesture at the end .
Jobs said the new MacBook Air has a recyclable aluminium case ( but surely all MacBook Pros have that ? ) , and 50 % less packaging than previous MacBooks .
But then it 's smaller , is n't it ?
For the first time , the display is mercury free and glass arsenic free , and the circuit board was made without BRFs and PVC .
That might make those of us with older Macs wonder exactly what toxins we are carrying around with us each day .
So what do we make of all that ?
•
19:51 update :
Apologies , but there was no wifi until after the speech
( Apple does n't like to encourage live blogs of the keynote , bless them ) , 3 G had ground to a halt and Twitter was down , possibly because too many people tried what I was doing - covering the keynote on it .
Still - thank you to londonruss for filling in and telling us about the new free - to - all iPhone on all networks , iTunes ' DJ - mode for 33 "" vinyl and the new Phil Collins edition MacBook '
I can feel it coming in the air tonight ' , RRP £ 299 .
Yep , thanks for clearing that up ."

It 's that time of year again - the bi - annual MacWorld orgy in San Francisco .
It 's four days of Mac heaven for fan boys , gadget obsessives and will vie with last week 's CES to set the consumer technology trends for 2008 .
The highlight is the keynote speech by Apple 's polo - necked chief executive Steve Jobs , who will deliver an hour - long evangelical to the Apple faithful , complete with whoops of audience joy .
He will reveal the devices and developments Apple wants us to buy into for the next year -
oh , and something else ...
There 's always rampant speculation , and this year the hoaxers surpassed themselves with a ' draft ' of Jobs ' speech on Wikipedia - as we noted on Friday .
Of course if that was the real draft , we 'll never know - Apple 's scriptwriters will have hastily concocted something new .
But if nothing else , it 's a tidy summary of what we can expect from this evening 's keynote announcements : •
the iPhone developer kit , SDK , complete with launch applications and widgets that will sell through the iTunes Store • iPhone to launch in Japan • a new , ultra - thin 13
"" MacBook Pro •
YouTube videos within iTunes TechCrunch said the draft was fake and predicted that film rentals , the Beatles iPod and DRM - free music has to be on the real agenda .
I was particularly intrigued by the mention of Last.fm and Twitter in the ' draft ' , which were given as launch examples of applications and widgets .
Last.fm told me they are not due to announce anything and
Twitter said they thought the draft was fake , although that 's not a denial .
And as MrProject noted on Friday 's post , Twitter co - founder Ev Williams posted a month back that he was testing a secret Twitter client .
Anyway , there are already unofficial applications out there for nobbled iPhones and the SDK is overdue .
Bring it on .

2008-01-15,"A mostly - boring keynote from Steve Jobs got a late lift when he unveiled the ultra - thin and great - looking MacBook Air .
This is tapered like the old Sony Vaio X505 but ends up being even thinner .
It 's also faster and much heavier , but has a bigger screen and a much better price .
The question is , did Wired take the edge off the surprise value ?
Otherwise it was mostly me - too stuff , like wireless backup , and movie rentals via a price - cut Apple TV .
As usual , Ryan Bock blogged it live at Engadget , but making the terrible mistake of changing to reverse order .
This makes it much harder to read .
Jemima Kiss also blogged it from the UK on the Guardian 's PDA blog , but without the pictures ."
2008-01-15,"Apple has already made waves with its iPod , iPhone and trendy desktop computers , but today the company threw out a new challenge to its competitors , unveiling the world 's thinnest laptop and a new movie download system that it hopes will allow it to dominate the TV and movie business .
The secretive Silicon Valley company confirmed the launch of a new lightweight laptop , the $ 1799 Macbook Air , which measures just three quarters of an inch deep – thin enough to fit inside an envelope .
Also in his speech at Macworld in San Francisco , chief executive Steve Jobs said Apple would push to take control of the video industry with movie rentals and launch a revamped Apple TV product to stream films direct to television screens . ""
On iTunes we 've sold 125 million TV shows , and we 've sold 7 million movies –
it 's more than everyone else put together , but it did n't meet our expectations , "" said Jobs .
"" I think we 've got it right this time . ""
"" Significant shift "" in the film industry Until now iTunes customers have only been able to buy movies outright , a business that has not been as successful as Apple 's entry into music .
Apple TV , which allows video to be streamed from a computer to a television screen , has struggled to make an impact – but Jobs predicted that a relaunch of the device would mark a significant shift in the film industry .
"" We 've all tried to figure out how to get movies over the internet and onto the TV – but we 've all missed , no one has succeeded yet , "" he said .
"" We tried with Apple TV , but it 's not what people wanted .
So we 're back with Apple TV
take two –
no computer is required .
You can rent movies directly on your widescreen TV and you can rent them at DVD quality or you can rent then at high - definition quality . ""
Costing $ 229 , the system links into the company 's plans to offer films to rent over the internet through its iTunes store , also confirmed today .
Rumours of the plans had been widely reported in the past week , and the company said it would join with film studios including 20th Century Fox and Sony to allow iTunes users to stream movies live , direct to their computer or TV , for a one - off payment of between $ 3 and $ 5 .
A thousand new titles The system will launch with support from every major Hollywood studio , with a thousand new titles and back - catalogue films available by the end of February .
The service will be launched immediately in the US , and is set to arrive around the world latest this year .
"" We 're dying to get this international as well , "" he added .
It is similar in concept to the TV download services offered by British broadcasters , including the BBC 's iPlayer and Channel 4 's on - demand service , but using Apple 's systems will make downloads watchable on TV , iPods and iPhones .
The excitement surrounding the secretive Silicon Valley company reached a high watermark last year as Jobs unveiled the iPhone , Apple 's entry into the lucrative high - end mobile phone market .
Since it launched in the US and Europe , the touchscreen handset has spawned a minor industry of competitors and copycats .
Jobs said that the iPhone had sold 4 million units already , meaning that it was well on course to hit its target of selling 10 million units by the end of 2008 and had already captured 20 % of the US smartphone market .
Fevered anticipation
The excitement surrounding the iPhone had further increased expectations about today 's announcements , with some Apple fans queuing up overnight to get a place at the event .
Since the success of its trendy iMac and iPod , conceived as fashion items by British designer Jonathan I ve , Apple has been resurgent .
The company 's share price broke through the $ 200 barrier for the first time this week as speculation cranked up ahead of the announcements , and this week 's Macworld show in San Francisco is expected to draw its largest ever number of visitors ."
2008-01-15,"As Charles has pointed out , Apple has released the Air , which the Mac rumour mill got spot on .
In some ways , Steve Jobs delivered .
But is it what the Mac faithful wanted , or do they feel let down ?
No better place to gauge post MacWorld reaction than the blogosphere .
William D. Walsh cries out in desperation ,
"" apple stop making new stuff so quickly ! ""
But despite the obvious technolust , he calls into question Apple 's claim to having released the thinnest notebook .
He says that crown belongs to Sony 's X505 , measuring a svelte .75 inches and released in back in 2003 .
Well , if you do n't like the Air 's $ 1799 price , the X505 set you back $ 2999 in 2003 .
And the X505 received similar reviews to what some have given the Air :
As a result of its sheer smallness , the VAIO X505 skimps on features ; in fact , it barely has the essentials .
The system offers two USB 2.0 ports , a four - pin FireWire port , and a PC Card slot for the 802.11a / b / g Wi - Fi card that Sony includes with the system .
Blogger Bernard Leong ca n't see himself buying an Air and says , "" It 's too expensive for a 1.6 GHz processor computer . ""
And he adds : More features to my preference .
I still like to have a few USB ports , ethernet and firewire port on my laptop , not to mention that optical drive I want to have .
In order to make it so thin , they have sacrificed a lot of peripherals in the process .
Rick McCharles is nonplussed with the quoted 5-hours of battery life , the lack of of a DVD / CD and the price .
He 's holding out for advanced technology that will increase battery life to days , not just hours .
I want a MacBook Air sold state hard drive with 40hrs+ battery life
RIGHT NOW .
Jenn S. in Minnesota in the US overcame her initial desire and balks at the lack of an optical drive and the price .
Follow the arc of technolust
: First thought :
Oooooh
that 's hot .
WANT WANT WANT WANT WANT Second thought , as gear lust dies down :
Um .
But what if I want to burn a CD ?
Third thought :
$ 1800-$3100 ? ?
Does Cupertino realize that people ( i.e. , me ) will not favorably compare their product with real air , which is free ?
Final thought : I am quite happy with my current Macbook
, thank you very much .
People have paid a premium for these supermodel laptops .
You ca n't compare it even with Apple 's Lamborghini line - up .
You have to compare like to like for price , performance and , yes , compromises to see whether the Air is heat on the competition or just hot air .
Look at Lenovo 's ThinkPad X - Series .
A similarly specced X61s with a 1.6Ghz low - power Core 2 Duo with an 80 GB hard - drive , 802.11n and Bluetooth is $ 1349 on sale right now .
Usually , it 's $ 1729 .
The X6 Ultrabase which adds a host of capabilities will set you back an extra $ 199 .
The 8-cell battery will get you 12.5 hours of run - time .
The Vaio SZ , which is close to the Air with a 13.3 inch screen and similar features to the Air , will set you back $ 1399 .
( I 'm keeping everything in dollars just to compare like - to - like and not include the UK technology tax . )
But that includes an optical drive , a DVD - burner in fact .
But this is n't about price , features , gigabytes , ports or benchmarks .
Apple is technolust .
It 's about design , attention to detail and one of the seven deadly sins , envy .

MacBook Air , MacWorld"
2008-01-15,"As a travelling journalist , I sometimes feel sorry for the Apple laptop users who tote around boat anchors , because Apple has never made an ultraportable of the sort that Windows users have been able to buy for more than a decade .
But with the Apple notebook market growing fast , there must now be more than enough users who would queue up to buy a "" thin and light "" Mac laptop , and the rumours suggest Steve Jobs will announce one later today .
Wired Blogs has even mocked it up .
It says : Most people are expecting a conventional sub - notebook -- a super - thin , lightweight laptop that ships without an optical CD / DVD drive .
The MacBook Air may also dispense with a wired Ethernet port , according to rumor .
It will be a purely wireless device , relying solely on Wi - Fi or other wireless technology for its connectivity -- hence the "" Air "" moniker .
But the Air seems more like a ultra portable with a physical keyboard and multi - touch screen , according to our source ( who we promised not to name but confirmed works at an Apple third - party vendor ) .
Having used PCs like the FlyBook , which has a SIM slot , I like the idea of a permanently connected machine , though the Windows PC industry seems to be going for WiMax , to judge by this year 's CES show .
It 's the option that Intel is pushing really hard , and Apple is now an Intel shop .
The other question is : How thin is thin ?
The thinnest Windows PC that I can remember using was the Sony Vaio X505 , more than three years ago .
That was 0.75 inches at its thickest point and 0.3 inches at its thinnest , which will take some beating .
Intel also showed a prototype Metro ( below ) , which was 0.7 inches thick , and had an external ancillary display courtesy of Windows Vista .
A major drawback with ultra - thin machines is that there 's a marked drop in the responsiveness of the keyboard , but Apple has already moved to ultra - thin but mediocre keyboards even where compromise is n't necessary .
I 'm sure it wo n't hesitate when compromise is required .
As for ripping off Nike for the name , it 's a different product category , and I 'd guess Nike would be flattered , rather than upset ."
2008-01-16,"If you 're lucky enough not to have wasted 90 minutes ( or more ) of your life on Steve Jobs 's mostly - tedious Apple sales spiel yesterday , you can get the gist of it in 60 seconds , thanks to Mahalo 's Veronica Belmont .

2008-01-16,"Apple has already made waves with its iPod , iPhone and trendy desktop computers , but last night the company threw out a new challenge to its competitors , the world 's thinnest laptop .
The secretive Silicon Valley company confirmed the launch of the £ 1,199 Macbook Air , which measures just three - quarters of an inch ( 2 cm ) deep - thin enough to fit inside an envelope .
In his Macworld Expo keynote speech , speculation over which has been rife for weeks , chief executive Steve Jobs said Apple would try to take control of the video industry with movie rentals and a revamped Apple TV to stream films direct to television screens .
Until now iTunes customers have been able to buy movies outright , a business which has not been as successful as Apple 's entry into music .

It will start immediately in the US and in other territories later this year .
"" We 're dying to get this international as well , "" Jobs said .
Similar in concept to the the BBC 's iPlayer and Channel 4 's on - demand service , Apple 's systems will make downloads usable on iPods and iPhones as well as television sets ."
2008-01-17,"Apple on Tuesday revamped its attempts to colonise American living rooms , announcing the launch of online movie rentals in standard and high - definition formats and a revamped "" Apple TV "" to play them on which does not require a separate computer .
Steve Jobs , giving the keynote speech at the Macworld event in San Francisco , also unveiled a new ultra - thin notebook , the £ 1,200 "" MacBook Air "" , claiming the crown from Sony of the world 's thinnest computer , and an integrated network hard drive and wireless access point called "" Time Capsule "" which offers the capability to effortlessly back up files .
The facility had been expected , but not was implemented , in the release of the Leopard operating system last October .
A £ 13 paid - for software upgrade for the touchscreen iPod Touch will give it email , mapping , shares , weather and notes applications .
Jobs also announced that the iPhone , launched a year ago but only on sale since June , had already sold a total of 4 m units .
In its first quarter it garnered a 19.5 % share of the US smartphone market , second only to RIM 's BlackBerry , and dwarfing Palm 's 9.8 % . ""
When the December quarter numbers come out , we think we 'll have done even better , "" Jobs said .
The arrival of film rentals had been widely trailed , with leaks appearing in the media last month .
Until now , Apple had only offered films for purchase via its iTunes Store , and Jobs said that while 7 m films had been sold since the service was introduced in September 2006 , "" it did n't meet our expectations , I have to tell you "" .
He said : "" We think there 's a better way to deliver movie content through iTunes .
So today , we 're introducing iTunes Movie Rentals .
"" All six major film studios in the US have signed up to the service , which Apple is clearly aiming at rivals such as Netflix and Amazon 's Unbox service in the US .
On Monday , Netflix , which has 7 m subscribers , announced a $ 9 per month scheme which would let people stream unlimited amounts of films to their TV or PC .
The price for renting new films from Apple and Amazon is the same , at $ 3.99.In the UK , 20th Century Fox and Apple announced a new offering , "" iTunes Digital Copy "" , in which buying a DVD also gives you a digital version in iTunes .
However , the rental service for films does not appear to be available in the UK at present .
Michael Gartenberg of Jupiter Research said that the introduction was "" a really good move ... video rental is a business model that we know works "" .
He added : "" It is n't that Apple has invented something new here , it 's how they 've done it .
Existing efforts have met a lukewarm response .
We 're likely to see something different in terms of consumer response to this . ""
Key to that , he said , was that the Apple TV integrates the flow of TV and film content to homes . ""
The ability to flow content to all the screens that are important to consumers is strategically important to Apple and no doubt , Apple TV is going to go from ' hobby ' [ as Jobs called it last year ] to strategic product in 2008 "" .
Jobs also showed off new versions of the Apple TV , which with a free software update can play back the rented films without a separate computer .
It now has 40 GB or 120 GB hard drives , and Apple dropped the price , which now starts at £ 199 .
But the announcement that left Apple fans salivating was of the MacBook Air , an ultra - thin laptop which dispenses with an optical drive and Ethernet port in favour of wireless connectivity .
It has a single USB port , for which an Ethernet adaptor can be purchased .
Jobs said that Apple had not compromised in stripping down the machine : it has a full - sized keyboard and 13 in display .
"" It 's the world 's thinnest notebook , "" he said , putting it into an envelope to demonstrate its dimensions .
Even at its thickest , it is thinner than Sony 's Vaio TZ , previously the thinnest machine , Jobs said .
The MacBook Air uses a 1.8 in 60 GB hard drive , the same as an iPod , but also offers an option for a 64 GB Flash memory drive : that version , with a slightly faster processor , costs £ 2,030 .
"" They are a little pricey , "" Jobs admitted , "" but they are fast . ""
Key to the development of the MacBook Air is a reduced - size version of Intel 's Core 2 Duo chip , which made the battery life - claimed to be five hours - possible .
Gartenberg commented : "" After some hands - on time with the device , I know I want one ... this is going to win them some more customer sales .
I expect demand for this machine to be strong , really strong . ""
Jobs also unveiled Time Capsule , a network storage drive in either 500 GB or 1 terabyte ( 1,000 GB ) sizes , which can be used as a wireless backup in conjunction with Time Machine , the automatic backup facility introduced with the latest version of Mac OS X , "" Leopard "" , last October .
Jobs also said that sales of Leopard had been "" unprecedented "" , with 5 m shipped so far : "" We 're really thrilled by this . ""
Notably missing from the speech was any mention of upgrades to the Mac Mini , Apple 's "" headless "" computer , or to its .Mac online service .
Many observers think that the Mac Mini 's days are numbered .
Instead , it is the Apple TV that is now aimed squarely at the space beneath the living - room TV .

2008-01-18,"Tom Cruise is locked in an egomaniacal battle with Apple chief executive Steve Jobs for the top spot on this week 's Viral Video Chart .
Jobs ' unveiled the latest shiny treats from Apple at the conference , including the really alarmingly thin MacBook Air .
Some rascal pondered if it was a Phil Collins special edition laptop , but alas no .
Those of you that could n't quite bear to watch Jobs evangelising to his congregation for the full 90 minutes can watch the delightful 60-second version , courtesy of Mahalo Daily .
It 's all the Mac with none of the pomp , but I ca n't see it catching on at Apple HQ .
There 's not enough whooping in it , for starters .
Cruise control
I watched Cocktail on telly the other night , and Tom Cruise seemed like a nice young chap .
Skip forward twenty years and he 's public enemy two , after the president .
Some sneaky lizard smuggled out a video of Tom speaking about Scientology and saying that it can cure drug addicts , unite cultures and create world peace .
Now where would the American economy be without the war industry , Tom ?
Derrr !
Such is the influence of the Church - and this is shocking - that YouTube has removed the offending videos - no doubt under some spurious copyright claim .
The rest of the web is being systematically scoured for them so if you 're curious , get in there quick !
I do the best parties Australian party brat Corey Worthington has had more than his fair share of publicity after a house party went out of control .
The 16 year - old 's guests and gatecrashers started damaging cars outside his parent 's in Melbourne and his parents could be slapped with a $ 20,000 fine .
That did n't stop him bragging on national TV .
The well - meaning newsreader on the ACA show tried to rattle him into taking off his sunnies and apologising , but he was n't having any of it .
"" What would you say to other kids who were thinking of partying when their parents are out of town ? ""
"" Get me to do it for you , "" he quipped .
"" It was the best party ever so far - that 's what everyone 's been saying .
"" My Favourite Despite all that drama , my three favourite videos were The downfall of HD - DVD , the Aquaduct bike and People in order .
It 's a bit inside baseball , I confess , but the brilliance of re - editing Downfall to document the last , tortuous hours of the Blu - Ray format is very satisfying .
The Aquaduct is an extremely clever bike for the developing world which purifies water while as it goes along , and People in Order is a charming social document of people aged one to one hundred .

The Weekly Viral Video Chart is currently based on a count of the embedded videos and links on approximately two million blogs ."
2008-01-20,"It 's that time of year again .
Last week the Church of Apple Resurgent gathered in San Francisco for its annual congregation .
The faithful were granted an audience with the Blessed Steve Jobs , who revealed unto them what miracles he had wrought since they were last gathered together .
First , he showed them a Time Capsule , which can bring back the past and preserve memories of days gone by .
Then he comforted them by narrating the Great Success of his Personal Communicator , the iPhone , of which four million have been sold in 90 days .
This heart - warming news was followed by information about a scheme whereby the faithful may hire moving pictures from Steve 's Celestial Music Store .
But all these were merely the prelude to the greatest revelation of all - Apple is to sell Air .
At this , he produced a simple A4 envelope from which he drew forth a magical device , not unlike the blade of an elegant hatchet , ranging in thickness from 0.16 in to 0.76 in .
This is the MacBook Air , and hath no wires or - said the Blessed Steve - any need for them .
Many of the faithful swooned , while others waved their wallets in an orgy of technolust and were only quieted by the appearance of Randy Newman , Musician to the Court of Steve , who sang two ditties and accompanied himself on the pianoforte .
There is no parallel with the annual Jobs Keynote Address in any other industry that I can think of .
But this year 's seemed more muted , somehow .
In the old days , every new product or upgrade would be greeted by cheers , whistles , cries of ' Yee - haw ! ' and foot - stomping .
But last Tuesday there were just ripples of polite applause from an audience whose members seemed suspiciously well - dressed .
Could it be that the Jobs Keynote has become just another hot ticket on the corporate hospitality round ?
As for the new laptop , it 's chic but expensive ( £ 1,199 ) and technically compromised .
If you need to use optical disks , for example , you have to buy ( and cart around ) an external drive .
The battery is sealed in the unit ( as in the iPhone ) , so replacing it involves returning the machine to Apple .
There 's no obvious way of plugging in an ethernet cable ( which means that the Air is restricted to relatively slow wi - fi connections ) .
The hard drive holds only 80 GB , and if you want the 64 GB diskless version the solid - state ' drive ' will set you back another £ 829 .
So much for what Apple calls ' thinnovation ' .
Blogosphere comment was sniffy .
One prominent blog held that the name derived from the fact that air is all that would be left in the wallets of those who pre - ordered the machine .
And there was a distinct geeky consensus that for all its design virtuosity and aesthetic attractions , the MacBook Air looks like being more of a fashion accessory than a machine for Serious Hacking .
But similar objections were levelled at the iPhone , and look what 's happened with that .
It has captured a fifth of the US smartphone market in its first quarter .
So let 's see what happens .
Control disorder '
The moment the very name of Ireland is mentioned ' , wrote Sydney Smith in 1807 , ' the English seem to bid adieu to common feeling , common prudence , and common sense , and to act with the barbarity of tyrants and the fatuity of idiots ' .
The same might be said of the government and the net .
The latest control freak is Home Secretary Jaqui Smith , who has announced her determination to target websites promoting extremism .
She wants to use technology to stop ' vulnerable people ' being ' groomed for violent extremism ' .
She has , as of now , no practical way of doing that , but is of the opinion that ' because something is difficult , that is no reason not to have a go at it .
The internet ca n't be a no - go area for government . '
Smith is to discuss her plans with the communications industry .
Translation : she is going to lean on British ISPs .
To do that , she will have to join a long queue of representatives of the movie and record industries and those of her governmental colleagues who have swallowed the propaganda of the copyright thugs .
If this unholy alliance were to have its way , ISPs would be transformed from common carriers to computerised censors , legally liable for everything that passed through their servers .
The result would be an internet choked with filtering systems monitoring everything sent or received by every user in the UK .
Is that really what these people want ? john.naughton@observer.co.uk"
2008-01-21,"Photo :
Engadget Apple boss Steve Jobs is the king of snakeoil salesmen , and his Macworld Expo keynote included a great example of manipulation .
Check his chart of US Smartphone Marketshare , for example .
Yes , the green Apple segment ( 19.5 % ) really is bigger than the Other segment ( 21.2 % ) , which is also out of order , by size .
Someone must have figured out that you could make Apple look better by putting it at the front , by tilting the pie chart backwards , and possibly by moving Other .
Job is famous for his attention to detail , so did he really not notice ?
Or did he say : "" Hey , great idea "" ?
Another great piece of deception is deciding to illustrate market share by brand .
Anybody who wanted an honest appraisal of the market would look at it by operating system , because there are several operating sytems used by many different smartphone suppliers .
The leading ones are Symbian , Linux , and Windows Mobile .
We know that Symbian dominates the world smartphone operating system market ( below ) , but it 's weak in the US .
How about Windows Mobile ?
Well , that makes up a chunk of Other , thanks to firms such as HTC , and it makes up a chunk of Palm , and Motorola also supplies phones running Windows Mobile .
It 's reasonable to ask what you get if you add these together , and there 's some indication on the chart below ( N.AM ) .
But you 're certainly not going to get Jobs standing on stage showing Microsoft 's share of in the US smartphone market if it 's as big as Apple 's !
Everybody appreciates that the iPhone has been a spectacular success in a very short time .
Why not present that success fairly and honestly ?
Why is n't that "" the Apple way "" ?

2008-01-24,"Fake Steve Jobs just gave IBM 's Lotus Notes a bit of a kicking , observing : Putting Notes on iPhone is like getting out a piece of exquisite Wedgwood china and using it to serve a steaming pile of dog shit .
Have you ever seen Notes ?
It 's not software , it 's a form of punishment .
Companies that use Notes have to staff not only a help desk but also a suicide prevention center -- it 's that bad .
Even the poor bastards at IBM , who are forced to use it , do nothing but complain .
True , but it 's only the people unfortunate enough to have to use Notes who loath it .
At least some of the ones who make it and sell it think it 's wonderful .
( There are people who love rat poison , on the same basis . )
So there 's been an attempt at a backlash on the Fake Steve blog .
Ed Brill -- who is or was a senior Lotus executive / sales droid -- has also hit back ( in Fake Steve Jobs
says I am a "" marketing f*cktard "" ) by pointing to a 1998 article in Forbes magazine ( The decline and fall of Lotus ) written by one Daniel Lyons , the "" real "" Fake Steve .
This is taking things far too seriously for IBM 's own good .
How many FSJ readers are actually potential Notes buyers ?
How many of those would take it literally ?
It 's hard to tell how well Brill is doing given that comments have been deleted or removed from his blog .
However , we already know that there are many more people who hate Notes than work for Louts Lotus .
It 's a standing joke .
Get over it .
This is not a fight Lotus can win .
You can understand Lotus 's position ( sic ) , but taking on a satirical site is not really a smart move .
Taking on end users like Rod Boothby -- who ended up describing Lotus Notes as The Asbestos of Enterprise IT -- is not smart either : it just increases the level of publicity via posts like this .
But if users did n't think your product was crap , Ed , you would n't have a problem ....."
2008-01-24,"In a previous incarnation this package was deemed by Steve Jobs so necessary to Apple 's survival that he got Bill Gates to pledge publicly that Microsoft would continue developing the Mac version , to make the corporations happy .
So is Office still necessary ?
It depends which one ; Microsoft now offers three versions .
Most people will get the Home and Student edition ( SRP £ 99.99 ) which includes everything you need - Word , Excel , PowerPoint , Entourage ( the Mac version of Outlook ) and Messenger .
The Office for Mac Suite ( SRP £ 349.99 , upgrade version £ 199.99 ) adds Exchange support and support for Apple 's Automator scripting system .
The deluxe version , Office For Mac Special Media Edition , costs £ 449.99 ( SRP , upgrade £ 299.99 ) .
This includes Microsoft Expression Media , a comprehensive if not intuitive package to manage your digital assets such as photos , audio and video files .
Oh , but : Access freaks , there is no version of the database tool for Mac users in any of the versions .
The revamped interface integrates seamlessly with the shiny look of Apple 's new version of OSX , Leopard .
The new suite defaults to the Open XML formats first seen in Office 2007 , with options to save documents in the old - skool formats for compatibility with people still running 2004 's version ( or earlier ) of the suite .
( Then again , Leopard 's free TextEdit app can open and save the new format too . )
The document ribbon atop the screen uses the new layout from the Windows flavour , presenting a huge set of tools in an intuitive and manageable fashion that makes it easy - well , easy - ish - to find what you 're looking for .
Entourage has acquired a "" My Day "" widget , which floats on the screen , gets in the way and is an ugly purple .
Unfortunately , it still has n't acquired any way to sync its calendar with the outside world , such as Yahoo ! or Google calendars - something you can do using small third - party apps in the Outlook world .
You can sync with Apple 's iCal , but it 's a fiddly process ( tinyurl.com/2thcnx ) , and doing an upgrade install to Office for Mac 2004 can lose all your mailing rules ( tinyurl.com/3xotfc ) .
Excel now supports something like 17bn cells , which should be enough for anyone .
( Is that a saying within Microsoft ? )
Expression Media does some of the stuff that Adobe 's Lightroom does , but Lightroom does it better , and Apple 's ( free ) iPhoto can handle my photos .
Messenger is there for teenagers , though they might prefer a multi - signon program like Adium .
In all , an attractive upgrade , but not a must - have unless you need Exchange ; and no use at all if you need Access .
Pros : Revamped interface ; competitive price for the home and student edition Cons : My Day widget , no Access microsoft.com/mac"
2008-01-24,"When can people in the UK start renting films from Apple ?
Sometime this year .
And we have that from the horse 's mouth , though we 're sure the spokesperson at Apple did n't mean to be disparaging about Steve Jobs by referring to him in that way .
But it was indeed he who said it , at 9.42am in last week 's Macworld keynote that movie rentals will go international "" later this year "" .
Yes , but when this year ?
The first half of the year ?
Second half ?
Third quarter ?
Fourth quarter ?
Alas , on that point Apple 's people become more like the Magic 8-Ball , a toy which answers questions with gnomic responses such as "" Answer uncertain , try again later "" .
But as the New York Times pointed out on Monday , the idea that Europe is a happy integrated whole is illusory when it comes to content rights ( tinyurl.com/2e2xlc ) .
The problem of setting up cross - border services , with films which may have different release schedules , are myriad .
France , for example , sometimes gets US - made films ahead of the UK so their prints can have subtitles added ; the UK gets the US prints when they finish their American cinema runs .
With other films , there is no delay between the US and UK release .
Viviane Reding , the European commissioner who oversees media issues , say she wants a structure in place by June that would simplify content sales across borders in Europe ; part of that would be to encourage rights holders including film studios to offer "" multiterritory "" licences .
Apple 's biggest threat though could be the companies already in the market .
Sky , BT , Virgin and Tiscali all offer pay - per - view or rental films and have millions of customers .
Apple , though , needs people to buy an Apple TV ( whose price has n't been reduced , unlike the US ) .
Try again later , indeed .
Never mind the US , how is Second Life 's economy doing ?
Well , people are n't throwing themselves out of windows , except to navigate around it , but things are n't that rosy in the world of Linden either .
Last month AOL shuttered its 10-month - old portal in the virtual world , saying : "" We 've gained a lot of insight from our participation in Second Life and we 're now refocusing our efforts in virtual worlds . ""
In other words , sayonara .
Wells Fargo has also moved out , and meanwhile there was a scramble in the financial services sector within Second Life ahead of Tuesday 's deadline , after which "" unlicensed "" banks - those not licensed by a real - world government - would be shut down .
It 's a classic way to engineer a run on a bank , and that 's what has happened , according to the Reuters reporter stuck in Second Life .
( His name there ?
Eric Reuters . )
He reported on one case , Steve Smith ( whose Second Life name is Travis Ristow ) of BCX Bank , who saw deposits shrink from 11.5 m Linden dollars ( US$ 42,600 , £ 21,730 ) to L$5 m ( US$ 18,500 ) in a week .
"" We have limited daily withdrawals while we reorganise , "" Smith said .
"" Customers can withdraw L$2,000 per day - we can meet all deposits as long as we do n't have to liquidate all assets immediately . ""
The imposition of regulation followed the disappearance of Ginko Financial , a Second Life bank that vanished five months ago - taking about L$50 m ( $ 187,000 ) with it .
( Its web page at ginkofinancial.com now talks woundedly of "" converting ... all customer deposits into a tradeable debt security called Ginko Perpetual Bonds "" .
Have they been watching Alastair Darling and Northern Rock ? )
Worried that other "" banks "" might just be fronts for pyramid schemes paying big interest rates ( Ginko "" paid "" 44 % ) directly from investors ' deposits in order to attract more money and abscond , Linden Lab cracked the whip .
While the virtual people of Second Life did n't have to queue in the rain , they have definitely been fretting about their money .
You do n't need money to take part in Second Life , though it helps , since without it you ca n't buy property or clothes .
Meanwhile despite the free entry , the raw statistics for Second Life participation are n't that encouraging .
Usage ( measured in the total number of hours people used it ) fell by 5 % from October to November , having also dropped very slightly in August ; the latter marked the first time Second Life had seen a reduction in total hours spent in the metaverse .
But the Linden blog last week offered a rosy picture ( tinyurl.com/yq46th ) of economic growth in the fourth quarter , with a graph with a jolly red arrow suggesting that the only way is up .
Except that peak usage and "" concurrency "" both maxed out in October .
Oh dear : is n't anywhere thriving ?"
2008-01-26,"The basic story is pretty simple .
Top Apple iPhone salesman Steve Jobs claimed at Macworld Expo that he 'd sold 4 million of the things , while AT&amp;T said it had registered 2 million iPhones .
What happened to the other 2 million ?
Financial analysts such as Bernstein 's Toni Sacconaghi and Piper Jaffray 's Gene Munster were soon on the case , and Eric Savitz has provided a good summary of the story so far at Barron 's : Apple :
More On The Missing iPhones .
The problem is that nobody knows ( apart from Apple , possibly ) how many iPhones have been sold in Europe , how many are sitting on store shelves , and how many have been unlocked .
Clearly there are lots of iPhones in use in China and other countries that are not on AT&amp;T 's network , but how many ?
Analysts are interested because of the "" Apple tax "" : the network operators who supply iPhones pay Apple a monthly fee beyond the price their users have already paid for the unsubsidized phone .
These payments are factored into the predicted profit figures that underpin Apple 's share price .
As Savitz says : Munster himself has previously estimated that Apple gets $ 18 a month for every iPhone user that signs up .
That comes to $ 432 over the course of the required two - year contract .
If you use Munster 's figure of 838,000 phones sold but unlocked , and multiply by $ 432 , that is $ 362 million in lost revenue .
The other worry for analysts is whether the wheels are coming off the iPhone bandwagon .
This has been fed by unconfirmed rumours such as one in Taiwan 's DigiTimes , Apple lowers iPhone shipment projection for fiscal 2Q08 , says paper , based on a story in the Chinese - language Economic Daily News .
It has certainly reminded them that when Apple says it has shipped an iPhone , that means "" shipped to an AT&amp;T , O2 or other warehouse , "" not necessarily "" sold to an active iPhone user "" .
Apple 's share price peaked at around $ 200 in the run - up to Macworld Expo and has since plunged to around $ 130 .
Speculators who expected to make a quick buck based on Steve Jobs making some exciting announcements in his keynote speech are , as they say , under water ."
2008-01-29,"U2 's manager yesterday called on artists to join him in forcing the "" hippy "" technology and internet executives he blames for the collapse of the music industry to help save it .
Paul McGuinness , who has plotted the rise of the Irish group over 30 years , said technology gurus in Silicon Valley such as Apple 's Steve Jobs and Microsoft 's Bill Gates had profited from rampant online piracy without doing anything to stop it .
"" I suggest we shift the focus of moral pressure away from the individual P2P [ peer to peer ] thief and on to the multibillion dollar industries that benefit from these tiny crimes , "" he said .
He was speaking at the Midem music conference in Cannes , which has been dominated by talk of new revenue models that might save an industry brought to its knees by piracy and falling sales .
Confusion yesterday surrounded the future of one of those new models , Qtrax , the supposedly legal filesharing service unveiled with the backing of artists including James Blunt on Sunday .
The service , five years in development , was due to launch yesterday and claimed to be able to offer more than 25 m tracks legally using a new advertiser - funded model .
But while label insiders yesterday confirmed talks had taken place and were continuing , they were taken by surprise by the launch announcement .
They said no contracts had been signed and earlier agreements had expired .
Warner Music , Blunt 's label , issued a statement saying it had not signed a deal , but Qtrax insisted talks were taking place and it was hopeful of reaching agreement .
Qtrax is one of several new launches hoping to distribute free music legally and pay artists , labels and publishers through advertising revenue .
At a time when music was easier to make and distribute than ever , and live performance was thriving , McGuinness said , record labels were failing because the technology companies and broadband providers were prospering from illegal downloads .
"" I call on them to do two things : first , taking responsibility for protecting the music they are distributing ; and second , by commercial agreements , sharing their enormous revenues with the content makers and owners . ""
McGuinness , who did a deal with Jobs in 2004 for U2 to promote the iPod and create their own limited edition version , said he was "" quite friendly "" with the Apple founder .
But he said technology companies could no longer argue they were a "" mere conduit "" for illegal music and movies with no responsibility of their own .
He likened their behaviour to a magazine publisher which "" was advertising stolen cars , processing payments for them and arranging delivery "" .
Figures released last week showed global revenues had declined by 10 % in 2007 as booming digital downloads failed to make up for plummeting CD sales .
Artists and their managers should be open to new revenue opportunities , such as subscription offerings , said McGuinness , but the debate over different funding models had obscured the "" extremely urgent "" larger problem .
McGuinness said he believed the Silicon Valley culture and its ecosystem had to undergo a cultural shift , noting the original "" hippy values "" of the west coast technology pioneers in the late 1970s and their internet equivalents in the late 1990s . ""
Embedded deep down in the brilliance of those entrepreneurial , hippy values seems to be a disregard for the true value of music , "" he said .
He said his plea was not made from a position of self interest , pointing out that U2 had sold more than 150 m records and grossed $ 355 m on their Vertigo tour .
McGuinness , who also manages PJ Harvey , lent his weight to a campaign by the international trade body IFPI calling on governments around the world to follow the lead of French president Nicolas Sarkozy and introduce legislation forcing internet service providers to disconnect persistent illegal downloaders .
He said there should be a "" three strikes and you 're out "" rule for users .
The issue would become increasingly critical as more bandwidth was required for video downloads , and he rejected claims by the ISPs that they could not effectively target illegal downloaders ."

2008-03-05,"Steve Jobs is back on the cover of Fortune magazine because Apple has displaced General Electric as the Most Admired company in America .
But the magazine has added The trouble with Steve Jobs , which rakes over a few embers from the Pixar and Apple stock options scandals , and Jobs 's "" delay "" in revealing that he had cancer .
( It 's not clear that he needed to . )
Still , there 's a quick skim of some elements of Jobs 's personal background , career and trademark histrionics , which may not be all that widely known to Apple 's new legion of fans ."
2008-03-05,"Although the iPhone is said to deliver a desktop - like Web experience , it does n't support eiher Flash or Java , which limits users ' access to things like games and YouTube videos .
Some thought Apple could announce Flash support tomorrow , but Steve Jobs 's comments at yesterday 's Apple shareholders meeting suggested not .
He reckons it 's too slow .
A Dow Jones report , Adobe 's Flash Player
Not Suited For IPhone , Apple CEO Says , covers the current state of play .
This is likely to upset Adobe , because its strategy is for Flash to be ubiquitous , but it probably does n't matter much to Jobs .
The number of lost sales because the iPhone lacks Flash is probably pretty small , because iPhone sales are themselves pretty small .
If it does become a significant barrier , then Apple can easily add it .
In the meantime , not supporting Flash ( and Java ) allows Apple more control over applications on the iPhone ."
2008-03-05,"Apple shareholders defied the company 's board yesterday by approving a proposal demanding a British - style "" say on pay "" through a regular vote on executive remuneration at the iPod maker 's annual meetings .
A motion tabled by the AFL - CIO federation of trade unions won a majority at the annual meeting of shareholders at Cupertino in California , despite opposition from Apple 's founder Steve Jobs and boardroom colleagues including Al Gore .
The result is an indication of gathering resentment at a lack of pay discipline at the top of US companies .
Similar proposals are on the table at imminent annual meetings of General Electric , Wal - Mart and Citigroup .
Although the resolution is not binding , it calls on Apple to put its pay policies to an annual vote - a procedure introduced in Britain five years ago .
Apple 's founder takes a token salary of $ 1 .
But the company has been embroiled in a scandal over the improper pricing of share options which prompted a criminal investigation and a public apology from Jobs in 2006 .
"" I hope this say on pay will help me with my $ 1 a year , "" he joked after yesterday 's vote .
Unease about executive pay has been stoked by deals such as a $ 210 m payoff for Robert Nardelli , who was ditched for a sluggish performance by the retailer Home Depot .
Pfizer 's outgoing boss Hank McKinnell received $ 200 m in 2006 and Merrill Lynch 's Stan O'Neal , who left after huge losses on mortgage related securities , was allowed to keep $ 160 m in stock and options .
Apple poured cold water on rumours that America 's economic downturn was damaging sales of its music players , phones and computers .
Jobs said he was confident of hitting a 2008 sales target of 10 m iPhones .
Apple 's shares rose $ 2.89 to $ 124.62 on the technology - dominated Nasdaq exchange ."
2008-03-07,"Just in case you do n't obsessively follow every word that Steve Jobs speaks ( as if ) , the Apple CEO unveiled a software development kit for the iPhone yesterday , allowing game developers to create new titles for the popular handset .
EA and Sega are already onboard , with versions of Spore and Super Monkey Ball on the way , the latter set to use the phone 's accelerometer to provide tilt - based gameplay .
Apple has also announced its own internally developed iPhone title , Touch Fighter , a space shooter which , according to MCV , the team knocked up in two weeks .
They 're clearly taking the mobile games market seriously then .
So Apple is pushing two of its latest platforms - iPhone and iPod Touch - as leading new arenas for touch screen gaming .
But Apple is not alone in this market - most other phone manufacturers have their own touch screen handsets .
Indeed , I met with Glu mobile today who were telling me that Vodafone expects 50 % of its new handsets to be touch screen - based .
And let 's face it , touch screen technology is what mobile gaming has been crying out for .
The mobile keypad has proved itself resolutely awful as a game controller , but a touch screen / stylus combo could work wonders for accessibility , especially with strategy and puzzle games .
Glu showed me several of their forthcoming titles , most of which support touchy phones - I 'll talk more about those next week , but there was a really nice Picross - esque puzzler and sequels to the excellent Diner Dash and Brain Genius titles , all very much improved by the touch interface .
Touch is the future for small games - Steve Jobs says so ."

Oh no !

I must be missing something here , because who is this mystery audience that 's going to be lapping up John , Paul , George and Ringo online ?
Is it diehard fans who simply must have everything ?
Is it "" the kids "" who have just seen them mentioned on a mate 's Bebo and want to dip their toe in the Merseybeat ?
Is it thirtysomething urban - hipsters in WiFi - enabled lofts who have ditched all their CDs ?
I 'm sorry
, I just do n't buy this .
Newspapers ' Beatles - take - over - world - again excitement is surely based on the catalogue coming out on CD 15 years ago and the 1 album in 2000 .
Both events were big news .
But times have changed since then , proof being 2006 's massively heralded Love album .
Cast your mind back to the reviews - they were uniformly orgasmic , along the lines of "" This is how the songs were always meant to be heard !
"" When the album massively under - delivered , and proved effectively to be a Stars On 45 version of the Fab Four , some critics I know freely confessed to being fooled by hearing Love on the big speakers in Abbey Road 's Studio Two at the glitzy playback they were invited to .
Surely everyone who is a fan of pop music already has the Beatles .
They 've inherited their parents albums , they 've ripped their own CDs ( despite being the only major catalogue artists apart from Pink Floyd never to have been sold at mid price , the Beatles ' CDs are now all under a tenner and that includes the red , blue and white doubles - what are you waiting for ? )
and some may have downloaded tracks in a very naughty and highly illegal way .
It 's rumoured that Apple Corps is asking £ 200 m from Apple Inc for the Fabs ' digital catalogue .
If they paid this , do you know how many downloads iTunes would have to sell just to break even on the deal ?
1.8bn .
That 's right .
If they sell that many , I am indeed the egg man ."
2008-04-04,"What 's a good alternative to an iPod ?
I do n't care about video , but I do want at least 30 GB of storage and easy file transfer from a Windows PC .
There are many options for those who do n't want to further line Steve Jobs 's pockets - but you 're unlikely to strike a bargain ( Apple sells so many iPods that it can drive its prices down lower than its rivals ) .
Still , if it 's power you 're looking for , I 'd recommend Archos - the 605 model has 160 GB of space for around £ 250 .
A 30 GB model is around £ 170 .
Or try Creative 's Zen series , which has flowered of late , although it 's rather pricey ( £ 250 for a 32 GB model ) .
My Sony Handycam records on to mini DVDs , but my iMac has a side - loading DVD drive , which means I ca n't put the discs into the computer .
How can I edit my discs ?
You could damage your machine if you tried to push an irregular - sized DVD into the slot , so your best bet may well be an external DVD drive with a tray - loading mechanism : Maplin stocks a reliable LG number for around £ 70 .
Also , remember that it always pays carefully to check camcorders before you buy : many models do n't play nicely with Apple computers .

2008-04-29,"Fake Steve Jobs has posted an amusing video showing the Apple AirBook and the ThinkPad X300 , protesting that "" No way will Lenovo ever win a cool kid contest with us "" .
Sure , that 's true .
If you do n't actually need a decent computer , the MacBook Air probably wins as a fashion accessory ;-)"
2008-05-14,"When Apple approached record companies about selling their music digitally five years ago , they "" were extremely cautious and required Apple to protect their music from being illegally copied "" , according to Steve Jobs 's recollection of the process .
That meant using digital rights management ( DRM ) - a software wrapper - to protect songs from unlimited copying .
Jobs says it is crucial to the contract : "" If our DRM system is compromised and their music becomes playable on unauthorized devices , we have only a small number of weeks to fix the problem or they can withdraw their entire music catalog from our iTunes store . ""
But what 's the real effect of DRM ?
Last year , EMI began offering songs without it on iTunes .
"" The industry has finally been able to get some hard data about how removing DRM restrictions from legitimately purchased tracks affects piracy , "" says Bill Rosenplatt , DRM specialist and president of GiantSteps Media Technology Strategies .
"" The statistics show that there 's no effect on piracy . ""
No effect .
The assertion is remarkable .
If DRM does not in fact discourage piracy , then it is merely a nuisance for the user .
Now the Guardian understands that most download stores will remove DRM on permanent music downloads .
"" We are going to be selling non - DRM music from the summer "" , says Dave Elston , HMV 's digital content manager , adding that it would solve "" obvious interoperability issues "" - primarily compatibility with Apple 's iPod .
Amazon has announced that its DRM - free MP3 download store , already online in the US , will be rolled out internationally later this year .
Napster in the US is moving to MP3 for non - subscription downloads , and sources close to the company implied that the UK service will follow suit .
And Apple offers DRM - free downloads for an increasing number of tracks .
Ironically , the music companies are now abandoning DRM because it worked too well .
Apple would n't license its version to rivals - so the best - selling iPod drove the iTunes store to its present position , where it is the third - largest music retailer in any form in the US .
Rosenblatt says that record labels "" have been desperate to find a viable competitor to Apple and iTunes "" .
Industry sources suggest that Apple 's iTunes store has more than 70 % of the UK download market , and growing . ""
The record companies do n't like dealing with Apple , because Apple is in a position where it can dictate the economic terms and dictate the business models , "" says Rosenblatt .
"" What 's going to draw people away from iTunes ?
One answer is to get rid of DRM . ""
Licences revoked In the meantime , some early adopters are suffering the consequences of DRM 's failure .
Last month , former customers of Microsoft 's defunct MSN Music store in the US received an unwelcome email .
""
As of August 31 , 2008 , we will no longer be able to support the retrieval of licence keys for the songs you purchased from MSN Music or the authorization of additional computers , "" it said .
So what does that mean ?
Protected music files are encrypted and locked with a key .
To play the file , the media player must acquire a digital licence that is specific to the PC or portable device on which it is played .
The licence may permit music to be copied to other computers or devices , but each device must be individually authorised by an online licence server .
Without such a server , former customers of MSN Music will not be able to play their DRM - protected music on any new PCs or portable players that they buy .
The problem is worse than it first appears , since a "" new "" device may actually be your existing PC .
Some users habitually reinstall Windows to keep it running sweetly , but doing so removes its authorisation ; even adding or changing a hardware component
can also break the DRM , as Microsoft notes matter - of - factly in a support article .
Worse still , the DRM component in Windows can get corrupted for no apparent reason .
This is a common problem for users installing the BBC 's iPlayer software , for example , which also uses Microsoft DRM .
The fix , described in detail on the iPlayer support pages , involves deleting all the files in the hidden DRM folder within Windows .
A side effect is that existing licences are destroyed - so existing DRM - protected files could well no longer play .
In other words , there are multiple scenarios in which customers who have bought music , supposedly for a lifetime , may need to re - authorise their purchases .
If the licence server has been turned off , the music will never , ever play again .
What if you back up your licences ?
This used to be possible through Windows Media Player .
But Microsoft removed the option from version 11 , introduced for Windows Vista .
Microsoft 's Adam Anderson told us that licence backup did not work properly anyway .
Getting your backup "" The ability to back up content was not granted by every service , leading to user confusion and frustration , "" he says .
"" Third - party digital content service providers are best positioned to meet the backup and restoration needs of their customers . ""
So the trail leads back to the licence server - which Microsoft is turning off for its customers .
Why is it doing that ?
According to Rob Bennett , who wrote the shock email , it was too complicated to support . ""
Every time there is an OS upgrade , you saw support issues .
People would call in because they could n't download licences .
We had to write new code , new configurations each time , "" he told CNet .
There are a few mitigating factors .
One is that purchased downloads usually include the right to burn CDs - thus removing the DRM , and allowing proper backup .
Though it 's not quite perfect : most download formats are compressed .
The CD will sound the same as the download - but if it is ripped back to a PC in a lossy format ( such as MP3 ) , the recompressed file will not sound as good .
Customers outside the US are not directly affected by Microsoft 's move .
Although several download services in the UK use Microsoft DRM - including MSN Music ( which is run by Nokia ) , Napster and HMV - these stores have their own licence servers .
Still , if Microsoft itself has done this , and if DRM for this type of purchase is on the way out , then customers with an investment in downloaded music should be cautious .
Best burn them to CD , just in case .
Some , however , wo n't let you .
Subscription services such as Napster
To Go , which gives temporary access to around 5 m songs , will keep using DRM .
But so far the subscription concept has not taken off .
Yet Rosenblatt thinks that subscriptions may turn out to be Apple 's answer to the DRM - free competition - because it has already laid the groundwork with films which expire a certain length of time after being downloaded or watched .
"" You can now rent a movie on your iPod .
The functionality on the iPod that enables that to happen is part of the functionality that you would need to support music subscription services , "" Rosenblatt says .
Same old problems
And that could mean the record labels will face the same problem all over again .
Just as they remove DRM from their products , Apple would re - impose it .
Apple customers with a subscription would probably never buy from third - party services , even while the likes of Amazon could undercut iTunes and be iPod - compatible .
Mark Mulligan , digital music analyst at Jupiter Research , also expects Apple to change its approach .
"" It 's highly likely Apple will get into the next - generation service game .
That could be Apple selling iPods preinstalled with unlimited access to music , or with a bundle to a subscription offering , "" he says .
Mulligan sees the market evolving into multiple tiers .
At the top end , a minority will be willing to pay a premium for the best quality , DRM - free downloads .
The middle tier will be "" subsidised offerings like Nokia 's Comes With Music , where you buy a device and the cost of the music is included subsidised "" ; while at the bottom will be advertising - supported services such as Qtrax , SpiralFrog and We7 , where free music is paid for by embedded advertising .
That would leave Apple with the top - end iTunes downloads and a subscription business .
But would Jobs back it ?
In January 2007 , Reuters asked him if Apple would do so . ""
Never say never , but customers do n't seem to be interested in it , "" Jobs said .
"" The subscription model has failed so far . ""
Which hardly rules it out forever .
DRM might not stop pirates , but it does rivals .
And in business , the latter can be a greater threat than the former ."
2008-05-18,"In 1979 , when Steve Jobs , co - founder of Apple , was 24 he visited Xerox Parc at Palo Alto in California , the research centre for Xerox , the manufacturer of electronic copiers .
He was transfixed by one of the things he saw , a prototype of a graphical user interface ( GUI ) .
Mr Jobs realised that one day it would be on the desktop of every computer .
It was a turning point for Apple , which subsequently pioneered the easy - to - click icons on screens that Microsoft and others have been forced to follow .
Later Mr Jobs admitted to having been so blinded by the GUI that he had not noticed other research projects - such as networked computers and object - orientating programming - that would also become industry standards .
That was what Xerox Parc was like then and what it still is today .
Xerox recently demonstrated some of the projects being worked on now , often in collaboration with others , that may affect our lives in future .
They include miniaturised solar panels ; paper that erases its ink after 24 hours ; a biomass plastic , over 30 % of which is made from plant material ; and a simple blood test given when a foetus is between eight to 12 weeks old that could replace amniocentesis tests .
Another is a method of spiral cleaning using centrifugal force to remove heavier particles from water .
Not all of these projects will succeed - that is the nature of the beast - but the fact that they are being done at all is a living monument to the wisdom of long - term corporate research ."
2008-05-23,"Oh , look , people are queueing already for the next - generation iPhone - the one that has n't been announced , whose existence can only be inferred by the behaviour of those around it .
Truly the second - generation iPhone is the Higgs boson of today 's technology world : huge amounts of effort being put into deducing its existence from the tiniest clue .
While this metaphor does put Steve Jobs into the putative position of the creator of the universe – a position that his fans and even he might be comfortable with – it tends to leave aside a question that seems worth examining .
With Apple 's Worldwide Developers Conference still more than two weeks away ( it starts on Monday June 9 ) , and pretty much every fan in the Apple constellation scratching their chin and saying "" Would n't it be cool if iPhone 2 had this ? ""
( where "" this "" may be GPS , 12-megapixel camera , video , Skype , a battery that goes 20 days between recharges , an FM radio and a coffeemaker with optional taser attachment for when you find yourself in the wrong side of town .
And pretty quickly it goes from "" would n't it be cool if "" to searches for evidence that will back up these slightly off - beam theories .
It 's like science , except less scientific , since it 's trying to wish something into existence , rather than accept that some things do n't exist .
( If you want to see it in action , have a look at this Macrumors thread , which goes from a little item on Gizmodo and spins off into 20-plus pages of forum - driven supposition , theory , fact - gathering and world - class generating of castles in the air .
For future reference
So let me give you my guide to knowing what Apple 's going to release next .
These methods , supplied free of charge , can be used when any hubbub builds up over what Apple is going to do next in some field or other .
1 ) What Apple produces never has as many bells and whistles as fans forecast .
People constantly overlook the fact that Apple cleaves to the belief that something is finished not when you ca n't add anything , but when you ca n't take anything away .
The ( first ) iPhone does n't do voice dialling , speed dialling , video , does n't offer camera options , ca n't forward SMS , and does n't offer multiple selections .
( See the full list . )
It just does a few things .
Quite well , apparently .
2 ) The user interface receives far , far more attention than people ever expect .
Most of the world that uses computers is familiar with Microsoft 's Windows , which means that people are inured to dialog boxes that could , with a bit of effort , be turned into medium - sized blog posts , and preference boxes that offer more options than a futures market .
Apple does n't do this .
It pares down the interface ( rather as it does with the hardware ) to the bare minimum . ""
Timeout error "" , Mac OS X tells me when it ca n't connect to my home wireless network .
This has a lot to recommend it over the Windows message , which goes something like "" Windows was unable to connect to the network My Home Network due to an error whose cause could not be ascertained "" .
( Either way I know I have to just power - cycle the router . )
3 ) It will only include surprising new technology if it 's been standardised but neglected a while .
USB only became popular because the first iMac used it , but it had been around a while .
Wi - Fi got its big kick through being built in to the first iBook , but was n't new ; Dell was able to follow almost at once because 802.11b was a ratified standard .
Bluetooth got its first big break for computers ( it was already all over mobile phones ) in Mac OS X in March 2002 .
None of them new ; but Apple was able to see ways to make good use of them .
4 )
It will cost more than you might wish .
This is axiomatic of things that come from Apple , because it knows that it caters to a market that is prepared to spend more on good design .
This always leads to one corner of the tech market complaining that "" it 's so EXPENSIVE ! "" as though nothing expensive could possibly sell .
This is a category mistake .
Apple is n't in the technology business to rule the world ; it 's in it to make stonking profits .
Neither precludes the other .
Ask the PC companies that make tiny margins making commodity hardware .
5 )
The leaks and rumours in the rumour outlets are , by and large , wrong - or at least so plentiful that it 's impossible to tell the correct from the daft .
The iPhone was going to have a sliding keyboard .
It would have a touch screen .
It would do 3G. It would only do GSM .
It would have GPS .
It would run Linux .
There 's no end to the speculation , and just because someone overheard someone who was using an Apple laptop saying it does n't make it true .
The next generation With that all in mind , let 's get to the meat .
What can we therefore expect in iPhone 2.0 ?
My calculations , based on all the noise going on , are : · a three - megapixel camera .
Cheap upgrade , people will herald its "" 50 % better "" picture quality . · video .
Easy , because it can already do this . ·
possibly , just possibly , WiMax .
A few places have this , and it 's just the kind of out - there technology that might find a use .
But I 'd put the chances at about 5 % .
· 3 G connectivity .
Cheap , obvious , essential for its Far Eastern launch coming later this year . · better Bluetooth profiles .
Obvious incremental upgrade .
· voice and speed dialling .
Easy , incremental upgrades based on phone software .
Apple 's had more than a year to work on this .
What wo n't be there : · SMS forwarding .
Americans do n't understand SMS , and are n't about to start now . · GPS .
Expensive , sucks power , imprecise , and is n't standard on the vast majority of phones , so Apple is n't losing by not using it . · a cheap one .
If you 'd like to believe that I 've got inside information about Apple 's plans , go right ahead .
The reality is that I 've just spent ages watching the company , and know what it 's like .
Come back in a couple of weeks and we 'll see if I 'm right , wo n't we ?"
2008-06-04,"Back in January , Steve Jobs introduced film rentals in the US .
Some people swooned .
Other people figured out that if you could figure out the software to rent films , you could use that same system to rent music .
But no matter on the latter .
We were promised films for rent in the UK , but no word on when it would happen .
Now , it 's happened : movies from major film studios including 20th Century Fox , The Walt Disney Studios , Paramount Pictures , Warner Bros. Entertainment , Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer Studios Inc. ( MGM ) , Sony Pictures Television International and Lionsgate UK are now available on the iTunes ® Store in the UK
Well , that 's nice .
You 'll be able to get films such as I Am Legend ( passable ; Charlton Heston 's version , The Omega Man , was just as good , or bad .
The picture link goes to Philip French 's review . ) .
Anyway
: The iTunes Store in the UK features over 700 films available for rent or purchase , with titles available for purchase on the same day as their DVD release 700 ?
That 's nearly as many as your average Blockbuster .
And how much do they cost ?
iTunes movies are available at £ 6.99 for library title purchases and £ 10.99 for new releases .
iTunes Movie Rentals are £ 2.49 for library title rentals and £ 3.49 for new releases , and high definition versions are priced at just one pound more .
How does that compare to the US ?
Over there , you 'll find iTunes Movie Rentals are priced at $ 2.99 for library titles and $ 3.99 for new releases , and high definition versions are just one dollar more with library titles at $ 3.99 and new releases at $ 4.99 .
Is it just me , or is this pricing differential just completely taking the piss ?
Let 's generously assume that Apple is not gouging us on the price here , and that it 's doing its pricing based on wholesale pricing by the ( generally , US - based ) studios .
How can they explain the fact that new releases cost the equivalent of $ 7 - where in the US they sell for $ 4 .
That 's on a product that 's already been made , which needs no translation ( unlike , say , software ) , where making new copies costs nothing .
For library rental , the comparison is $ 5 in the UK vs $ 3 .
Sorry , but this continuing differential in pricing - which has been pretty much ironed out for hardware (
once you allow for 17.5 % VAT in the UK ) and is falling for Apple 's software - still lingers in media ( iTunes tracks at 79p - or $ 1.60 - vs 99c anyone ? ) .
It 's bad , and if I needed to point to anything that comprises a barrier to a wholehearted acceptance of the Brave New Digital World , this would certainly be a big part of it .
( DRM being the other part , but mostly Apple 's keeps out of the way .
Pricing does n't . )"
2008-06-04,"The people at Twitter - you know , the web service that lets you send SMS - length "" microblogs "" to the world , or particular people , or just one person - must be bracing themselves .
Next week is the Apple Worldwide Developers ' Conference , where Steve Jobs will address the adoring masses .
Of developers .
Of whom , you can be sure , many will be on Twitter , sitting with fingers poised over their laptops or ( inevitably ) iPhones waiting to tell an information - hungry world what 's just been said .
Twitter is thus guaranteed to fall over at some point during Jobs 's speech .
Not that that will make much difference : Twitter users are increasingly inured to outages .
Why should a service that 's been around for a couple of years still have these problems ?
As Jack Dorsey and Biz Stone , two of its founders , noted in a blog post earlier this week , every new tweet ( a single message ) gets written on to one MySQL database ; that is then replicated to multiple slave databases , from which all the "" reads "" ( outputting the tweets to the world , or those parts of the world that want to know them ) are taken .
From a design point of view , sensible .
( And far better than a "" decentralised "" service , potentially a consistency nightmare . )
The problem comes from exponential growth . ""
Twitter is , fundamentally , a messaging system , "" explained Alex Payne of Twitter in another blog post .
"" Twitter was not architected as a messaging system , however .
For expediency 's sake , Twitter was built with technologies and practices that are more appropriate to a content management system . ""
Well , that 's your problem right there .
More to the point , because Twitter is so Web 2.0-y , and lets anyone hook into it through its well - exposed ( and simple ) application programming interface ( API ) , scores of services have sprung up which leech on it .
Quotably , Tweetscan , Tweetstats , Tweeterboard - while they might not be what 's killing Twitter , they are n't helping .
There 's an excellent explanation , from an outsider who built a Twitter - like system , of the problems with scaling it : basically , every single Twitter user 's view on every refresh is different from every other user 's view .
And it changes much , much faster than , say , Facebook ( also built on MySQL ) .
What Twitter needs is to expand its capacity while making money from those who are using it .
True , it has just received $ 15 m ( £ 7.5 m ) of venture capital funding , valuing it at $ 80 m .
But it needs to deter some people from using it - while benefiting from those who continue to .
There are two obvious ways forward .
Charge the users , or charge those who want to get at the users .
The first option is fine - if it wants to lose 90 % of its user base ( the rough tradeoff any service sees if it begins charging , however little ) .
The second option might look puzzling , but it has worked before , in the MP3 market .
Once , there were zillions of MP3-playing software programs .
Then Fraunhofer , which owns the patents , decided to charge for their use .
At a stroke , the number of MP3 encoder / decoders shrank - leaving only those companies able to pay for them .
Twitter could do the same : charge for access to its API , or throttle requests over a certain limit from non - paying sources .
True , its architecture challenges would remain - but with money coming in , it would have the incentive to get it right .
And in the end , what do you want : a Twitter that 's free , or a Twitter that works ?"
2008-06-05,"Steve Jobs originally unveiled Keynote , Apple 's presentation software ( now costs £ 79 in the iWork bundle with its page layout program Pages and spreadsheet Numbers ) back in January 2003 , after beta - testing it in secret in public for a year .
Now a team - who seem to be ex - Apple - have created a web - based Keynote clone which has the same look and feel as Keynote , though it does n't have the "" guidelines "" which will tell you whether you 've aligned an element ( such as a shape or headline ) with other elements .
You can though add in media elements such as video .
Obviously , you 'll only be able to use it when you 're online , but equally there 's the benefit that you can have shared editing , and/or download it for when you 're offline .
( There is n't though any upload facility . )
Why do I say it 's like Keynote and not Powerpoint ?
Because it has the rounded look of Keynote rather than the abrupt squared - off look of Powerpoint .
( You may disagree . )
As Chris Heilmann notes in the blog post above , The most amazing thing about this is happening under the hood : the developer wrote a library that abstracts browser rendering engines using Canvas , SVG and Flash ( on a per - need basis ) into a unified language – Objective J which is – as the name suggests – a mapping from Objective C to JavaScript .
Objective J may be more interesting than any twiddles with presentation software .
If that can be expanded , then it has potentially huge applications to all sorts of tasks .
Go away , ActiveX :
Objective J is here .
So : would you use web - based presentation software if it looked like this ?"
2008-06-07,"Looking forward to Monday 's announcement of the second - generation iPhone ?
Wondering , though , quite what the rabbit is that Steve Jobs will pull out of his hat ?
Well , use this guide , put together by Wired 's Cult of Mac blog , using Dipity .
The neat thing is that a number of the items include links to YouTube clips of the relevant items .
So , give us your insight : what 's going to be the "" one more thing "" on Monday ?"
2008-06-09,"There is , as usual , a swirl of speculation this morning as Steve Jobs prepares to make his announcements at Apple 's WWDC in San Francisco tonight .
As Richard Wray
and I reported this morning
, our sources are filling us in on what the expected iPhone 2.0 will look like
: they say it 's going to be smaller , cheaper through a subsidy , most likely 3 G ( though problems have been reported ) and probably available in this country next month .
Charles has already made his predictions , and we 'll be keeping track of it and pondering what it all means here on the blog later tonight , but in the meantime there 's plenty of weirdness to keep things going .
Among the many chin - scratching reports on Apple , the iPhone and What
It All Means is this little number from Dow Jones , which looks into patent applications from Cupertino .
Except - as Martin Stabe pointed it out briefly on his blog - it all goes a bit weird .
Just how will Apple meet expectations ?
Using the patent application as a guide , Apple appears to be making room on the iPhone for flash memory , which means an end to Apple 's standoff with Adobe ( ADBE ) that 's kept iPhones from easily viewing a plethora of Internet videos .
Apple has said that Adobe 's flash media player , which is on hundreds of other phones , does n't perform up to Apple 's standards for the iPhone .
Flash memory ?
Adobe ?
Right now I ca n't find the patent application in question , but hopefully I do n't need to explain why that 's seven shades of wrong and back again .
It seems everyone 's head goes a bit squiffy when they start writing about Apple ...
let the juggernaut roll onwards ..."
2008-06-09,"A year ago it was hailed as a piece of technological wizardry , prompting American fans to camp out for days to be the first to get their hands on it .
Last night Apple hoped that it could recapture some of the excitement of 12 months ago by announcing the latest version of its iPhone .
Speaking on stage at Apple 's Worldwide Developers Conference , the company 's chief executive , Steve Jobs , unveiled the iPhone 3 G - a cheaper , more powerful replacement intended to boost sales .
The gadget , which already combines an iPod , mobile phone and touch - sensitive internet browser , will now also sport a high - speed 3 G internet connection and GPS satellite positioning .
And , crucially , it will cost far less than it does at the moment .
The handset will be available from next month at $ 199 ( £ 100 ) .
"" We did figure out what our next challenges are , the next mountain we have to climb , "" Jobs said last night .
"" The number one reason people did n't buy the iPhone was that they could n't afford it , so we need to make the iPhone more affordable . ""
The news was welcomed by industry observers , who are keen for the gadget to fulfil the hype generated over the past 18 months .
But the changes reveal some of the difficulties that Apple - which has been flying high for the best part of a decade on the success of its iPod music player - has found with moving into the phone industry .
Dropping the price marks a shift in its strategy , which originally involved selling iPhones at the high price of £ 269 , rather than subsidising the costs , as is usual in the mobile phone industry .
With sales falling short of expectations , Apple executives know they have yet to make the same impact with the iPhone that they managed with the iPod .
Taking on competitors such as Nokia and BlackBerry in the battle for the lucrative "" smartphone "" market has proved tough . ""
They probably did the right thing launching when they did , because the hype bubble had reached the point of bursting , "" said John Delaney , research director at industry analyst IDC .
"" If Apple knows about nothing else , it knows how to generate and exploit hype .
But having only achieved 6 m sales , and most of them in the US , I think they feel a need to light a fire underneath it . ""
Still , Apple 's ambitions remain relatively small , with Jobs publicly making a conservative estimate of 10 m sales by the end of 2008 .
The company is already more than halfway there , but such numbers are small fry in a global mobile phone business that is expected to sell more than 1bn handsets this year .
Despite relatively low takeup , however , the gadget has grabbed public attention and awards .
Apple has had some testy relationships with mobile companies .
It had already developed a reputation for hardball negotiations , thanks to its tough approach to dealing with the record labels for its iTunes music store .
But the company signalled its intentions to break with mobile industry protocols when it avoided the usual route of offering customers large subsidies .
Although the shift has proved profitable - the Californian company takes a significant slice of every monthly contract which is signed - the result was a high ticket price which put off buyers used to discounted handsets .
This was controversial with the mobile operators , adding to already fractious relationships with those companies negotiating partnerships with Apple .
In Britain , the California company eventually signed O2 as its only network partner , leaving some rivals jilted at the altar .
Orange , which now only supplies the phone in France , had a deal worked out and was ready to sign it .
At the last minute , however , Apple dumped its potential partner and signed with O2 .
The reason was simple : money .
O2 agreed to hand back a larger slice of revenues than its rival would contemplate , with sources suggesting that the number lies between 30 % and 40 % .
Apple seems to have changed tack , considering different options in other parts of the world , offering deals with several networks simultaneously in some places .
"" It 's obviously designed to stimulate sales , "" said Delaney .
"" Apple started off being quite dictatorial and were getting away with it .
This shows that they 're getting a little more humble . ""
The competitors The iPhone 's touchscreen has prompted other manufacturers to launch handsets that make extensive use of touch .
Korean company LG 's Secret is technologically more advanced than the iPhone .
Nokia is working with scientists at Cambridge University , using nanotechnology .
It hopes within a few years to have a phone that can be rolled out as a keyboard or worn as a bracelet .
Some companies are banking on turning the mobile into a single device which , when plugged into other gadgets such as car navigation systems , music players and TVs , will become the centrepiece of personal technology .
Several companies are working on handsets made entirely out of recycled materials .
Campaigners such as Greenpeace have attacked the industry for being environmentally unfriendly , singling out handsets such as the iPhone ."
2008-06-09,"The next generation iPhone will include faster internet access , satellite navigation – and a drastic drop in price .
Speaking on stage at Apple 's Worldwide Developers Conference Steve Jobs , the chief executive of iPod maker Apple , unveiled the new iPhone 3 G – a cheaper , more powerful replacement for the handset launched a year ago .
Internet speculation had been rife about the new features that might be included on the high - end touchscreen handset , but in the end some of the rumours – such as built - in video calling - proved wide of the mark .
As reported in the Guardian , the new model will include GPS satellite navigation as well as faster 3 G internet connection and a suite of software improvements .
But the biggest news was the sharp drop in the headline price of the phone itself .
The iPhone 3 G will cost just $ 199 ( £ 100 ) – half the current $ 399 retail price in US shops .
The iPhone currently costs £ 269 in the UK , and although an Apple spokeswoman said British prices would be announced at a later date , it is understood that the phone is likely to be available for a variety of different prices depending on which tariff customers sign up to .
"" We did figure out what our next challenges are – the next mountain we have to climb , "" said Jobs at the end of a two - hour event in San Francisco .
"" The number one reason people did n't buy the iPhone was that they could n't afford it , so we need to make the iPhone more affordable . ""
The news was welcomed by industry observers , who are keen for the gadget to fulfil the hype generated over the past 18 months .
But the changes reveal some of the difficulties that Apple – which has been flying high for the best part of a decade on the success of its iPod music player – has found with moving into the phone industry . ""
If Apple knows about nothing else , it knows how to generate and exploit hype .
But to make a better version available for European consumers makes sense , "" said John Delaney , an analyst with IDC .
"" Having only achieved six million sales – and most of them in the US – I think they feel a need to light a fire underneath it . """
2008-06-09,"Each January I make a pilgrimage to San Francisco for Macworld , and the annual Steve Jobs keynote - it 's where many of Apple 's biggest announcements are made .
In the past the company 's summer powwow , the Worldwide Developer Conference ( WWDC ) has been restricted to some of the heavier , developer stuff ( hence the name ) such as operating systems , browser stuff and backend magic .
The company 's started doing more large events , however - there 's usually an iPod announcement in September , for example , and last year I watched Jobs launch the silver iMac line at the Apple offices in Cupertino , California .
But this time around I 've decided to restrain my carbon footprint for a change and follow things from London .
With a few minutes until El Jobso takes the stage , it 's all gone a bit quiet out there on the web - perhaps they 're all iPhoned out , given the insane amount of coverage recently .
Or perhaps they think they know it all .
I 've been talking to my sources about what we 're going to see today , and here 's what they 've led me to expect .
A black version 2 iPhone with 3 G capability and built - in GPS ; subsidies that will make the phone much more affordable for mere mortals and perhaps a better camera .
No word yet on storage .
Let 's get rrreeeaaaddddyyyy toooooo ruuuuuummmmbbbbllleee .
18.02 : Of course , there will be plenty of operating system stuff here today - rumours of a new release of OS X with the naff monicker ' Snow Leopard ' abound .
John Gruber has said what he thinks it 'll involve ...
I 'm no expert , but Gizmodo is showing a picture there are two iMacs on stage .
Surely two means something .
18.10 :
Oh god , it is called Snow Leopard .
What about all the other felines who have n't been graced with their operating systems ?
Lovely Manx ?
Fugly puma ?
Fortunately , Jobs has promised to do the iPhone stuff first .
Unfortunately , he 's started by talking about how businesses use it .
18.18 :
Some talk aimed at developers , discussing how the new software development kit is based on exactly the same stuff that Apple itself uses .
Handy , that .
Interestingly , I note that Techcrunch 's live blog appears to be down .
18.23 :
Apparently , according to Twitter user Seoulbrother , the Moscone West - a , where the big stage is upstairs , "" smells like nerds "" .
Thank goodness
I 'm many miles away in the confines of the Guardian offices - it just smells like sweaty armpits here .
18.28 :
They 've done a bunch of SDK demos , some testimonials and suchlike .
I do n't think you 're missing much .
Oh , and my previous comment was really an answer to commenter WilliamT , by the way - there 's no BBC beamback this time ( or if there is , I was n't invited ) and
so I 'm plugged into my international network of informants , attendees and on - the - scene reporters ( ok , yes , I 'm looking on the internet ) .
I thought this might be an interesting exercise in trying to inform and - hopefully - entertain ... and point out how little news actually happens at one of these keynotes .
18.32 :
Sega are demoing a version of Super Monkey Ball they built in four weeks and will sell for $ 9.99 through iTunes .
Engadget describes it with its usual vocabulary panache : "" Crap , these graphics look unbelievable compared to anything we 've seen on a cellphone before "" .
18.37 : Neil Turner 's right - there 's been a OS X Puma before .
But has there been a fugly puma ?
I think not .
Personally , I 'd have liked "" OS X GIANT SABRE TOOTHED CATRAWWR "" , but I realise there 's only a slim chance .
Oh , and a housekeeping note :
Twitter appears to be down , depriving me of the chance to steal witty lines from text message addicts locked inside WWDC .
It 's just you and me now , people : I apologise in advance .
18.42 :
Apparently Apple are keen to demonstrate Every .
Single .
App .
that will be in the store at launch .
( Associated Press , some games , Typepad , eBay and others ) .
I 'm not going to put you through this pain .
18.45 : Commenter Popgunbang asks whether "" crap "" is good or bad .
I could n't say ; the last time I was down with the kids I almost ended up being arrested .
Ooh , it 's a British web developer - Mark Terry , of MooCowMusic iBand , who 's got a smart little music - playing application called Band .
18.55 :
Yet More Apps .
The clock 's ticking , and no end in sight for these bits and bobs ( which are all well and good , but come on ) .
Apparently the Snow Leopard stuff is going to wait until another session later on .
19.05Jobs is back on stage , and telling us about some new stuff on iPhone : contact search , plus support for Numbers , Keynote and MS Office documents .
Bulk deletion of messages , save images , that sort of stuff that seemed obvious .
More in the SDK : language support , parental controls .
19.09 :
He 's talking about the Apps store - developers keep 70 % of the price - but the longer this preamble goes on , the less I 'm thinking the actual iPhone will be upgraded .
Oh noes !
19.14 :
Phil Schiller is on stage demoing Mobile Me - the over - the - air synchronisation tool that we 've been expecting , hosted at me.com .
Apple 's share price is dropping with each minute this goes on - it 's down 3.3 % as I write .
19.27 :
Mobileme replaces .Mac , costs $ 99 year .
Available in early July .
It does stuff , meh .
19.40 :
My prayers have been answered ( ie , I do n't look like a fool ) .
The iPhone 3 G is coming soon to countries all over the world , with a sleeker look , 3 G connectivity and GPS .
No word on price yet , but Jobs says it will be more affordable .
19.44 : The iPhone 3 G is going to sell for - $ 199 .
Wow , that 's just a £ 100 at current rates .
Actually , there 's no word on British pricing yet , according to an Apple spokeswoman , which means we could see it at a number of different prices .
19.57 :
Please excuse me for a moment -
I 'm writing this all up and trying to pin someone down for more details !
20.00 :
Snarky readers : you 're welcome - and I 'm delighted to have you on board .
The stream I was listening to crashed my browser , as well as a timing snafu which meant I was trying to file a news story for tomorrow 's newspaper , liveblog and write a news story for the website at the same time .
Yes , yes , I know : they should clone me or something .
Anyway , I do have some real information for you - apparently an announcement on British pricing will be made tomorrow morning .
20.10 :
I see one commenter , StupidGreatLump , has jumped to my defence .
Do n't worry , I 'm a big boy .
And Mum , I told you to stop commenting on these threads .
20.16 :
So , what did we learn today ?
Well , aside from being introduced to some of our more passive - agressive commenters , that Apple 's desperate to pump up sales .
$ 199 is almost certainly massively subsidised ( whether by Apple or the phone networks ) and that 's not including the inclusion of 3 G and GPS .
That certainly makes it more competitive with the other handsets in this class , and it 's got that great interface too .
I like me a Nokia , HTC and so on , but they 're bloody hard to use : at this price , iPhone is a lot more enticing
( I might even buy one , if they ditch O2 at some point ) .
Astonishingly , perhaps ( given the wildness of most Apple speculation )
our sources were pretty accurate .
Tomorrow we 'll find out whether our information on probably pricing - free with a £ 75/month contract , other prices depending on how much you splurge - was correct .
And with that , my friends , I bid you adieu ."

2008-06-13,"A piece of mine that 's just up on the site notes the effort of Long Zheng , a Chinese - born Australia - based business and web student who has set up an area on his site called Taskforce where everyone can vote on what things they 'd like done about Vista 's ( sometimes horrible ) interface .
That 's not all the piece is about ; I also look at the horror that erupted within Microsoft in June 2004 after Steve Jobs showed off the beta of Tiger , which had the Spotlight search function ( they 'd been working on WinFS , a search clone ) and pretty Dashboard graphics ( they 'd been working on Avalon )
years before them .
( The emails documenting their amazement were released as part of the antitrust case over "" Vista Capable "" stickers . )
Anyway , I had wanted to get some input from Zheng before finishing the piece , but the time difference did n't allow .
But now he 's responded , so I thought I 'd quote the Q+A here .
Q : has anyone from Microsoft got in touch about it ?
What would / have you say / said to them if so ?
Zheng : I 've definitely been in touch with several employees in and around the Windows group at Microsoft getting their feedback on the website .
As of yet , there has n't been any official communication between the "" Windows Experience "" group and I. Hopefully that will happen sooner than later and we can work together to add some official response to the feedback .
Q : where did you get the idea of putting it out to the crowd like this ?
Anything like the Dell ideastorm site ?
Dell 's Ideastorm was definitely an inspiration and starting point , as was Digg and other social bookmarking websites .
I 've always realized I was n't the only Windows user who cares about the user experience down to the last pixel , and this was hardly a project I could undertake alone
, so it made sense to invite the community as well .
Q
: do you think they 'll take any notice ?
The good news is that they already have , albeit silently .
I 've heard very encouraging words from various Microsoft employees who have all said the feedback is being looked at very closely and even as far as acted upon .
Q :
have you seen Microsoft 's Connect site at which has ,
I think , the same sort of aim ?
Any opinion ?
Funny you should ask , I 'm actually a former - and - current Windows beta tester
so I 'm familiar with the Connect portal .
I think the goal is the same - to improve the quality of shipping software , but the means are different .
For example , I believe Connect is targeted more at IT professionals whereas my site invites users from much broader spectrum to contribute .
Also , Connect users has a larger focus on the technological aspect of the products whereas the focus of my site is user experience .
There is some overlap , but I think for the most part these gather different types of feedback .

2008-06-14,"In a way , the most surprising thing about Steve Jobs 's presentation last week was how unsurprising it was .
The market had already discounted the fact that iPhone 2.0 would be a 3 G device and that its software would mesh seamlessly with Microsoft 's Exchange Server .
There were murmurs of discontent that the camera delivered a measly two megapixels , still declined to do video and lacked a flash .
There was a frisson of excitement when it was revealed that the phone had onboard GPS , and contented murmurings as some new games and other third - party applications were demonstrated .
But the only big news was that Apple is to halve the price in a dash for market share .
Of course this is bad news for Nokia , Motorola , Samsung , Sony Ericsson and others , none of whom have yet managed to come up with a device that can compete head - on with the iPhone .
But in fact the possibility that Apple might become as dominant in the mobile phone market as it is in the online music business should ring warning bells everywhere .
The iPhone is the first phone that makes accessing the internet from a handheld device seem pleasurable .
You can see that in the data about Google searches from mobiles , which shows that traffic began to soar the moment the iPhone launched .
The original version was crippled by having only GPRS mobile connectivity , but because it also came with built - in wi - fi , users could see how good its online performance could be whenever it got within reach of a wireless base station .
The 3 G version makes that kind of experience possible in a much wider range of locations .
Spool forward .
Imagine that iPhone 2.0 attains the kind of market penetration currently enjoyed by the iPod music player .
We will have entered an era when millions will routinely access the net predominantly from their handsets rather than from their computers .
We will have sleep - walked into a different world .
How come ?
Because whereas the personal computer is an open , user - configurable device , the iPhone is a decidedly closed one .
Nothing runs on it other than software approved by Apple .
This is not because the iPhone is incapable of running complex software : on the contrary , it is , in fact , a powerful Unix computer .
But users who treat it as such - for example , by installing ' unofficial ' software on it - run the risk of having their device ' bricked ' [ disabled ] the next time they synchronise it with the iTunes software on their PCs .
Of course anyone can write programs for the iPhone with the aid of Apple 's ( free ) Systems Developers Kit .
But the only way they can get them installed will be via Apple 's ' App Store ' .
And nothing will get into the store unless it 's been approved by Apple .
If Apple 's strategy succeeds , an increasing proportion of internet users will access through a gateway entirely controlled by a single company .
For delighted iPhone users , this may seem like a great idea - just as it seemed like a great idea when Microsoft brought order to the chaotic PC market by developing the de facto standard operating system , and thereby acquired the kind of dominance that became so problematic .
Steve Jobs and Bill Gates may have more in common than people realise .

2008-06-14,"Only Steve Jobs can turn the launch of a new phone into a quasi - religious ceremony .
Last week 's launch of the Apple 's latest iPhone in San Francisco was preceded by the usual feverish excitement and speculation .
When Jobs , chief executive and founder of the computer firm , finally got up to speak , audience members whooped and punched the air in triumph .
Bloggers logged minute - by - minute updates on Jobs 's utterances as if undertaking a football match commentary .
In the end , the launch was something of a letdown , though disciples of Jobs will not have a bad word said against their leader .
The phone replaces the iPhone launched last year , coming equipped with 3 G to enable faster internet access .
The only real surprise was the price - $ 199 for the 8 GB model , $ 299 for the 16 GB model - compared with $ 399 for the cheapest version last summer .
So how has Jobs inspired such fervent devotion to Apple and to what most people would just call a new phone ?
Jobs 's life story is better documented - and more unconventional - than almost any other chief executive of a leading company .
Born in 1955 , he dropped out of university after one term and took a job at video game maker Atari to save up enough money to backpack around India .
When he returned , with friend Steve Wozniak and barely out of his teens , he designed and hand - built in his garage what many people have credited as being the world 's first personal computer .
A local store put them on sale for $ 666.66 in 1976 , selling about 200 .
Apple was born , introducing the Macintosh computer less than a decade later , and more recently the iPod and iPhone .
Leander Kahney , news editor of Wirednews.com and author of Inside Steve 's Brain , calls Apple the ' magic factory ' .
Trying to explain the mystique that still surrounds the company 's product launches , he says : ' No one gets to peek behind the curtain - the products just seem to appear magically .
The whole innovation process is mystical . '
As with many myths , the cult of Jobs and Apple ( they are almost interchangeable ) is a mix of fact and carefully preserved fiction .
Jobs 's and Wozniak 's development of the Mac was a response to the launch by IBM , the dominant technology company at the time , of its own mass - market personal computer in 1981 .
Kahney says : ' He and Steve were hippy idealistic kids .
There was a motivation to take on "" the man "" .
IBM was the man and the Mac was the tool of empowerment .
They believed that technology would give power to the people .
They played this image up - but they probably believed it at the beginning . '
Jobs , a student of Buddhism and a vegetarian , was diagnosed with cancer in 2003 but the tumour was removed a year later and he has since made a full recovery .
In 2005 , he gave a moving speech to Stanford University students , apparently drawing on his brush - with - death experience : ' Your time is limited , so do n't waste it living someone else 's life , ' he said . '
Do n't be trapped by dogma , which is living with the results of other people 's thinking .
Do n't let the noise of others ' opinions drown out your own inner voice .
And , most important , have the courage to follow your heart and intuition . '
Kahney says Jobs remains very hands - on in the design of new products : ' Everything has to go through his approval .
He has his finger in all the pies . '
Former employees of Jobs say he is extremely demanding to work for , with very high standards .
Gary Allen , who runs an Apple fan site , says his management style is like a good sports coach - ' encouraging people to move past good performance and on to excellent performance ' .
He concedes , somewhat sarcastically : ' Sometimes his encouragement might seem aggressive , but apparently that 's successful in creating extraordinary products .
And apparently there are lots of people who want to experience his management style , since there is no end of applicants for jobs at Apple . '
Analysts said that the launch of the iPhone 3 G , at a lower price than its predecessor and being made available in 70 countries , marks Apple 's bid to break into the mass mobile market .
But as Paul Lee , analyst at Deloitte , points out , the company 's previous big hits - the Mac and iPod - were launched into nascent markets where no dominant incumbent already existed .
By contrast , the world is already awash with mobile phones .
Lee says : ' The mobile phone market is one of the biggest in the world .
Any vendor has to try to differentiate itself from competitors . '
Analysts say that , as with other products , Apple will gradually launch other cheaper , pared - down versions of the iPhone .
Apple , which is on track to meet its original target of selling 10 million iPhones by the end of this year , has not given any sales targets beyond that date .
But it 's unlikely the company will try to compete with the cheapest handset manufacturers , wanting customers impressed with the hi - tech iPhone to buy Apple software for the device and other products .
Charles Golvin , principal analyst at Forrester , says : ' There seems to be a halo effect on Mac sales as many consumers who come into contact with other Apple products like an iPhone or iPod end up considering buying a Mac . '
When it became public , Jobs 's cancer fuelled speculation about how Apple would cope without its founder and talisman .
Jobs watchers say that , notwithstanding last week 's launch , the company is trying to give more exposure to other executives .
Leander says : ' An Apple without Jobs would not have the same charisma or his mystique . '
But as Allen sums up : ' Jobs will always be the Guru for his fans . '

Whether he 'll return to FSJ the same or changed is another question .

2008-06-20,"Readers join in the fun at FSJ 's blog With Fake Steve Jobs taking a bit of time off ( or so he claimed ) , Fake Jerry Yang has stepped into the breach and he 's already made more than a dozen posts .

2008-07-10,"It 's a sad farewell today to Fake Steve Jobs , which has been a consistently brilliant and all - too - diverting source of entertainment for the past two years , even after the New York Times cruelly exposed him as former Forbes journalist Dan Lyons .
Lyons is throwing in the towel because he 's bored of the pretense , and though he tried introducing Fake Jerry Yang
it just was n't the same .
He 'll be starting a new blog under his real name and moving on to new and , we hope , even funnier things .
Greatest hits include : Monkey Boy 's three - legged race ( Microsoft - Yahoo merger )
"" It 's like taking the two guys who finished second and third in a 100-yard dash and tying their legs together and asking for a rematch , believing that now they 'll run faster . ""
In the worst - case scenario the merger turns into a never - ending world of shit à la AOL and Time - Warner , and Microsoft ends up gutted and gasping and then they waste another few years debating whether they should break the two companies apart and if so how do they do that
and then maybe some prick like Carl Icahn or Kirk Kerkorian jumps in and adds to the misery . ""
( That was from February , so predicting a intervention from Icahn was quite impressive ... )
Regarding my management style "" Obviously we ca n't literally put our employees ' lives at risk .
But we have to make them feel that way .
This requires a lot of psychological manipulation on our part .
But look at the result .

The iPhone development process "" This can go on for months , with round after round of emergent designs , and it 's all based on non - thinking , intuitive kind of interpretation , just an emotional reaction ...

2008-07-10,"Maybe the death of Fake Steve Jobs has previously been exaggerated , but the satirical blog may finally have ended with a post that says I 'm sailing away :

Meanwhile I 've compiled a "" Greatest Hits "" book for anyone who 'd like a small keepsake of the FSJ blog .
Real Dan Lyons , the man behind Fake Steve , has left Forbes for Newsweek , which might seem to have a somewhat cosier relationship with Apple 's egocentric and autocratic boss .

"" I hear that I 've been blacklisted , and that Apple reached out directly to Newsweek to complain about my hiring "" Dan tells us .

Still , according to The New York Times , there may be a movie in the works : Mr Lyons translated the appeal of his blog into a novel , "" Options : The Secret Life of Steve Jobs , a Parody , "" published in October by Da Capo Press , and he is writing a screenplay based on the book for Hollywood production house , Media Rights Capital .
Unlike the book , Mr Lyons said , the screenplay will feature a generic chief executive ."

Having cornered the market in digital music downloads , Steve Jobs has trained his sights on the mobile phone market .
But the iPhone has so far struggled to live up to the hype , with the launch this month of a cheaper , beefed - up 3 G version intended to boost sales .
The Apple chief is not used to coming second , having ridden high for most of the decade on the back of the extraordinary success of the iPod and iTunes , which have transformed the way we buy and consume music .
Last year 's panel was sceptical about the prospects for the iPhone and they have so far been proved right , as it has struggled to compete with Nokia and BlackBerry in the so - called "" smartphone "" market .
Jobs admitted : "" The number one reason people did n't buy the iPhone was that they could n't afford it . ""
But this year 's MediaGuardian 100 panel said it had still been a good year for Jobs , despite the failure of the iPhone to match its US success in the UK and Europe .
The Apple boss opened up several new fronts at the start of the year , with plans to launch online movie rentals and a revamped "" Apple TV "" on which to play them , trying to do for broadband - based video on demand what iTunes did for music downloads .
He also unveiled a new ultra - thin notebook , the MacBook Air , but Apple is no longer best known for its computers .
Like Google 's Larry Page and Sergey Brin , Jobs is part of the $ 1 salary club , rewarded with large share options in the company instead .
Jobs 's return to Apple in 1997 was the beginning of one of history 's biggest corporate comebacks .
He co - founded Apple in 1976 but was kicked out of the company a decade later following a power struggle .
He returned to almost single - handedly rescue it from the brink of disaster with the launch of the iMac and the iBook .
Then came the iPod , the defining product of the digital revolution .
Sales passed the 100 m mark last year , and it became the fastest - selling electronic device of all time .
Apple now has around 250 stores worldwide , accounting for 20 % of the company 's total revenue .
In 1986 , Jobs bought Hollywood animation studio Pixar , which scored massive hits with Toy Story and The Incredibles .
He sold the company to Disney in an all - stock transaction in 2005 and in the process became Disney 's biggest shareholder .

Apple 's chief executive Steve Jobs said that the new iPhone 3 G has had "" a stunning opening weekend "" .
"" It took 74 days to sell the first 1 m original iPhones , so the new iPhone 3 G is clearly off to a great start around the world , "" Jobs added .
However , the surge of demand for the new smartphone caused problems for Apple customers as sales system and upgrades were hit with technical difficulties across Europe and the US .
Analysts at RBC Capital Markets said lower pricing , pent - up demand and expanded distribution had contributed to increased interest , adding that buyers will be frustrated by limited stock and logistical problems caused by launching across 28 mobile operators in 22 countries .
But Apple will still achieve overall worldwide sales of 5.1 m iPhone 3Gs for the third quarter of 2008 , according to RBC 's forecast .
The market analysts dismissed concerns over battery life for the new iPhone , raised by some reviewers , claiming the phone still outperforms comparable handsets such as the LG Voyager and HTC Tilt .
RBC also praised the new Apple Applications store , a feature enthusiastically welcomed by the web development community , saying the simple interface for selling games , location tools and messaging features "" is reminiscent of the huge success of the marriage of iPod with iTunes "" .
Apple is expected to meet its target of launching the new 3 G handset in 70 countries , said RBC , and will sell around 14 m iPhones in the next year .
Some Apple fans in the US bought new handsets but were unable to use their new phones for several hours because the iTunes store , through which users administer their phone accounts , ground to a halt under the weight of requests .
In the UK , O2 , the exclusive mobile retailer for iPhone , saw its web - based retail system collapse on Friday , making it impossible to register and sell new handsets .
The problem persisted into Saturday when stores were unable to sell the new phones , despite adequate stock .
The gadget blog Gizmodo christened the problems the "" iPocalypse "" , while the Information Week columnist Mitch Wagner said Apple had compounded problems through "" negligence and failure to anticipate demand "" .

2008-07-21,"Nervous investors dumped shares in Apple last night on concerns over weakening profit margins and persistent rumours about the health of the technology company 's founder , Steve Jobs .
Apple 's quarterly profits soared 31 % to $ 1.07bn as customers snapped up record numbers of Mac computers , iPods and iPhones .
But the California company provided cautious guidance to Wall Street on its prospects for the rest of the year and offered little to quell speculation surrounding Jobs , whose gaunt appearance drew comment at a recent industry conference .
When asked about Jobs ' health during a call with analysts last night , Apple 's chief financial officer , Peter Oppenheimer , said : "" Steve loves Apple .
He serves as CEO at the pleasure of Apple 's board and has no plans to leave Apple .
Steve 's health is a private matter . ""
In unofficial trading after the close of the stockmarket , Apple 's shares slumped 11 % to $ 148 .
Jobs , 53 , is considered the driving force behind the company 's consistent innovation .
He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer five years ago but has recovered .
When Jobs ' apparent weight loss was noted last month , Apple said he was taking antibiotics for a minor "" bug "" .
The New York Post revived the issue yesterday by quoting unnamed industry and financial sources expressing concern .
Investors have long been worried about the lack of an obvious succession plan at Apple .
The issue surfaced last year when Jobs ' position was briefly threatened by a scandal over improper pricing of executive share options .
Questions about the entrepreneur proved a distraction from second - quarter figures which revealed Mac sales had rocketed 41 % year on year to 2.5 m computers , and iPod sales were 12 % higher to 11 m globally .
Apple sold 717,000 of its touch - screen iPhones during the three months to June .
But the company said margins were likely to weaken because of a series of factors including a "" back to school "" promotion and an unspecified product launch which is being kept strictly under wraps .
The technology company opened 16 Apple stores during the period and this week unveiled its first outlet in Beijing ."

2008-07-26,"The Steve Jobs health thing wo n't go away .
In the corner saying "" it 's private , it does n't matter "" we have Michael Gartenberg , an analyst at Jupiter Research .
And on the other side , we have Chuq von Rospach , a former longtime employee at Apple
( he left last year ) , saying it does matter - "" t is also VERY true that Steve is and continues to be a key driving point at Apple .
Ultimately , he 's the deciding factor in success / fail of products and features in many situations "" - and that Apple needs to be open about its succession plan .
And then there 's Joe Nocera , who took a call from Jobs himself quite recently .
But we 'll come to that .
Nocera 's piece is detailed and well worth reading , and argues that it does matter to shareholders who Apple 's chief executive is - perhaps more than any other public company on the planet .
That gives a duty to tell shareholders about matters that might affect the value of their stockholding .
Jobs 's health , arguably , fits that description .
But Apple has n't been forthcoming with the truth : it turns out that he was actually diagnosed with cancer in October 2003 , months before it was made publicly known , and did n't have an operation because he hoped to beat it with a diet .
( I 've got a guess which one , but I 'd need to run it past Ben Goldacre . )
It did n't work .
He had the operation in summer 2004 , after which it was made publicly known .
Investors are n't happy about it .
And Apple needs to change its ways , Nocera writes : The final reason , to be blunt about it , is that Apple simply ca n't be trusted to tell truth about its chief executive .
Under Mr. Jobs , Apple has created a culture of secrecy that has served it well in many ways — the speculation over which products Apple will unveil at the annual MacWorld conference has been one of the company 's best marketing tools .
But that same culture poisons its corporate governance .
Apple tells analysts far less about its operations than most companies do .
It turns low - level decisions into state secrets .
Directors are often left out of the loop .
And it dissembles with impunity .
And then we move to the money quote .
On Thursday afternoon , several hours after I 'd gotten my final "" Steve 's health is a private matter "" — and much to my amazement —
Mr. Jobs called me .
"" This is Steve Jobs , "" he began .
"" You think I 'm an arrogant [ expletive ] who thinks he 's above the law , and I think you 're a slime bucket who gets most of his facts wrong . ""
After that rather arresting opening , he went on to say that he would give me some details about his recent health problems , but only if I would agree to keep them off the record .
I tried to argue him out of it , but he said he would n't talk if I insisted on an on - the - record conversation .
So I agreed .
Because the conversation was off the record , I can not disclose what Mr. Jobs told me .
Suffice it to say that I did n't hear anything that contradicted the reporting that John Markoff and I did this week .
So read the article and consider it sort - of fact - checked by Steve Jobs .
I 'm interested by the "" slime bucket who gets most of his facts wrong "" thing .
Two points there : when reporters get facts wrong , it 's generally because people who know and have been asked have n't been forthcoming with them - so who 's really at fault ? ;
and I 'd heard , from someone who once worked at Apple , that "" Steve thinks of the press as insects "" .
Are slime buckets higher or lower than insects ?
After he hung up the phone , it occurred to me that I had just been handed , by Mr. Jobs himself , the very information he was refusing to share with the shareholders who have entrusted him with their money .
You would think he 'd want them to know before me .
But apparently not .
Look , Steve , my number 's available if you need to clarify anything here ...
Update : Dan Lyons - he of the now - deceased Fake Steve Jobs blog , who hung up that in part because he was so worried by Jobs 's appearance at the iPhone 3 G launch - points out that this secretive behaviour would n't be tolerated from any other company :
imagine , for example , that it was Steve Ballmer who appeared looking thin and who you were then told he 'd had "" a common bug "" .
There 's some dissonant thinking here .."
2008-08-05,"Ars Technica 's Infinite Loop says it has seen "" an internal e - mail sent to Apple employees this evening "" where Steve Jobs admitted that MobileMe was launched too early and "" not up to Apple 's standards . ""
The story says : In addition to needing more time and testing , Jobs believes that Apple should have rolled MobileMe 's services out slowly instead of launching it "" as a monolithic service . ""
For example , over - the - air iPhone syncing could have gone up initially , then web apps one by one ( Mail , Calendar , etc . ) .
Jobs goes on .
"" It was a mistake to launch MobileMe at the same time as iPhone 3 G , iPhone 2.0 software and the App Store , "" he says .
"" We all had more than enough to do , and MobileMe could have been delayed without consequence .
"" We agree with that one .
MobileMe was apparently so awful it got a negative review from The Wall Street Journal 's Walt Mossberg : Apple 's MobileMe Is Far Too Flawed To Be Reliable .
Meanwhile , Apple -- unusually , and possibly for the first time -- has been keeping MobileMe customers informed , at Steve Job 's request , says the site .
Update :
Infinite Loop has now published the full text .
It does n't add much ."
2008-08-08,"My bad habit , on Friday afternoons , was often to hit the Fake Steve blog .
I 'm still trying to make the transfer to The Real Dan , which replaced it after Apple decided it did n't like being satirized .
The two blogs have a lot in common , obviously , but not everyone is prepared to cut a real journalist the same kind of slack as a fake CEO .
Well , someone might take Dan seriously .
That also appears to include Mac cultists , for whom just being a Mac lover is not enough : as with any pseudo - religion , you have to drink the Kool - Aid , or at least give your integrity a suicide pill .
Now he 's on the hate list with the rest of us , Dan protests :
Also striking in this whole fiasco around Steve 's health is the response from the Apple faithful .
Check out the comments on this blog for a representative sample .
Criticize the PR operation at Apple , or Dear Leader himself , and the Apple faithful swarm out in droves to call you a traitor or worse .
My email inbox has even worse stuff .....
I can even understand why Apple faithful overlook the shortcomings of a new Apple product , or look the other way when Apple produces a dud .
But it 's another thing to put up with being lied to and insulted .
The reason Steve Jobs and Apple get away with this behavior is that nobody has ever held them accountable for their actions .
At the moment , Dan is working the Steve Jobs Patent Chatup Line to death : "" It 's Jerry Yang .
You think I 'm an inept nerd who does n't know how to run a company , and I think you 're sleazier than a used condom .
Got a minute to chat ? ""
"" This is Sergey Brin .
You think I 'm a spoiled hypocritical billionaire who talks smack about energy conservation while commuting to strip bars in a jumbo jet , and I think you 're an argument for making abortion retroactive .
Am I catching you at a bad time ? ""
This is Kevin Rose .
You think I 'm a self - absorbed lothario who is secretly only seventeen years old and who once bragged to BusinessWeek about being worth $ 60 million even though I did n't have a dime , and I think you 're a parasitic low - life who should be mopping booth floors with your tongue at the Lusty Lady in North Beach .
Could I bend your ear for a moment ? ""
"" This is Michael Dell .
You think I 'm the uninspiring leader of a has - been PC company that 's never created a single original product in its entire 24-year - history , and I think you 're a pus - filled fistula on the ass - crack of humanity .
Got a minute to catch up ? ""
But Dan still links to things like the sob - filled video plea , Leave Steve Jobs alone ! and the apt spoof of MobileMe called FailMe .
Problem is that Fake Steve would be a tough act for anyone to follow .
Real Dan is n't as good , but do you think he 's still worth the trip ?"
2008-08-20,"Apple Insider reports that one of its readers has received a one - line message from Apple CEO Steve Jobs about iPhone users being locked out of their third - party applications by a crash bug on startup .
It says : "" This is a known iPhone bug that is being fixed in the next software update in September . """
2008-08-28,"Bloomberg decided to update its Steve Jobs obituary , and inadvertently published it .
It was , of course , soon retracted , but not before people had saved it , and it 's all on Gawker .
It 's pretty much a business story -- hardly any personal details , because Bloomberg is a financial service -- and contains little or nothing new .
However , major publishers keep stuff like this around and then update it as required , when the need arises .
So it does n't tell you what Stevie is going to die of , or when .
As usual , some of the claims made are not entirely adjacent to the truth .
I particularly like the one that kicks off the obit : that Jobs "" helped make computers as easy to use as telephones "" .
The best comment along these lines was made by a great computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup in around 1990 : "" I have always wished for my computer to be as easy to use as my telephone ; my wish has come true because I can no longer figure out how to use my telephone . ""
Charles Arthur adds : Dan Lyons , the ex - Forbes journalist who wrote the Fake Steve blog , notes that the mistake was probably prompted by an update to the obit following Jobs 's gaunt appearance in June - after which his health became an issue that knocked millions off Apple 's value .
Lyons comments how would Apple PR handle it ?
I suppose for a while they could just stonewall by saying they were n't here today to talk about Steve , they were here to talk about how excited everyone is about [ FILL IN NAME OF NEW PRODUCT HERE ] and maybe they could buy themselves a year or two during which the Apple faithful would continue to believe Steve was really alive despite having seen reports to the contrary on the news .
But eventually people would start to notice that they had n't seen Steve around for a while , and they might even start to doubt Apple 's line about Steve missing Macworld because he was stuck in traffic .
And then what happens ?
It makes me shiver to think about it .
For this reason alone , this can not happen .
Steve Jobs can not die .
It makes you wonder quite how Newsweek is going to cover Apple stories once Lyons starts there .. in four days ' time ."
2008-08-28,"Guy Kawasaki , former "" Apple evangelist "" ( seriously , that was his title ) is now a venture capitalist , but still enamoured of things Apple .
And while Bloomberg has let Steve Jobs know how he 'll be reviewed after he shuffles off this mortal coil , plenty of iPhone owners are wondering why their gizmos die , mayfly - like , after just a day of use .
By comparison , my Sony Ericsson - which admittedly ca n't surf the parts of the net that the iPhone can , but can play music , videos and do photos ; oh , and Bluetooth - can usually sit about for seven days without a recharge .
( Of course Apple is aware of this , and has bought the semiconductor company PA Semi with the explicit aim of lengthening iPhone battery life , and plenty else besides . )
Anyhow , Kawasaki explains in a detailed post that the key to what you might call longevity is , um , not to talk too much , only fetch data each hour , turn off Bluetooth and location services and turn off 3 G reception .
He says : I do n't talk much on the phone--""talk is not cheap "" in my book .
I am totally an email / tweet centric person .
This clearly contributes to my standby time .
I consider my iPhone a "" tinytop computer that can also send and receive phone calls "" as opposed to a phone that can "" do email and browse . ""
Hang on , though - no 3 G , no location , hourly data , limited calling ?
Sounds to me like he might as well have bought an iPod Touch ... and a proper phone .
Do n't you think ?"
2008-08-29,"Poor Steve Jobs .
All he wants to do is totally dominate the technology world with his modest little consumer technology firm in Cupertino , and he 's constantly pestered by these Mactards who obsess over every last detail of all the cool new secret stuff he wants to play with on his own for a while - like the touch - screen tablet .
That , and people saying he 's , like , dead and stuff .

We 've all had our gaffes , and Lord knows some amount of that is inevitable with the amount of material published by the average news organisation .
But publishing an obituary before someone has actually died is fairly high up the list of boo - boos .
And that 's exactly what Bloomberg did late yesterday . ""
Steve Jobs , who helped make personal computers as easy to use as telephones , changed the way animated films are made , persuaded consumers to tune into digital music and refashioned the mobile , has XXXX .
He was TK . ""
Replace Xs and ' TK ' with age and details of death ...
The lengthy obituary - headed ' HOLD FOR RELEASE
- DO NOT USE - HOLD FOR RELEASE -
DO NOT USE ' - goes on to explain how Jobs started Apple with Steve Wozniak in a garage in 1976 , how he was ousted by John Sculley in 1985 , founded Pixar and launched more than a few gadgets that changed the technology world .
And then , more ominously , it talks about Jobs 's treatment for pancreatic cancer in 2004 and the concern in June this year over his gaunt appearance at the developers ' conference ; the Apple chief later said it was more than a common bug but not life threatening .
There are few companies whose destiny is believed to be so closely tied to that of its leader .
Bloomberg anticipates Apple 's stock falling in the event of Jobs 's death : "" The decline is no surprise to investors and analysts , many of whom considered Jobs irreplaceable . ""
The slip - up by Bloomberg - which , to be fair , retracted it just 30 seconds later - does underline a perception among shareholders that Apple 's biggest weakness is its dependence on Jobs , and an apparent lack of successor .
Gawker pounced all over this like a pouncy thing , but did note : "" The obit ... is a bit macabre to read but should not scare you out of your Apple shares . ""
Listed on the Bloomberg release is a fascinating list of people to contact for comment on his demise ( whenever that might be ) including former girlfriend Heidi Roizen , Oracle head Larry Ellison , California attorney general Jerry Brown and Eric Schmidt , chief executive of Google .
Perhaps he might have some advice for Apple 's future ?"

2008-09-09,"Apple underwhelmed observers on Tuesday , updating its iPod nano line , shrinking its top - end iPod Classic ( which now boasts a storage of 120 GB rather than the 160 GB versions sold previously ) and offering a software update for the iPhone and iPod Touch – but not , as had been expected , a music subscription offer through iTunes .
The event was introduced by Steve Jobs , chief executive of Apple , who began with Mark Twain 's famous line that "" Reports of my death have been exaggerated "" – a reference to the accidental publication of his obituary last month by financial services firm Bloomberg .
He also showed off a new version of iTunes – now up to version 8 – which includes "" Genius "" , which automatically makes playlists of songs that "" go together "" , based on anonymised data from other iTunes users about their playlists .
"" Sounds like Last .
FM 's scrobelizer , "" commented Mark Mulligan , music analyst at Forrester Research , as he watched the event .
Jobs also showed off the new iPod nano – now longer and with an oval profile , which has an accelerometer so that you can "" shake to shuffle "" .
They also come in multiple colours .
The iTunes Store added high - definition films , while NBC , which had fallen out with the company over its pricing strategy , had now returned to the fold – though there is no indication yet of whether Apple has acceded to NBC 's earlier demand to be able to price film and TV shows as it desired , rather than Apple 's flat pricing scheme .
Jobs also claimed that the iTunes Store is "" the number one music distributor in any format "" .
But there were no announcements about any extension of DRM - free music on iTunes , or – as Mulligan and other analysts had expected – of a subscription model for iTunes to compete with companies such as Nokia .
Jobs , making his first major public announcement since June – when his gaunt appearance sparked rumours that the pancreatic cancer that he was diagnosed with in October 2003 had recurred – still looked remarkably thin compared to his former self .
But he made no reference to the rumours , apart from the Twain quote – which was his first presentation slide ."
2008-09-10,"Apple chief executive Steve Jobs launched a series of updates to the company 's iPod music player line yesterday - and attempted to quell speculation about his health .
The physical wellbeing of the 53-year - old has been the subject of much concern recently , with investors worried that the company could suffer a dramatic reversal of fortunes if its talismanic co - founder was forced to step down through illness .
Speculation reached fever pitch after Jobs – who is in remission from a rare form of pancreatic cancer – looked gaunt and unwell during a public appearance this summer .
He subsequently told the New York Times that he had suffered a serious illness , but that it was not a return of the disease he battled five years ago .
He attempted to put those anxieties to rest on stage in San Francisco yesterday , dressed in his trademark black polo neck and blue jeans .
Although Jobs looked gaunt , he made light of the situation – and the recent incident in which Bloomberg accidentally published his obituary - by quoting Mark Twain 's aphorism that "" reports of my death are greatly exaggerated "" . ""
Enough said , "" he joked , before unveiling a series of minor updates and redesigns to the iPod line , intended to boost sales in the run - up to Christmas .
British customers will be able to buy revamped versions of three popular iPod models – the iPod classic , nano and touch – with higher memory capacity and other improvements from £ 109 .
Additional extras include nine new colours for the new iPod nano – its fourth iteration since launching just three years ago - as well as revamped iTunes software which can now create "" Genius "" playlists , suggesting songs which are similar to any track in your library .
"" The iPod nano is the world 's most popular music player and we 've made it even better for this holiday season , "" said Jobs , adding that more than 160 million iPods had now been sold worldwide .
The news failed to excite investors , however , with leaked photos of the new iPod - along with accurate reports about some of the upcoming features - taking the shine off the announcements .
On one of the weakest days of trading in US stocks for some time , shares in Apple fell by almost 4 % to $ 151.68 at the close of business .
But despite the raft of new announcements , concerns about the Apple chief 's health never fully disappeared .
Jason Chen of gadget blog Gizmodo said Jobs looked "" skinny but energetic "" , while the New York Times ' Brad Stone suggested that even the CEO 's appearance on stage would not stop the questions : "" He does look a bit thin , "" he wrote .
"" The hens are n't going to stop clucking . ""
In an interview after the event with CNBC , Jobs joked that he was underweight , but said there was little more he could do to reassure investors about his health .
"" I 'm doing fine really , "" he said , adding that he could "" stand to gain 10 or 15 pounds . """
2008-09-11,"By Robert Andrews Apple 's ( NSDQ : AAPL ) addition of a music recommendation engine to iTunes this week will have brought a nervous gulp from those already in that space .
One such , Peter Gabriel - backed TheFilter , saw fit to issue a press release last night , designed to differentiate its nascent offering from that of Steve Jobs .
CEO David Maher - Roberts said he "" genuinely welcomes "" iTunes ' new Genius feature as validating his own offering , but argued TheFilter covers a wider selection of media sources , like video and Last.fm … iTunes ' new feature recommends to listeners tracks that are similar to their current song , whether from their own library or iTunes Store .
The threat to TheFilter : its own plugin must also piggyback iTunes .
In theory , other sites - Pandora , Last.fm et al - face a similar challenge .
Apple now has something of an advantage and , if it comes down to communicating the products to users , may win there , too …
Whilst Apple says Genius finds "" songs from your library that go great together "" , The Filter explains it 's "" derived from a branch of artificial intelligence called Bayesian mathematics "" and uses "" an evidence model to derive the similarity of items , a pick - list of items that are statistically relevant by order of probability "" .

2008-09-13,"In triumph of the Nerds , Robert Cringely 's 1996 TV documentary series about the rise of the personal computer industry , Steve Jobs was asked what made Apple such an unusual company . '
It comes down , ' he said , ' to trying to expose yourself to the best things that humans have done and then try to bring those things into what you 're doing .
Picasso had a saying , "" good artists copy , great artists steal "" , and we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas . '
Before we get too sanctimonious about this , it 's worth remembering that Jobs 's adoption of Picasso 's mantra is what has made Apple such an innovative force in the computer business .
Its unique selling proposition is that it takes good ideas and turns them into products that ordinary human beings can use .
The graphical user interface of all modern computers , for example , was not invented by Apple but by researchers at Xerox 's Palo Alto lab in 1970 - 73 .
Xerox , however , proved incapable of exploiting the then - revolutionary technology , thereby providing a classic case study in fumbling the future .
Jobs recognised the potential of the Xerox interface and made it available to the world in 1984 in a consumer product called Macintosh .
Similarly , the MP3 format for compressing audio files was patented in 1987 , and music in MP3 format was widely circulating on the net from the mid-1990s .
But it took Apple to turn compressed music files into a consumer product by launching the iPod and iTunes software in 2001 .
It 's the same story with wi - fi .
The technology was around from 1990 , but in order to create a wireless network at home for most of that decade you needed to be two - thirds geek and one - third lunatic .
In 1999 , Apple turned wi - fi into a plug - and - play consumer product under the Airport brand name , and wireless networking has become ubiquitous since then .
Spool forward 12 years to last week , when the version 8 update of iTunes was released .
Having duly downloaded and installed it , users were confronted with a new feature - the ' genius button ' .
Pausing only to spit at the implicit hubris , your columnist duly agreed to the terms and conditions ( which basically involve agreeing to let Apple analyse your music library ) and sat back .
It works like this : click on a track in your iTunes music library and a sidebar pops up with a list of other tracks which are , somehow , ' like ' the one you 've chosen .
By a happy coincidence , all are available for purchase from the iTunes store .
So Van Morrison 's ' Days Like This ' triggers associations with ( among others ) '
End of the Line ' by the Traveling Wilburys
, ' World Spins Madly ' by the Weepies and - more intriguingly
- ' Waiting on a Friend ' by the Rolling Stones and several songs by Paul Simon .
But click on anything by the Beatles and the genius button turns moronic . '
Genius sidebar , ' it complains , ' could not find matches for your specific selection , but here are the top songs and albums from the iTunes store . '
Which rather gives the game away .
The ' genius ' of iTunes is really a crippled implementation of collaborative filtering , one of the oldest - and most useful - technologies to have emerged from the web .
It 's based on algorithms that filter information based on a collection of profiles of other users , working on the assumption that people with similar profiles may share similar interests .
It is what enables Amazon , for example , to suggest books , records and videos that you might like , based on your record of purchases and the information the site holds on millions of other customers .
The difference is that the range of choice and suppliers is much greater on Amazon than it is on the iTunes store .
The introduction of the genius button suggests Apple is sticking close to Jobs 's philosophy about the shameless appropriation of great ideas .
But the new iTunes feature is a pretty feeble appropriation .
It is also a lost opportunity .
Collaborative filtering improves dramatically the more people are involved .
Now think of all the tracks in the music libraries of iTunes users across the world - and then imagine what could be done .
So if you want to see it done better , try last.fm , the world 's largest social music platform ."
2008-09-30,"With Steve Jobs and the Portal to the Invisible , Esquire magazine has given Apple 's boss what almost amounts to another obituary , with the implication that he 's going to die sooner rather than later .
It says : It is true that his cancer , originating not in the ductwork of the pancreas but rather in the islets of Langerhans , is slow growing and , in the words of one expert , can be addressed "" with curative intent "" ; it is also true that even after surgery , the average patient lives about five years .
But the 6,700-word story does n't show too much respect for the living , dishing the dirt on what some people really think of him .
It says : Nobody wants to be the guy who points out that Jobs is "" an obnoxious asshole "" or "" just a horrifying human being "" -- because then Jobs has already won , simply on the basis of scale .
Better to be the ex - Apple - employee who says , "" The question is not whether he 's an asshole .
That 's beside the point .
The question is whether he can be an asshole and a good Buddhist . ""
"" For most people , he 'll go down in history as the guy who made technology user - friendly , "" says one executive .
"" But to people in business , he 'll be remembered as the guy who only did deals where he had all the leverage -- and used every bit of it .
It 's not enough that he wins .
You have to lose .
He 's completely unreasonable . ""
Author Tom Junod makes rather a lot of the fact that Jobs was adopted and apparently needs to prove himself : "" he has , shall we say , control issues that many adoptive parents would recognize .
"" He also makes quite a lot of Jobs 's desire for some sort of immortality , while pointing out that today 's iPod is tomorrow 's landfill , just like the old Sony Walkman .
Raised but not answered ( not surprisingly ) is what happens to Apple after Steve Jobs dies .
As a company , Apple is now more of a one - man show than ever before .
He is irreplaceable , and if he had n't returned to the company , it seems unlikely that Apple would have survived .
How long it would survive his death is a key question ."
2008-10-06,"On Friday , like clockwork , I got calls from three reporters asking me to defend citizen journalism ( again ) after its latest mortal sin against the gods of journalism : the report / rumour / lie on CNN 's iReport that Apple 's Steve Jobs had been rushed to hospital with a heart attack , which spread – and sent the company 's share 's diving .
Every time so - called citizen journalism muffs one , I get such calls , as if to say , look what your bratty kid is up to now .
Funny , I do n't get them – as a journalist – every time a reporter messes up .
I told these reporters that they were on the tail of the wrong story .
This may not be about citizen journalism at all .
It may be about someone trying to game Apple stock and using , nefariously , whatever tools were available .
I also told them that anyone who sold their stock on the basis of a pseudonymous post on the web was a fool who deserved what they got ( are these the same people who invested in subprime mortgages ? ) .
The proper response to this is to ask what our response should be , not to decry all "" citizen journalism "" because of this .
First , we need to recognise that life is messy .
The idea that we could package the world neatly in a box with a bow on top is a vestige of the old means of production and distribution of news : tightly controlled with the limitation - turned - luxury of time .
Ever since the creation of 24-hour cable news , we have lost that luxury of time .
Mistakes – let alone rumours and lies – go out live and the public has to learn to judge the news more sceptically .
The truth is , they always have .
But now , rather than ignoring their scepticism , we need to encourage it and educate people to think this way .
Call it media literacy .
That is one proper response .
Another response from media is that we have to get better at giving caveats .
As news rushes by , it is important that we make it clear what is and is n't confirmed .
We thought we were in the business of saying what we know in the news .
But we 're more in the business of saying what we do n't know .
I 've often quoted Gawker Media 's Nick Denton 's definition of what we bloggers call "" half - baked posts "" .
They say to our readers : "" Here 's what we know .
Here 's what we do n't know .
What do you know ? ""
Note well that CNN iReport issues a blanket caveat on everything it "" reports "" – hell , this is its tagline and slogan : "" Unfiltered .
Unedited .
News . ""
Maybe that last word is a problem , but then iReport has had lots of news , including video from the scene of the Virginia Tech massacre .
CNN president Jonathan Klein said at a McGraw - Hill conference some months ago that the point of iReport was to have a place to accept stuff from citizens and witnesses that was n't CNN .
Only that which is vetted , he said , goes up under the CNN brand .
But , of course , iReport is near the CNN brand .
It may be a mistake for news organisations to keep begging people to send them stuff .
That 's the way they think – centralised , controlling , exclusive .
But the better structure may be for journalists to curate the best of what is out on the web .
Rather than playing wack - a - mole on the occasional mistake / rumour / lie sent it , editors would better serve if they found the best content anywhere , not just among that which was sent to them .
When the web , like TV , goes live ( I can broadcast live today from my Nokia phone over Qik.com ) , news organisations will have no choice but to find and point to others ' content elsewhere because there wo n't be time to send it in .
But the sanest response to reading a report from an unidentifiable source on Steve Jobs ' health is to get on the phone to Apple and find the truth .
Note well , again , that that happened quickly online .
When I first heard this "" news "" , it was not that Jobs was sick but
that Apple said he was n't sick .
The reporters I talked to said that was what they first heard as well .
Hmm , the system seems to have worked pretty well – except for fools who sell stock based on baseless rumours .
But then , that has happened on Wall Street long before there was an internet .
The web , as it turns out , is almost as fast at spreading truth as it as at spreading rumours .
Is this a story of citizen journalism and its failings , or of professional journalism and its jealousies ?"
2008-10-14,"Today 's Apple notebook event turned out to be … an Apple notebook event , refreshing a line that looked somewhat tired but was selling very well at US retail .
( See Rejigged Apple laptops fail to excite . )
Of course , there was no netbook , no touch screen / Tablet PC model , and no $ 799 machine .
In fact , all the things we did n't expect to get , we did n't get .
Everyone who disbelieved the rumours could sit back and have the satisfaction of being right .
On the good side , Apple is moving away from the Intel Integrated graphics that are the standard in $ 499/£249 Windows PCs towards Nvidia graphics chips , including the GeForce 9400 M and 9600 M GT , which Jobs reckons gives 5x or 6x times the graphics performance .
The 9400 M goes into the MacBook Air , along with a 120 GB hard drive .
The improvements to the MacBook Pro line also look worth while , but they 're not that cheap .
The "" one more thing "" ... ... was a new version of the old plastic MacBook , with a $ 100 price cut to bring it down to $ 999 .
A MacBook for under $ 1,000 !
Whoop - de - whoo .
However , Apple seems to be in the process of abandoning FireWire , which has now disappeared from the MacBook .
That might upset a few audio and video fans .
Also , Apple still thinks two USB ports are enough -- or one on the MacBook Air .
On the other hand , Apple has continued to move towards using the Dell - backed Mini DisplayPort instead of mini - DVI .
Maybe there 's a good business in selling $ 30 dongles ( especially if people find they need both VGA and DVI adaptors ) .
Or maybe a lot of MacBook users like Dell monitors .
Still , it 's interesting to see Apple moving before DisplayPort really takes off in the marketplace … .
Engadget live - blogged the press conference , and someone asked why Apple ( which is , after all , on the Blu - ray board ) still did n't support Blu - ray .
Quote :
Steve : "" Blu - ray is just a bag of hurt .
It 's great to watch the movies , but the licensing of the tech is so complex , we 're waiting till things settle down and Blu - ray takes off in the marketplace .
""
Too complex for Apple , but not too complex for Sony to stick in a $ 399 games console ?
It 's a "" bag of hurt "" that the Windows PC world managed to negotiate a few years ago , so it 's a pity Jobs was n't more specific about the problems .
Presumably these include the need for low - level copy protection .
Obviously it could n't be some petty grudge against the fact that Microsoft 's WMV9 video is one of the mandated Blu - ray standards , where it 's called VC-1 , though finally enabling Macs to support ubiquitous WMV video should make life easier for the BBC and several zillion porn sites ."
2008-10-14,"Apple chief executive Steve Jobs today unveiled a range of updated laptops as the company attempted to keep up sales in the face of economic turmoil .
The company 's whole range of laptops has been given an injection , including its popular MacBook , MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air – which was only launched in January .
The machines have been given new designs to bring them in line with the company 's iMac desktop computers , although the current white plastic MacBook will remain on sale at the marginally lower price of $ 999 ( £ 719 in the UK ) .
All other models will now sport aluminium casing , shiny black screens and a new glass trackpad that dispenses with the traditional mouse button .
They will also switch between twin graphics processors –
both an Nvidia GeForce 9400 M and 9600 M GT - in what Jobs claimed was an attempt to boost performance and battery life . ""
Apple has invented a whole new way of building notebooks from a single block of aluminium and , just as important , they are the industry 's greenest notebooks , "" said Jobs .
"" The new MacBooks offer incredible features our users will love . ""
The new MacBooks will cost £ 949 or £ 1149 for British buyers , while the MacBook Pro will cost between £ 1399 and £ 1749 .
The MacBook Air , meanwhile , will cost either £ 1299 or £ 1799 .
Laptops have been an increasingly important part of Apple 's business .
Its most recent financial results , for the quarter ending in June , showed that the company shipped 41 % more computers than the same period last year , with portable machines counting for almost two thirds of sales .
However , Apple has been bucking the computer industry trend by refusing to launch a lower - cost line of machines .
Smaller , cheaper laptops such as the Asus Eee PC have helped drive the so - called ' netbook ' market and have convinced many consumers to stay away from the higher end models .
Despite rumours that Apple would consider releasing a lower cost laptop of its own – costing around $ 800 or £ 500 in the UK – Jobs merely lowered the price of the company 's existing MacBook model , which now looks as if it will be phased out in the coming year .
Among other rumoured upgrades which did not surface was the inclusion of a Blu - ray drive for watching high definition DVDs .
The system , which is championed by Sony and a core component of the PlayStation 3 , is struggling to entice customers to buy .
Jobs described it as a "" bag of hurt "" and said that he would not include Blu - ray in Apple machines until there was more evidence that consumers were interested – despite Apple being a member of the Blu - ray consortium which has backed the technology .
The event also featured a rare appearance by Jonathan I ve , Apple 's British senior vice president of design , who is credited with masterminding the distinct style of the iPod and iMac .
I ve discussed a new manufacturing method which allows the company to create thinner , lighter machines – including the MacBook Air , which was launched earlier this year .
The Air was among the machines to benefit most from the rejig , with a serious boost in power – which Apple hopes will help it turn around its underwhelming sales figures .
During a question and answer session with journalists , Jobs said that he considered netbooks a "" nascent market "" but would would not comment on the company 's financials –
it is due to make its latest quarterly earnings announcement next week .
Apple 's share price , which hit lows of $ 85.5 last week , has been taking a hammering recently – not least thanks to concerns that the harsh economic climate will drive down demand for its fashionable gadgets .
The value of Apple stock had been increasing ahead of the announcement in California , with early trading putting the price at $ 111 before the announcement .
However , it appears the news was not enough to convince traders to buy more shares in the 31-year - old company , as dropped more than 4 % to $ 105 immediately after the launch .
Although that marks a significant increase on the previous week 's trading , it is still a distance from the $ 140 it was pegged at a month ago ."
2008-10-15,"Apple thinks that the market for high - definition video defined by Sony 's Blu - ray is "" just a bag of hurt "" where the licensing of the technology is too complex - and its chief executive Steve Jobs said that the company is "" waiting till things settle down and Blu - ray takes off in the marketplace "" .
The remarks came after Apple refreshed its notebook computers on Tuesday night , introducing a "" pro "" version which includes two separate graphics cards and a new version of its consumer - focused MacBook line which uses an aluminium casing .
But while the notebooks were unexceptional , the launch showed that the company is unafraid of the economic downturn in the US - the only concession to price was a lowering of the cheapest MacBook to $ 999 - nor in the UK , where the price of the cheapest MacBook actually rose from £ 699 to £ 719 . ""
Apple is relying on its brand here , "" remarked Ian Fogg , an analyst with Jupiter Research .
The new machines abandon the mouse button completely in favour of a larger multi - touch trackpad on which one can make gestures using up to four fingers .
But multi - touch screens "" so far have n't made a lot of sense to us , "" said Jobs .
The launch in Cupertino was notable for the fact that Jobs shared the spotlight for the first time with Tim Cook , Apple 's chief operating officer who took over the running of the company while Jobs was in hospital in 2004 for surgery for pancreatic cancer , and then with Jonathan I ve , the company 's head of design .
Jobs alluded afterwards to the continuing speculation about whether he has had any recurrence of the cancer , putting up a slide claiming to show his blood pressure : "" This is all we 're going to talk about Steve 's health today , "" he told journalists .
Jobs shrugged off the idea of a "" netbook "" ( or ultraportable ) , saying it was "" a nascent market that 's just getting started "" .
Also notable was the absence of FireWire , the high - speed data transfer system invented by Apple , from its new MacBooks in favour of USB 2 ports .
Overall though the new machines showed that real processing power advances are coming from graphics chips , not CPUs : the new CPUs are barely faster than those of machines released six months ago , but the GPUs are dramatically more powerful .
Apple intends to use that power in future versions of its OSX operating system ( The piranhas of processing await , July 17 2008 ) ."
2008-10-17,"Down these mean streets a man must go , and if he 's carrying a modern camcorder , then it 's going to have USB 2.0 , not FireWire .
And that , in a nutshell , is why it 's farewell , my lovely , to FireWire - according to no less an authority than Steve Jobs .
There 's been plenty of outrage and despondency from would - be Apple MacBook buyers over the fact that the latest versions of the low - end laptops do n't have FireWire , the high - speed data transfer system invented by Apple and Sony that basically kicks USB 's bum ( even USB2.0 ) .
It 's being taken out the back and getting an icepick in the neck .
And for why ?
Because , as Jobs explained to an upset customer who emailed him , and reproduced at The Unofficial Apple Weblog ( which says it 's checked the headers ; we 'll take it on trust ) , "" Actually , all of the new HD camcorders ofthe past few years use USB 2 . ""
The guy 's complaint being that "" I used to tell friends : ' you can easily connect your digital camcorder and edit your own movies ! '
Now I 'll just tell them that Dell and Sony still make affordable laptops that have a firewire [ sic ] connection . ""
( I had almost exactly the same conversation with my own brother , who 's considering a MacBook :
I had to ask the video question , since people update their camcorders less often than their computers , I think . )
True , Pure 's Flip and the Kodak Zi6 and others do use USB2 - even though it 's an inferior method for data transfer compared to Firewire ( the reasons are complex , but basically USB2 involves the CPU , while FireWire is peer - to - peer , so if you 're doing anything at the same time as moving data , Firewire is faster ) .
So wait - FireWire is faster , yet USB2 wins out ?
Yup .
Why ?
Because USB was originally driven by a group that included Intel , which pushed it further with USB2 .
Intel dominates in this field ; the Intel - backed standard wins .
It 's a classic case of "" good enough "" coming through in technology .
( Apple uses FireWire for other things beside video , including a "" Target Disk Mode "" that lets you boot from an external FW drive - useful for repairing problems on your main disk from a backup , or transferring data from an old computer to a new one .
That 's not possible with USB2 , apparently . )
So say a long goodbye to FireWire ; it became the little sister to USB .
It 's getting pushed out of a high window and you might not see it again .
[ Ta PointyShinyBurning for suggesting "" a long goodbye "" . ]"
2008-10-21,"Two of the technology industry 's biggest names faced wildly different futures last night after announcing quarterly results .
While Apple boss Steve Jobs hailed the "" spectacular "" iPhone last night as the company posted a dramatic increase in profits for the last quarter , his opposite number at Yahoo , Jerry Yang , announced plans to slash 1,500 jobs at the internet company .
Apple shipped more than 2.6 m Mac computers , 11 m iPods and almost 6.9 m iPhones , raising profits by 26 % and leading to revenues of $ 7.9bn and profits of $ 1.14bn for the quarter ended last month . ""
Apple just reported one of the best quarters in its history , "" Jobs said , hailing the sales lead the new iPhone 3 G scored over the market - leading BlackBerry . ""
In terms of revenue , Apple has become the third largest mobile phone supplier in the world . ""
Meanwhile , Yahoo continued to struggle , with net income down 64 % to $ 54 m despite a 1 % rise in revenue .
"" We have been disciplined about balancing investments with cost management all year , and have now set in motion initiatives to reduce costs and enhance productivity , "" Yang said .
It has been a troubling year for Yahoo and Yang in particular , who took over from Terry Semel in June 2007 , but has come under scrutiny after a disappointing tenure .
This year Yahoo rebuffed a $ 44bn takeover bid from Microsoft , instead making a deal to sell part of its advertising through Google - an agreement that is now under investigation by America 's department of justice over allegations that it is anti - competitive ."
2008-11-19,"When Dan Lyons joined Newsweek , it appears he had to give up his popular Fake Steve Jobs persona * , and in July , Fake Steve started blogging at Real Dan instead .
This has included some pretty pungent stuff , but recently the pungent stuff has started vanishing .
And according to The Industry Standard -- The Real Dan Lyons bails on blogging -- he may have stopped altogether .
One post referred to Jerry Yang 's decision to step down as boss of Yahoo .
Lyons had been assured that Yang was n't stepping down and that the Google deal was "" a sure thing "" but neither turned out to be the case .
On his blog , he intemperately referred to Yahoo 's "" PR operators "" as "" really an unsavory bunch "" and a "" crack team of lying sacks of shit "" .
( Come on , Dan : PRs just tell you what the company tells them to tell you .
That 's their job . )
Not surprisingly , this post has now been withdrawn .
Another post railed at Kara Swisher from the Wall Street Journal 's All Things Digital blog for puffing her "" EXCLUSIVE SCOOP "" on Yang 's announcement : she sent Dan a note chiding him for not crediting her .
That post -- Kara Swisher :
Everybody look at me !
Not at Jerry !
At me !
At me !

( Sure , All Things D is n't very good and it 's insufferably smug , but if you trash publications on those grounds you 'll soon be reduced to reading cereal boxes . )
The Industry Standard has republished the texts of the deleted posts .
But it must be tough for Dan Lyons .
He could say more or less what he liked as Fake Steve because it was satirical ( many a true word spoken in jest , as they say ) , and that brought him a big audience .
He ca n't say the same sort of things as Real Dan and a Newsweek employee , so he does n't have a big audience .

2008-12-12,"When both Steve Jobs and Bill Gates announce something separately but simultaneously , you know it ought to be important .
And so it was with the "" digital home "" and especially the idea that computers would be the "" digital hub "" of the home , which – weirdly , because I do n't think they rang each other up to coordinate it
– both Jobs and Gates did in January 2001 at their respective speeches at Macworld in San Francisco and the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas .
And around about now , that vision is coming true .
Except that it 's not the computer they thought which is at the hub .
It 's a rather different one that had n't even been considered at the time , using a technology that had only just begun to get traction .
That would be the iPod Touch , and Wi - Fi .
Here 's Chris Espinosa ( an Apple employee ) as an example .
Here 's what he was doing last night :
"" Enforcing kids ' bedtime by VNCing into their Mac from my iPhone and closing their windows .
Modern tough Dad . ""
( VNC is a remote access program : you tell it the IP address of the machine you want to go to , and if it 's set up to allow you in , you can control it right there . )
OK , so to many that 's a method that 's beyond geeky –
is it so much trouble to talk ?
–
but it 's indicative .
I think Wi - Fi - enabled devices , plus Wi - Fi , are the real home hubs that Gates and Jobs had begun to imagine .
But they could n't really describe them then without sounding too futuristic .
Take another product : earlier this week I was stunned by the quality and ease of the iPhone / iPod Touch controller for the Sonos multi - room music system .
A free software download can transform your iPhone or Touch into a controller for the wireless system , which can play different tracks ( or internet radio , or stuff from a line in , such as your TV set ) all around your house .
Very impressive when you consider that the stand - alone controller costs £ 279 .
( The software to control the system is also a free download for your computer , but who wants to be jumping up and down twiddling their computer rather than listening to music ? )
And another : the latest release of Keyboard Maestro , a key - capture - macro - launcher program for the Mac : it "" adds to the macro utility a Keyboard Maestro Control app for the iPhone and iPod touch that enables users to execute any macro from your iPhone or iPod touch , just as though you were sitting at your Mac .
Possible uses include launching or quitting applications , restarting or shutting down the Mac ... iTunes song rating capabilities for the current track , iTunes volume controls , and a variety of interface refinements .
"" To me , that sounds worth the price of the upgrade ( I 've got an ancient version ) on its own .
Together these technologies are creating an environment where you can control all sorts of devices around the house from that small handheld device .
A growing number of homes use
Wi - Fi
– it 's the only connection the Wii comes with , and wireless routers are being pushed for all they 're worth by BT and other broadband providers .
( About time ; those USB broadband modems are beneath useless . )
To be honest , I 've been expecting something like this for ages .
When the rumours began flying in October 2001 of some "" revolutionary "" product Apple was going to introduce , I thought that the obvious thing was a Wi - Fi tablet that would connect to your computer and network and do things .
( I 'd already discovered the joys of Wi - Fi in January 2001 . )
So when Jobs announced a digital music player - the same sort of thing
Rio had been doing for years –
I was , to say the least , disappointed .
Which is why I kept expecting the iPod to be turned into a platform .
Which now , of course , it is .
And Wi - Fi is really making inroads at home .
Almost 30 % of homes have it , according to research by Forrester , against only 12 % with a wired home network .
Even in 2003 , nearly a third of US broadband users at home used Wi - Fi .
( Feel free to be amused by the phrase in that story which talks of "" lean economic times "" , by the way . )
Even a drive - by test by Peter Cochrane , plus a bit of figure - wrangling , suggests at least 7 % of homes using it in early 2007 .
These things cascade .
The mistake that other companies have made is in thinking that you want to have their remote control to do these things .
You do n't , any more than you want a remote control for every single gadget in your house ( even though that 's how it ends up ) .
Universal Remote Controls tend to sell well ( even though Stephen Fry swears he 's never found a good one ) .
None of this precludes other companies from making their own machine that you can use to control your network - aware devices .
The problem is , they wo n't have the penetration .
The iPod has driven all before it , and the iPhone shows signs of doing precisely the same in the smartphone market .
I 'd advise companies like Microsoft ( with Windows Mobile ) and Google ( with Android ) to start cosying up to companies like Sonos pronto .
Not , of course , that they need much encouragement from me .
But now , the universal remote is on the way .
Network - connected devices just need to listen for their orders over the network , and with Wi - Fi you 've got a way in .
( So if you update your favourite radio stations or playlists for the Sonos gear on your iPod Touch , that 's transmitted to the related devices , including the dedicated controller , if you have one . )
But this is only the first step .
Think bigger .
Do you know what the temperature is in all the rooms of your house ?
Is the hot water on ?
As it gets easier to make sensors that can talk to the network as well , it becomes easier to control your home via a real home hub .
Turn the radiators down in rooms you are n't in .
Turn off the hot water .
Let your home tell you how it is .
( An example : Andy Stafford - Clark of IBM has a home with a Twitter feed .
How 's his hot water doing ?
And you can read more at this page . )
And if that were n't enough to convince you that this is all coming down the rails like a train without brakes , there 's Bill Thompson , who describes his connected home to the BBC 's Rory Cellan - Jones :
We watched as Bill and his 16-year - old son Max put the system through its paces – selecting iPlayer programmes to stream onto the wall , watching YouTube videos , and using the Xbox 360 – not just to play games , but to store and play video previously downloaded to Bill 's desktop computer .
Yup , it 's all coming .
Hell , it 's about time that we could see some gleams of light amidst all this depressing talk .
Let 's build ourselves out of the recession .
Technology seems as good a way as any ."

2008-12-17,"Every year , the Mac Faithful trek to the Macworld Expo to show their adoration for Apple co - founder and chief executive Steve Jobs , and to see whatever magic bit of kit he is about to introduce .
But all the pre - Macworld speculation about Mac - netbooks , a new Mini etc did n't come up with Jobs opting to stay home and let marketing man Phil Schiller do the keynote sales pitch on January 6 .
The official announcement also says that "" this year is the last year the company will exhibit at Macworld Expo "" , which is bad news for the IDG - run show .
Apple pulled out of Macworld Boston a few years ago , so it will be interesting to see if the San Francisco event survives without the proprietary company .
Psystar World ?
I think not .
El Jobso 's stage presentations generate a fantastic number of column inches round the globe of the sort money ca n't buy .
However , Apple 's press release says , basically , that it does n't need the show any more : Apple is reaching more people in more ways than ever before , so like many companies , trade shows have become a very minor part of how Apple reaches its customers .
The increasing popularity of Apple 's Retail Stores , which more than 3.5 million people visit every week , and the Apple.com website enable Apple to directly reach more than a hundred million customers around the world in innovative new ways .
However , it just so happens that there is an even bigger show on in Las Vegas every year at the same time .
Better still , this show is actually about consumer electronics , since it 's the Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) .
It 's a show that Apple has ignored , perhaps partly because Microsoft co - founder Bill Gates has been doing the opening keynotes , and Jobs is too proud to be a support act .
However , Bill Gates has retired , and while Steve Ballmer is doing the next CES opener , it 's not hard to see Jobs upstaging him .
CES wants publicity and it wants to attract visitors , and I reckon Jobs would bring in a lot more punters than Ballmer .
I 'm speculating , of course .
But it does n't sound unreasonable .
There 's also , inevitably , a different sort of speculation going on -- about Steve Jobs 's health .
Jobs appears to lap up the adulation he gets at Macworld , and he 's missing the chance for a blockbuster finish .
Would he really pass that up ?
He might , if he really was ill .
He might , if he was planning to switch to speaking at CES .
If neither of those applies , is he telling the Macworld faithful that he does n't need them any more ?"
2008-12-17,"As you could have guessed , the reaction to the announcement that Steve Jobs wo n't be giving the keynote at Macworld - for the first time in 12 years - and that Apple will not be exhibiting there after 2009 ( if there 's a 2010 show .. ) has split people pretty much into two camps .
Well , perhaps three .

: Apple 's withdrawal is a smokescreen for Jobs being ill again .
Camp 2 : Apple 's withdrawing because it does n't like exhibiting there , and Jobs does n't want to do it because expectations always get boosted too high .
There is though a Camp 3 :
Apple does n't like it and Jobs
is ill again .
Into all this I 'll throw two perhaps pertinent points .
Phil Schiller has taken the place of Jobs before : September 2004 , at the French Macexpo .
When Jobs was recovering from surgery to remove the original cancer .
Schiller was very funny - and announced the flat iMac , which was a big move for Apple .
So let 's ignore the "" Apple does n't have anything big to announce "" lines .
The other data point : the five - year survival rate for neuroendocrine tumour ( for which Jobs was operated on ) is quoted as 67 % or a less encouraging 50 % ( see supporting article ) - but the latter also suggests that if you hit five years , you 've beaten the disease .
Anyway , here 's a roundup from various places so you can join in the triangulation game too .
Joe Wilcox : the "" last show "" announcement
is a cover : Good PR works like this : Bad news obscures even worse news .
Because the topic of the press release is that this will be Apple 's last Macworld , many bloggers and journalists will write mainly about that .
Jim Cramer on CNBC : sources inside the company tell me that Jobs 's decision was more about politics than his pancreas .
Sources tell me that if Jobs for some reason was unable to perform any of his responsibilities as CEO because of health reasons , which would include the Macworld keynote , I should "" rest assured that the board would let me know . ""
Silicon Alley Insider : Time for Apple fans to freak out : possible reasons
: Apple is phasing out trade shows ( "" almost certainly not the reason Steve wo n't be giving the keynote "" ) ; Apple wants to let other executives share the limelight ( "" A good idea , but not this way "" ) ; Steve just wants to pop out of a cake or something and stun his adoring fans ( "" possible "" ) ; Apple , Steve , and Macworld are having some sort of business dispute ( "" possible "" ) ; Apple expected to have an exciting product or two to announce , but it has now realized that they wo n't be ready ( "" This one makes sense "" ) ; Steve is sick ( "" At this late date , given Steve 's history , we regret to say this also seems plausible "" ) .
Valleyag : [ the ] stock market 's fear
is that Steve Jobs is dying .
( Come on , guys , you 're hardly trying there . )
Good Morning Silicon Valley :
the ones who are really sick are the folks at expo organizer IDG , who are now wondering why Santa hates them .
Kara Swisher 's Boomtown
: the announcement will Renew rampant and unsubstantiated speculation about the health of Apple CEO Steve Jobs , which will immediately impact the stock of the tech icon .
FT.com
Tech blog :
With Apple once again refusing to address the issue of its CEO 's health , the speculation that follows this cancellation will be intense .
Jason Snell at Macworld :
What went wrong ?
I do n't know anything about Steve Jobs ' health .
And I really do hate idle speculation about the health of a human being .
( Though I do believe that if he 's terminally ill the shareholders ought to be informed .
Otherwise , it 's nobody 's business but his own . )
Who knows the real reason for the exit of Jobs from the keynote ?
There are a nearly unlimited number of reasons that do n't involve the man 's medical history .
Maybe there simply were n't any earth - shattering products ready .
Maybe someone at IDG offended someone at Apple .
Maybe a product that was intended for release at Expo has been delayed , either for technical reasons or because today 's economy would make it a bad time to launch a new product .
So , which of the three explanations do you prefer ?
And how does it explain both the Schiller presence and the future Apple absence ?"
2008-12-17,"Apple chief executive Steve Jobs will not be giving the keynote address at the Macworld show in January for the first time in 12 years , raising more questions about his long - term health .
Instead of taking to the stage in San Francisco to unveil the company 's latest products – an event that has become something of a fixture in the technology industry - Jobs will be replaced by Phil Schiller , one of Apple 's senior vice presidents .
No reasons for Jobs 's withdrawal were given , but in a statement Apple said that it was making a long - term decision to reduce its activity at trade shows and conferences – adding that after 2009 's event was over , the company would no longer hold any kind of keynote at Macworld . ""
It will be Apple 's last keynote at the show , "" said the statement .
"" Apple has been steadily scaling back on trade shows in recent years . ""
However , the decision to drop Jobs in favour of one of his subordinates is cause for concern among those who follow the company closely , rekindling speculation about the health of the 53-year - old .
Jobs was diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer in 2003 , though he put off treatment until mid-2004 .
Although an operation to treat it was deemed successful , he has looked gaunt in recent public appearances and has started making significantly shorter appearances on stage .
Joe Wilcox , a business analyst who watches Apple , said the decision casts new doubt on Jobs 's wellbeing . ""
In business perception is everything .
So it 's tantamount that Steve get up on stage and keep up the image .
Macworld is still a huge media event , mainly his keynote , "" he said .
"" From that perspective , there would have to be something big to offset the many reasons why Steve should keynote Macworld .
I come back to his health .
I think that 's the real news here , what today 's last Macworld announcement seeks to obscure .
Steve is n't well , and he has n't been for some time . ""
According to Gene Munster , an analyst for Piper Jaffray , Apple was not settling Wall Street 's concerns .
"" I think that Apple could have done a lot to have made it so people would n't speculate about Steve Jobs ' health , "" he told the Associated Press .
Immediately after the announcement , Apple 's stock fell by nearly 2 % in after - hours trading .
Jobs has given the keynote speech at the event since 1997 , leading to it being nicknamed the "" Stevenote "" .
Over the years he has regularly delivered two -- hour speeches in which he commands the stage almost throughout .
But in recent months Jobs has been handing more public duties to executives including Schiller , as well as chief operating officer Tim Cook and Briton Jonathan
I ve , the award - winning designer of the iPod .
His gaunt appearance at June 's Apple Worldwide Developers ' Conference led to speculation that the cancer had returned , and while the company has previously denied such reports , it is believed his dramatic weight loss was linked to treatment he had been receiving while in remission .
In October , Jobs tried to joke about the concerns over his health during a presentation to unveil new laptops when he put up a slide saying "" 110/70 "" , saying that was his blood pressure - and that he would take no other questions on his health .
That seemed to put the rumours to rest , but the latest announcement will spark them again .
Wall Street has been nervous about the company 's ability to come through the economic downturn with the same growth , judging it to be highly reliant on the consumer side of the economy , which has been very weak in the US .
Apple however has enormous cash reserves and could almost certainly ride out any financial bad weather .
What is less clear is how well it could weather a prolonged illness or absence of the man who is acknowledged to have breathed new life into it when he rejoined in 1996 , and is now seen as its figurehead and driving force .
The announcement meanwhile that Apple will not exhibit at future Macworld Expo shows almost certainly spells the death knell for the show - which will struggle to justify its existence without either Jobs or its principal supplier to draw crowds .
It may end up rolled into the Consumer Electronics Show , which runs at the same time - although in past years Jobs 's presentations have damped CES 's announcements so thoroughly that that show , held in Las Vegas , has shrunk in both size and impact .
Wil Shipley , an independent software developer , criticised the show as expensive : "" Small booth : $ 15,000 You wanted internet ?
$ 1,000 .
You wanted curtains ?
$ 4,500 .
Decent carpet ?
$ 2,000 .
Power ?
Trash cans ?
..
You wanted extra outlets ?
Have to hire one of our union electricians .
How many hours you want him for ? ""
Apple 's fortunes have been directly linked to Jobs , who has spearheaded its renaissance since rejoining in 1996 after a decade in exile from the company he co - founded .
In the process Apple has almost attained the status of a personal cult , identified with Jobs far more than Google or even Microsoft ever have been with their leaders .
Apple lost direction in the years after Jobs was ousted , its share price slumping to an all - time low before his return .
Under Jobs , the company has gone from strength to strength , establishing itself as a byword for innovation and elegant design .
The launch of the iMac and iBook were followed by the iPod , which was not the first – or even to some minds the best – digital music player but led a revolution in the consumption of music thanks to its sleek and user - friendly design .
In 2007 , Apple enhanced its reputation for technological innovation with the launch of the iPhone , a touchscreen smartphone that marked a step change in the mobile world ."
2008-12-17,"The Macworld Expo has become an annual pilgrimage for thousands of Apple devotees .
But the undoubted highlight is usually the keynote address by Apple chief executive Steve Jobs - famous for his whooping fans and "" one more thing "" catchphrase .
He has been delivering the speech since 1997 - during which time his two - hour performances and high - profile product launches have helped lift Apple out of the doldrums and back to the top of the technology heap .
Here are his best moments - and his worst .
1997
Jobs makes a triumphant return to the company he was ousted from 1985 .
Clad in a sweater vest and glasses , he announced a radical shakeup of the company 's board - it had been on the verge of collapse - and an investment from great rival Microsoft .
Before the year was out he had regained his position as the company 's chief executive .
1998
The first serious signs of a road to recovery are made as the colourful and innovative translucent iMac is unleashed .
Aimed bringing Apple to a new generation of computer users - those who wanted to surf the web - it helped re - establish the company 's mantras of style and innovation .
1999
Jobs builds on the iMac 's success with the iBook , which helped popularise Mac laptops , and announced the Airport wireless base station - a gizmo that kickstarted the trend towards Wi - Fi ... something many people now see as a basic requirement for home computing .
2000
A resurgent Jobs trumpeted the launch of a new desktop Mac , the 8-inch G4 Cube - which he said was "" quite possibly the most beautiful product we 've ever designed "" .
Beauty was n't enough however , and the Cube flopped - proving too expensive for consumers and with a number of problems .
It was discontinued in July 2001 .
2004
Three years after Apple had introduced the iPod , raising some eyebrows along the way , it was already starting to take command of the digital music industry .
The iPod Mini - a smaller , leaner , fashionable machine - quickly became the fastest - selling model , and helped the iPod explode into the mainstream .
2007
Huge speculation had built up over the subject of 2007 's Stevenote , with rumours of Apple 's entry into the mobile phone business .
In the end the iPhone - which incorporated a touchscreen iPod and web access - received a rapturous response .
The device was eventually released that summer to great excitement , and got a major rehaul the following year ."
2008-12-17,"Apple created a stir yesterday with the news that Steve Jobs would not be giving the keynote speech at Macworld early next month , and would no longer go to Macworld Expo events .
Apple had already dropped out of Apple Expo in Paris , France , which was held in September this year .
Now comes the news that "" Reed Exhibitions will not hold Apple Expo Paris in 2009 , "" according to Macworld .
It seems to be a bad time for trade shows , because CNet is now reporting that "" Novell just announced that it is cancelling its annual BrainShare conference . ""
Apparently registrations were down … .
Several other shows have been cancelled , including the 2009 European Road Transport Show ( ERTS ) at the RAI in Amsterdam , the Brisbane International Motor Show in Australia , and the Welsh Hospitality trade show in Carmarthen ."
2008-12-18,"For a dozen years it has been the launchpad for some of the most high - profile new technologies in the world - including the first glimpses of the iMac and the iPhone .
But Apple has shocked the hi - tech industry with the news that its chief executive , Steve Jobs , will no longer be making his keynote annual address to the industry at the Macworld Expo in San Francisco .
The event has become something of a pilgrimage for the company 's fans , with Apple 's 53-year - old co - founder regularly holding court for two hours as he announces its latest much - hyped gadgets .
This year , however , spectators will have to make do with an appearance by Apple 's senior vice president , Phil Schiller .
In a statement , Apple said the move was part of a decision to end its overall involvement with Macworld - which is run by the media and conference company IDG .
"" It will be Apple 's last keynote at the show , "" said the statement .
"" Apple has been steadily scaling back on trade shows in recent years . ""
However , the decision to pull Jobs out of the show , just three weeks before he was due to take the stage , has caused concern on Wall Street .
Some experts said they had fresh worries that Jobs , who survived cancer in 2004 , could be very ill . ""
In business , perception is everything , so it 's tantamount that Steve get up on stage and keep up the image , "" said Joe Wilcox , a business analyst .
"" Macworld is still a huge media event .
There would have to be something big to offset the many reasons why Steve should [ attend ] Macworld .
I come back to his health .
That 's the real news here , what today 's announcement seeks to obscure .
Steve is n't well . ""
Apple spokesman Steve Dowling said the decision to pull Jobs out of the show indicated the company 's intention to stop exhibiting at Macworld .
"" It does n't make sense for us to make a major investment in a trade show we wo n't be attending any more . ""
Jobs was first diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003 , although the news was kept under wraps for more than a year .
After failing to treat his condition using only a special diet , Jobs - a strict vegetarian - underwent surgery to remove a neuroendocrine tumour in July 2004 .
Although the operation was deemed successful , over the past year he has looked gaunt at public appearances .
In October he tried to joke about the concerns over his health , but the latest announcement has fuelled them again , with Wall Street nervous about the company 's ability to come through the economic downturn with the levels of growth it has seen in recent years .
Apple 's recent fortunes have been directly linked to Jobs , who spearheaded its renaissance after he rejoined it in 1996 , following a decade in exile .
The firm has large cash reserves that could help it through difficult times , largely thanks to the success of the iPod , but it is less clear how well it could weather the absence of the man seen as its driving force ."
2008-12-19,"My , my , what a busy week .
If it was n't zero - day flaws here , it was bargain basement space shuttles there .
Oh , and there was something or other about Steve Jobs too .
Anyway , with only a few days until Christmas my thoughts are beginning to turn to the season of goodwill - and , more disappointingly , to my current lack of festiveness .
We have n't put up decorations yet
( the explanation not a long story , just a boring one ) , and I 've still got to go and buy presents ( shhh , do n't tell anyone ) .
In any case , this will be our last Friday Afternoon Question before December 25 descends upon us - and that means there 's only one possible thing I could ask : What do you want for Christmas ?
Me ?
I 'm easy to please : I would be very happy indeed if Father Christmas could make it so the shoe had n't missed .
Your answers in the comments ; best one wins good tidings ."
2008-12-22,"Daniel Lyons , who used to write the Fake Steve Jobs blog , has written up Real Steve for the 5 January issue of Newsweek , where Jobs is 34th in the Global Elite .
( Barack Obama gets the top slot , while Warren Buffett is 19th and Oprah Winfrey 47th . )
There 's no doubt about Jobs 's success , but there are now questions about how long he 's likely to keep running Apple .
As Lyons says : Sadly , Jobs looks a lot older than his 53 years , and even before he pulled out of Macworld , much of the buzz about Apple was focused on who might succeed him as chief executive .
It 's hard to imagine any mere mortal attempting to fill his shoes .
Anyway , it 's good to know Real Dan is still alive .
He has n't posted any stories on his own blog since November 17 , though there were some posts about Yahoo that were withdrawn .
The Industry Standard story dated November 19 -- The Real Dan Lyons bails on blogging -- has proved to be true ."
2008-12-23,"Macworld Expo in January could see the announcement of a new iMac by not - Steve Jobs , Phil Schiller .
According to DigiTimes in Taiwan : The Chinese - language Economic Daily News ( EDN ) has cited sources inside the component supply chain as saying that Apple plans to launch a new iMac all - in - one PC in the first quarter of next year , and the company 's sole manufacturing partner , Quanta Computer , is gearing up to supply monthly shipments of around 800,000 units during the first quarter of 2009 .
Mac fans are also expecting a new version of the "" woefully outdated "" Mac Mini , and have been for months .
As DigiTimes notes : "" In addition to Apple , Quanta is also manufacturing all - in - one PCs for Sony and NEC . """
2008-12-30,"Gizmodo has posted a rumour from one of its normally reliable sources under the headline : Steve Jobs ' Health Declining Rapidly , Reason for Macworld Cancellation .
This would be big news , if it were true , but the odds are against .
Apple has n't commented , even though its shares took a hit on the rumour .
All Things D points to a CNBC video response , as follows :
But CNBC 's Jim Goldman – who earlier this month reported that Jobs 's decision to skip the Macworld keynote had nothing to do with his health – is calling BS on the Gizmodo report .
"" I spoke to Apple after these headlines crossed and the company , which officially does n't comment on rumors , reiterated the reasons it offered two weeks ago :
Apple was pulling out of Macworld because the company did n't see the need to continue its investment in the expo , which included Steve Jobs 's keynote .
I was told this morning ( Tuesday ) that nothing has changed since then .
The same reasons apply today that applied two weeks ago .
I was told two weeks ago by sources inside Apple that the decision had nothing to do with Jobs 's health .
I got the same message today .
Period .
"" Gizmodo had itself argued in October that by shifting the emphasis to other people in the company , Steve Jobs was "" preparing his farewell "" .
However , this does n't look like a problem that 's going to go away until Jobs actually retires .
Some investors clearly think Jobs 's health is a material factor , and Apple has a duty to disclose material factors that affect the company , but how much concern does there have to be to make that happen ?
Who measures it ?
Who decides ?
Well , it would be pretty simple to rig Steve up with health - monitoring equipment so everybody could track his condition on a minute - by - minute basis .
The results could be distributed via a special How 's Steve ?
icon on the iPhone .
Or , of course , Apple could sell tickets … .
iHealth monitoring of some sort is likely to become a very big business as the US population ages , so it could help propel Apple into a whole new growth phase ."
2009-01-02,"Even two years after I left Apple , I still feel like I celebrate two Christmases : the one I celebrate with my family , and the one in January that we celebrate when Steve Jobs gets up on stage and says : "" I have a few things to show you today that I think you 'll really like . ""
When I worked there , the MacWorld speech was always the point at which most of us stopped work and gathered around the screens – there was always a big gathering and a special screen in the restaurant .
Work would stop for a while as everyone enjoyed the surprise .
And for most of us it was a surprise ; only for those in the small teams working on , say , the iPhone or the new release of Apple 's office suite iWork would know precisely what was coming ; and even they did n't know what the other teams had .
And afterwards people talk about it for days ; and the staff discount means that there are plenty of orders right after the speech ends .
Only , of course , this year it wo n't be Steve .
It 'll be Phil Schiller , Apple 's own Vice President of Demos , as we liked to call him , because he 'd always be the second guy who 'd come out to help Steve out .
I 'll still tune in with great anticipation , and while people are already predicting there will be no major announcements , I 'm not so sure .
Instead , I think this is the first step in proving to the Apple community ( and investors ) that while Steve 's vision is important to Apple , Apple is not Steve , and Apple will not disappear when Steve retires from the company – which he is going to do , sooner or later .
Lots of people are making noise about this change , because they find change unsettling – but Apple 's history shows that these kind of changes are common , and once people settle in and get used to the changes , they generally find they had nothing to worry about and that the new Apple is pretty good .
We 'll probably look back to this event in a couple of years and wonder why we were so worried , too .
The fact is , MacWorld causes all sorts of problems for Apple 's workers , and is an expensive proposition for the company to be ready for .
It usually meant a bunch of people had to work through the Christmas break to make deadlines , and then get compensatory time later .
It 's terribly timed to Apple 's sales cycle : right after the holiday buying season .
Who really wants to announce new stuff then ?
It tended to force products out on a schedule Apple could n't affect , so sometimes products missed the deadlines and had to wait for another opportunity like WWDC , or it was pushed out the door early .
Early on , Apple needed Macworld and the hype to generate interest and excitement , but it 's been pulling back from it for about five years , moving introductions to other venues or to special events – or in many cases , just issuing press releases .
The hype machine was part of the plan to get people interested in Apple again , back when Steve needed to save the company , but today , the need for flexibility in releasing things outweighs the advantage of the large stage
Macworld presents Apple .
Apple has proven it can create its own events when it needs them , too , which limits the need to continue supporting and being part of Macworld .
Why is Apple pulling out now ?
The budget was probably the last nail in the coffin , but this one 's been in the shop for years , being built for when it was needed .
So it 's going to change .
But that 's life at , and with , Apple .
Most people do n't know what to think when they find out I spent 17 years at Apple ; in a time and an industry where job longevity sometimes seems counted in hours , spending that much time with one company seems almost impossible .
When I 'm asked how I stayed that long , the only honest answer I can come up with is "" one day at a time "" .
I went to work for Apple in February of 1989 for simple reasons : I loved the technology .
It was a company that I felt could make a difference and improve society , and I wanted a chance to help make those changes .
I think it 's safe to say that most people who go to work for Apple go for similar reasons ; Apple is a rare breed of company , one not afraid to try to improve the world around it .
It is constantly reinventing itself – five years ago , it was a computer company ; today , it 's a consumer products company that also makes computers .
When I joined , John Sculley was CEO and the Macintosh II was the state of the art .
Few people had heard of the internet , and nobody had URLs or web pages , because they were n't invented until years later .
Music came on CDs , videos came on VHS tapes , and the mobile phone was big , expensive and along with pagers more a sign of corporate servitude .
Cable systems may have had 15 , 20 channels .
Your VCR probably had a clock flashing 12:00 .
When I left , Steve Jobs was in charge and the Macbook Pro was the best of the best , the iPod was a global success and Apple was reshaping the music industry ( much to that industry 's dismay ) .
Life there was n't always fun .
Apple had its problems .
I rode the rollercoaster through four different layoffs , and was laid off once in the summer of 1993 – but talked them out of it .
I 've never regretted that decision , even though I left a stack of money on the table to stay with a company whose future was n't certain at the time .
Why ?
Because I still believed Apple was worth fighting for .
I came to Apple to work on its Unix products – at the time , a version of Unix called A / UX .
I spent the first half of my time there working with a wide array of things , mostly enterprise products –
A / UX , Data Access Language , AppleShare , AppleSearch , 3270 and Token Ring .
Other than Unix , most of the products were at best marginal successes and generally soon cancelled .
AppleSearch was by far my favorite – a technology to help you find content on your server .
You may have heard of its grandson , called Spotlight , standard since April 2005 on Mac OS X.
Ten years ?
That 's a pretty long gestation for a feature .
AppleSearch was considered an enterprise product , with an enterprise pricetag , and a hardware requirement a generation or so ahead of the computers Apple sold at the time .
This was actually a common problem with Apple products during the bad years : really great ideas a bit ahead of the hardware or the market 's ability to understand them .
Many of the ideas , such as AppleSearch , got recycled later .
I also built and managed things designed to help Apple communicate with its users , or to help users communicate with each other – some of Apple 's first websites , Apple 's first public mailing list server , Apple 's first web forums , used for communicating with beta testers of various products .
The list server eventually grew into lists.apple.com , the key communication tool for Apple developers .
The forums were the model for what became the Applecare support forums ; the goal for these systems to act as a way for users to support each other .
The biggest criticism of the forums is the strong moderation ( some would say censorship ) .
I can see both sides of this argument – inside Apple , I always lobbied for more discussion , more disclosure , more transparency .
That 's not always compatible with Steve 's focus on controlling the message .
When Steve was fighting to restructure the company and keep it relevant , that control really was necessary .
Today , I believe it hurts more than it helps , but there are signs that Apple is slowly opening up and starting to move in these directions .
Do n't expect Steve ever to blog , though .
But maybe his successor will .
My not - so - covert goal was always to find ways to make it easier for Apple and customers to communicate with each other .
I spent a lot of time and energy talking to whoever would listen about how Apple could use blogging and other communication techniques to reach out to users .
That kind of informal communication just is n't in Apple 's DNA , and wo n't be as long as Steve is in charge .
If you look at how Apple 's done , it 's hard to argue it 's wrong , too .
Still , I have hope that some day , this will change and Apple will open up further .
I built a number of custom email systems for Apple .
If you get an email from Apple , it probably passed through a system that at one point I built or managed .
Those tools have allowed Apple to rethink how it markets its products and how it communicates with its users – they bring the customer and Apple closer together .
To me , that 's my best accomplishment .
It does n't hurt that these systems have saved a huge number of trees from being pulped into paper along the way .
But Apple does n't always get it right .
Remember the launch of MobileMe in June 2008 ?
It was that rare reminder that Apple could , in fact , royally screw up .
When Apple released it , it simply was n't ready .
Early users , myself included , suffered from committing to it before it was ready , and the Mac faithful had a field day complaining about it ( legitimately ) and using it to declare everything from the upcoming death of Apple to the impending nova of the sun and loss of all life in the solar system .
Not that it would n't have felt like that internally .
To people who wondered how what the atmosphere would be like inside 1 Infinite Loop , I said : "" Just imagine Steve Jobs wandering the hall with a flame thrower in hand , asking random people ' do you work on MobileMe ? '
"" I never had Steve 's flamethrower aimed at me , although I came close a couple of times ; all in all , I was close to getting my butt fired three times – and all three times , I probably would have deserved it .
I do know friends who did .
It was n't always pleasant – but one thing I give Steve credit for is he held himself to the same high standards he held those around him .
He is a perfectionist , and that 's what makes him successful and what made Apple succeed .
But that kind of perfectionism is n't easy , and is n't done with gentle criticism .
Apple is a place where you work hard , but you get rewarded , and you help create things that are special .
I found being part of something that was able and willing to fight to change society a real adrenalin rush .
Seeing people react to what we did was even more of one .
In the end , I left to look for new challenges .
Even so : would I recommend people work for Apple ?
Absolutely , if you get the chance .
Think about the things that Apple innovation has fostered , from the mouse and the graphical user interface we all take for granted today , all the way to the iPod and the iTunes store and the revolution of music into an online , electronic industry .
And the iPhone , which is revolutionising how society works with data while on the move : I can do things with my iPhone that were difficult on a desktop machine five years ago , and were inconceivable in any way 10 years ago .
How awesome is that ?
Which is why I 'll even be watching Phil Schiller on Monday – just as I know hundreds of Apple staff will be too .
If Apple keeps turning out the kind of products it 's become known for , I 'll keep buying them .
And if the circumstances were right , I 'd go back and do it again .
So would most of the ex - Apple people I know .
After all , how many companies will you work for that give you an opportunity to be part of something that fundamentally changes society ?

2009-01-05,"Steve Jobs and Apple have , finally , broken their silence about Jobs 's health , after rumours that he must be seriously ill had been allowed to build up for weeks after the company announced that he would not be giving the keynote speech at MacWorld , which starts today .
The timing of the announcements is fascinating : rather than putting paid to speculation , as could have been done at the time , Jobs and Apple put out their statements , blaming his weight loss on a "" hormone imbalance "" , just as MacWorld is getting prepared ... and Steve Ballmer is practising his speech for CES on Wednesday .
Effortlessly , Jobs has wrenched the spotlight away from CES and MacWorld without even going there .
So what 's at the root of the "" gaunt "" Jobs ?
In his letter , he says As many of you know , I have been losing weight throughout 2008 .
The reason has been a mystery to me and my doctors .
A few weeks ago , I decided that getting to the root cause of this and reversing it needed to become my # 1 priority .
Fortunately , after further testing , my doctors think they have found the cause — a hormone imbalance that has been "" robbing "" me of the proteins my body needs to be healthy .
Sophisticated blood tests have confirmed this diagnosis .
The remedy for this nutritional problem is relatively simple and straightforward , and I 've already begun treatment .
But , just like I did n't lose this much weight and body mass in a week or a month , my doctors expect it will take me until late this Spring to regain it .
I will continue as Apple 's CEO during my recovery .
Let 's recap why there 's concern about his health : in October 2003 , he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer - which is usually a quick killer .
But Jobs is extraordinarily lucky : he had neuroendocrine cancer , a rare and treatable form .
He had the Whipple procedure ( which removes the head of the pancreas , where the cancer was , and the duodenum , which connects the stomach to the jejunum ) to treat it in July 2004 (
having unsuccessfully tried to "" treat "" it through diet , a fact that was kept from Apple shareholders beyond the board ) .
The Whipple procedure does however mean that you need to watch your diet afterwards , according to Pancreatic Cancer UK : Because the pancreas is an organ which provides enzymes to aid the digestion and absorption of food and nutrients , any kind of surgery which removes part or all of the pancreas will affect the ability to digest and absorb food and nutrients .
It is important after any surgery to try and have as nutritious a diet as possible , and after pancreatic surgery this is best done by using small frequent meals and snacks .
And : Ensure that you are taking in enough calories and protein in a form that you can cope with , either as liquids , soft diet or normal foods .
Try to have a good variety of protein foods such as meat , chicken , fish , eggs , milk and cheese as well as foods which provide energy such as bread , pasta , rice , potatoes and cereals .
Small frequent meals with snacks such as crackers and cheese , full fat yogurts , cakes and biscuits , are often easier to take when your appetite is poor .
Foods such as fruit and vegetables provide vitamins and minerals and should be included daily .
Jobs was , famously , a fruitarian , though is now understood to be vegan .
The question is whether he has been eating enough protein - rich food to make up the difference .
The mention of a hormone imbalance that has eluded even California 's best is intriguing : surely they can advise about hormone imbalances that might be caused by pancreatic surgery ?
Unless it was something quite different .
( I 'm trying to contact a pancreatic specialist for more info . )
Will this stop the murmuring about Jobs 's health ?
Briefly , perhaps - but until he appears in public looking at least slightly chubby , then some people probably wo n't .
Or has it satisfied you that he has put this out ?"
2009-01-05,"The head of the Apple technology empire , Steve Jobs , has revealed that a "" hormone imbalance "" has caused him to lose weight and to take on a gaunt appearance that has alarmed investors , analysts and gadget enthusiasts .
In an attempt to quieten persistent rumours that he is fighting a recurrence of pancreatic cancer , Jobs made a rare personal statement on his health today , which proved sufficiently reassuring to reverse a steady decline in Apple 's shares .
The man behind the iPod , the iMac and the iPhone said he had nothing more serious than a nutritional problem with a "" simple and straightforward remedy "" , although his remarks caused a degree of puzzlement among experts in endocrinology .
Jobs , who co - founded Apple in 1976 , is widely viewed as the driving force behind the company 's innovation in consumer electronics .
The 53-year - old 's weight loss has prompted worries on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley over the future of the business .
His decision to pull out of MacWorld , an annual trade show in San Francisco this week , heightened concerns , though he stressed today that he fully intended to remain as chief executive .
In a letter addressed to the "" Apple community "" , Jobs said he had grown tired of media reports that he could be on his "" deathbed "" .
He said the cause of his weight loss had initially been a mystery but that doctors had recently discovered a "" hormone imbalance that has been ' robbing ' me of the proteins my body needs to be healthy "" .
He continued : "" The remedy for this nutritional problem is relatively simple and straightforward , and I 've already begun treatment .
But , just like I did n't lose this much weight and body mass in a week or a month , my doctors expect it will take until late this spring to regain it . ""
During early trading on the technology - dominated Nasdaq exchange , Apple 's shares rallied by 3 % to $ 93.56 .
The stock has fallen by 45 % over six months , in part depressed by rumours about Jobs , despite the phenomenal global popularity of Apple 's touch - screen iPhone handsets .
Speculation began last summer when Apple 's army of followers on technology websites remarked upon Jobs 's slim appearance at an event to launch a 3 G version of the iPhone .
Some pointed out that Jobs had surgery for pancreatic cancer in 2004 and that at the time Apple had been cagey about his condition .
Apple 's repeated refusal to comment on such a "" personal matter "" did little to silence the rumour - mongers .
The newswire service Bloomberg unwittingly kept the issue in focus by accidentally ­publishing an obituary of Jobs in August .
Then two months later , a contributor to a news blogging site owned by CNN , iReport , wrongly reported that Jobs had suffered a "" major heart attack "" , sending Apple 's shares down 11 % within 10 minutes .
Richard Ross , a professor of endocrinology at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield , said that although Jobs 's description of his condition was opaque , a hormonal imbalance could be a result of his pancreatic surgery .
"" If you 've had surgery around the pancreas or small bowel , you can get mal­absorption or nutritional symptoms , "" said Ross .
"" If you 've had damage to the pancreas , you can lose enzymes that break down food . ""
Such disorders are generally treated with dietary supplements and drugs .
A common imbalance of this type is diabetes .
Analysts expressed relief that Jobs had clarified his condition .
"" I think it does put to rest all the speculation on his health
and I think people will now start to focus on the business , "" said Vijay Rakesh , an analyst at ThinkEquity Partners in Chicago .
"" I think obviously this is very good for Apple and the stock because Jobs has been an innovator .
He steered the company into a lot of new products . """
2009-01-05,"Apple founder Steve Jobs has written an unprecedented open letter revealing details of his health problems .
The chief executive was due to deliver the keynote address at the Macworld conference in San Francisco this week , but pulled out late last year sparking fears about his health as he had appeared gaunt in recent public appearances .
Jobs survived pancreatic cancer in 2004 .
But now Jobs says he has been suffering from a "" hormone imbalance "" and doctors have told him that he needs rest .
He says that he will continue as CEO while he recovers .
"" I have been losing weight throughout 2008 .
The reason has been a mystery to me and my doctors , "" Jobs , who turns 54 in February , said today in a statement . ""
After further testing , my doctors think they have found the cause – a hormone imbalance that has been ' robbing ' me of the proteins my body needs to be healthy . ""
In a statement , Apple 's board said : "" It is widely recognised both inside and outside of Apple that Steve Jobs is one of the most talented and effective CEOs in the world ...
If there ever comes a day when Steve wants to retire or for other reasons can not continue to fulfill his duties as Apple 's CEO , you will know it . ""
Speculation about the reasons for Jobs 's decision not to make the keynote speech at the Macworld show in San Francisco this week had pushed questions about his health to the fore .
The company previously declined to comment on it and Apple 's share price fell .
Apple 's share price rose in pre - market trading today .
Macworld is run by the company IDG , and Apple has said it no longer wanted to be committed to releasing new products at another company 's trade show and that it did n't see reason to have its CEO speak at a conference it would n't be attending in the future .
In his statement , Jobs added : "" The remedy for this nutritional problem is relatively simple and straightforward , and I 've already begun treatment ...
Just like I did n't lose this much weight and body mass in a week or a month , my doctors expect it will take me until late this Spring to regain it . """
2009-01-05,"Apple and Steve Jobs have both issued letters about the latter 's health , so we 're publishing the full text here .
They were first issued through news wires but are now also on Apple 's site .
This is the letter from the Apple board : CUPERTINO , Calif. --
It is widely recognized both inside and outside of Apple that Steve Jobs is one of the most talented and effective CEOs in the world .
As we have said before , if there ever comes a day when Steve wants to retire or for other reasons can not continue to fulfill his duties as Apple 's CEO , you will know it .
Apple is very lucky to have Steve as its leader and CEO , and he deserves our complete and unwavering support during his recuperation .
He most certainly has that from Apple and its Board .
And now , here 's the letter from Steve Jobs .
Dear Apple Community , For the first time in a decade , I 'm getting to spend the holiday season with my family , rather than intensely preparing for a Macworld keynote .
Unfortunately , my decision to have Phil [ Schiller , vice - president of marketing ] deliver the Macworld keynote set off another flurry of rumors about my health , with some even publishing stories of me on my deathbed .
I 've decided to share something very personal with the Apple community so that we can all relax and enjoy the show tomorrow .
As many of you know , I have been losing weight throughout 2008 .
The reason has been a mystery to me and my doctors .
A few weeks ago , I decided that getting to the root cause of this and reversing it needed to become my # 1 priority .
Fortunately , after further testing , my doctors think they have found the cause -- a hormone imbalance that has been "" robbing "" me of the proteins my body needs to be healthy .
Sophisticated blood tests have confirmed this diagnosis .
The remedy for this nutritional problem is relatively simple and straightforward , and I 've already begun treatment .
But , just like I did n't lose this much weight and body mass in a week or a month , my doctors expect it will take me until late this Spring to regain it .
I will continue as Apple 's CEO during my recovery .
I have given more than my all to Apple for the past 11 years now .
I will be the first one to step up and tell our Board of Directors if I can no longer continue to fulfill my duties as Apple 's CEO .
I hope the Apple community will support me in my recovery and know that I will always put what is best for Apple first .
So now I 've said more than I wanted to say , and all that I am going to say , about this .
Steve"
2009-01-06,"It 's that time of year again : MacWorld is almost wrapped up and CES will soon be upon us , with the great and the good of the technology world descending on Las Vegas for five days of dribbling , drooling and bragging about the latest software hardware , gadget geekery and with a few power speeches thrown in for good measure .
There 's a different flavour this year with no appearances from the two usual headliners ; Apple chief executive Steve Jobs at MacWorld
( he 's finally confirmed a hormone imbalance has been causing his long - term weight loss ) and Microsoft founder Bill Gates , the latter replaced by chunky showman Steve Ballmer , Microsoft 's chief executive .
What can we expect ?
More on Windows 7 from Ballmer , and a few surprises as he takes up the high - profile CES stage .
Our tech correspondent Bobbie Johnson will be covering that keynote and all the big news from CES in text and video , while we 'll be sifting through the thousands of product releases and curiosities to bring you a smattering of the best CES highlights each day - from green tech and gaming hardware to mobile gagdets and the fastest notebooks money can buy .
As ever , we are at your service .
Tell us what you 're interested in and what you want us to check out on the conference floor .
It might be that 280 "" HD flat - screen TV , or more from the firm that brought you last year 's leopard - print MP3 player with combined Taser ..."
2009-01-07,"Apple 's last Macworld keynote speech turned out to be notable as much for what did not appear as what did .
Steve Jobs , the company 's chief executive , was the most obvious non - appearance - but also missing were expected appearances of new iMacs , an updated Mac mini and any sign of Snow Leopard , the next update to Apple 's Mac OS X operating system .
Instead Phil Schiller , Apple 's senior vice - president of worldwide product marketing , gave a 90-minute presentation showing off new versions of the company 's iLife and iWork software suites , a new MacBook Pro laptop with a 17 in screen and non - removable battery , and announced that in the near future the entire 10 m song music repertoire on the iTunes Store will move to DRM - free formats .
iLife and iWork , for what ?
Schiller 's breezy presentation could not disguise the fact that Apple had little to show off - and that some of the innovative features in the software being unveiled were already being made available for free through Google 's free services .
For example facial recognition , added to the iPhoto picture organisation program in the next version of the £ 69 iLife "" leisure "" suite of software , is a feature of the free Picasa download from Google , announced on Monday evening .
A "" document collaboration "" feature in the £ 69 iWork "" office "" suite , where users can upload documents to iWork.com , "" will eventually be a paid service "" , Schiller said .
By contrast , Google and Microsoft both offer similar document collaboration services for free .
Schiller did unveil one piece of new hardware : a new 17 in MacBook Pro , a top - end laptop with prices starting at £ 1,950 , which follows the slimline MacBook Air by having a non - removable battery .
Schiller insisted that though the new battery requires specialist replacement , it will go for up to eight hours between charges , and work for up to 1,000 charging cycles .
"" We wanted to deliver our longest lasting battery ever , but we wanted to keep it thin and light , "" he said , explaining the decision to build the battery into the chassis .
The use of lithium polymer technology meant that the battery would have three times the industry standard lifespan and charging cycles , he said .
Snow - free zone
But the focus on the annual updates to iWork and iLife meant that other , expected announcements did not happen , leaving question marks over the future of some of the Apple hardware line .
In particular the lack of any focus on the Mac mini , the "" headless "" low - end machine which has not been updated since August 2007 , and had been the focus of a number of rumours ahead of Schiller 's appearance , has led to concerns it might be killed off .
Also absent were any new iMacs , the consumer - level desktops , which were last updated in April .
Some had expected a formal announcement this week , after industry suggestions that Quanta 's factories in China were making new models for launch this year .
The biggest absence however was Snow Leopard , the next version of Mac OS X , which according to a presentation given last November by Jordan Hubbard , head of Apple 's Unix Technology Group , would appear in "" Q1 2009 "" .
That timescale would tend to imply at least a demonstration in January to whet the appetites of buyers for a release by late March .
And given that Microsoft 's Steve Ballmer showed off some of the next release of Windows , called simply Windows 7 , at his CES keynote on Wednesday , Apple had been expected to try to draw some attention to its own product , which is widely anticipated to marshal graphics processing power for general computing purposes .
The announcement that iTunes will move entirely to DRM - free music formats , nearly six years after it launched in April 2003 , indicates that both Apple and the record labels which provide the music see a benefit in not tying songs to iPods or a limited number of computers or digital music players any more .
Jobs had called for the labels to drop their requirements for DRM on songs sold through the service as long ago as February 2007 ; it appears that the price they exacted for fulfilling that wish was flexible pricing , under which songs will sell for 59p , 79p and 99p , with "" most albums "" costing £ 7.99 - a change from the previous structure under which individual DRM - enabled tracks always cost 79p , and DRM - free tracks 99p .
Mark Mulligan of Jupiter Research said : "" Do n't expect it to kick start the digital music market , which is worryingly sluggish .
This is just a basic enabler the market needs for long term viability .
It is , however , crucial for future differentiation of the next wave of digital music services . ""
Apple 's abandonment of DRM also implies that it will not try to launch a subscription service for iTunes ; having become the largest single seller of music in the US it has plainly calculated that it will make more money from selling songs playable on any computer or digital player than by trying to protect the iPod 's market share through tying iTunes songs to it ."
2009-01-07,"Before he even takes the stage at the Consumer Electronics show , Microsoft 's chief executive Steve Ballmer has been upstaged by Steve Jobs - and all Jobs had to do was not show up .
The two keynotes at MacWorld and at CES , traditionally kick off the two events , marking the busiest ten days in the geek calendar .
Phil Schiller delivered an underwhelming keynote in place of the hormone - imbalanced Jobs , and despite a confident performance Apple just did n't have the big announcements this season to make it that interesting .
Ballmer is taking the mantle from the mostly retired Bill Gates for the first time , but faces a different challenge to Schiller .
MacWorld is a temple for Apple devotees and the hundreds of firms that produce products for the Apple ecosystem , but giving the keynote at CES ca n't be just another product pitch ; Gates traditionally set the scene for the trends and strategy of the majority of the computing industry for the next year and beyond , and Ballmer will need to do the same .
Lest we forget , Ballmer 's most famous public performance until now was the monkey man rabble - rousing dance he did at an internal Microsoft conference .
The world 's 43rd richest person , according to Forbes , has been characterised as the man who has kept Microsoft running , leaving Gates free to concentrate on bigger thinking .
So how much ' bigger thinking ' has Ballmer had time for ?
His main pitch will be on Windows 7 , the much anticipated operating system that will supersede Vista .
Vista had plenty of teething problems since its launch in January 2007 , including criticism over privacy and security features and compatibility with other devices .
Details of the new operating systems have been dribbling out for months , with the official unveiling in October last year .
Microsoft 's chief software architect Ray Ozzie , who took over company strategy from Bill Gates , has said Windows 7 will be faster and easier to use , include support for new devices including touchscreens and features to make Vista easier to deploy in corporate IT departments .
There will also be far fewer of those pop - up alerts that infuriated so many early Vista users , but there has been speculation that Microsoft might offer Vista users free or discounted upgrades to Windows 7 .
More significantly , Windows 7 is designed to integrate with Windows 7 Mobile and Live Wave 3 , because Microsoft wants to synchronise our offline and online lives through its software .
There 's also a new version of Microsoft Office on the way , which will allow us to work on the same document from multiple locations .
Despite the build - up , Windows 7 is unlikely to be released until late this year at the earliest .
Ballmer wo n't be announcing that Windows 7 is in the shops today , as Apple famously does with its product launches , but he is likely to announce the release of the beta version - as leaked online during the Christmas break .
While he 'll be using some hard - talking to evangelise about Microsoft and pontificate about the economy , expect the harder product pitches to come from executives like Robbie Bach , president of Microsoft 's entertainment and devices division .
He 'll be wheeled on to show off the Xbox 360 console , so expect some announcements there .
All eyes will be on Ballmer when he takes the stage early Thursday morning UK time - but perhaps more to see if he cracks out another embarrassing , heart attack - inducing power dance .
With a bit of luck , he 'll stick to the day job ."
2009-01-08,"A Letter From Clippy ,
The Microsoft Office Paperclip Dear Microsoft Community , For the first time in more than a decade , it looks like I 'm writing a letter .
Unfortunately , my apparent absence in the latest version of Microsoft Office set off another flurry of rumours about my health , with some even publishing stories of me on my deathbed .
As many of you know , I have been slowly rusting since Office 97 .
The reason has been a mystery to me and my doctors .
A few weeks ago , I decided that getting to the root cause of this and reversing it needed to become my # 1 priority .
Fortunately , after further testing , my doctors think they have found the cause : I am an 11-year - old paperclip .
Sophisticated tests have confirmed this diagnosis .
The remedy for this oxidization problem is relatively simple and straightforward , and I 've already begun treatment .
But , just like I did n't get this rusty in a week or a month , my doctors expect it will take me until late this spring to lose it .
I will continue to irritate the living shit out of people during this time .
I have given more than my all to letter writers for the past 11 years now .
I will be the first one to hand over responsibility to Scribble The Annoying Letter - Writing Cat if I can no longer continue to fulfil those letter writing duties .
So now I 've said more than I wanted to say , and all that I am going to say , about this .
All further announcements will come in the usual way : through Robert Scoble 's frozen yogurt shop working friend .
Lots of love , Clippy Hello from San Francisco .
I 'm in town for Macworld – officially – but unofficially I 'm also here as a fugitive from British justice .
This most recent bout of legal trouble started a couple of days ago , as it often does , with a phone call from a policeman .
A detective constable in Bethnal Green who earlier in the day had paid a surprise visit to my friend Anna to see if she knew my whereabouts . ""
He 's in a whole lot of shit , "" were ( Anna swears ) his exact words .
Why the police think I live at her house is anyone 's guess , but Anna turned out to be the perfect criminal 's moll , cunningly palming them off with the truth .
That I do n't live in her house , that I 'm out of the country and that she has n't seen me all year .
This failed to satisfy them , hence the phonecall .
Apparently , the policeman explained , there had been a burglary in East London and , much to his evident glee , my fingerprints had been found at the scene .
What with me having now fled the country , it was pretty much an open and shut case .
Except for the slight detail that I 'm not a burglar .
In fact as it turned out , the reason my fingerprints were are the scene of a burglary is that the scene of the burglary is a hotel room .
Or , more accurately , a serviced apartment that I rented for one night last November when I was liveblogging the American election .
Annoyingly , of all the billion fingerprints found in the apartment , only mine matched a record on the police national computer , and so I was their lead suspect .
You see , despite never actually been found guilty of committing any crime – although do check out my last book for details of how lucky I am that that 's the case – the fact that I have been arrested in the past for something astonishingly trivial means the police have my fingerprints on file .
And because of that trivial arrest , I was suddenly being wrongly accused of burgling a flat .
It 's a classic story of wrongly - accused criminality : from not committing petty crime , I 've graduated to not committing increasingly more serious crimes .
In a few years , unless I seriously do n't not change my ways , there 's a real risk I 'll end up not in jail for not committing arson – or perhaps even not - murder .
Of course , I blame the fact that I did n't grow up without a strong father figure , and my lack of not having a decent education .
School of soft - knocks , that 's me .
And yet , being falsely accused of something both serious and weird does make me realise how Steve Jobs must feel every time he 's wrongly accused of being dead .
It 's really the only thing people are talking about at Macworld .
What with his continuing weight loss and his decision not to perform one of his classic "" Stevenotes "" at the conference , the consensus among people who have absolutely no inside knowledge at all is that he 's not long for this world .
Admittedly , the consensus may have a point .
Hormone imbalance or not , Jobs did survive neuroendocrine tumours – a fact that he neglected to announce to the world until after its apparently successful treatment .
And now once again , the world learns that the CEO of Apple ( a publicly - listed company ) is ill only after he claims to be getting better .
Like the Alan Partridge of the tech world , Jobs is a man who is constantly bouncing back but never seems to quite make it .
But at the same time – so what ?
People die .
It 's pretty much the defining characteristic of living things .
And when they do , other people are usually found to replace them .
It 's perfectly foreseeable that when Jobs dies , Apple will manage to find one person on Earth capable of running a company that makes computers with one mouse button .
In fact , there 's a real possibility that he or she might already be among the 31,999 people who work at Apple but who are n't Steve Jobs .
But that 's not the point .
The point is that the attendees of Macworld have to talk about Jobs 's health because there 's absolutely bugger all else to talk about .
In previous years we 've seen the launch of the iPod , the iPhone and the Macbook Air .
Game - changing technologies , unveiled with the unique presentational flair of Steve Jobs .
This year we get a slightly better Macbook Pro , a slightly better iLife suite and DRM - free iTunes , all announced by Philip Schiller .
It was like watching the bearded lady trying to encourage people to pay to see PT Barnum – wrong messenger , wrong message .
Desperate to track down some buzz about anything other than a man who is n't dead , I decided to crash a Macworld "" TweetUp "" – a spontaneous conference party arranged via Twitter .
Surely among the Mac geeks in attendance , someone would be excited about the new MacBook 's extended battery life ?
But no .
Instead , somebody had made a Steve Jobs mask and the partygoers were taking it in turns to be photographed wearing it .
In fact , apart from Steve talk , there was only one other notable topic of conversation , prompted by the fact that I write this column .
And it was , of course , the pipe guy .
It started with Megan McCarthy from Techmeme . ""
So what 's the deal with the pipe guy ?
"" she asked .
I had to think for a moment . ""
Pipe guy ?
Um ... wait ...
do you mean Jack Schofield ? ""
""
Yeah . Is the pipe for real ? ""
"" I think it 's a real pipe , yes . ""
"" Wow .
That 's pretty awesome .
""
Gabe Rivera , Megan 's boss , wandered past . ""
Hey Gabe , "" said Megan , "" This is Paul –
he writes for the Guardian . ""
"" Did you ask him about the pipe guy ? ""
And so that was Macworld – a conference so devoid of exciting news that the people of Silicon Valley have had to import Jack 's pipe as a talking point .
In fact the whole thing has been such a letdown that I 'm starting to get paranoid .
Since I started writing this column , I 've been to two big conferences – Le Web and Macworld – and both have been a disappointment .
I 've written before about the fact that everything I write about tends to take an immediate turn for the worse ( sorry Steve ) .
If I keep travelling to conferences at my current rate , there 's a chance that by the end of 2009 I 'll have killed off the entire technology events industry .
In a few hours I 'm due to fly to Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show .
So far the hype has been pretty positive .
The event kicked off with a keynote from Microsoft 's Steve Ballmer and the BBC ran the headline "" Tech show bucks global downturn "" .
If by Sunday , when the conference ends , it 's all turned to shit – with no exciting product launches , complaints about internet connectivity problems or , God knows , a meteor hitting the convention centre –
I 'll know for sure that I 'm to blame .
So here 's my pledge : if I do manage to ruin CES , I 'm going to do the right thing .
I 'm going to fly straight back to London , walk into the first police station I see and admit to the burglary , and possibly also the future arson and murder .
Hopefully they 'll lock me up and throw away the key and my orgiastic buzz - killing spree can finally be brought to an end .
Nothing less than the future of the technology industry is at stake .
One way or another it 's going to be an interesting few days .
And of course I 'll tell you all about them next week .
But right now me and my new pipe have a plane to catch .

2009-01-08,"The Macworld keynote delivered by Apple 's head stand - in Phil Schiller turned out to be a snoozeathon , or as Reuters put it : Apple disappoints - no Jobs , big news at Macworld ( "" with no dramatic products or master pitchman Steve Jobs , the company 's final Macworld performance disappointed Wall Street . "" )
As a BBC reporter tweeted at the time :
"" Oh dear .
It 's Garageband 09 next !
No wonder Jobs pulled out of this one ! ""
But John Paczkowski , at The Wall Street Journal 's All Things Digital , had a quote from someone who thinks differently : "" [ The ] Macworld keynote was underwhelming as expected , "" said Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster .
"" The lack of significant announcements adds clarity to Steve Jobs ' absence .
We believe he remains the primary spokesman and active leader of Apple . ""
In other words , this was n't a transfer of power : El Jobso is going to give the real keynote later , and he 'll use it to announce the things that Schiller was n't allowed to unveil -- Snow Leopard , the new Mac Mini , the Daily Mail 's iPhone Nano ( out by Christmas ! ) and , ideally , the MacBook Wheel ( "" One more thing … "" ) .
Either that or a special 25th Anniversary Macintosh , because if you paid $ 7,500 for the 20th Anniversary version , the massive 2 GB hard drive is probably filling up .
The Mac 's 25th anniversary is on January 24 , but perhaps that 's too soon .
On the other hand , Apple is losing money by having an old turkey like the Mac Mini hanging around , so Jobs wo n't want to leave it too long .
February ?
When do you think ?"
2009-01-11,"When Apple made its annual tranche of product announcements in San Francisco last week , few observers were focused on the products .
The big question was one that the Californian technology giant has rarely had to answer : where was Steve Jobs ?
In December , Apple announced that its emblematic and charismatic chief executive would not be making his annual address to the industry at Macworld .
It was the first time he had skipped the event since returning to the company in 1996 , leading to rampant speculation about his health .
Despite constant attempts to quell interest , Apple eventually revealed the truth - Jobs was suffering from a "" hormonal imbalance "" , itself the result of life - saving cancer surgery in 2004 .
For many , Apple 's massively successful brand is synonymous with Jobs , who co - founded the company in 1976 and is seen by most as indispensable .
This perception is largely shared by Wall Street , which has become obsessed with the company 's long - term future .
What if Jobs is no longer at Apple ?
Could it survive - and who would take over ?
Predicting Jobs 's successor is almost impossible .
Even trying to guess who is in favour and who is n't would tax seasoned Kremlinologists , who could divine power struggles from the positions of USSR leaders on the balcony at the May Day parade .
Apple - watchers do the same .
Late last year when Tony Fadell - who in 2001 brought the idea of the iPod and the iTunes store to Apple - left the company , some people looked back and found his downfall foreshadowed in a Jobs demonstration of the new iPhone in 2007 : when showing how to delete a contact from the phone 's address book , it was Fadell 's name that Jobs erased .
The problem for those trying to understand who might be Apple 's next CEO is that the company 's board is so tight - knit .
When Jobs regained control in 1997 after a 10-year exile , Apple had become notorious for leaks .
Jobs , who has an innate understanding of the value of surprise , changed that completely by instituting a simple rule : loose lips sink ships .
This makes it hard for observers to pick apart the succession process , particularly among internal candidates .
What is clear is that the executive team around Jobs has been in place for a comparatively long time .
Some are confidants who have been in his coterie for more than a decade .
Others pre - date Jobs 's return to Apple , such as Phil Schiller , head of product marketing , who stood in for his boss last Tuesday , and Jonathan
I ve , the British designer who has won awards for his work on the iMac , iPod and other products .
The company has not been riven by boardroom rows and power struggles and there is none of the usual personal dynamics found in a top - flight company trying to thrive .
Instead , Apple 's board has a collegiate approach : every Monday morning senior executives meet to go over in minute detail every aspect of the business , including which models of which iPods are selling well or not .
But for all that , Jobs is still identified as the driving force and vital to Apple 's commercial and financial success .
Following false reports last October that he had had a heart attack , former Wall Street analyst Henry Blodget estimated that Jobs added 20 % to the stock 's value .
So who would take his place ?
The question of succession had not been raised until Jobs 's brush with pancreatic cancer , a rare and treatable form that was diagnosed in October 2003 , but only treated ( after Jobs did n't respond to a special diet ) in summer 2004 .
That , and subsequent speculation culminating in last week 's confirmation of his latest problems , threw the matter into sharp relief .
When Jobs was recovering from his surgery , chief operating officer Tim Cook ran the business , while Schiller took over public duties .
Cook , described as demanding but not a visionary , is respected inside Apple but rarely considered as a replacement for Jobs .
While Schiller , an engaging and amusing public speaker , has been touted as a successor , it is unclear how well he could set out a strategy for the company .
I ve , who has , unusually , been trotted out by Apple at recent events , has also been put in the frame .
But for all his expertise in industrial design , he has not shown any evidence that he would seek to shoulder the huge burdens of a chief executive , where marketing , software and financial considerations must rule .
Another one - time contender , I ve 's former boss as head of hardware Jon Rubinstein , left in 2007 to become chairman of the handheld computer company Palm .
That might not rule him out entirely , however ; his engineer 's training , allied to his long experience of life inside Apple - and now experience running another company - could count in his favour .
Rubinstein , however , is staying tight - lipped and refused to comment on Apple 's current predicament .
Leander Kahney , the author of The Cult of Mac and Inside Steve 's Brain , believes Apple has now been moulded so closely in the image of Jobs that it could easily survive without his leadership .
"" The company is a well - oiled machine , which is already 80 % run by his lieutenants , "" he says .
"" During the past 10 years , Jobs has instituted his personality traits into Apple 's business processes .
His love of simplicity and good design , his obsessive perfectionism and focus - all have become trademarks of how Apple goes about its business .
This will continue after he 's gone . ""
However , he adds , whether the company can continue to progress indefinitely is another question : "" Apple will be fine post - Steve Jobs for about a decade .
The company will run like clockwork at first , and things will go wrong only slowly .
"" That is because while the challenge that will follow Jobs 's departure is simple to enunciate , it is hard to fulfil .
At Apple , it is not enough to understand technology , design and the trends shaping them ; the successor also has to be a strong leader who can pick a path through an increasingly complex environment .
Apple focuses on profitable niches , and tries to expand them .
Its Mac computers are still niche ; the iPod became a global brand .
The iPhone hangs between the two .
And after that , what is the next big thing Apple must be ready to do ?
The next chief executive probably knows .
That will mark him , or her , out .
Amid all Apple 's recent successes , though , it 's easy to forget that Jobs has not always guessed correctly .
In 2000 , Apple chose to put DVD drives into its computers , rather than CD - burners able to create music discs .
It was a bad choice : CD burning was big business in 2000 , and in January 2001 Jobs had to tell analysts that the company had suffered its first quarterly loss since he became chief executive .
The same year the announced the G4 Cube computer , an eight - inch - square Macintosh encased in plastic .
Despite Apple 's hype , the machine failed to catch the public imagination and , after being plagued by technical problems , was discontinued .
Undeterred by those failures , Apple quickly bought a third - party music - playing program called SoundJam and transformed it into its own brand , which it called iTunes .
Soon afterwards , Fadell got in touch with his idea for a digital music player ( then a burgeoning sector ) tied to an online music store .
The player became the iPod ; the rest is history .
That vision - to brush off defeat and focus on industry - changing products - is what could prove irreplaceable if and when Jobs departs Apple , says Kahney . ""
The big problem will be developing new products , the unique talent that Jobs so excels at , a skill that few in any other tech company - or any other industry , for that matter - seem to exhibit . """
2009-01-11,"Since Steve Jobs did not descend from the heavens to give the keynote at the Macworld conference last week , and the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas failed to reveal anything interesting ( with the exception of a neat application called Songsmith from Microsoft ) , we can turn our attention to things that really matter .
Like email .
More specifically , consider the curious legalese that is increasingly appended at the foot of emails dispatched from corporate email servers .
Here , for example , is what appears at the end of a chatty personal message from a friend who works for a prominent media organisation : "" This email and all attachments are confidential and may also be privileged .
If you are not the named recipient , please notify the sender and delete the email and all attachments immediately .
Do not disclose the contents to another person .
You may not use the information for any purpose , or store , or copy , it in any way . ""
Here 's another one , from a bank : ""
This message is for the named person 's use only .
It may contain confidential , proprietary or legally privileged information .
No confidentiality or privilege is waived or lost by any mistransmission .
If you receive this message in error , please immediately delete it and all copies of it from your system , destroy any hard copies of it and notify the sender .
"" A friend sends you an email saying "" How about lunch ? "" and it comes with this implicit threat that if you so much as breathe a word of it to any living being the massed litigators of Messrs Sue , Grabbit and Runne will descend upon you .
The practice is now so widespread that most of us have become inured to it .
We treat it as a penance to be borne - like muzak in lifts and the "" we really value your call , please hold "" mantra of customer "" help "" lines .
The funny thing is that the practice is , at best , legally dubious . ""
The value of disclaimers is limited , "" writes Simon Halberstam ( of Sprecher Grier Halberstam ) in an article on weblaw.co.uk , "" since the courts normally attach more weight to the substantive content of the communication and the circumstances in which it is made than to any disclaimer .
Having said that , disclaimers may possibly be helpful if an issue ends up in court in various respects ... and , since disclaimers cost ( almost ) nothing , it is worthwhile to use them . ""
Under English law , Halberstam goes on to explain , a recipient of a communication is obliged not to disclose or misuse its content - but only "" if the communication was expressly or implicitly confidential "" .
So how does one know if a communication meets that requirement ?
Apparently it depends on "" whether a reasonable person in the position of the recipient would regard it as confidential .
Clearly this leaves room for argument ... ""
Quite so , m'lud .
One is reminded of a Willie Rushton cartoon published during the passage of the Sexual Offences Bill ( passed in 1967 ) , which legalised homosexual acts between consenting adults in private .
It shows two stout chaps in bed in what appears to be a London street , and a policeman saying : "" Adults you are , consenting you may well be , but I would question the privacy of Lowndes Square . ""
No doubt lawyers regularly exchange communications about highly confidential matters , and in those circumstances the disclaimer may indeed have some legal force .
But the same can not be said about an invitation to lunch , or an email about the results of the office sweepstake .
What can be done about this nonsense ?
Employers will doubtless say that anyone sending emails on company time and using corporate networks will just have to put up with whatever the legal department appends to their messages .
But that does n't mean that the rest of us can not fight back .
Cory Doctorow , the celebrated sci - fi writer , activist and blogger , has come up with his own disclaimer , which is now appended to all his emails .
"" READ CAREFULLY , "" it says .
"" By reading this email , you agree , on behalf of your employer , to release me from all obligations and waivers arising from any and all NON - NEGOTIATED agreements , licences , terms - of - service , shrinkwrap , clickwrap , browsewrap , confidentiality , non - disclosure , non - compete and acceptable use policies ( "" BOGUS AGREEMENTS "" ) that I have entered into with your employer , its partners , licensors , agents and assigns , in perpetuity , without prejudice to my ongoing rights and privileges .
You further represent that you have the authority to release me from any BOGUS AGREEMENTS on behalf of your employer . ""
Er , yours sincerely ."
2009-01-14,"The boss of the Apple computer empire , Steve Jobs , today disclosed that his health problems have become "" more complex "" , prompting him to take extended leave from his role as chief executive until the end of June .
In a shock announcement just eight days after Jobs reassured investors about his well - being , Jobs emailed employees to say that Apple 's chief operating officer , Tim Cook , was taking control of day - to - day operations .
Jobs , 53 , survived pancreatic cancer five years ago .
A deterioration in his health is likely to cause great alarm among both Apple investors and technology enthusiasts , who see him as the driving force behind successful products such as the iPod , the iMac and the iPhone .
In his message to staff , Jobs said : "" Unfortunately , the curiosity over my personal health continues to be a distraction not only for me and my family , but everyone else at Apple as well .
In addition , during the past week I have learned that my health - related issues are more complex than I originally thought . ""
In order to take myself out of the limelight and focus on my health , and to allow everyone at Apple to focus on delivering extraordinary products , I have decided to take a medical leave of absence until the end of June . ""
Speculation over Jobs ' health has been rife since the summer , when he appeared gaunt and drawn at a technology conference , prompting a slide in Apple 's stock .
On January 5 , Jobs issued a statement acknowledging that he had suffered weight loss .
But he blamed his condition on a relatively minor hormone imbalance and said he intended to remain in charge of Apple .
Moments before today 's announcement , trading in Apple 's shares was suspended on the technology - dominated Nasdaq stockmarket ."
2009-01-14,"This is the story running on PR Newswire and Apple.com : Apple CEO Steve Jobs today sent the following email to all Apple employees : Team , I am sure all of you saw my letter last week sharing something very personal with the Apple community .
Unfortunately , the curiosity over my personal health continues to be a distraction not only for me and my family , but everyone else at Apple as well .
In addition , during the past week I have learned that my health - related issues are more complex than I originally thought .
In order to take myself out of the limelight and focus on my health , and to allow everyone at Apple to focus on delivering extraordinary products , I have decided to take a medical leave of absence until the end of June .
I have asked Tim Cook to be responsible for Apple 's day to day operations , and I know he and the rest of the executive management team will do a great job .

2009-01-15,"Technology consumers are bored ; not just skint .
You only have to look at the flurry of results out today from British retailers to see that there are precious few must - have products able to overcome the dampening effect of the economic downturn .
News that Steve Jobs is stepping down at Apple only underlines the paucity of new ideas .
At a time when the business world desperately needs a hero or two , Steve Jobs is a shining example of how it is still possible to combine great design and great profitability .
Speaking personally , if I had to name the five consumer products that had most enriched my life in the last five years Apple would claim the bulk : iTunes has reignited my passion for music , Apple TV has restored my faith in the power of television drama , the iPod Touch has made traveling with kids more bearable and the iMac and MacBook Air do as much for interior design as they do for computing .
Contrast this with the dreary picture painted today by companies like DSG ( Dixons to you or me ) , Carphone Warehouse , Argos and Halfords .
There are only so many flat screen TVs you can shove down people 's throats before the credit card is maxed out .
The mobile phone world in particular is showing little of the flair and excitement it once had .
It took an outsider like Jobs to show the way forward with the iPhone , but few have risen to the challenge .
The best many companies can do is whine about the downward pressure on pricing for yesterday 's must - have items such as car sat - navs .
Technology retailers have their own challenges - not least dealing with the great online sales migration - but the financial results point to a bigger challenge for the British economy .
As Stephen Carter pointed out yesterday , digital media is one of the few potential growth areas for the UK , especially if he succeeds in wiring everyone up with broadband .
It is time for our home - grown media and technology companies to respond with the mix of product innovation and marketing flair that Steve Jobs showed the world ."
2009-01-15,"The future leadership of the Apple computer empire was unclear last night after its chief executive , Steve Jobs , took six months ' medical leave to tackle deteriorating health .
Nine days after reassuring staff and investors that he had nothing more than a hormonal imbalance , Jobs stunned the technology community by disclosing that his medical issues were "" more complex "" than he initially thought .
In an email to staff , Jobs said Apple 's chief operating officer , Tim Cook , was taking day - to - day charge of the business until the end of June .
But Jobs said he would remain involved in "" major strategic decisions "" throughout his time out .
On Wall Street , trading in Apple 's shares was briefly suspended by the technology - dominated Nasdaq stockmarket while the company issued the news .
When action resumed , the stock slumped by 9 % .
Jobs , 53 , co - founded Apple in 1976 and is widely viewed as the driving force behind consumer electronics blockbusters such as the iMac , the iPod and the iPhone .
His wealth is estimated at $ 5.4bn ( £ 3.7bn ) by Forbes magazine , ranking him as the world 's 189th richest man .
He had surgery for pancreatic cancer in 2004 and appeared to have beaten the disease .
But Jobs ' health has been the subject of intense speculation since he appeared at a technology conference in the summer looking gaunt and drawn .
In his email to employees , Jobs said : "" Unfortunately , the curiosity over my personal health continues to be a distraction not only for me and my family , but everyone else at Apple as well .
In addition , during the past week I have learned that my health - related issues are more complex than I originally thought .
In order to take myself out of the limelight and focus on my health , and to allow everyone at Apple to focus on delivering extraordinary products , I have decided to take a medical leave of absence until the end of June . ""
Jobs ' health is viewed as a critical issue by investors who are increasingly nervous about the company 's lack of disclosure .
For months , Apple insisted that Jobs was in good health until last week 's announcement that his recent weight loss was down to a "" nutritional problem "" caused by an easily treatable hormone imbalance .
Jobs is answerable to a heavyweight board of directors which includes the former US vice - president Al Gore , the Google chief executive Eric Schmidt , and the head of Avon cosmetics , Andrea Jung .
Questions were mounting last night over the company 's corporate governance .
"" People are going to be very frustrated with the way Apple handled this , "" said Gene Munster , a technology analyst at stockbroker Piper Jaffray .
Munster added , however , that as Jobs ' long - standing right - hand man , Cook was well qualified to fill in as chief executive : "" He 's very capable of running the company , although obviously , replacing the magic of Steve Jobs is impossible . ""
With a market value of $ 75bn , Apple is one of the world 's most successful technology firms .
The business was established by Jobs and a friend , Steve Wozniak , in Jobs ' parents garage in California .
A university drop - out , Jobs has always eschewed the usual corporate uniform , typically preferring to appear in jeans and a polo - necked sweater .
He is a vegetarian , Buddhist and a father of four .
Under Jobs ' leadership , Apple has stolen a march on its rivals through its simple , sleek , easy - to - use designs for music players , computers and phones .
The company is highly profitable – it earned $ 4.8bn on sales of $ 32bn in the year to November ."
2009-01-15,"There has been a lot of argument after last night 's shocking memo from Apple boss Steve Jobs , but the prevailing mood has now been summed up by New York Times columnist Joe Nocera :
It 's Time for Apple to Come Clean .
Jobs phoned Nocera last summer and called him a slimebucket .
He says : "" I said at the time that I knew I was being spun by Mr Jobs .
But I did n't think I was being lied to .
Now , I 'm not sure what to think . ""
Welcome to the club , Joe !
One of the problems is that Apple has spent so long manipulating the press that nobody is quite sure who to believe .
So far , CNBC 's Jim Goldman -- previously regarded ( not least by me ) as having an inside track -- has taken most of the flak , with Dan Lyons , formerly Fake Steve Jobs , dishing it out on CNBC .
In the video ( in Charles 's post , below ) , Lyons was asked : "" Dan , do you think Apple has impaired its credibility permanently because of this particular issue ? ""
He said , amongst other things : "" In my mind , Apple never had much credibility .
Anybody who 's covered that company ...
There 's two kinds of reporters that cover Apple , the kind who realise they 're getting snowed and getting bullied and getting blocked out and realise that a lot of what they 're being told is not true , and the other kind , who suck up in order to get access , and end up getting played and punked like your Valley bureau chief [ Jim Goldman ] has been played and punked by Apple . ""
Later , Lyons added : "" The guy who 's running PR at Apple used to be the CNBC bureau chief , and your guy is now his assistant . ""
Goldman just got shouted down on air in another spat with CNBC 's Dylan Ratigan ( above ) , with Ratigan trying to find out "" whether the quality of the information we 're getting out of Apple now is any better than what we were getting a week ago . ""
Goldman says not , adding that one contact says Jobs "" is in serious denial about his health circumstances "" ( as Gizmodo said , and Goldman denied ) .
And the prospect of Jobs returning at the end of June "" is in serious doubt . ""
Ratigan cuts to the quick : "" the quality of information we 're getting from Apple is inconsistent at best and misleading at worst .
Fair ? ""
Goldman says : "" Sad to say , I think that 's fair . ""
The problem is that stockmarket and analyst reaction has just proved that Steve Jobs 's health matters , which is why Apple needs to tell the truth .
As Nocera says : There are certain people who simply do n't have the same privacy rights as others , whether they like it or not .
Presidents .
Celebrities .
Sports figures .
And , at least in terms of his health , Steve Jobs .
His health has become a material fact for Apple shareholders .
His vagueness about his health , his dissembling , his constantly changing story line
— it is simply not an appropriate way to act when you are the most important person at one of the most high - profile companies in America .
On the contrary : it is infuriating .
It is , of course , perfectly possible that Jobs and Apple have been telling the truth the whole time , but their credibility is shot .
And the habit of working through a small number of journalists who have been , basically , Friends of Apple may now prove counterproductive , because this story now looks like being driven by the previously - excluded majority ."
2009-01-15,"Steve Jobs 's decision to take time away from Apple to deal with his health problems has once again raised the question of who his long - term successor might be –
but it has also left concerns about the company 's approach .
Although there are no laws governing whether a corporation 's senior executives should disclose their health problems , some believe that the exalted status that Jobs holds within Apple means Wall Street deserves better information .
And particularly puzzling is that the news comes just a week after Jobs – an intensely private man - surprised the industry by suddenly revealing that his recent weight loss was the result of a hormonal problem .
Jobs 's initial health statement was made on the eve of Macworld Expo , an event at which the company traditionally unveils its latest products .
The show has become massively important to Apple investors , with the company 's stock leaping after the announcements by as much as 14 % in recent years .
That announcement helped quieten frantic speculation regarding his decision to pull out of the speech , but the short time between the two statements has left some confused by Apple 's behaviour .
"" They 'll tell you the least they can tell you , "" Roger Kay , an industry analyst with Endpoint , told Associated Press .
"" They 're trying to have it both ways , to protect their guy 's privacy and feelings and at the same time somehow signal the market , "" said Kay .
An Apple spokesman responded by referring to an email sent to Apple staff by Jobs , in which he said that he discovered the broader scope of his health problems "" during the past week "" .
Answering the questions about Jobs 's long - term successor is no more straightforward .
Several names have been mentioned as potential candidates , but for now the only hard signal is that his temporary replacement will be Tim Cook , the company 's meticulous and demanding chief operating officer .
Without more details , it is impossible to know how serious Jobs 's latest illness is – but history would suggest that it is far from insignificant .
His previous decision to relinquish control came only after an 18-month battle with cancer , which he had tried to treat with a homeopathic diet before finally agreeing to undergo surgery and hand over temporary control of Apple to someone else .
Even at that point Jobs took just a few weeks off work - far less than the five months announced today .
Apple pundit John Gruber , writing on his popular blog Daring Fireball , said that the latest development was "" worrisome "" .
"" It 's very difficult to read this any other way than that where Jobs says ' more complex ' , he means ' worse ' . """
2009-01-15,"Dan Lyons , the journalist formerly known as Fake Steve Jobs - before he gave up that gig last summer , because of his worries that Real Steve Jobs was seriously ill - had a hell of a ( verbal ) fight with Jim Goldman on CBNC yesterday as the "" Steve Jobs rather more ill than a week ago "" story broke .
Lyons has consistently said that Apple twists its PR , especially when it comes to Jobs and his health . ""
Imagine if any other CEO pulled bullshit like this "" , as he forthrightly put it in July :
Imagine [ Steve ] Ballmer [ of Microsoft ] appeared in public having lost an incredible amount of weight , looking seventy years old and about one hundred and twenty pounds .
Imagine that Ballmer 's flacks at first said he 'd had a "" common bug , "" but when nobody bought that line ( since it was absolutely totally ridiculous )
they came back and said he 'd been on the South Beach diet , or the vegan version of the Zone , and then when that did n't fly they said that it was n't anyone 's business why Ballmer looked like shit , and when that did n't work they lined up some "" sources "" to leak word that ooooh , yeaaaaah , you know come to think of it
we just remembered that Ballmer underwent some pretty hairy surgery a while back and then developed a pretty hairy infection , and then , when the hacks still would n't back off , Ballmer called a business columnist out of the blue , opened by insulting him , and then said he wanted to answer the columnist 's questions
— but only off the record .
The latter being a reference to Jobs 's call to Joe Nocera of the New York Times , who in late June was researching a piece trying to detail what was happening with Jobs - who called him , swore at him ( on the record ) and then spoke to him on condition the conversation remained off the record and somehow assured Nocera that his condition was not a reoccurrence of the neuroendocrine tumours that were diagnosed in 2003 .
And then we come to the events of the past couple of weeks .
Gizmodo wrote a piece at the end of December suggesting Jobs 's health was "" declining rapidly "" and that plans were being made for a succession .
Gizmodo said it had a source who had been "" 100 % correct "" in previous cases .
But Goldman then went on CNBC and said that he 'd been told by his sources at Apple that Jobs was fine .
Dandy .
All these rumours were rubbish .
And then came the news last night ( UK time ) that Jobs will be out until at least June .
Cue Lyons and Goldman , together for perhaps last time on CNBC .
Why ?
Because according to Silicon Alley Insider , Lyons has been banned from the channel as a result .
( There 's no confirmation at present from CNBC that this is the case ; Lyons 's blog , last updated a week ago , is silent on the matter . )
Goldman himself blogs that Jobs 's and Apple 's sudden change of information just wo n't wash :
Sophisticated tests showed Jobs he was suffering a hormone imbalance .
And only a week later , he admits that something happened in these intervening days that showed him his health - related issues are more complex than he originally thought .
Come on .
Forgive my skepticism .
That seems disingenuous to me at best ; dishonest at worst .
It 's tantamount to fiduciary , ethical and financial whiplash .
The fact is , late last week I spoke to two well - known tech industry executives , both of whom are very close to Jobs , and one of whom had been speaking to Jobs regularly up until a couple of months ago .
Neither has an axe to grind , and neither needs to manipulate Apple stock to make more money .
Trust me when I tell you that both have plenty .
What struck me was that both felt compelled to come to me to tell me that they had "" serious misgivings "" about the state of Jobs ' health .
One said , based on his contact with Jobs personally , that he was in "" serious denial "" about just how bad the circumstances had become .
It looks like only time will tell ."
2009-01-16,"Steve Jobs is considering a liver transplant to treat a consequence of the neuroendocrine cancer he was treated for in 2004 , according to the financial news service Bloomberg .
The story , which is unconfirmed , quotes unnamed "" people who are monitoring his illness "" ; in a phone call , Jobs apparently told the organisation "" Why do n't you guys leave me alone - why is this important ? ""
Why is it important ?
Well , Apple 's stock has lost around 10 % of its value since Jobs released a letter on Wednesday saying he would be on medical leave until June because his medical condition - previous described as a "" hormone imbalance "" - were "" more complex "" .
Clearly , some stockholders think it is important .
Bloomberg quotes medical sources who say that neuroendocrine tumors that originate in the pancreas , as Jobs 's did , often spread to the liver .
One option doctors have in these cases is to perform a liver transplant , Steven Brower , professor and chairman of surgery at Mercer University School of Medicine in Savannah , Georgia , said .
"" It 's one of the tumors for which transplantation can be considered , "" said Brower , who is a member of the American Society of Clinical Oncology .
"" It 's rare , but it 's sometimes done . ""
Note that Brower is n't treating Jobs , and there 's no suggestion that he 's the source of Bloomberg 's story .
However , he is a specialist in this field .
There 's nothing in what Browser has said that differs from the many medical opinions out there .
And Brower does offer a positive outlook , if - pinch of salt time - Jobs is indeed seeking such a transplant .
Brower said the transplant might work out well in a patient whose neuroendocrine cancer began in the pancreas , in part because this tumor type often spreads only to the liver and grows so slowly .
Even after having had a Whipple procedure [ as Jobs did to remove the tumours ] , a patient might expect to have good quality of life , he said .
"" The outcome can be quite good , "" he said .
"" With immunosuppressive drugs , the patient can expect to have a significant , durable life expectancy . ""
The Whipple procedure , following neuroendocrine tumours , has a survival rate of around 50 % after 5 years .
That puts Jobs in the fortunate 50 % already .
Plus he no doubt has the best medical treatment money can buy .
Why does it matter ?
Why do the stories ( and we 've spared you one of the more ludicrous medical ones that was on Wikileaks - which even Wikileaks did n't believe , since the timings , quite apart from anything else , were all wrong , involving a blood test apparently done in 2004 by a company that did n't exist until 2006 ) keep trickling out ?
Because Steve Jobs ca n't stop trying to control everything .
He wo n't accept that it 's not that people want him to be ill .
Quite the opposite .
They just want to know .
Then they can arrange their lives .
Everyone will be - well , if not happier , at least with a little less uncertainty in their lives .
To recall the line from the John Cleese showcase film Clockwise , in which Cleese is a time - obsessed headmaster who is trying to get to an appointment but keeps being diverted , "" I can cope with the despair .
It 's the hope that kills you . ""
( Cleese wrote the line himself . )
The irony is that in his 2005 commencement speech at Stanford , Jobs said : Remembering that I 'll be dead soon is the most important tool I 've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life .
Because almost everything — all external expectations , all pride , all fear of embarrassment or failure -
these things just fall away in the face of death , leaving only what is truly important .
Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose .
You are already naked .
There is no reason not to follow your heart .
By "" soon "" he meant "" in less than 100 years "" .
We 're all going to die , one day .
There 's no embarrassment in being ill ; only in needlessly hiding from the truth .
So we will , regrettably , have to keep trying to follow the zigs and zags of this story until the facts emerge , blinking , into the light ."
2009-01-16,"As news broke yesterday that Steve Jobs , the Apple chief executive , would be taking at least six months ' medical leave from the company he co - founded , the internet was abuzz with the question : what is Apple without Steve Jobs ?
Less asked , but just as intriguing , is : what is Jobs without Apple ?
The evidence suggests he 's an obsessively private visionary , with world - beating talents for negotiation , motivation and attention to detail .
That approach has helped him transform the world three times : first in computers , then films , and latterly music .
Apple ( not Microsoft ) gave the world computers with "" windows "" ; Pixar , which he bought in 1986 and funded at great expense , changed the way we think about animation ; and record companies might have vanished if not for the online iTunes Music Store , now one of the biggest sellers of music in the US , including physical retailers .
As he approaches his 54th birthday ( on 24 February ) , his enforced absence due to ill - health - the precise nature of which Jobs has , typically , kept secret - will be the longest away from Apple since he returned to the company in 1997 , having been thrown out in a boardroom coup in 1985 .
He 'll spend the time with his family - he has three young children at his family home , a giant mansion in Woodside , California , not far from Apple 's offices .
A grown - up child from a previous relationship lives in the UK .
"" This would be a hard adjustment for Steve Jobs , "" said Van Baker , an analyst with Gartner Group .
"" I think he would find other pursuits , but it would be difficult to take the Apple out of Steve .
The company has defined him for so many years . ""
To many people , he is synonymous with the iPod and latterly the iPhone ; to some before that he was the progenitor of the iMac , credited with having pulled Apple back from the brink of collapse after he took over again in 1997 .
Yet Jobs did n't design , or initiate , any of those products .
The iPod was the idea of Tony Fadell , an outsider who came to Apple with the proposal .
The iPhone was an obvious move forward .
The iMac was the brainchild of Jonathan I ve , the British - born designer who has been at Apple almost 15 years . ""
Steve does n't really invent all this stuff in his garage alone , despite the perception he does , "" says Michael Gartenberg , a technology strategist .
Jobs has led a complex life .
He was given up by his birth mother , a "" young , unwed college student "" , for adoption by a university - educated couple - except that Paul and Clara Jobs were n't graduates , a fact that almost derailed the adoption .
Jobs senior was a machinist for a laser manufacturer .
But Jobs the person remains elusive .
He will cut dead anyone he feels has been disloyal by telling the press about his personal life .
That extends to companies : those which let slip any detail of forthcoming Apple launches have found themselves dropped from contracts .
Alan Deutschmann , author of The Second Coming of Steve Jobs , says that it 's as if there were two people :
Good Steve and Bad Steve .
Good Steve is friendly , charming , amusing ; Bad Steve shouts , screams and denigrates whoever has incurred his displeasure .
Chuq von Rospach , who worked at Apple running its critical email and web forum systems for 17 years before leaving in 2007 , says it is like being in the path of a flamethrower .
His talent for negotiation - and perhaps exaggeration - can stretch into personal and health matters .
When the mother of his first child claimed paternity , Jobs , then 23 , denied it for two years , even signing a court document which said he was "" sterile and infertile , and as a result thereof , did not have the physical capacity to procreate a child "" .
But those skills have proved their worth repeatedly .
If there 's one thing Apple will miss , it 's his negotiating skills .
Nobody within Apple is talking about the disruption .
But Von Rospach said : "" If Steve leaves Apple , I think he leaves satisfied .
One could argue that few people have affected computing and society like Steve has ; [ Bill ] Gates is the other really .
Proud of his legacy , comfortable with his place in history . ""
But , Von Rospach adds : "" People forget he 's a husband and father , always very protective and private , and I think if and when he leaves Apple , it 's going to be so he can enjoy that part of his life more .
And that 's probably what he 's most proud of . ""
Not that Jobs - the complete unromantic , unattached to the past - is likely to be casting backward glances .
Journalist Steven Levy saw him at Apple last October and asked about the upcoming 25th anniversary of the original Apple Macintosh .
Jobs "" recoiled at any suggestion of nostalgia "" , says Levy .
"" When I got back here in 1997 I was looking for more room , and I found an archive of old Macs and other stuff , "" Jobs told him .
"" I shipped all that shit off to Stanford .
If you look backward in this business , you 'll be crushed .
You have to look forward . ""

2009-01-17,"Well , it 's been a hell of a busy fortnight .
Steve Jobs ill .
Apple releases some software and updates a laptop .
My predictions ( including one about Steve Jobs ) .
Yahoo gets a new chief ( and my opinion on her challenges ) .
Microsoft gets a new beta for Windows .
Steve Jobs gets , it seems , more ill .
Nintendo puts even more clear road between itself and Sony .
Sony 's financial results are going to be painful - as in $ 1.1bn loss for the year painful .
And now you want to know what 's important ?
We 've got important coming out of our ears .
Perhaps the pertinent question is : what 's interesting ?
Even better : what 's important and interesting ?
The news from Dixons Store Group and IDC , that 's what .
DSG is a barometer of our fascination as a nation with the shiny technology gew - gaws now on offer .
I go into the one in my local town once or twice a week to take the gadget temperature : see what they 're pushing , what 's hot , what 's been consigned to the top ( and hence obscurity : presently it 's big USB 2 external drives ) .
And occasionally to buy something .
IDC , meanwhile , reports on sales of PCs .
Neither had very good news this week .
Let 's start with IDC .
It reported on PC sales for 2008 , and boy , was it gloomy .
The fourth quarter figures for PC unit sales showed a decline ( compared to 2007 ) of 0.4 % ; worse , it forecast a 5.3 % decline in sales for 2009 , more than in 2001
when the US was last in recession and unit sales fell by 5 % .
IDC is only offering a "" slow "" recovery in 2009 .
Most PC sales of course go to corporates rather than consumers , but both are holding back from purchases as they try to assess quite how much cash they have to play with .
Mixed in with this is the news from Intel that it had its worst quarter for 20 years , and income fell to just 10 % of the year - ago figure , with revenue down by 23 % at $ 8.2bn ; and for the next quarter it 's vaguely forecasting only $ 7bn ( lower than the $ 7.28bn analysts were forecasting ) .
And then we look at DSG .
Oh dear .
Sales fell 10 % overall in the 12 weeks to January 10 ; and it would have been worse if the quarter had ended before the post - Christmas sales .
DSG executives were so puzzled by what was ( not ) going on that they got staff to ask customers .
Who told them they were waiting for the post - Christmas sales .
Deflation , thy name is gadget buyers .
Only laptops , netbooks and flatscreen TVs kept things afloat .
And there 's the clue for the problem that the PC industry faces in 2009 , which is very likely going to be ugly .
The problem is those little things that were n't there at all a year ago : the netbooks .
For PC makers , which for years have been able to smile and persuade themselves that things are n't that bad , even as they scrape and scrimp profits from volume sales - somehow - of desktops and laptops , the netbooks are the devil 's work .
I mean , look at the damn things .
They 're cheap as chips ( around £ 200 for a Linux - based Eee PC ) .
The margins on them are so thin you could cut yourself on them .
And though they 're presently an incremental , rather than replacement market ( the netbook supplements , rather than replaces , your ageing machine ) , in cash - straitened times they 're suddenly attractive to parents looking for get a child online , or someone who 's trying to save the deposit for a house while paying down their credit card bills .
Netbooks , in other words , are going to start eating the traditional PC makers ' businesses like termites discovering a wood - framed house .
Nobody is safe from this , not even Apple - which some people think is somehow safe from netbooks because it makes premium - price products .
Wrong .
Another research group , NPD , says sales of Apple 's computers declined by 1 % in November ; in my inbox this morning I found an analyst note from RBC Capital Markets , reckoning Apple 's shares will underperform the market , in part due to its own surveys data which indicates further deterioration next 90 days in consumer electronics and Apple - related spending ; January RBC IQ / Changewave survey data ( 3,500 ) shows only 28 % of respondents planning to purchase a Mac laptop next 90 days , down from 33 % Nov. Separately , 30 % plan on buying iPhone 3 G in Dec , down from 34 % in Sept.
Just after Macworld last week , it had also noted "" risks "" for Apple , in the form of "" deteriorating consumer spending environment [ and ] premium price points mismatched to tightening budgets "" .
Apple is going to release its financial figures for the quarter last this month .
Those are going to be - well , interesting .
Forget the Jobs foofarah , which wo n't have affected those .
These numbers are going to tell us just how exposed Apple is to the cold winds blowing through the consumer economy in America , where half of its revenues come from .
Hell , it 's going to hurt them all .
Analysts think that Intel needs to sell three times as many processors for netbooks to make the same profit it does on a single laptop processor sale .
What 's causing it all ?
Moore 's Law .
Netbooks are now as capable - or better - than computers of five or six years ago .
My daughter 's Asus Eee PC can play back YouTube videos - which her 2001-vintage iBook ( a hand - me - down ; it died before Christmas )
could n't .
For the PC business , which has grown used to eking out an existence , 2009 is going to be even tougher .
Sales are going to be down .
Companies that might have upgraded to Vista are going to pause and wait for Windows 7 , which has been getting rave reviews from beta testers .
And those netbooks are going to slice the profits out of the bottom of the consumer market .
PC makers will have to pray that Microsoft gets Windows 7 out of the door this year , or they are going to suffer .
It wo n't be pretty .
Indeed , it might be the first time that Moore 's Law really starts biting PC makers , rather than helping them .
In the past , it helped them sell computers : they could promise faster performance .
But now , netbooks offer good - enough performance , especially if your internet connection is fast enough ; add - on disk space ( all those USB disks on the shelves at Currys Digital ) is cheap .
Why buy a PC , apart from the screen size - but those are cheap too ?
I think PC makers might be glad of all the noise around Jobs , Bartz and Sony .
At least it will distract people from their travails .
For a while .
But only a while ."
2009-01-19,"Many companies are linked with individuals - Bill Gates and Microsoft , Warren Buffet and Berkshire Hathaway - but few have been forged in the image of one person in quite the same way as Apple .
The likelihood that CEO Steve Jobs will not be making an early return will have ramifications that go well beyond the firm .
News that his health problems were "" more complex "" than originally thought emerged in a faltering manner , and when it was signalled last week that he was temporarily stepping down , there was a hit on Apple 's share price .
His absence from this month 's Macworld Conference in San Francisco was a clear case of Hamlet without the prince - ordinarily , Mr Jobs takes to the stage and performs a soliloquy to doting fans .
A pioneer of personal computing , Mr Jobs co - founded Apple in 1976 , before being ousted by his own management 10 years later .
But after another decade had passed , he was invited back to rescue the company from potential bankruptcy .
Despite the effect of the current recession , it remains one of the most spectacular comebacks in US corporate history .
The question is whether it can continue if Mr Jobs 's illness prevents him from returning .
Had Jobs not returned to Apple in 1997 , then its future would have depended on a corporate white knight riding to the rescue .
Had none arrived , Microsoft would have grabbed even more than the 95 % market share it claimed at the time , and the way we all enjoy multimedia today would be different .
Jobs not only revived Apple 's flagging computers with widely acclaimed designs , but changed the face of music with the iPod and iTunes , which - while costly for fans - provided an industry besieged by piracy with a simple payments system .
Most recently he changed the direction of mobile communications by making touch phones ( which already existed ) easier to use .
The iPhone is still a bit player in the market , but it has set new standards .
Apple is far from perfect .
It tries to keep its products within its branded walled garden , and Jobs himself can be very controlling .
The unanswered question is whether a Jobless Apple would also be rudderless .
There was clearly disappointment at Macworld that no big hardware announcements were announced .
But perhaps Apple is just keeping the release of new computers or phones to a date of its own choosing as it strives , possibly without Mr Jobs , to do what it has been so good at under his lead : producing beautifully designed innovative products , albeit at premium prices .
At a time when computers are more commodified than ever , and designed as well as manufactured in Asia , Apple has become something of a role model for a different way of doing things ."
2009-01-21,"Apple chief executive Steve Jobs is taking a six - month leave from the company due to "" complex "" health issues , and the rapture is coming tomorrow .
OK , perhaps not the latter , but that 's what one might think given the extreme and exaggerated public response to the news .
More than they care about Jobs , though , people care about Apple .
The company 's phoenix - like tale holds a special but scary place in our hearts , and most of us would hate to see Apple fall to the same , dark place it was in the mid-1990s when the decisions of leaders who were not Steve Jobs nearly drove the company out of business and into oblivion .
But worry not , Apple fans .
Jobs 's ( hopefully temporary ) leave does n't mean the company is doomed .
Apple 's as much on track for long - term success as it has ever been , and it 's likely to remain successful for some time to come .
There are some things for which Jobs is essential .
For one , Apple has allowed his larger - than - life reputation to become synonymous with the entire company .
But this penchant for attention and showmanship only accentuates what Apple already offers : interesting and innovative products that people love to use .
Jobs may be known for hand - picking certain devices or features in the company 's product lines , but Apple has learned its managerial lesson from the first time Jobs left between 1985 and 1997 as a result of a power struggle – it would be a massive failure on the part of Apple if all of its eggs were in one basket .
There are other people who work at Apple , and these executives , managers and engineers are some of the best in the world .
The general public is n't very familiar with the leadership that Jobs is leaving in charge for the next six months , so it 's natural that there 's some fear that Apple is left with a leadership vacuum .
For now , Tim Cook , Apple 's chief operating officer , is holding the reins while Jobs takes his leave , leading day - to - day operations in much the same way he already has been .
Jonathan I ve , the king of Apple design , is practically an icon himself and will continue to wrangle the design team into creating products that we do n't even know we need yet .
And finally , Phil Schiller , the perfectly loveable senior vice - president of worldwide product marketing , demonstrated in his Macworld Expo ' 09 keynote last week that he , too , is capable of taking the stage with authority .
All three of these men – plus a plethora of elves behind the curtain – have worked closely with Jobs for many years , have all taken the stage with him in the past and will continue to keep things running in his absence just like the Apple we already know and love .
That 's not to say things wo n't change if Jobs decides he likes having free time again and elects not to return in late June as promised ( an unlikely , but possible , outcome ) .
To be sure , cloning technology is not yet sophisticated enough to ensure that an exact replica of Jobs will take his place and that nothing will be different .
In this event , there will undoubtedly be subtle changes in company culture , products and attitude over the next several years as whoever takes over exercises his or her own judgment .
The important part will be to find a person who is capable of acting in the spirit of Jobs – perfectionism and vision included –
but with enough confidence to make those kinds of decisions without second guessing .
That is , after all , what Jobs himself does .
But whatever these changes may encompass , they are likely to be fairly minor to the casual observer .
For the next six months , Apple will remain exactly the same .
And for the foreseeable future , Apple will continue to make great products that most of its target audience will fall all over themselves to buy .
Truth be told , attempting to predict the far future is always a difficult endeavour , but one thing is for sure : Steve Jobs as an iconic leader will surely be missed if he decides to make his temporary leave more permanent .
Should this happen , it would signal the end of an era , but not an end to Apple ."
2009-01-21,"Apple faces a review by the US Securities and Exchange Commission to check that its recent disclosures about Steve Jobs 's health did not mislead investors , Bloomberg is reporting .
The company is due to announce its first - quarter financial results ( covering the three months ending December 31 ) tonight at 2200 GMT .
Analysts will probably be asking about this matter - among others .
The review does n't mean that there is any evidence of wrongdoing ; but some proactive investigation by the SEC will be welcome .
It might also set out some ground rules for what actually needs to be disclosed , and when it needs to be disclosed .
Following growing rumours about his health near the end of December , Jobs issued a statement on January 5 , ahead of the Macworld trade show , saying he had been diagnosed with a hormone imbalance and that there was a straightforward treatment for it .
A week later though he said that the diagnosis had changed and that he would be taking medical leave - though not stepping down - until June .
Peter Henning , a former federal prosecutor and SEC lawyer who now teaches at Wayne State University Law School in Detroit , told Bloomberg that the SEC would probably only have cause to take action if it could be shown that the company tried to benefit by holding back information about an unambiguous diagnosis .
"" It would be difficult , and certainly a new area of the law , "" Henning said .
"" You would have to pin down exactly what they knew , and with a health issue – unlike a merger or a decline in revenue – it 's not subject to definitive answers .
"" At the AllThingsD blog ( owned by the Wall Street Journal ) , Kara Swisher - who has been pretty vocal in the "" leave the guy alone "" group - says : What will be most interesting is exactly how much companies do have to reveal about the health of their leadership and whether the relative fame and brand - critical nature of that exec matters more .
For example , does someone like Jobs or , say , Martha Stewart have more need to discuss their health than some lesser known CEO who might have a similar problem ?
And since it has been well known that Jobs has suffered from a bout with pancreatic cancer and recovered , does he have to disclose it all , given that even his curable version of the illness has complications that are well documented ?
And , most of all , how specific does Apple and Jobs have to be , and how frequently do they have to update , especially since a diagnosis is always a moving target ?
More to the point , given the bordering - on - crazed attention given to Jobs – who engenders so much passionate emotion – has also been off - putting and , worse , all over the map in terms of accurate information , what clarity can regulators provide ?
Swisher wrote last June that Apple investors who have not figured Jobs ' precarious health – after a round with any kind of cancer – into their investment strategies about Apple going forward need some serious reality medication themselves ."
2009-01-22,"Despite the shaky economy and fears over the health of chief executive Steve Jobs , iPod maker Apple has shaken off the gloom to register record financial results .
Over the three months to December 2008 , Apple had revenues of $ 10.17bn ( £ 7.3bn ) and profits in excess of $ 1.6bn , selling record numbers of iPods and iPhones along the way .
"" We 're proud … particularly in comparison to the rest of the market , "" said Apple 's chief financial officer , Peter Oppenheimer .
The figures are the company 's best quarterly results , up marginally on the same period last year and with revenue breaking the $ 10bn barrier for the first time .
Between October and December , Apple sold 22 m iPods and 4.36 m iPhones worldwide , pushing up the company 's share in both markets .
Apple also registered computer sales gains – selling 2.5 m Macs over the period – although it said it was increasingly seeing consumers move away from desktop computers and towards laptops .
Apple has had to deal with speculation and concern over the health of Jobs , who survived pancreatic cancer in 2004 .
Earlier this month , he revealed he was suffering from a "" hormonal imbalance "" before then announcing that his health problems had become "" more complex "" and saying he would take a five - month leave of absence to aid his recovery .
Apple 's chief operating officer , Tim Cook , who is deputising for Jobs , said : "" The values of our company are extremely well entrenched .
I think regardless of who is in what job , those values are so embedded in this company that Apple will do extremely well . ""
He did not comment on reports that the US financial regulator , the Securities and Exchange Commission , was investigating the way in which the news of Jobs 's health was revealed to shareholders .
Despite the record results , Oppenheimer warned the coming months could prove more difficult , particularly without the bumper Christmas season to boost figures .
Although the company is ploughing ahead with plans to continue expanding its popular retail operation – with another 25 shops worldwide in the next 12 months –
Oppenheimer said it was difficult to forecast sales for the next quarter , suggesting revenue guidelines of $ 7.6bn-8bn .
Apple stock registered gains of more than 8 % in after - hours trading .
Other technology companies fared less well .
Auction site eBay reported a 31 % drop in earnings from the same period last year , with a $ 367 m profit over the last three months , down from $ 531 m , .
Chip manufacturer Intel announced plans to close factories in Malaysia and the Philippinesand end production at facilities in Oregon and California .
The closures will affect up to 6,000 of the company 's 86,000 employeess ."
2009-01-23,"Even by Apple 's standards , the past few weeks have been turbulent .
The company delivered its final address , after 24 years , to the crowd at the annual Macworld conference , and then faced the news that co - founder and chief executive Steve Jobs was being forced to take a leave of absence for health reasons .
Earlier this week it announced record - breaking sales and profits – even as technology giants such as Microsoft , Intel and Sony announced jobs cuts or losses .
Yet even these dramatic events pale into insignificance in comparison to what happened at Apple a quarter of a century ago , when it launched what many believe was the product that changed the face of the computer industry : the Macintosh .
Twenty - five years ago , on 22 January 1984 , the Mac famously launched with a $ 1.5 m , 30-second commercial run during American TV 's biggest event , the Super Bowl .
More than 90 million people were watching when Apple unveiled the brand that , even after all these years , is still at the core of the company 's identity .
In a world dominated by computers where a mouse and "" windows "" are commonplace , it 's easy to forget what PCs were like in 1984 .
The best - selling ones , including the $ 5,000 IBM PC XT , $ 600 Commodore 64 and Apple 's own $ 1,200 Apple II , offered black screens and typewriter - like lines of green or white letters ; to copy a file you typed obscure lines like "" copy a:\autoexec.bat c:\windows "" .
Mistakes – sometimes disastrous ones – were common .
And typewriters , of course , do n't need a mouse .
The Macintosh , priced between $ 1,995 and $ 2,495 , aimed to change all that by introducing an affordable machine using the window - and - mouse system Jobs had seen on a visit to Xerox , which had an early version of the system .
"" It was obvious that every computer in the world would work this way someday , "" Jobs said later .
But how to tell people of the dramatic change it would offer ?
Not for Jobs a standard advert showing the machine .
Instead , in the science fiction spot – overseen by Blade Runner director Ridley Scott –
a legion of worker drones are lectured by a huge , Big Brother - like entity representing IBM and the existing computer companies .
Into the picture runs a young woman , symbolising Apple , who is chased by armed police before smashing the screen and freeing the enslaved masses .
An ominous , movie - trailer voice then intones : "" On January 24th , Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh .
And you 'll see why 1984 wo n't be like ' 1984 ' .
"" The ad has since been hailed as one of the greatest ever because of its audacious approach and immediate impact .
But it also reflected , in part , the optimism and – even hubris – of the young millionaires in charge of the company .
Apple co - founder Steve Wozniak remembers the first time he saw the commercial . ""
[ Jobs ] sat me down in front of a U - Matic tape machine and played the 1984 ad , one time , "" he told the Guardian in an interview last week .
"" I was stunned .
I was a bit naïve
–
I thought it was incredible science fiction .
It was very rebellious in a sense .
I said ' Wow , we 're going to show this at the Super Bowl ?
This is the best ad I 've ever seen . ' ""
According to Wozniak , Jobs said the company 's board had decided against showing the spot because of the $ 800,000 price for a Super Bowl premiere – almost leading Wozniak to dip into his own pockets , even though cost was n't the real reason they 'd gone cold on it .
"" I did n't realise the board had turned it down because they were shaky about coming out against Big Blue …
I thought it was the money , "" he says .
"" I thought about it and thought about it .
Steve and I were pretty wealthy by then , so I said ' I 'll pay half if you pay the other half … this thing should be shown –
this is us . '
"" In the end , however , it was approved – and seen by an estimated 97 million people .
The Mac was born .
Though even by then the project had been running for nearly five years .
It was the brainchild of Jef Raskin , a computer scientist from New York who had joined Apple in 1978 and believed that computers needed to be easier to use .
After seeing the futuristic computer systems used at Xerox 's Palo Alto Research Center – which used graphics instead of text input , and used a mouse as well as a keyboard – Raskin decided that it was the only way to successfully sell computers to millions of people .
As Raskin and others developed the idea of computers with a WIMP ( windows , icons , mouse , pointer ) interface , the team slowly coalesced , bringing together people from across the company , with a group including hardware engineer Burrell Smith , and programmers Bud Tribble and Bill Atkinson .
Andy Hertzfeld , who joined the Mac team in early 1981 , ended up acting as a bridge between Atkinson and Smith as one of the main developers behind the core system software .
He remembers the group 's reputation and how he started gravitating towards them . ""
When this little rebellious skunkworks Macintosh project started up …
well , I was friends with the guy he picked to be the hardware designer , Burrell Smith .
And so I just started helping Burrell out . ""
Wozniak also joined the team around the same time , drawn by the enthusiasm and ingenuity of the people working on the Mac .
"" I like crazy , eccentric people , "" he says .
"" I like people that have brilliant artistic minds ; people who think for themselves and contradict the established reality .
All those people somehow , the ones who could n't get a job elsewhere in Apple , who could n't satisfy a manager very well , were all grabbed by Jef Raskin on this Macintosh project . ""
In the early days , Jobs saw the Mac as an unwelcome diversion and potential competition for his own project , the high - end Lisa computer ( named after his first child ) .
The Lisa was also based on a graphical interface – but following a series of clashes with his own team , Jobs found a home with the Macintosh group .
"" They did n't like Steve 's personality , "" says Wozniak .
"" Steve would have a vision and they would fight it – they would have a different vision of their own .
They just got tired of Steve calling them idiots . ""
Jobs took part of Raskin 's vision of a low - cost , usable machine and moulded it into his own image .
Early prototypes included surprising little additions – such as a screen - flipping switch so that people could use a traditional green - on - black monitors instead of the Mac 's black - on - white screen .
But the extras were knocked back as Jobs stripped things down and helped guide things towards a finished product .
"" We thought we were going to change the world , "" says Hertzfeld , who has gathered together stories of the Mac 's development on the website Folklore.org and in the book Revolution in the Valley .
"" One of Steve Jobs 's roles was to keep drumming into us how important what we were doing was going to be to everyone .
We really believed it .
"" It was very exciting , but it was also a lot of pressure .
There was a funny tension between having a blast – we liked each other and we loved what we were doing –
but at the same time there was enormous pressure to do it quicker than we could .
When I started on the project , we were supposed to ship it in 10 months .
It ended up taking more like 36 months . ""
Despite the excitement inside the Macintosh division , to the rest of the company it remained an unloved splinter group .
The Apple II continued to be phenomenally popular and the basis for all of Apple 's success – indeed , it continued production until 1993 – and the $ 10,000 Lisa was seen as the machine of the future . ""
The Mac was kind of a funny hybrid between the two , and no one thought much of it , "" he says .
"" Even after Steve Jobs took it over , a lot of people thought it was the Steve Jobs back - to - the - garage fantasy , that he was trying to pull Apple back to its roots with a small team who were very excited about what they were doing . ""
Attitudes shifted quickly , however , thanks to mistakes elsewhere in the company .
When the $ 10,000 Lisa failed to make an impact on its release in 1983 , eyes began turning to Macintosh as a serious prospect .
"" People started investing their hopes in the Macintosh , "" says Hertzfeld , who now works for Google .
"" By the time the Mac shipped , it was kind of ' bet the company ' : it was clearly the most important thing at the company . ""
Dag Spicer , senior curator at the Computer History Museum in Palo Alto , California , says it was a radical departure to have a graphic representation of what was stored on the computer – rather than be forced to use the typewriter - like "" command line "" to instruct the machine about what to do . ""
[ Until then ] you had to know what all these incantations and secret words were , "" he explains .
"" The big difference with the Mac was that a complete novice – indeed children – 10-year - olds , five - year - olds who had never seen a computer before , seemed to instantly and intuitively lunge for the mouse . ""
Hertzfeld remembers the moment in more graphic terms .
"" It was like an orgasm , "" he says .
"" A release of all that hard work for three years , finally unveiling it to the world .
That just felt fantastic … that was the culmination . ""
On the back of its enormous exposure and marketing campaign , the Mac made big splash .
Early sales were strong , but after a few months just 50,000 of the machines had been snapped up .
Faced with another problematic product launch after the problems with the Lisa , Apple 's chief executive John Sculley – who had been lured away from Pepsi by Jobs , but was finding working alongside him increasingly difficult – decided to pump more resources into keeping the Mac afloat .
Over the coming years , the Mac secured itself in the market , thanks to the burgeoning desktop publishing industry .
It also spawned competitors : Microsoft launched the first version of Windows in 1985 , having licensed some aspects of the interface from Apple .
But as Windows became more capable , Apple filed a lawsuit , claiming in 1988 claimed that Windows copied the "" look and feel "" of the Mac .
The suit failed , and graphical interfaces became the norm for modern computers in homes and offices around the world .
In fact , says Hertzfeld , the influence of the ideas behind the Macintosh is so strong that it may have even hampered other developments .
"" It 's just amazing that a computer I can buy for a lot cheaper than the original Mac is literally 100,000 times more powerful , "" he says .
"" [ But ] the software is where I think there 's either a lack of imagination or a difficulty in changing paradigms .
It has n't moved significantly past the paradigms we set 25 years ago .
"" The reasons are many and complex , ranging from the sheer scale – and hence inertia – of the PC industry , to Microsoft 's dominance .
But without the Macintosh , says Wozniak , things would certainly not have been the same .
"" I do n't think we would [ be in the same place ] , but I do n't know what place we would be in , "" he says .
"" We certainly converted the world over to the mouse .
I like to say that every computer in the world is now a Macintosh . ""
Spicer agrees .
Even if inventors like Douglas Engelbart , who devised the first computer mouse , and teams like Xerox PARC had made great strides in creating the new ideas for how to use a computer , the Mac deserves a place in history as the machine that popularised such technologies .
"" I think the credit deservedly goes to the person or the entity that brings it to the masses , "" he says .
"" Apple is the one that brought it to the world .
You really have to give them a lot of credit . ""
In retrospect , Wozniak believes there is an analogy with the car industry – and that while his own Apple II was an integral part of the PC revolution , it will be the Macintosh that goes down as the machine that changed the way we think about computers .
"" I think the first Macintosh was like the Model T Ford – even 25 years later , you can see the resemblance to it , "" he says .
"" Sure , one is a little bit cruder and simpler … but 20 years from now , we 'll look at a Macintosh and pretty much understand the similarities . """
2009-01-24,"It 's 25 years since Apple first unveiled the Macintosh , a brand that helped revolutionise the PC industry and create the home computer as we know it .

2009-02-08,"Ancient journalistic principle : follow the money .
On 6 March last year , Steve Jobs , Apple 's CEO , currently on medical leave , launched the "" apps store "" for the iPhone .
This is the section of the iTunes store that sells applications - programs - which run on the phone .
Using a systems development kit supplied by Apple , programmers can write software for the phone and have it distributed by Apple , which takes a cut of 30 per cent of the selling price .
All of this was explained by Jobs with his customary zeal .
At this point , those of us who have been watching Mr Jobs strut his stuff for decades began to yawn .
Then something happened that made your columnist sit up .
On to the stage strode John Doerr , the driving force behind Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers of 2750 Sand Hill Road , Menlo Park , California - the world 's premier venture capital firm .
Mr Doerr said that he was so taken by this apps store idea that he was setting up a $ 100 m fund to invest in people who were interested in developing software for the iPhone .
In retrospect , it may have been a pivotal moment in the history of the computing industry .
Doerr , you see , has great judgment and a long history of spotting winners before anyone else .
Companies he backed in their early days , for example , include Amazon , Compaq , Electronic Arts , Google , Lotus , Macromedia and Sun Microsystems .
So if he thought there was something in the apps store idea then perhaps Jobs 's hyperbole might be justified .
And so it has proved .
There are now upwards of 15,000 programs in the store , at prices ranging from zero to a few dollars .
Since last July more than 500 m have been sold or downloaded for free ( depending on the app ) and are running on iPhones and iPod Touch devices all over the world .
Many are little more than inane diversions .
But many are extraordinarily ingenious and some downright beautiful .
There 's a lovely version of the London Tube map , for example , that expands and contracts at a touch and from which one can extract individual lines and even get routes from one station to another .
Useful enough in London , but imagine how attractive the corresponding app for Paris would be .
The best applications make ingenious use of the iPhone 's hardware , which enables it to sense movement , orientation and inclination .
One of my favourites is a version of the Labyrinth game , in which the user tries to guide a ball - bearing to a target while keeping it out of all the holes that lie in its path .
Another is called Air Mouse , which turns the phone into a wireless mouse for Apple laptops .
A third favourite is a digital "" clinometer "" - an application that turns an iPhone into a device for detecting levels and measuring slopes .
( Very useful for checking that one 's friends ' pictures are properly aligned . )
The most startlingly original app is iPhone Ocarina , which turns the phone into an uncanny simulation of the musical instrument beloved of small children .
Four coloured circles - two
small , two larger - appear on the phone 's screen .
Cover these "" holes "" with your fingers and blow gently into the phone 's microphone , and out of the speaker wafts the haunting sound of the ancient instrument .
Vibrato and other effects can be simulated by tilting the phone .
Go to http://bit.ly/Qguq and see for yourself .
Ocarina has spread like wildfire .
A search for "" iPhone Ocarina "" on YouTube produced 535 hits just now .
A cynic might say "" So what ? ""
But then you notice a globe symbol at the bottom of the screen .
Click on it and an image of the planet appears , and from a location somewhere in the world you see some notes being beamed up and you hear someone , at that location , playing his or her ocarina at that moment .
Click on next and the beam comes from another location - perhaps on another continent .
The software is making use of the phone 's location - sensing technology .
And the cost ?
Just 59p , including delivery via the internet to your iPhone .
This is what the next phase of software will be like : free applications via Open Source developers ( eg Linux ) or supported by advertising ( à la Google ) running on inexpensive netbooks ; and small , cheap programs like Ocarina sold in hundreds of millions and running on phones .
And making serious money .
Now we see what John Doerr saw when the iPhone was first mooted .
As usual , he got there first .
He always does .
You see , he follows the money ."
2009-02-22,"This is a second hand second hand story from what might not be the world 's most reliable anonymous source , so treat it accordingly .
Nonetheless , Philip Elmer - DeWitt 's Apple 2.0 blog at Fortune has picked up something from Robert X
Cringely 's latest column , Where 's Steve ?
Cringely says : A friend of mine has for years been one of Steve Jobs ' Internet chat buddies .
And as such his chat client has – again for years – shown as Steve came online each day and remained there for hours and hours as you 'd expect a Silicon Valley mogul to do .
And it 's a trend that continued well past Jobs ' announcement that he was taking a six - month leave of absence to get well .
But then Steve started logging - on less and less .
And several weeks ago he stopped logging - on at all . ""
Now this does n't necessarily mean anything .
And , like us , Cringely has been attacked on the grounds that what Steve Jobs does is nobody else 's business .
To which he replies , in a comment : I knew that this would be a polarizing column but that , in itself , is not a valid reason to avoid it .
And if the commenters are Apple shareholders , then I 'm really surprised .
If they are n't Apple shareholders , then I 'm not at all surprised they do n't care .
But no major company in the computer industry is guided more personally than is Apple by Steve Jobs .
Not even Microsoft under Bill Gates
and it was Bill Gates who told me that , admiringly .
So his condition IS material and he can change that by resigning and nothing else .
I 'm not calling for that , by the way .
But if he wants to take his name off my map that 's what it will require .
And that , like it or not , is the reality with regard to Steve Jobs and Apple .
Otherwise I suggest you heed the immortal words of Shirdi Sai Baba : "" Before you speak , ask yourself : Is it kind , is it true , is it necessary , does it improve upon the silence ? """
2009-02-26,"For most bosses influencing your company is hard at the best of times , let alone when you 're not even in the room .
Trifling things like physical presence are not a problem if you 're Steve Jobs , however : his fingerprints were all over Apple 's annual meeting of investors , despite the fact that he was n't even there .
Apple 's other senior staff took control of affairs at the AGM today in Cupertino since Jobs could n't be there ( he is , you might have heard , taking a leave of absence to fight ill health ) .
Investors were once again reassured that Jobs is still in the loop , and that he will be back in June as previously announced .
But they were also told that the company does have a succession plan in case the worst comes to the worst – except that it 's a secret . ""
He is deeply involved in all strategic matters … nothing has changed , "" said director Arthur Levinson - before adding that the board has been discussing succession strategies regularly , but that "" if there 's new information that we deem is important to disclose , then that will happen . ""
Despite all this interest , though , Apple appeared to take the line that his absence might be seen , but it would rarely be heard .
Questions about Jobs were limited , and the company also refused to comment on reports that US financial regulators were investigating how the disclosures over his health were handled .
Instead , Apple 's stand - in boss Tim Cook talked through the company 's recent financial results - which were pretty strong , though reports that the recession is biting into computer sales seem to have fallen away .
The intended impression , it appears , was to promote the idea that all is stable , safe and samey in Apple 's world - that it 's business as usual .
Still , one little aside meant that the assembled gang could n't entirely ignore the fact that their great leader was n't around : to mark the fact that Jobs turned 54 on Tuesday , one investor by leading in an impromptu rendition of Happy Birthday ."
2009-03-03,"Today , Apple "" refreshed "" its computer range , which means it mostly updated existing machines without doing anything strikingly novel such as , for example , a netbook .
It was also a low - key launch that mainly consisted of updating a web site , without a speech from Steve Jobs or anyone else from Apple 's management .
The Mac Mini got the biggest update , partly because it was the most out of date .
As rumoured , the new Mini has an Intel Core 2 Duo running at 2.0 or 2.26GHz , an nVidia 9400 M integrated graphics chip , and a slow 120 GB , 250 GB , or 320 GB hard drive .
It also has have five USB ports and , for reasons unknown , both Mini - DisplayPort and Mini - DVI ports .
( But still no Blu - ray drive , and no HDMI port . )
The iMac refresh brings faster Core 2 Duo processors ( 2.66GHz , 2.93GHz , or 3.06GHz ) , integrated nVidia graphics , and fast hard drives from 320 GB to 1 TB .
All the iMacs have glossy displays , so if you want matt , you 're out of luck .
The nVidia graphics chips use shared memory , which is a very good approach for economically priced notebooks .
However , you have to go to the 2.93GHz ( £ 1.499 ) and 3.06GHz ( £ 1,799 )
24-inch iMacs to get a real nVidia GeForce or ATI Radeon graphics card .
The Mac Pro gets an upgrade to Intel 's new Nehalem - based quad - core Xeon processors with up to 8 GB of memory , and eight - core systems with up to 32 GB .
All have four FW800 FireWire ports .
As my colleague Charles Arthur noted , one with everything maxes out at around £ 14,000 .
Apple reckons its new machines are more affordable than before , and in the US , that seems to be true .
Whether they will prove to be "" more affordable "" enough is another matter .
The fact is , most buyers wo n't pay Apple 's prices , or Sony 's prices , or the high price of Dell 's all - in - ones , so it 's pointless to argue that they 're equivalent or cheaper .
In the UK , things are a little worse , and the BBC 's Rory Cellan - Jones talked of Apple 's "" brave "" price rise .
He says : From now on , Apple 's entry - level computer , the Mac Mini , which comes without a screen or a keyboard , starts at £ 499 - as compared to £ 391 before today .
The 20 in iMac now costs £ 949 - the old price was £ 782 .
Right at the top of the range , the brand new 8-core Mac Pro costs £ 2499 , but the quad - core costs £ 1899 , up from £ 1712 .
On Twitter , Ian Betteridge , former editor of MacUser , posted some comparisons , saying : "" The closest specced equivalent Dell I can find to the £ 649 Mac mini costs ... £ 379 .
That 's with a 2.8GHz Core 2 Duo , rather than a 2GHz one .
Of course , if you go for the pretty Dell Studio Hybrid , the price is closer - £ 598 vs £ 649 .
But at least you have the choice not to . ""
The problem , says Apple UK , is that the pound has declined against the dollar -- though it might have been more pertinent to know how the Taiwanese and Chinese currencies were doing , since Apple uses Taiwanese suppliers who may assemble machines in China .
In the PC market you can easily pick up a notebook or desktop PC for £ 250-£350 , or a quad - core tower for £ 500 .
Netbooks are available for £ 150 to £ 300 .
They 're assembled in Taiwan or China as well .
People who have jobs will still be able to afford Macs , and there are plenty of Mac enthusiasts who are n't overmuch bothered about the price , but just want the latest systems .
But people who want to conserve their cash could either reduce their ambitions or put off purchases until later ."

2009-04-27,"Over the last few days , Forbes has been dribbling out information gathered from a very intriguing document that it obtained through a Freedom of Information application : the 2008 deposition hearing of one Steven P Jobs , the chief executive of Apple .
The deposition comes from the government 's case against former Apple general counsel Nancy Heinen , who was accused of fraud in the scandal over the company 's backdating of share options .
While the case itself is over - Heinen settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission for $ 2.2 m , and other Apple executives ( including Jobs ) made a $ 14 m settlement -
this is still a remarkable document for a number of reasons .
There 's no doubt that there is something very , very interesting about getting notoriously secretive technology executives speaking on the record about their business - after all , who can forget the video of the deposition of Bill Gates , where the Microsoft co - founder gets argumentative , defensive and rocks back and forth in his chair .
Of course , the 119 page text of Jobs deposition does n't give us the same insight as those videos of Gates - but it has plenty to tell us about Jobs himself , and about the way Apple works .
For starters , there is the ever - present subject of health .
Early in the deposition , the questioner points out that Jobs "" you mentioned that you 're not feeling well this morning "" and asks whether he is on any medication that could affect his answers .
Jobs responds by saying that he wants mitigation for looking uncomfortable : "" If you just play them this part , where I 'm feeling really bad or I look really bad or I look grimaced or anything .
It 's not because of the deposition , it 's just because . ""
( p10 )
It 's also interesting to see that Jobs - who has a notoriously spiky attitude towards things past - is very fuzzy on the early days of Apple .
He 's vague on things like the year that Apple 's stock market flotation took place , or which year he left Apple and went on to found NeXT and Pixar .
While , admittedly , those events took place more than 20 years ago , it 's still surprising that ca n't he pinpoint crucial moments such as when he became a multimillionaire .
When it comes down to the way the company runs , and the way he sees it , there are some fine - grained details .
Jobs veers between a seemingly - intimate knowledge of the way the company 's stock fluctuated and a hands - off attitude that essentially put some of the decision - making in other people 's hands .
It 's something revealing about the way , and who he considered to be important .
It was Jobs ' proposal to issue 4.8 m stock options to senior executives as "" golden handcuffs "" - incentives to stay at Apple and not get poached by rival companies .
His "" ultra key "" team was just four people :
Tim Cook - then executive vice president of operations , now COO and the man standing in for Jobs at the moment ; Fred Anderson , the chief financial officer , who resigned from Apple after the scandal and is now MD of Elevation partners ; Jon Rubinstein , the head of hardware ( now chairman of Palm , which is largely owned by Elevation ) ; and Avie Tevanian , then head of software , who left in 2006 .
Around page 89 he also goes into some details about why he thought he deserved extra financial compensation from the board ( something Forbes characterises as a "" nobody loves me "" speech ) .
"" Everybody likes to be recognized by their peers , and the closest that I 've got , or any CEO has , is their Board of Directors .
And as we 've seen in the discussions in the past hour , I spent a lot of time trying to take care of people at Apple and to , you know , surprise and delight them with what a career at Apple could be - could mean to them and their families .
And I felt that the board was n't really doing the same with me . ""
"" So I was hurt , I suppose would be most accurate word , and , you know , the board had given me some options , but they were all underwater ...
I had been working , you know ,
I do n't know , four years , five years of my life and not seeing my family very much and stuff , and I just felt like there is nobody looking out for me here , you know .
"" There 's no sense that he does n't take the deposition seriously , but there is a lot that he does n't recall .
Equally , there 's a feeling of entitlement in his demands for recognition .
( At the time of the stock controversy , Apple co - founder Steve Wozniak told me that he wanted some corrective action because "" basically leave other shareholders treated at a disadvantage "" and that "" Apple 's going to have to correct that for what they 've done "" )

2009-05-02,"When a black - jumpered Steve Jobs bounded on to a San Francisco stage just over two years ago to give the keynote speech at the annual gathering of the Apple faithful known as Macworld , he made his intentions very plain . ""
Every once in a while a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything , "" he said , to whoops and cheers . ""
Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone . ""
Jobs is given to hyperbole , but when , later this month , the first wave of British users are freed from the contracts they had to sign to grab one of the early iPhones and start contemplating a replacement , they will be faced with a range of remarkably similar devices .
That ever - expanding array of touchscreen handsets is just the physical evidence of the monumental change the iPhone has wrought .
It has sent some of the largest technology companies in the world back to the drawing board and proved that , given the opportunity , people will do far more with a phone than make calls and send texts .
For Apple , the iPhone may also be one of the most important products it has produced since its first personal computers in the late 1970s .
Before the iPhone there were already touchscreen devices ; there were mobile phones that could play music and videos ; there were mobile phones that could access the internet and send emails ; and it was already possible to download applications on to some devices in order to personalise them .
But hardly anyone took advantage of these features .
Finding them was hard enough ; getting them to work was a nightmare and most consumers gave up .
"" It is not as though Apple invented a totally new technology , "" says Adam Leach , principal analyst at consultancy Ovum .
"" What they did was re - think the whole mobile experience and produce a very polished experience compared with what people were used to . ""
The iPhone was also aimed at a segment of the market that the giants of the handset industry had been ignoring - the "" high end "" .
Nokia , Motorola and Sony Ericsson were chasing the middle of the market where the high volumes and high subsidies from the mobile phone operators were .
Their launch strategies involved upgrading their phones bit by bit - a better camera , a brighter screen or larger memory - so as to make the "" new "" device just a little more attractive .
Making a phone a different colour boosted sales , but did nothing to persuade anyone to do more than make calls , send texts or download the occasional ringtone .
The iPhone , in stark contrast , is sexy and very , very easy to use .
Since its arrival there has been a stampede back into making top - tier phones , not least because the recession has decimated the mid - market .
Cash - strapped consumers are demanding a much better phone in return for signing an expensive monthly contract ; if they do n't get one , they are opting for cheaper Sim - only deals and holding on to their old handset .
BlackBerry rushed out its first touchscreen device - the BlackBerry Storm - to be followed by the first from Nokia , the 5800 ; Samsung and LG have been churning out touchscreen devices from the Tocco and the Omnia to the Renoir and the Arena .
Waiting in the wings are new touchscreen devices from Palm ( the Pre ) and Sony Ericsson ( the Idou ) .
The iPhone 's ease of use , meanwhile , has turned the spotlight back on an often neglected aspect of mobile phones : the software .
A month after the iPhone appeared in the UK , Google brought together some of the biggest names in mobile to develop a new operating system .
Called Android , it has already appeared on two touchscreen devices , made by HTC , and many more are planned .
A year after the iPhone appeared , Nokia bought out its partners in Symbian , which produces operating systems for smartphones .
Then Microsoft rewrote Windows Mobile and its new guise - unimaginatively called Windows Mobile 6.5 - has borrowed a lot from the iPhone 's look and feel .
Already more than 1bn iPhone applications have been downloaded from the iTunes store .
The Android marketplace is operating , while RIM - maker of the BlackBerry - is also pushing applications at its users .
Nokia 's Ovi Market and Microsoft 's Windows Marketplace are both set to go live this month .
In the 12 months before the handset launched , Apple raked in $ 22bn in revenues .
That has rocketed to almost $ 34bn in the past year , largely boosted by the iPhone and iPod Touch .
The success of the iPod made Apple 's Cupertino headquarters one of the coolest places to work in Silicon Valley and the iPhone has made it one of the most powerful .
With so much now at stake , some experts suggest the iPhone will soon become the most important technology Apple 's empire has produced , even , potentially , eclipsing the computer business that revolutionised our lives in the 1980s .
There are an estimated 1bn personal computers in use worldwide , but that many mobile phones are sold every year and for many people their first experience of computing will be through a mobile phone .
But while Apple caused a revolution , it is unlikely to become dominant in the market .
It has sold just over 20 m iPhones since the first device appeared in 2007 ; in that time more than 1.5bn phones have been shipped by everyone else .
A similar thing happened with the personal computer market .
The concept was championed by Apple when it launched Apple II , the world 's first personal computer , in 1977 , and the first Macintosh in 1984 , but other players now lead the market .
Steve Wozniak , who co - founded Apple with Jobs in the mid-1970s , reckons the Apple II remains their most important innovation : "" That started the company and brought it the great wealth to develop so many things from then on .
It also began a revolution of computers at home , at school , etc .
The Macintosh has been around for over 20 years .
Sure , it 's more the name that stuck than any technology , but wait 20 years before comparing the importance of the iPhone in terms of historical importance to the Macintosh platform . """
2009-05-07,"Despite reports that the interlocking directorships between Google and Apple are under scrutiny , Eric Schmidt says he has n't considered resigning from his part - time role advising Steve Jobs and co.
Talking to reporters today , Schmidt said leaving Apple 's board was n't on the cards ( indeed , that the possibility had n't even crossed his mind ) - but that he realised Google had to be "" more careful about when and how we do things that will raise concerns of any party , "" reports Barrons .
Apparently because Google and Apple are n't primary competitors , Schmidt does n't see a problem .
That 's not what the law says , but hey .
Talking of the law , Schmidt should at least be getting some informed advice on the subject : yesterday Digital Daily dug up a juicy little staff training session on the specific laws being investigated by the FTC , conducted by Google 's lawyers , WSGR .
It 's fun , but not quite the smoking gun .
Reuters , meanwhile , devotes some space to an overview of the anti - competitive investigations around Google , including this quote from Bert Foer , the head of the American Antitrust Institute , that I think should be spread far and wide .
"" It 's not that it 's bad or poorly intentioned , "" said Foer .
"" It 's playing such a large role in the flow of information and has so much free cash to play with and so many creative and aggressive ideas that it presents potential problems regarding ... privacy and competition .
"" This is a prevailing view among the antitrust experts I 've spoken to , who also point out that there are two ways of looking at monopolies .
One , the American view , is that monopolies are only dangerous if they abuse their power directly to squash competitors .
The European approach , meanwhile , usually tends to believe that it 's dangerous for any company to become too big ( controversial , but perhaps vindicated by recent bailouts and government interventions ) .
It 's easy for political critics - or Google fans - to say the Obama administration is tending towards a European model whenever it looks at the internet giant .
But Google has many tendrils .
It 's influential .
Investigations do n't necessarily mean anything .
And , let 's not forget , the Bush government was so ridiculously lax about competition law that any concern about seems positively socialist by comparison ."

I do n't see the point .
They are dead .
They are in denial .
He sees a bifurcated market where the newspapers die off and what remains are the "" high value - added , brainiac magazines "" like The New Yorker and The Economist .
He described the situation confronting newspapers as a disaster and said it would be worse than the collapse of the US auto industry .
But he laid the blame squarely at the feet of newspapers .
They had long lived off of massive profits , but that was over .
"" It was based on scarcity of information and monopolies , "" he said .
Even after the recession ends , he predicted that the US newspaper industry would n't ever recover .

2009-05-27,"Apple wants European officials to change the law so that iTunes customers across the continent can pay the same amount for their downloads no matter where they live .
That 's according to chief executive Steve Jobs , in documents released today by the European Commission .
Right now , the price of music and video downloads from iTunes vary wildly depending on which country you live in .
But according to a report ( PDF ) detailing meetings between senior business figures and EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes towards the end of last year , Apple is lobbying Brussels to remove the complex series of agreements that it says prevents it from selling downloads for a single price .
The document says that Jobs believes the current licensing system – in which music publishers can charge different rates in different countries - "" might make it difficult to operate online stores accessible for any consumer , anywhere in the EU "" .
In order to make pricing more straightforward , Jobs suggests harmonising the rights and creating a way in which digital can be sold anywhere in Europe for the same price .
In addition , Jobs suggested that a single pricing model would allow Apple to launch iTunes in a number of eastern European countries where it does not currently have a presence .
The problem is not a small one .
British consumers have long been worried that they pay over the odds for music downloads – something that concerned European regulators so much that last year they forced Apple to bring down iTunes prices for the UK .
Despite this change , however , prices across Europe still vary massively .
For example , Britain 's current No1 iTunes download is Boom Boom Pow by the Black Eyed Peas – a track that will set you back
99p if you buy it from the UK store .
In Germany , the same track costs just € 0.99 – the equivalent of 86p – while French iTunes users are asked to splash out € 1.29 ( £ 1.13 ) for exactly the same file .
All this compares poorly to the US , of course , where the track is on sale for $ 1.29 , a mere 81p – but it highlights the disparity between countries just miles apart from each other and , in some cases , using the same currency .
The differences have become even more noticeable since Apple relaxed its rules on iTunes downloads – a move that saw rivals like Amazon try to capitalise on the rising price of some tracks by undercutting Apple 's new prices .
The meeting - which had attendees including Jobs , Mick Jagger , the head of EMI and eBay chief executive John Donahoe – addressed a number of issues concerning the way the internet changes cross - border sales .
According to the documents , the panel concluded that a "" one stop shop "" for rights across the European Economic Area ( EEA ) was a good solution – but would require careful negotiation .
"" All participants recognise the need for EEA wide licensing in the online environment , "" said the report .
"" It is the responsibility of the industry involved to develop workable licensing solutions . """

- unveiled his "" one more thing "" , which turned out to be a computer shaped like a cube , eight inches on each side .
Impressive .
Expensive too . ""
So who do you expect to buy this ?
"" I asked David Moody , then Apple 's head of desktop systems .
He insisted it was n't just some flight of fancy : "" We had customers coming to us and saying that they wanted a class of product that nobody was offering .
They wanted to have professional power but did n't want the baggage of the slots and big box on their desk .
"" You may know the rest of the story .
The Cube was iced a year later .
Sure , some people wanted its power but they also wanted to , but could n't , add expansion cards and lots of memory .
Those who liked its looks and did n't mind the lack of expansibility found the price tag - $ 1,799 in the US , £ 1,149 in the UK - too steep .
I think I 'm correct in saying that Apple has never since discontinued a product because of insufficient sales .
It 's killed things off - the eMac , the iPod mini , the 160 GB iPod - but not because they were left shamefaced on the shelf .
That tells us Apple is a rigorously focused company nowadays .
Which is why I do n't think it 's going to announce either a tablet or a netbook at next week 's WWDC conference - or any time .
The tablet is the easier prediction .
Ignore the people who say , "" If Apple made a tablet I 'd buy one in a heartbeat !
"" They 're a niche , just like those who led Apple astray over the Cube .
And , despite its image , Apple does not build for niches .
It aims for the biggest market it can - within the limits it sets itself - making premium products .
It would be happy with 100 % of the top 5 % most expensive computer purchases , because it would make tons of profit .
( It settles for less , obviously . )
Tablet computers are the nichest of niche products .
Great for doctors and , um , architects ?
Hopeless for the average person who needs a rapid way to interact with , and input data to , web pages , email , spreadsheets and documents .
But , you say , Apple sells the iPhone , which is like a small tablet !
It 's got an onscreen touch keyboard .
Just make it bigger , and there 's your tablet !
Nope .
The iPhone ( and iPod Touch ) are successes in the category Apple has aimed them at - highly portable internet devices .
They are n't intended to replace a computer at times when you 'd use a computer ; they 're serving a different need .
The tablet computer is generally envisaged as a replacement for a laptop or desktop .
Why , though ?
When would you pull out your tablet and start working with that , rather than attaching a keyboard to it - ie , use a laptop ?
Alternatively , why would you use a tablet if you could use an iPhone ?
It 's a solution looking for a problem .
Which then leads us on to the netbook question .
Why would n't Apple launch a netbook ?
Besides Tim Cook 's repudiation of the idea , which does n't necessarily count for anything - if the sun were one of Apple 's products it would deny it was going to rise until dawn , or possibly slightly after - there 's that "" market "" mathematics .
Netbooks are designed down to a price ; they 're after price - conscious consumers .
Apple is n't .
It does n't want 100 % of the bottom 5 % of the market .
But that 's what the netbook market is .
Do n't expect that either next week .
But there will be a new iPhone to go with the updated iPhone OS , of that
I 'm sure .
And I think that 's going to be a very interesting entrant to the market ."

The fact that Steve Jobs was never due to appear at Apple 's WWDC announcements yesterday has n't stopped everyone and their dog from indulging in a bit of chin scratching .
Fast Company 's David Lidsky suggests that without Jobs , "" what felt revolutionary now seems incremental and small "" ; while Business Week speculates on whether Tim Cook will take over as CEO .

2009-06-10,"For most of the 5,000 attendees at Apple 's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco this week , the first taste of proceedings came from a familiar face : not Steve Jobs , but John Hodgman , the charmingly nerdy face of "" I 'm a PC "" in America
( he 's the character played by David Mitchell in the British ads ) .
Hodgman came onto a huge screen and told the crowd they just had to stop being so cutting edge .
"" I want to be the first to wish you a week with some innovation - but not too much , "" he said .
"" You 've already sold 1bn apps , do n't you think that 's enough ?
"" The ironic introduction set the tone for announcements largely intended to project the image that Apple 's new software - both the forthcoming Snow Leopard version of Mac OS X , and the 3.0 version of the iPhone 's system - is bigger and better than anything made by its rivals .
Despite the column inches handed over to the hardware launched on Monday , including the new iPhone 3GS , events at the Moscone Center were really focused on software .
That should n't be surprising , given that programming pays the bills of attendees , but Apple 's recent penchant for launching gadgets at WWDC had people waiting expectantly for hardware news .
Once all the hubbub was over , however , what did Apple really deliver ?
Perhaps the most important thing was dates : the iPhone 3.0 software will arrive on 17 June , while Snow Leopard is set to be available in September .
This ends the speculation about when consumers might be able to get their hands on what developers are creating behind the scenes .
Despite the strict timelines and the refrain of "" innovation , innovation , innovation "" - though much of Apple 's product line - up has been seen already - the iPhone update has been talked about for months , while Snow Leopard was first announced at the same event last year .
That did n't stop Apple from pinpointing a variety of new technologies that it is using , and providing more details that made the case for upgrading .
For Snow Leopard that boiled down to a few key areas , some , to make a selection of basic activities easier : advanced 64-bit support ; multithreading processes to make better use of the power of modern machines ; and support for Microsoft Exchange - which could allow Apple to scoop a few more business users .
The company made a big push on several applications , including the Safari 4 web browser , that Apple claims is the fastest on the market and up to eight times faster than Microsoft 's Internet Explorer 8 , and its media player , Quicktime , which has been rewritten and redesigned .
These changes may involve major developments under the bonnet but on the surface they appear incremental - one reason , admitted the software boss Bertrand Serlet , that the name Snow Leopard was chosen as the successor to Leopard .
Perhaps the biggest surprise was the price .
Snow Leopard will cost just $ 29 in the US , a marked contrast to the $ 129 that previous major updates have cost .
While the price shift is partly a recognition that it is not the most essential upgrade in Mac history , and partly an attack on Windows 7 - due to go on sale just a few weeks later - it is also an unexpected recessionary business manoeuvre .
Apple has entrenched itself at the higher end of the market , keeping its profit margins inflated as much as possible .
But a $ 29 upgrade price shows , at least partially , that the company recognises the struggles of some of its customers : it makes upgrading from Leopard a straightforward decision .
Access all areas It is in the iPhone , however , that the company is making the largest strides .
According to Apple 's vice - president , Scott Forstall , the 3.0 software developers kit now includes access to more than 1,000 APIs - delivering a set of tools that seemed beyond the imagination just a year ago , and allowing them increasingly deep access to the phone .
The speed of development on the iPhone is remarkable and the inclusion of new API systems and new services , despite the fact they have nearly all been seen before , impressive .
Among the new developments were peer - to - peer connections , largely aimed at allowing iPhone gamers to play against each other ; greater access to other iPhone services from inside applications ; and better streaming access to enable video and audio over the network .
The demonstrations , when they worked , got the crowd cheering with unbridled enthusiasm .
Amid all the excitement it is worth highlighting one statistic : that Apple referred proudly to how many people are using OS X.
According to Phil Schiller , Apple 's senior vice - president of worldwide product marketing , the installed base of users has tripled in the past three years to around 75 million .
Those figures are a little disingenuous as they include the 40 million iPhones and iPod Touch devices that run iPhone OS - a system derived from , but not the same as , its Macintosh cousin .
State of play
This leaves the company in a strangely ambiguous position : happy to claim large user figures by glossing over the fact that , if it were to compare like with like , Apple would be left trailing by its rivals .
The installed base of Windows Mobile , for example , is only a little bigger than the iPhone OS , at around 50 million , but once you include full computer systems , Microsoft has another 1bn Windows PCs in the bank .
That is not to underplay the iPhone 's impact , but it does hint at a degree of insecurity on Apple 's part - particularly as the company 's desktop computer business continues to shrink in the face of its other devices .
That is , perhaps , one of the reasons why Apple chose to knuckle down at WWDC and focus on delivering what it had already promised .
The pace of change has seen Apple shift rapidly away from what was once its core business - big desktop computers - and to a world full of surprises ; one thing that software developers , who need time to prepare for major changes , do not tend to like .
For once , they got what they wished for ."
2009-06-13,"The big news at the Apple Worldwide Developer Conference last week was that Steve Jobs is apparently still away on sick leave .
So the limelight fell on subordinates .
They announced a new version of the iPhone , drastic price reductions on the old model , a new operating system for old and new iPhones and the next version of the company 's OS X operating system .
But widely - touted expectations that the company would launch a "" tablet ' computer were not realised .
Which makes sense , really : a tablet would represent a major change in direction for Apple and it 's hard to imagine Jobs leaving such an announcement to a mere underling .
As far as unveiling tablets is concerned , Steve 's only peer is Moses .
Since hardware is what turns report ers on , it 's not surprising that the new iPhone received the lion 's share of attention .
It 's finally got a decent camera , for example , can now record movies and has a digital compass , whatever that is .
And so on .
But far more interesting is the new version of the phone 's operating system , which significantly expands its capabilities - and thus the potential for developing new applications that will run on it .
At the launch , Apple 's vice - president , Scott Forstall , said that the 3.0 software developers ' kit now includes access to more than 1,000 APIs ( geekspeak for application programming interfaces ) , thus providing software developers with a set of tools that allow them increasingly deep access to the phone 's hardware .
So stand by for an even bigger upheaval in an unprecedentedly explosive marketplace .
There are now something like 50,000 apps ( applications ) for the iPhone , and Apple has long passed the billionth download point for these small programs , creating a seismic shift in the conception and marketing of software .
It also heralds the possibility of an unprecedented extension of corporate control on people 's behaviour .
To understand why , we need to understand how this new software ecosystem works .
At present , anyone can write an app for the iPhone .
But to get it distributed they have to get it on to the App Store on the iTunes site .
Nothing gets on to iTunes without being explicitly approved by Apple .
The company 's rationale is that it does n't want unsavoury or tasteless applications being distributed via its site .
Second , and more importantly , it does n't want programs that might screw up the key functions of the phone .
So far , so reasonable .
But something happened recently that caused your columnist to sit up .
A smart young developer named Jamie Montgomerie created an app called Eucalyptus which enables an iPhone user to search the vast ( 20,000-volume ) collection of public - domain books that have been digitised over many decades by the wonderful Gutenberg Project - and to download selected texts to the iPhone .
It seemed a lovely idea whose time had come .
But out of the blue , Apple rejected Eucalyptus .
Why ?
Well , according to Montgomerie 's blog , the App Store reviewer used Eucalyptus to search for The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana , which was apparently enough to disqualify the application because it "" contains inappropriate sexual content "" .
And at this moment , alarm bells began to ring .
The key point is that Eucalyptus does not provide any content .
It is simply a tool that enables users to search a repository of books .
Yet here was a computer company saying customers should be denied use of the tool because they might use it to access content some anonymous reviewer considered inappropriate .
You do n't have to be George Orwell to see where this logic might lead .
Which underscores a more fundamental point .
The wildfire success of the iPhone heralds a world in which the mobile phone will become most people 's prime gateway to the internet .
But the iPhone is tightly controlled ; nothing appears on it unless Apple gives it the nod .
Anything Apple dislikes can be removed next time the user synchronises the phone with a personal computer .
So its control of the gateway is total .
To its credit , Apple spotted the idiocy of the Eucalyptus ban and the decision was reversed .
Your columnist downloaded the app ( at a cost of pounds 5.99 ) and has been using it ever since .
In fact , he 's now wandering around with a copy of James Joyce 's Ulysses in his shirt pocket .
Which is appropriate since next Tuesday is Bloomsday ."
2009-06-17,"Shoppers at Apple 's flagship store in the heart of San Francisco were treated to a surprise last week - not an appearance by Steve Jobs , or even the new iPhone , but a strange advert that appeared on the side of the building .
Promising "" the cure for iPhone envy "" , the ad offered shoppers the chance to get "" your iTunes library on any device .
In seconds.""For most , teasing Apple on its home turf could be a solitary , fleeting moment of fame .
But doubleTwist , the company behind the stunt , is no stranger to controversy .
The Californian startup boasts one of the world 's most notorious hackers among its founders , the Norwegian whiz - kid Jon Lech Johansen .
Better known as DVD Jon , he cracked the movie industry 's anti - piracy codes in 1999 , enabling anybody to copy DVDs straight onto their computer .
This put him at the top of Hollywood 's most - wanted list and in 2002 ( aged just 19 ) he went on trial in Oslo .
In the end , Johansen was found not guilty of computer crime , but it is clear that he 's not yet finished thumbing his nose at the establishment .
"" I suppose our two biggest competitors are Apple on the one hand and Microsoft on the other , "" says Monique Farantzos , the former physicist who co - founded doubleTwist with Johansen .
"" What we 're building is a neutral platform that works with any device or content . ""
Transfer policy
The company 's premise is straightforward : that you should be able to take your music , videos and other files and transfer them easily between any of the vast array of gadgets on sale today - iPods , mobile phones , digital cameras , laptops and games consoles .
Right now , they suggest , people get frustrated and confused by software that either locks them in to one provider or just does n't work across different gadgets .
"" iTunes is pretty good at what it does , but from a consumer perspective it does n't do everything , "" says Johansen , when we meet at the company 's small , chaotic offices .
"" If you have anything you 've downloaded from the net , iTunes does n't support it .
That 's where we come in . ""
The software is heavily based around Johansen 's work breaking down a variety of copy - protection systems - as well as breaking the DVD encryption ( known as DeCSS ) , he was the first to reverse - engineer Apple 's Fairplay digital rights mechanism .
Although it might seem a niche market , the company is betting that people want to be able to make better use of their technology .
And it 's an idea that has drawn in big backers : doubleTwist has raised $ 10 m in funding from a variety of investors , including the former Disney chief Michael Ovitz , the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka - shing and the venture capital groups Northzone and Index .
In fact , the investors have been so enthusiastic that it was they who initially convinced the company to get started - plucking Johansen and Farantzos out of their technology consulting business to join Silicon Valley 's startup scene . ""
Index Ventures seduced us , "" says Farantzos .
"" We met some of their other companies and looked at what they did - and then they convinced us to go into software . ""
Since then , their moves have read like something from the Official Web 2.0 Strategy Guide : build a popular company first and then try to make money later .
"" We believe that , with a very powerful free application , you can layer on top of it with various products and services that people will buy , "" says Farantzos .
That includes adding more media to the service - movie trailers , podcast support and backup systems that help people keep copies of their media library in the cloud .
Plus they intend to make plenty of deals along the way to make doubleTwist the media - management software of choice for all sorts of devices .
Although the company wo n't say how many times its software has been downloaded , the duo claim to be in negotiations with a number of mobile phone companies and networks to have doubleTwist software shipped with new handsets ( allowing people to move their iPod libraries over ) .
Expanding in this way is not cheap , says Farantzos , who confirms they are looking at ambitious expansion plans that will burn through their most recent $ 5 m investment within a couple of years .
"" We 're going to keep on investing .
It 's better to spend during a recession , "" she says .
"" You can make advances while other people are slowing down . ""
At ease with the establishment But would n't most companies quake at dealing with someone with DVD Jon 's reputation for rubbing the establishment up the wrong way ?
"" We have n't had any problems so far : it 's only been a benefit , it 's opened doors for us , "" says Johansen .
"" When I think about the great software companies , they were started by hackers . ""
True : but for every great hacker - turned - entrepreneur success story , there are also many failures .
One that springs to mind is Napster - another industry - threatening technology whose teenage founder , Shawn Fanning , fell foul of the establishment .
While Fanning has made a moderate success of his post - Napster enterprises ( the digital download system Snocap and the gaming service Rupture ) it has been far from the stellar career that many predicted in the late 1990s .
Turning infamy into profit is not easy for anyone .
However , the experienced investor Fred Destin , a partner with Atlas Ventures , says that having a bit of history can still be a bonus for entrepreneurs - and not just because it gives them notoriety .
He is not linked to doubleTwist , but believes that sometimes the best entrepreneurs are those who walk the legal tightrope .
"" We back disruption , "" Destin told the Guardian . ""
Very often technology evolves faster than the legal framework , and hence we can find ourselves on the wrong side of the law . ""
He points to the example of the video site DailyMotion , where he is a board member , which has faced a number of court cases in its native France . ""
Creating jurisprudence or getting laws changed is part of how we bring about change ; so it 's not illogical for us to sometimes find ourselves , or our companies , in court . ""
Whichever side of the hacker story doubleTwist falls , it is still clear that Johansen still thrills from getting one over on the big boys .
Every time a new device or a fresh version of some copy - protection mechanism is released , the 25-year - old and his team concentrate on cracking it , usually succeeding within a few minutes .
"" You have to hold a bit of that maverick streak in you , both as an entrepreneur and a venture capitalist , "" says Destin ."
2009-06-19,"Steve Jobs ' other company is entering the Windows netbook market with the Disney Netpal , aimed at children aged 6 - 12 .
It will have an 8.9 inch screen and will be available in Princess Pink or Magic Blue .
DigiTimes in Taiwan says the XP - based Netpal "" is durable with a reinforced mechanical design , while offering a unique Disney user interface "" .
Two models -- one with a 16 GB solid state drive , one with a 160 GB hard drive -- will be sold via Toys R Us , Amazon and other retailers at a suggested $ 349.99 .
The Netpal should be available in the US in the summer , and might reach Europe towards the end of the year .
There 's a mostly - untapped kids market for netbooks , and there 's at least a potential market for branded netbooks -- we 've already seen Hello Kitty , for example .
How many units they might shift in a depressed economy is another matter .
As The Wall Street Journal has pointed out : In 2004 , Disney introduced a children 's desktop PC that was bright blue with a monitor framed by a mouse - ears silhouette .
The Disney Dream Desk PC , which was priced at about $ 900 , with the monitor , did n't gain much traction .
The Disney branding on the netbook is more subtle .
The netbook is part of a raft of new devices from Disney Consumer Products , which is also launching its first camcorders and MP3 players for kids , a $ 129 "" Ultimate Buzz Lightyear robot that responds to voice commands and plays laser tag , a Wii - like Zippity TV - game system for preschoolers , and a next - generation digital still camera whose body twists to let kids take close - ups of themselves , "" reports TWICE ."
2009-06-20,"Apple chief executive Steve Jobs underwent a liver transplant earlier this year , according to a report in the Wall Street Journal .
Jobs - who survived pancreatic cancer in 2004 - has been on medical leave from Apple since January in an attempt to cope with "" complex "" but undisclosed health problems .
According to the company , he is due to return to day - to - day business at the Californian technology firm by the end of June .
But today the Wall Street Journal suggests that Jobs underwent a liver transplant two months ago at an American medical facility , and will most likely only return to part time duty in the short term .
Quoting information from unnamed sources , the Journal said the 54-year - old billionaire underwent the surgery in Tennessee and has been advised to scale back his commitments and "" work part - time for a month or two "" .
Apple has refused to confirm or deny the claim , saying only that he still intends to return to work by the end of the month .
The incessant rumours about Jobs 's health have whipped up investors , the press and Apple 's legion of fans into a frenzy , beginning last year when he appeared to undergo a dramatic drop in weight .
At the start of 2009 , speculation over his health forced the notoriously private businessman into a public statement in which he blamed a "" hormone imbalance "" .
Days later , however , he made another public announcement , saying that his problems were more complex , and would force him to take temporary leave from the company he helped found 33 years ago .
Shortly after Jobs dropped out of the public eye , a series of rumours suggested he was looking for a liver donor to help overcome the issue - believed to be a result of the surgery he underwent to treat his earlier cancer ."
2009-06-22,"The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Wednesday 24 June 2009
The article below on the chief executive of Apple referred to memorable TV ads aired in 1984 to promote the Apple Macintosh computer and said these portrayed "" mindless conformity in Jobs 's supreme rival , Bill Gates of Microsoft "" .
The ads were actually tilting at the industry 's giant of the day , IBM .
A young Bill Gates is on record praising the Mac .
When Steve Jobs rolled out the Apple Macintosh computer in January 1984 he did so , true to form , by commissioning one of the most memorable TV adverts ever created .
It bore several classic Jobs hallmarks .
It was cool .
It was darkly funny .
And it seemed to portray a mindless conformity in Jobs 's supreme rival , Bill Gates of Microsoft .
Modelled on the George Orwell novel Nineteen Eighty - Four , it showed row upon row of grey - suited , grey - faced male automatons ( for which read PC users ) sitting in front of a huge screen upon which Big Brother pontificates .
A blonde woman in white and red running gear - Ms Apple by implication - hurtles towards him and hurls a mallet at the screen , which erupts into a fireball just as Big Brother is saying , "" We shall prevail ! ""
Close observers of the ever more mysterious world of Steve Jobs will have remembered that advert this weekend with a wry chuckle .
For , in the last few days , the behaviour of Apple 's chief executive and his top team has become increasingly erratic , bordering on bizarre , with definite shades of Big Brother .
Over the weekend we learned that Jobs had had a liver transplant two months ago .
You could almost hear the sharp intake of breath among geeks everywhere , particularly in the west - coast techno - Mecca of Silicon Valley .
At last there was an explanation for his gaunt appearance and evident weight loss , for his disappearances and for this year 's six - month break from work .
But consider the manner in which the news came out .
It broke late on Friday night - that witching hour beloved of buriers of bad news - at the end of a day that had also seen Apple launch its latest iPhone .
The Wall Street Journal had the exclusive and , unusually for them , ascribed it to no source at all , provoking a mass of blogger speculation that the source could only have been Jobs himself .
All that Apple would say on the subject was to repeat parrot - like the phrase that "" Steve continues to look forward to returning at the end of June "" .
Big Brother would have been proud .
The news of the liver transplant was just the latest of a series of events that saw Jobs and Apple dig themselves deeper and deeper into a pit of secrecy surrounding his health .
The first the world knew about his problems was in August 2004 , when it was announced he had been treated for a rare form of pancreatic cancer .
Later it dribbled out that in fact the diagnosis had been made months earlier , in October 2003 , and that he had tried initially to beat it with a peculiar dietary treatment ( we 're talking about a Buddhist vegetarian approach here ) .
Earlier this year came the baffling claim that he had a relatively simply treated "" hormone imbalance "" , followed just days later by the announcement that Jobs would be stepping down for six months to focus on his health .
The relative news blackout over almost five years has prompted desperate attempts by Jobs 's devoted band of followers to reach the truth .
Bloggers have tried to confirm that April 's liver transplant took place in Memphis , Tennessee , by tracking the movements of Jobs 's private plane .
They have also pored over records of property transactions near the Memphis hospital that specialises in such treatments , to identify the mansion house they believe he bought while preparing for and recovering from the operation .
Why go to such extraordinary lengths to find out information that Jobs clearly prefers to keep private ?
Why does his health matter so much to anyone other than himself and his close family and friends ?
Here 's a clue to the answer to those questions : Apple share prices .
When Jobs took over the company for the second time in 1996 its stock was trading at about $ 4 a share ; now it approaches $ 140 .
Or look at more micro movements .
When his six - month break was announced in January , share values plummeted to as low as $ 78.20 .
Even unfounded rumours about his health can move the markets : last December , Apple stock went up simply on unconfirmed reports that Jobs had been spotted looking well at his favourite frozen yoghurt outlet in Palo Alto .
On another occasion , an inaccurate blog report that he had suffered a heart attack depressed shares by more than 5 % .
Such figures , impressive though they are , are mere symptoms of the peculiar power of Steve Jobs ; they do not provide a diagnosis .
For that one has to look back into the cluttered garage of Jobs 's family home in California where , in 1976 , aged just 21 , he joined forces with Steve Wozniak to create their first personal computer .
They built 25 of the first Apple I prototype , with the help of an order from a local company , and within just four years had exploded from a garage industry into a major international technology giant .
Millions of words and a library full of books have been dedicated to trying to understand how Jobs did it .
But two characteristics stand out beyond all others .
First , Jobs is a man who does not suffer from self - doubt : everything he does is imbued with absolute self - confidence .
Second , he is obsessive about Apple and its products , which he engages with at a level of detail virtually unheard of among his fellow CEOs .
Rob Enderle , a technology analyst who has been covering Apple for more than two decades , says that Jobs has "" redesigned Apple around him .
In any product , he 's involved from its first design stage to its final presentation . ""
That attention to detail , Enderle says , includes coal - face negotiations with phone carriers and suppliers in which Jobs uses his legendary temper to scare other companies into submission .
Enderle tells the story of one firm that supplied a faulty computer chip to Apple .
Though the fault was Apple 's own , Jobs apparently insisted the supplier rebuilt the chip in an impossible 60 days , threatening never to work with them again if the deadline was missed .
"" That 's the kind of thing that scares people to death .
They know that if you let him down you can lose your contract , your job or even your company , "" Enderle says .
Jobs has a similar nerve - jangling reputation among Apple 's 35,000 employees .
Workers at the company 's Cupertino headquarters have a phrase - "" being Steved "" , meaning to be at the receiving end of his wrath . ""
He uses fear more effectively than any CEO I 've ever seen , "" Enderle says .
Leander Kahney runs an Apple analysis website , Cultofmac.com , and is author of Inside Steve 's Brain , which seeks to understand his creative genius .
He believes that since Jobs returned to Apple in 1996 , having resigned from his own creation 11 years previously , he has set out to remould it in his own image .
The new Apple bears the imprint of Jobs 's obsessiveness .
"" When they take on a problem at Apple they discuss it from every possible angle until they have absolutely mastered it . ""
Kahney points to a telling - and rare - anecdote from Jobs 's own private life .
A few years ago he needed to replace the family washer - dryer .
Where most people might go online and select a model that looked right for them , Jobs embarked on a two - week consultation process with his wife and children .
Every night around the dinner table they explored a different aspect of the ideal machine - how much water it used , its ecological footprint , its cleaning ability and how it impacted on clothes .
Then he went out and bought one of the most expensive German models .
Apple is sticking to that Big Brother mantra that Jobs will return later this month , though it adds that he may come back initially in a part - time capacity .
The question , though , is can the culture that he has created in his own image survive him ?
Other senior executives have been stepping up to the plate since Jobs 's enforced absence .
Tim Cook is widely tipped as a possible replacement as CEO .
He has run the show for the last few months , proving himself to be a diligent and safe pair of hands , but analysts wonder whether he lacks the creative spark that Jobs has had in abundance .
Last Friday 's launch of the latest iPhone was competent , but where was the magic ?
The same issue exists in reverse for Jonathan I ve , Apple 's legendary designer .
As a design artist he is unsurpassed , but he lacks the clout and the fear factor that Jobs uses to generate loyalty and drive results .
And then there 's that other overwhelming question , which has little bearing on Apple 's commercial future but has every bearing on Jobs 's personal prospects .
Why would someone facing the threat of cancer spreading from his pancreas to other organs want to bother with mere gadgetry any longer ?
Has n't he got bigger worries now on his mind than whizzbang phones ?
There is another clue here provided by a speech he gave in 2005 - just after his surgery for cancer - to a class of graduating students at Stanford .
He spent a third of the speech talking directly about death . ""
Remembering I 'll be dead soon is the most important tool I 've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life .
Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose .
You are already naked .
There is no reason not to follow your heart . ""

The bombshell news that Steve Jobs had a liver transplant - first reported in an unsourced story by the Wall Street Journal and since confirmed by CNBC - is still echoing around the technology industry .
The smallest details are now being scrutinised : his movements , his alleged mansion in Memphis , his medical prognosis .
And if the torrent of attention seems a little overwhelming , it 's probably just a recognition of the fact that Jobs is one of the most influential figures in the technology industry - and hence society - over the past 30 years .

2009-06-22,"The eyes of the technology industry will be watching Californian giant Apple this morning , following reports over the weekend that chief executive Steve Jobs had undergone a liver transplant .
The Wall Street Journal ended months of speculation about Jobs 's health late on Friday by reporting that the billionaire technologist had been admitted to a Tennessee hospital two months ago for the procedure .
The report on his condition was not attributed to any source – a highly unusual step for the Journal – but said that Jobs was currently in recovery and would return to the company on a part - time basis .
Others have since confirmed the news .
Investors and Apple 's legion of fans are closely monitoring events ahead of the start of Wall Street trading , to see if Apple will make a public statement in order to quell possible drop in its share price .
Until now , the company has refused to address the report directly : a request from the Guardian for further comment was met with the same blanket statement that "" Steve continues to look forward to returning at the end of June , and there 's nothing further to say "" .
The news once again opens questions about the long term health of the 54-year - old mogul , his right to privacy and the potential impact on the company he helped found 33 years ago .
Jobs - who is also the largest shareholder in entertainment giant Disney – has been ferociously secretive about his health problems , which are believed to stem from his battle with pancreatic cancer six years ago .
Diagnosed in October 2003 with a rare form of the disease that is less fatal than other strains , Jobs – a strict vegetarian – initially attempted to treat his condition through a special diet .
After nine months , when it was clear that he failed to cure the cancer this way , Jobs opted for surgery to remove part of his pancreas : the company announced he had undergone the procedure in August 2004 , one month later .
Although Jobs was thought to be in remission , a period of drastic weight loss last year led to frenzied speculation that the cancer had returned .
In January , the notoriously secretive Jobs made a rare public statement attributing his weight loss to a "" hormone imbalance "" .
Just a few days later , however , he was forced to admit that the situation was "" more complex "" than first thought , before announcing his intention to step down from day to day activities at Apple for six months .
According to doctors , it is not unusual for pancreatic cancer to spread to the liver , the nearest organ – but with few donors available , transplants remain rarely - performed procedures .
Data suggests that 83 % of adult patients survive the operation in the short term . ""
These tumors can be treated quite well with liver transplants and are able to be managed and have a good outcome , "" said Dr Waldo Concepcion , a specialist at Stanford University , told the San Jose Mercury News . ""
In transplants , there are no guarantees , but if it works well , people can lead normal lives . ""
Even if he survives , returning to full - time work as the chief executive of a company of around 35,000 employees could prove difficult .
Jobs is known to keep to a punishing schedule , and many expect him to move out of the top role to focus on his chairman 's role in the near future .
Whether or not that affects in the long term is still unknown , but Jobs has spent the past decade assembling a group of top managers who effectively run the company .
Among them is Tim Cook , Apple 's chief operating officer and the man who most expect to take over the chief executive 's role – perhaps sooner rather than later , if Jobs steps aside as a result of his health .
A quiet and determined Texan who made his career with computer manufacturer Compaq , Cook is regarded as a safe pair of hands and has already taken on Jobs 's responsibilities in his absence .
However , the news of Jobs 's condition – and its provenance – may have other consequences for the company , based in the Silicon Valley city of Cupertino .
The Wall Street Journal 's report broke shortly after the US stock markets closed , with Apple 's share price riding high on the successful launch of the latest model of its iPhone hanset .
Conversely , Apple 's share price reached its nadir in January - shortly after Jobs revealed he was taking time off from the company .
That led to accusations by some investors that the company should have been more forthright about the situation regarding Jobs , who has been critical to the company 's success since he returned to Apple in 1996 after an 11-year absence .
"" I 'm not saying they need to release X - rays and lab tests , but the board has to show it 's up to speed on the issues of his health and the prognosis and that they 're prepared for whatever might come next , "" said Nell Minnow of corporate governance research firm
The Corporate Library at the time .
The Securities and Exchange Commission had previously considered accusations that the company misled shareholders by failing to disclose important information , deciding against a full blown investigation upon review .
But the timing of this weekend 's story - and the opaque way in which it has emerged – have led some to reiterate their previous demands for the process to be examined .
Technology analyst Joe Wilcox claims the news was a "" bombshell – the kind that sends a company 's stock free - falling "" , but that its source raises even more questions .
"" The timing , on day of iPhone 3GS launch , helps protect Apple 's share price and de - emphasise an important fact : Steve is n't really coming back this month , "" he wrote on his blog .
"" There is no SEC rule that requires Apple to reveal this information .
I 'm repeatedly on record as saying there should be .
There are no private health matters at public companies . ""
Asked about the possibility of a fresh investigation , a spokesman for the SEC declined to comment ."
2009-06-22,"Apple says it has sold a million of its new iPhone 3GS model ( and we 'll come back to the "" 3GS "" there in a moment ) in the first three days since its worldwide launch on Friday .
The press release is also interesting for including a "" quote "" from Steve Jobs , who you might recall is the company 's chief executive , and who in an interesting development was said , by a mysteriously unsourced story in the Wall Street Journal , to have had a liver transplant earlier this year . ""
Customers are voting and the iPhone is winning , "" said Steve Jobs , Apple 's CEO .
"" With over 50,000 applications available from Apple 's revolutionary App Store , iPhone momentum is stronger than ever . ""
Certainly no dispute about the momentum .
Even the precipitious price for the new model does n't seem to be putting people off , despite this hefty recession .
For those still stuck on the old iPhone 3 G , or even the old old iPhone , there 's now a handy table to show you what things you can and ca n't do on each phone .
Notable among these is that no matter how you swing it , the original iPhone ca n't do MMS ( a phone released in 2007 that ca n't do MMS ? ) .
And last year 's iPhone 3 G ca n't do video - although one company , GPApps , insists that it could enable video recording on the 3G. Perhaps someone with a jailbroken 3 G phone could tell us if it works ...
Oh , yes , the 3GS thing .
Well , when Apple originally released the phone , it was called "" iPhone 3 G S "" .
Such as the email hawking it last week , which read "" Make a call or play a song using just your voice .
And discover many more features that make iPhone 3 G S the best iPhone yet ""
But today the press release says "" CUPERTINO , California — June 22 , 2009—Apple ® today announced that it has sold over one million iPhone ™ 3GS models through Sunday , June 21 ... ""
See ?
The space has gone , and in an Orwellian touch , the old press releases on the Apple site are being tweaked to remove the space as well .
( Though as Chris Hall commented on Twitter , "" I wonder if they 'll reprint all the boxes ... "" )
Obviously , we 've been using the 3GS formulation since its launch .
Nice to see them seeing sense over there ."

2009-06-24,"On Friday the Wall Street Journal reported that Steve Jobs had undergone a liver transplant .
It was an amazing story , not least because it lifted the lid on the troubles of a well - known and secretive figure , but also because it took the unprecedented step of not referring to the story 's source .
The Journal staked its credibility on the information , leading to plenty of speculation about where it came from .
In an equally unprecedented move just a short while ago , that news has now been confirmed - by the hospital that did the surgery .
According to a release from Methodist University Hospital in Memphis , Tennessee that had been approved by the patient : Steve Jobs received a liver transplant at Methodist University Hospital Transplant Institute in partnership with the University of Tennessee in Memphis .
Mr. Jobs underwent a complete transplant evaluation and was listed for transplantation for an approved indication in accordance with the Transplant Institute policies and United Network for Organ Sharing ( UNOS ) policies .
He received a liver transplant because he was the patient with the highest MELD score ( Model for End - Stage Liver Disease ) of his blood type and , therefore , the sickest patient on the waiting list at the time a donor organ became available .
Mr. Jobs is now recovering well and has an excellent prognosis .
Let 's hope that he continues to mend .
A few issues remain , though , which are probably worth examining .
Why are we so interested in Jobs 's health ?
Are we gossiping about somebody unfairly ?
Has his privacy been invaded , or should he have disclosed his condition to investors ?
First of all , Jobs is clearly an important public figure , and there is great interest in - and hope for - his recovery .
He 's arguably one of the most influential people in the world , and at the very least a huge force in both technology and entertainment .
I can think of lots of other public figures who would be treated in the same way .
Yet everybody deserves privacy , particularly at the darkest moments of their life .
And there 's something inherently distasteful about the way the human story here - a successful man struck down by a life - threatening disease - has been turned into a mixture of scurrilous gossip and mechanical investment advice .
I am left a little nonplussed , even though I realise I have contributed in part .
Still , I continue to be fascinated by the machinations of this story , not so much in the details - there are so very few of them to tell , after all - but in the reaction to it .
We 've done plenty on what it means , but there has been no shortage of follow - up stories : some invasive ( the chase to find the house in Memphis that Jobs stayed in , for example ) some angry ( Doug Rushkoff 's Daily Beast appeal for a little humanity , please ) .
Additionally , there has been the scathing : such as when the New York Times decided to attack Apple 's cult of secrecy .
Apple - centric blogger John Gruber , who has been a beacon of clarity throughout , was similarly intrigued by this piece - since , after all , it argues that Apple is being particularly secretive about the health of its chief executive , much to the company 's detriment .
In fact , Jobs 's health has probably been the least secretive thing about Apple in recent months .
Starting with responding to early questions about his weight loss by blaming a "" common bug "" last summer , through to the lack of an appearance at Macworld , the public notice about a hormone imbalance and then the announcement that he was taking six months off , there has been more information from Apple on this ( and more of it directly from Jobs ) than on probably any other substantive issue in the company 's recent history .
And it 's far from unusual for the company to issue blank responses to journalists ( I got the same ones , too :
I get them all the time from Apple ) .
Whoever leaked the liver transplant story , they were almost certainly a senior Apple insider - and for all we know , it could have been Jobs himself ...
after all , he even went so far as calling a New York Times columnist and telling him about his health last summer .
It is Apple and Jobs who - in a move no doubt regretted now - let the cat out of the bag .
Apple 's problem is usually secrecy , but you could argue that it would have been better served being more secret here , not less .
On the other hand , the press and the public have shown an insatiable appetite for the details , and yet it 's unclear whether anyone is better off knowing what 's happening .
Talking about somebody 's health - whoever they are - remains difficult .
And all I know for certain is one thing : that I hope he gets better soon ."
2009-06-24,"Steve Jobs 's return to Apple and , we hope , health seems to have led to something much more interesting : the return of Fake Steve to his blog , The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs .
This started to wake up a week ago with a simple headline : "" Feeling ... strange .
Am I ... in heaven ?
"" It 's now fully engaged with Livergate and associated press coverage .
Fake Steve stopped writing his popular blog just under a year ago , telling The New York Times that "" he had grown tired of his fictional creation , but mainly he was worried about making fun of a real person whose health has been a recent topic of speculation . ""
Fake Steve directed readers to his Real Dan blog -- one started under his own name , Dan Lyons .
However , this ran into trouble over Yahoo .
In November , The Industry Standard 's Jordan Golson wrote : A frustrated Dan Lyons told me this afternoon that he is hanging up his personal blog at RealDanLyons.com after his Newsweek bosses made him yank a blog post where Lyons ( rightfully ) called Yahoo 's PR staff "" lying sacks of shit . ""
It 's no surprise that a Newsweek writer blogging under his own name could n't get away with anything like the same amount of stuff as an anonymous blogger writing as a fake CEO .
If Real Dan is returning to the Fake Steve scene refreshed and ready for action , we could be in for an amusing time .
If not , it 's not the end of the world .
It 's only a blog ."
2009-06-25,"Meet the new boss , same as the old boss sang The Who , effectively skewering conformist managers everywhere .
Yet look around and there are plenty of flamboyant bosses , some at least as big as the companies they head .
When it was revealed this weekend that Steve Jobs had had a liver transplant , questions were naturally raised about the implications for his firm , Apple .
And when Virgin Atlantic this week celebrated 25 years of ferrying passengers from Gatwick to Newark and further afield , posing for the press alongside model Kate Moss was a toothy , bearded chap in a ridiculous pilot 's outfit : none other than Richard Branson .
It would be a rare boss who did not try to get publicity for his enterprise .
The head of a public - facing company such as Topshop had better be as willing to mug up for the cameras as fearlessly as Philip Green does .
And if you are in the business of turning out dull boxes filled with electronic bits and bobs ( or what your IT department call a computer ) , then a good way to try to stand out from your legions of competitors is to give it a public face .
It has certainly worked for Michael Dell and his eponymously titled PC - maker .
But something more interesting is going on at the moment : the battle is on over who controls big companies .
At the heart of any PLC is a tension over who has ultimate control : the shareholders , who collectively own the company , or the management , who can argue that their interest is far deeper than the buy - today - sell - tomorrow investors .
For much of the postwar period , the shareholders have had the upper hand - witness the downsizing trend of the 80s and the outsourcing fashion of the 90s .
Even greens and human - rights campaigners try to influence the behaviour of big , bad multinationals by buying equity in them .
Now , perhaps , the pendulum is swinging back towards the company bosses .
For months , all Apple shareholders knew about their chief executive 's health was that he had a "" hormone imbalance "" ; they did not know that he had had a liver transplant .
In the UK this week , leading companies have been pressing the Financial Reporting Council to relax the corporate governance code .
And Sir Stuart Rose has been in a long - running dispute with M&amp;S shareholders , who are uneasy with his dual role as both chairman and chief executive .
Ruled by managers or by share owners , both systems have flaws - but it is good to revisit the question .
After the financial crisis , who can argue that corporate governance by speculators and sleepy pension funds is always best ?
Best of all would be to include employees and other stakeholders in decisions .
Now that , in the jargon , really would give companies a 360 ° view ."

2009-07-21,"After spending recent months fighting off questions about the health of chief executive Steve Jobs , iPod maker Apple today shrugged off its critics by announcing some of the best financial results in its history .
Despite the economic gloom , the Californian technology giant reported revenues for the three months to the end of June of $ 8.34bn - up almost 12 % from the same time last year .
That generated profits of $ 1.23bn , a 15 % increase on this time in 2008 , and a record amount for the company outside of the Christmas season .
The success was achieved largely thanks to the launch of the new iPhone 3GS , which went on sale in June - as well as renewed interest in the company 's Macintosh computers .
Sales of iPods were down year - on - year , although the company hinted that more models were on the way later this year .
"" We 're proud to report the best June quarter for both revenue and earnings in Apple 's history , "" Jobs , who returned to work a few weeks ago after undergoing life - saving liver transplant surgery , said in a statement .
"" We set a new record for Mac sales , we think we have a real winner with our new iPhone , and we 're busy finishing several more wonderful new products to launch in the coming months . ""
During a six - month leave of absence , the company was run by chief operating officer Tim Cook , whose successful command underscores the view of many that he is set to be Jobs 's successor .
But Apple 's fortunes contrasted sharply with those of Yahoo , which reported another disappointing quarter .
Revenues for the past three months dwindled to $ 1.573bn , down 13 % year on year , while profits dropped to $ 76 m - a 25 % fall from the same period in 2008 .
The company said it had been hit heavily by currency fluctuations , which accounted for nearly 5 % of the fall in revenue , but insisted that the figures represented a "" solid quarter "" in the face of wider economic turmoil .
"" I 'm pleased with our results this past quarter , "" said chief executive Carol Bartz .
"" We established a clear , simple vision to be the centre of people 's lives online , and we 're backing that vision with important initiatives to create ' wow ' experiences for our users .
"" The company was keen to point to the recent relaunch of its homepage , one of the web 's most popular portals - but those words seem foolhardy just days after Yahoo 's main rival posted results that bucked the downturn entirely .
Although Google 's overall revenues were flat for the last quarter , the company eked out efficiencies to post an 18 % increase in profit year on year .
That will not have gone unnoticed at Yahoo , where the company 's inexorable slide has been taking place for several years - ending the rule of a succession of executives who were unable to prevent the rot from taking hold as Yahoo .
Most recently co - founder Jerry Yang stepped aside as CEO in January to be replaced by tough - talking technology veteran Bartz .
However , despite attempting to streamline and reorganise the company , she has yet to make a noticeable impact on the bottom line .
The numbers will also make intriguing reading for executives at Microsoft , after reports last week that the Seattle technology giant was close to signing a deal with its Silicon Valley rival .
The two companies have had a testy relationship ever since Microsoft launched a $ 45bn takeover bid for Yahoo last year - but even so , they are believed to be closing in on a deal that could see Microsoft take control of Yahoo 's search engine for around $ 3bn .
Microsoft is desperate to take on Google and gain more traction in the lucrative search advertising market - but Martin McNulty , director of search marketing specialist Trafficbroker , said that the raised more questions than it answered .
"" The results are really just a sideshow to the main event right now , and that 's the potential deal with Microsoft , "" he said .
"" It 's unclear why Yahoo ca n't stand on its own two feet , as it still commands a significant market share in search queries and advertising revenues globally . ""
"" Even if the deal does go ahead , "" he added , "" A Microsoft - Yahoo collaboration is unlikely to offer an increased threat to Google , which , brand and technology - wise , is in a league of its own . """

2009-08-22,"Feverish speculation all over the internet , gadget shoppers nearing mass hysteria and pundits predicting our lives will never be the same .
It must mean that an Apple product launch is on the way .
The company that makes the Mac computer , iPod music player and iPhone is reportedly poised to launch a tablet computer
– small enough to carry in a handbag or briefcase but big enough to comfortably surf the web , read newspapers and watch films .
It could be Apple 's latest billion - dollar jackpot .
Months of rumour and hype have reached a crescendo in recent days with some reports suggesting that the tablet could be launched by Apple 's chief executive , Steve Jobs , next month and be in the shops by Christmas .
Such is the fascination with all things Apple that blogs are humming with speculation and a new mention of the tablet crops up on Twitter around every eight minutes . ""
The Apple magic is great technology and great marketing , "" said Leander Kahney , a blogger and author of The Cult of Mac .
"" We 've seen it with the iPod , the iPhone and , before that , the Mac .
That 's why this is so exciting . ""
He added : "" They 've been working on this for the past six years .
People expect it to be the ultimate Apple surprise .
This thing will knock people 's socks off . ""
Apple product launches are celebrated rituals where the talismanic Jobs , in black sweater and jeans , stands on a stage in San Francisco and unveils the company 's latest innovation , cheered by adulatory crowds with near religious fervour .
The Californian giant has sold more 200 million iPods since their launch in 2001 .
Famously secretive , Apple has refused to comment on the tablet speculation .
But Tim Cook , its chief operating officer , recently hinted that the company was working on something "" very innovative "" .
Jobs – now back at work after a six - month leave of absence following a liver transplant – is thought to have been personally involved in the development of the device over the past two years .
The tablet is rumoured to be any size and scale between the iPhone and the MacBook laptop .
Some have described the tablet as a "" Kindle - killer "" , potentially usurping the Amazon Kindle and other electronic book readers .
It would be billed as a solution for people who work a lot on the move but do n't want to carry a laptop .
What experts believe would set the tablet apart would be that , instead of a keyboard , it would use a touch - sensitive screen .
Kahney said : "" Apple will totally rejig the computing experience .
You wo n't manipulate a keyboard and mouse any more but rather use an intuitive touchscreen .
It will very tactile .
It will be a whole new paradigm .
"" It might also prove the launchpad for an "" iTunes for newspapers "" , allowing commuters to read news on screen instead of in print .
Even magazines might be reproduced convincingly on the high - resolution screen .
Kahney said : "" Instead of reading a review of a band , you could have audio and video embedded and listen to them and watch them being interviewed . ""
Expectations flared recently when Gene Munster , a technology research analyst , said that he had had discussions with an Asian component supplier that claimed to have received orders for a touchscreen device which needed to be filled by the end of the year .
Munster took this as evidence that Apple would launch a tablet in early 2010 .
He estimated that an Apple tablet , with an onscreen keyboard like the iPhone , would cost around $ 600 ( £ 363 ) , putting it between the highest - end iPod Touch at $ 399 and the MacBook , which starts at $ 999 .
At $ 600 , Munster calculated that sales of 2 million tablets could add $ 1.2bn ( £ 727 m ) to Apple 's sales next year .
Sales of Apple laptops are stalling as they face competition from netbooks , the smaller and lighter laptops that have proved popular among students .
Rival companies have also introduced tablets but lack the hype that guarantees Apple mountains of free publicity .
Bill Thompson , a technology author and blogger , warned , however , that Apple 's run of dramatic breakthroughs was unlikely to last for ever . ""
If Steve Jobs stands up and announces this , it could be his last hurrah .
The technology industry has matured and , unless Apple does something completely unexpected , we have a pretty good idea what this will look like .
The world has been shaped by technology in such a way that it is no longer surprising . """

2009-09-09,"Apple 's chief executive , Steve Jobs , today publicly acknowledged for the first time that he has had a liver transplant – and the donor was a man in his mid-20s who died in a car crash .

Jobs said : "" I am very happy to be here today with you all . ""
He was given a standing ovation as he arrived on stage for the launch event at the company 's headquarters in Cupertino , San Francisco .

It adds videos , liner notes , lyrics and other extras to buyers of albums rather than single tracks .
The software also lets listeners post details about tracks they are listening to on to Facebook and Twitter .
Jobs , who had treatment for a rare form of pancreatic cancer in 2004 , had made a series of opaque announcements in January about his health after media organisations and analysts expressed concern about his increasingly gaunt appearance during public speeches last year .
Initially , Apple had said Jobs had "" a common bug "" but , by January , he was saying it was due to a "" hormonal imbalance ""
–
but then a few days later said the problem were "" more complex "" than he had thought .
He then said he would take a six - month leave of absence .
It later transpired – through documents that were apparently leaked to the press with Jobs 's approval – that he had a liver transplant at the Methodist University Hospital Transplant Institute in Memphis , Tennessee .
Tonight Jobs cleared up the matter once and for all .
He said : "" As some of you may know , about five months ago I had a liver transplant –
so I now have the liver of a mid-20s person who died in a car crash and donated his organs .
I would n't be here without such generosity .
So I hope all of us can be as generous and elect to become organ donors . ""
He added : "" I 'd like to take a moment to thank everybody in the Apple community . ""
He said that Tim Cook , the company 's chief operating officer who took over the daily running of the company while Jobs was on sick leave earlier this year , and other Apple executives ran the company well in his absence .
"" I 'm vertical , I 'm back at Apple
and I 'm loving every day of it , "" Jobs announced , and was greeted with warm applause from many of the invited audience .
Speaking of the new video - enabled iPod , Jobs said video was a market that Apple was interested in getting into , while the new iTunes feature looked like an attempt to please record labels – which have seen their revenues tumble with the advent of individual track downloads .
Jobs also extolled the company 's success with its two newest products , the iPhone and touchscreen iPod Touch , which have sold 30 m and 20 m worldwide since their launch in summer and autumn 2007 .
Phil Schiller , Apple 's head of marketing , said that the iPod Touch is now "" the fastest - selling model "" because it could play games – downloaded from Apple 's "" app store "" – and get email and surf the web on a wireless network ."
2009-09-09,"4.39pm
BST : Much is being expected from what most people think might be pretty straightforward tonight .
The high expectations : Steve Jobs appears to launch a new iTablet , with a new music format requiring iTunes 9 - which also ushers in subscriptions , a la Spotify - and announces that the Beatles ' songs will be available for download from the iTunes Music Store , which is introduced by Sir Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr playing together for the first time in ( how long ? ) , and also new iPods in which the iPod Touch gains a camera and the iPod nano gains an FM tuner .
The lowball expectations : no Steve Jobs , no Sir Paul , no Ringo , no Beatles on the iTunes Store , no FM tuner , no iTunes subscriptions .
But new iPods , including a camera for the iPod Touch , and a new version of iTunes .
Which one sounds more likely to you ?
4.44pm BST :
( Charles Arthur writes : ) if you 're looking for confirmation on the highball expectations , then a website called unbeatable.co.uk ( uh - huh ) says it has leaked pictures of an iPod Touch with a camera , and a skyscraper - style iPod nano .
My take : good Photoshopping , but something that fat would n't get out of Cupertino .
4.50pm
BST : Charles writes : While you 're here , you might like to have a browse of our main story of the day , "" Twilight of the iPods "" ( ach , see vot we did there ? ) which notes how sales of the "" traditional "" - ie non - connected - iPods has tailed off .
Analysts think that pattern is going to be reflected all across the MP3 player market over the next few years .
But that has big implications for the music industry , as it 's been iPods that have been driving sales of music downloads for some time .
If people are n't buying iPods , or are buying iPods that also run apps ( and games ) and like those , then will music download sales stall ?
5.23pm
BST : Charles writes : and just to be iPod - tastic , there 's also a blog post : How large is the iPod installed base ?
( Next question : how much larger will it get after tonight ? )
5.28pm
: Bobbie writes : It 's a crisp , cool morning here in San Francisco - I 'm wearing a jumper ! - and the media and special guests are piled up outside the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts .
I 've seen a lot of familiar faces among the press gaggle , but yet to see anything that betrays whether we 'll see Steve Jobs on stage here .
It was this event last year that Jobs made his last public appearance - before dropping out of his annual MacWorld keynote , taking medical leave and getting a liver transplant .
There 's some speculation that we 'll see him here today , which would be not just a boost for the company , but a sign that he 's returning to something like normal .
No news from the floor here on what we might see , over and above the usual speculation .
In the meantime I 'm heading inside to see what 's going on .
5.32pm :
By the way : if you 're looking to log on as it happens , the event is supposed to kick off at around 6 pm British time , and should n't take more than an hour .
5.43pm :
Bobbie writes :
Turns out I was a little previous , we 're all still standing outside while they fill us with pastries and coffee - no doubt laced with a concoction that will make the reality distortion field even stronger when he step inside .
In the crowd , meanwhile , I see New York Times gadget reviewer David Pogue ( no doubt talking about the accusations of bias that have hit him recently ) and that bloke Greg Grunberg , who plays the psychic policeman from Heroes .
Not sure if anybody watches it any more , but this perhaps indicates something about video .
Then again , he also has a band with Hugh Laurie and ( yes , really ) so perhaps it 's music .
Or perhaps he 's just a geek .
Ooh , they 're letting us in .
5.48pm :
Bobbie writes : OK .
Now we 're in - and I 'm immediately serenaded by the dulcet tones of Aerosmith 's version of Walk
This Way ( not their classic collaboration with Run DMC , by the sounds of it ) .
Next it 's a bit of Green Day - local lads from just across San Francisco bay , but I 'm not sure if we should be reading too much into the set list yet .
A little gang of smile Apple people are gathered around the front of the stage , including Greg Joswiak , who runs marketing for iPods .
I hear the mention of a price - 199 - but , unsurpisingly , nobody says what product they 're talking about .
Still !
We have a price !
( even if there is no product to match it to yet ) .
5.59pm :
Bobbie writes : Now the Rolling Stones kick in on the speakers - with the song used as the tagline for the event - and the voiceover man tells us it 's about to start .
Lights down , anticipation up .
6.00pm :
Phil Schiller - who has stood in for Jobs on previous occasions - apepars to be sitting a couple of seats in front of me .
( I can only see the back of his head , but it looks like him ) .
Does n't appear that he 's presenting today - will we see his Steveness ?
6.02pm :
Yes , we do .
Looking very thin and a little worse for wear , Jobs comes on stage .
A rapturous standing ovation follows .
6.04pm :
The cheering and clapping has gone on for a good minute or so .
Jobs , dressed in trademark black top and blue jeans , starts talking .
"" I am VERY happy to be here today with you all .
As some of you may know , about five months ago I had a liver transplant -
so I now have the liver of a mid 20s person who died in a car crash and donated his organs .
And I would n't be here without such generosity .
So I hope all of us can be as generous and elect to become organ donors . ""
"" I 'd like to take a moment to thank everybody in the Apple community , "" he says , adding that Tim Cook and other Apple executives ran the company well in his absence .
"" I 'm vertical , I 'm back at Apple
and I 'm loving every day of it .
"" 6.06pm :
His voice appeared to be cracking for a while there on stage - but now he means business .
He 's done the intro and now we 're on to talking about products , although he says Phil Schiller will be joining him for part of the presentation .
6.10pm :
First it 's iPhone : 30 million sold worldwide , a new 3.1 operating system available for download and boosts including application recommendations ( on a similar basis to the Genius playlist ) and the chance to buy ringtones straight from the store .
Then he 's on to iTunes .
It 's the No1 music retailer in the world , he says , and there are 100 million accounts now open on the store .
With a zen - like smile , he announces iTunes version 9 : "" we 've cleaned it up a bit , made it much easier to navigate around "" .
6.15pm :
He 's running through the new features of iTunes 9 , pacing from side to side as if nothing had ever happened .
These include Genius mixes - creating radio - like playlists that you parcel up similar tunes - and synchronisation options .
Better sharing around the home and a redesigned iTunes store .
This is hardly revolutionary stuff , just the most incremental of incremental improvements .
Still , he takes the chance of some respite during a round of applause to swig from a bottle of water .
6.18pm : Just as expected , he 's now outlining a new selection of features called iTunes LP , that adds videos , liner notes , lyrics and other extras that you get if you download an entire album rather than just single tracks . ""
Unfortunately most of that stuff left us went to CDs and even more so when we went to digital music , "" he says .
The irony , of course , is that iTunes and Apple has been one of the biggest forces in encouraging the single - track download .
An Apple dude comes on to demo , while Jobs takes a break .
He comes and plants himself three rows in front of me , sitting back and keeping pretty quiet .
His return is going to be the big story , by the looks of it - because , so far , this is pretty pedestrian in terms of product advances .
6.20pm :
DJHworld in the comments says that the 3.1 iPhone update is n't available yet .
Hold your horses !
They do n't usually become available until after these events finish .
As expected , we also discover that social networking extras have been incorporated into iTunes as well , allowing you to post about things you like from iTunes to Facebook and Twitter .
Yes !
I 've always wanted a chance to make my expressions of unbridled joy in great art to be as simple as a single click !
6.28pm : In the comments , SilentRunning points out that Wired is reporting that the US Apple website has dropped iPod prices .
Well , that 's US prices - nothing in the UK yet .
And then he takes the time to chide us for not writing about it .
Completely fair : sorry , next time
I 'll try balancing a ball on my nose while clapping as well .
Demo over , Jobs comes back on stage for a few seconds to hand over to Phil Schiller .
In a puff of smoke ( not literally , you lot ) he 's gone again .
Schiller , who always reminds me - somewhat bizarrely - of a big cuddly bear when he climbs up in front of the crowd , starts talking up the iPod 's success .
The iPod Touch , he says , is now the fastest - selling iPod , with more than 20 m sold .
Why ?
He suggests that it 's not only a great music and video player , but that it also a handy pocket computer , wherever you can get on a Wi - Fi network at least , and a games machine too .
Something coming up here ?
6.38pm : While Schiller hits his sales pitch - which includes a sly dig at Nintendo and Sony , which "" seemed cool "" when they came out - I 'm scanning around the audience to see who else is here .
Look : it 's Google chief executive Eric Schmidt - who 's reclined in his chair , watching with his hands clasped in front of him .
He might not be on Apple 's board any more , but he 's obviously still an interested party .
Perhaps he 's pondering how to compete with the iPhone , particularly with the launch of the new Motorola Android handset due tomorrow .
6.45pm :
A chirpy young fellow from Ubisoft comes on stage to show off Assassin 's Creed 2 for the iPhone , which ( unsurprisingly ) ditches the insanely rich graphics of the console version if favour of a little sideways scroller that 's got a sort of mid 90s PlayStation One vibe about it .
Then the boss of Tapulous comes along to show off , Riddim Ribbon , a new music game they 're about to launch .
"" You 'll be racing down a ribbon , and your job is to follow the groove "" .
He 's talking about that literally ; you move the iPod from side to side , trying to keep the music going by sticking to the middle of the road and getting new bits of the mix dropping into the music as you progress .
Looks like fun .
This is all nice , and everything - but I 'm reminded of Apple 's World Wide Developers Conference earlier this year , when we had to sit and endure an exhausting set of demos by application developers .
They 're OK , but it still seems rather beside the point .
And you start to wonder : is anything actually going to happen in iPod land ?
6.50pm
: Phew ; just two more demos - Gameloft 's first - person shooter Nova - and then Electronic Arts showing off Madden NFL 10 for the iPhone ( what , no Fifa ? ) .
Down in the comments , SoftlyDoesIt sums up the feeling here ( or at least in my seat ) by saying "" Yaaawwwnnn .
This ai n't rock ' n ' roll "" .
Too right .
I want to see Steve Jobs on stage with a guitar , throwing it into the crowd and then smashing up the drum kit .
Meanwhile , Urbanbumpkin has some info on the appearance of Heroes star Greg Grunberg , mentioned earlier . ""
He is the co - creator of an iPhone coupon app called Yowza - Only available in the US at the mo , but soon to be in the UK too I think "" .
That explains it .
I was rather hoping that he 'd do something with the Band From TV
( I 've got their album , I 'm ashamed to say ) .
6.54pm :
The iPod Touch , he announces , is dropping in price to $ 199 for the 8 GB , $ 299 for a 32 GB model and $ 399 for a whopping 64 GB .
We 'll have UK prices as soon as possible .
Meanwhile , the iPod shuffle is dropping in price to $ 59 for 2 GB and in a range of new colours .
Bah .
I was hoping they 'd kill the shuffle entirely ( at least the button - free version , which is a weird little freak of a machine ) .
6.59pm :
And with that , Schiller says "" That 's it for the new iPods "" and turns it back to Steve Jobs .
What ?
Nothing going on with cameras ?
No new models elsewhere ?
But we do have one more thing , he says .
Thank goodness . ""
A video camera "" .
7.02pm :
Jobs explains that the small video camera market - the sort of thing embodied by , say , the Flip , is something that Apple wants to get into .
"" We 're going to build a video camera into the new iPod nano : on the back is a video camera and a microphone built right in .
"" It 's got one - click YouTube uploading .
The size of the nano itself does n't seem to have shifted , but the question is how good it is .
A boxed demo is certainly pretty nice quality - but the devil will be in using it like most people do , quickly , in shaky situations with problematic sound .
7.04pm :
Oh , and there 's an FM radio built in too - but he skims over that pretty quickly ; no surprise given Apple 's long - term reticence to admit that customers might want one in their iPods .
No word on the stats behind the camera , but he says it 's got a slightly larger screen at 2.2 inches .
Two models : 8 GB for $ 149 and 16 GB for $ 179 , all on sale today .
That 's definitely a very competitive shot at this market , and perhaps takes the iPod nano further into new territory .
It will be interesting if , at some point in the future , they actually go ahead with the rumoured iPhone nano .
This could be a handy stepping stone .
7.05pm :
We 'll give you UK prices as soon as we have them .
With that , it 's done .
Jobs - not quite triumphant on his return , but certainly unfazed by taking the stage after his life - saving surgery - finishes up things by introducing Nora Jones , while much of the crowd gets ready to file out .
7.20pm :
OK , those prices .
iPod shuffle : 2 GB for £ 45 iPod nano : 8 GB for £ 115 and 16 GB for £ 135 .
iPod touch : 8 GB for £ 149 , 32 GB for £ 229 and 64 GB for £ 299 7.37pm :
So , to sum up : nothing unexpected , really , and - as we already knew - no Beatles .
Looking back at Charles 's prediction at 4.39pm , we hit somewhere close to the lowball expectation end of the event - no Sir Paul , no Ringo , no Beatles and no iTunes subscriptions .
But we did get Steve Jobs , new iTunes and iPods sporting cameras ( although not the iPod touch , intriguingly ) .
Jobs was the big talking point , really , and although he took it fairly easy - no surprise for somebody who is now sporting liver 2.0 - he certainly seemed up for the challenge .
I meanwhile , discovered that my jumper was hotter than expected and that my laptop battery runs out REALLY quickly at crucial moments ( thanks Apple lady , for not letting me plug it in , that was really nice of you ) .
Thanks for all your comments .
Until next time ."
2009-09-10,"At the close of Wednesday 's iPod announcement , the resurgent Steve Jobs shook hands with various people in the crowd and even found time to chat with some hand - picked journalists .
Notable among them was David Pogue , the gadget reviewer for the New York Times , and one of the few writers regularly allowed to step inside Jobs 's magic circle .
In a brief Q&amp;A published on the NYT site , Pogue asked Jobs about whether electronic book readers were interesting to him , and got a zingy little response .
"" I 'm sure there will always be dedicated devices , and they may have a few advantages in doing just one thing , "" he said .
"" But I think the general - purpose devices will win the day .
Because I think people just probably are n't willing to pay for a dedicated device . ""
He said that Apple does n't see e - books as a big market at this point , and pointed out that Amazon.com , for example , does n't ever say how many Kindles it sells . ""
Usually , if they sell a lot of something , you want to tell everybody . ""
No surprise , really - after all , Jobs has panned e - book readers in the past as folly , famously even suggesting it 's a terrible idea because "" people do n't read anymore "" .
But notice the subtle change in his approach .
No longer does he say "" the idea is terrible "" , but instead suggests that if and when people do want to read books on an electronic device , it will be sold to them through the back door - not on a dedicated gizmo .
Hardly a stretch to imagine that he thinks the iPhone , or something like it , would be that sort of device .
So , the question of book readers is deeper than it first seems .
But there 's another question here , too : should we believe what he says in any case ?
Over the years , Jobs and his lieutenants have routinely suggested that certain features or products are a no - go area .
The reasoning , often , is that consumers simply do not want a particular item or the market for them is not big enough .
Yet Jobs has a reputation for persuading people to splash out to products they did n't even know they wanted - it 's part of what makes him one of the ultimate salesmen .
So the subtext of "" consumers do n't want something "" is actually that Jobs does not believe in the concept and does n't want to sell it .
But the language means that when Apple finally does sell the item in question , it 's easy to paint the change as the result of a shift in consumer trends , even if it 's just Apple 's opinion that has changed , not the public 's .
A great example from yesterday was the nano 's built - in FM radio - for so long , a feature that lots of iPod users asked for but Jobs rejected ( and always with a certain sense that FM just was n't advanced enough to be worthy of iPod status ) .
After all that time spent keeping FM out of the iPod , Apple sticks a receiver in just when nobody really cares any more .
That 's hardly his first change of heart .
Let 's take a look at a few examples from recent years , starting back in 2004 , when Jobs said that Apple was n't working on a video iPod because consumers did n't want to watch long movies on tiny screens : "" One of the things we say around Apple , and I paraphrase Bill Clinton from the 1992 presidential race , is ' It 's about the music , stupid . ' ...
You ca n't watch a video and drive a car .
We 're focused on music . ""
A year later , Apple released the video - capable 5th generation iPod .
Here 's another one : in 2005 , when Apple announced its ill - fated partnership to create iTunes - compatible phones with Motorola , senior Apple executive Eddy Cue said that not only did the company not want to move into the phone market , but it also wanted to avoid the high - end market .
"" What we 've talked about is a something that is valuable for the mass market , "" Cue said .
"" It has to be a phone in the middle - tier of the market , not a $ 500-tier phone .
It has to be very seamless to use . ""
Two years later - and partially because of frustrations of working with Motorola - the company announced a little product called the iPhone , initially priced at $ 599 .
And then there is the almost mythical tablet Mac : something that Jobs has denied for years , but that numerous , well - sourced reports have said is all but certain in the coming months .
Even if it never emerges , it 's clear that the staff in Cupertino are working feverishly on a product that fits the bill .
There are examples of the company sticking by its guns - music subscriptions are something Apple has been bugged about for years , and has yet to implement - but there are enough times that a denial has been followed by the product in question to make it worth being sceptical .
This is not to say precisely that Steve Jobs lies about such features - but that he has a history of making categorical statements which are eventually overturned .
Whether he actually believes that Apple are n't going to make a certain product and then changes his mind , or whether he 's simply bringing down the veil of secrecy to keep the competition on their toes , I have no real idea .
But one thing 's certain :
when Steve Jobs says people do n't want e - book readers , that does n't mean Apple wo n't make one ."
2009-09-10,"•
Steve Jobs returned to the public eye yesterday by hosting Apple 's annual iPod announcements ( here 's our liveblog ) , but the only real product news in an otherwise lacklustre event was a boost for the iPod nano , which now boasts a video camera and other add - ons .
That fact did n't stop Jobs from chiming in on his competitors , however : as well as pops at Nintendo and Sony , he also took the time to swipe at Amazon in a brief Q&amp;A with New York Times gadget guy David Pogue .
•
While Apple was out wooing the press in California , Microsoft has been doing some deals in the UK - or with Tesco , to be more precise .
According to this announcement , Tesco customers buying some DVDs will now be offered the chance to download a version of their movie for computer consumption .
Silverlight only , unsurprisingly .
•
And before I go , just time to mention that this week 's Technology Guardian is on the streets now : featuring all kinds of lovely stuff , including a look at whether flattening iPod sales are bad news for the download business , and hear about a machine at Bletchley Park that is set to become the world 's oldest working computer .
We also hear from Bruce Schneier on how to take control of the files we delete online .
All that and more with a copy of the Guardian today .
You can follow our links and commentary each day through Twitter ( @guardiantech , or our personal accounts ) or by watching our Delicious feed ."
2009-09-28,"Two billion applications have been downloaded from Apple 's iTunes App Store in just over a year since its launch , the company announced today .
With roughly 85,000 different apps now available , and around 50 m iPhones and iPod Touches ( capable of running the apps ) in use around the world , the statistic confirms the importance of the store to the success of the iPhone - which in the UK will get an added sales boost once it goes on sale through Orange in competition with O2 , which has previously had the exlclusive franchise here .
And hey , here 's an official quote : "" The rate of App Store downloads continues to accelerate with users downloading a staggering two billion apps in just over a year , including more than half a billion apps this quarter alone , "" said Steve Jobs , Apple 's CEO .
"" The App Store has reinvented what you can do with a mobile handheld device , and our users are clearly loving it . ""
Of course , you could ask whether they 'd be loving it slightly less if they had to pay for the overwhelming majority of those apps , rather than getting them for free ; Mark Mulligan of Forrester noted that "" lt took Apple over 3 yrs to hit 2bn song downloads .
It took less than 1.5 years to hit 2bn app downloads "" .
But of course , those 2bn song downloads will have brought in around $ 2bn in revenue ( of which record labels get about $ 1.4bn and Apple gets the remaining $ 600 m or so - which it 's earned , do n't forget , over three years , accelerating as it goes .
For apps , the income is rather smaller because the average price is likely to be lower because so many of those downloads are freebies .
That means that claims that the App Store is bringing in $ 2.4bn per year look vastly inflated ( as that blog post points out ) .
The proper number might be
closer to $ 250 m to $ 500 m per year , of which Apple gets 30 % , or $ 75m-$150 m .
Even so , that implies that the App Store is doing pretty well for something that 's only a year old .
If multiple phone carriers gooses that , the indications are that it will keep being a tidy money - earner - though nothing much compared to the actual hardware sales , which keep the coffers full .
Update : Mulligan adds : "" Lots of you [ on Twitter ] commented [ that ] many Apple apps are free .
Very true .
But also remember Apps only work on a quarter of all 212 m [ iPod ] devices sold to date . ""
Which suddenly makes it look like a much more promising market , does n't it ?"
2009-09-30,"The speculation that Apple is developing a touchscreen computer has once again stepped up another gear , following detailed internet rumours that have sent the company 's fans into a frenzy .
A report from the iLounge blog - which has a fairly good record at getting details of forthcoming Apple launches - says that the machine will boast a 10.7 "" screen , use the iPhone operating system and come in 3 G and non 3 G versions .
That detail has been enough to get the gadget blogs talking , with speculation focused on where exactly Steve Jobs and friends are going to find a capacitive touchscreen of that size .
Rumours of such a device are hardly new in themselves : it is believed that Apple has worked on a number of prototypes over the years , but never come up with something that it thought could turn into a viable product .
But with a constant stream of reports appearing to back up the idea that a project is in the works , it seems that Apple has had a change of heart - largely thought to be due to the success of the iPhone , which helped bring multitouch technology to the masses and has proved a hit with more than 20 m sold worldwide .
Despite the interest in the company 's plans for the future , though , it is not smooth sailing for Apple at the moment .
While plenty of fans hope that a larger touchscreen machine could help boost the fortunes of tablet computers - which have been tried many times in the past , but failed to take off - the Californian technology company is also taking plenty of jabs from critics .
Locked in an ongoing battle with handset rival Palm - which is caught in a cat - and - mouse game in which it tries to make its Pre handset compatible with iTunes - the volume of voices lashing out at Apple 's dominance and control has increased recently .
The company is being investigated by the US communications regulator over its dealings with Google , as well as allegations of anti - competitive hiring practices .
And yesterday saw the return of another one of the thorns in the company 's side : San Francisco startup DoubleTwist , which has developed software that allows other manufacturers access to iTunes .
Three months after the startup cheekily placed an advert on the side of the company 's flagship shop in California , it launched another campaign - this time spoofing Apple 's famous 1984 commercial ."
2009-10-13,"The Apple computer tycoon Steve Jobs is lending a hand to Walt Disney to sprinkle a little technological stardust onto the entertainment empire 's chain of high street stores in an ambitious effort to transform merchandising outlets into miniature theme parks for children .
In an overhaul lasting five years , Disney intends to spend an estimated $ 1 m on each of its 340 stores in the US and Europe .
The retail chain sells a huge variety of toys , games , videos and costumes tied to characters ranging from Tinkerbell to High School Musical stars .
The Apple boss , who is a member of Disney 's board of directors , has reportedly pushed the company towards a radical re - shaping of the outlets and is sharing some of the techniques that have turned Apple 's high - street sites into highly profitable retail landmarks .
Jobs has provided access to proprietary information at Apple and Disney intends to use some of the technology company 's ideas , such as giving handheld checkout devices to employees and creating an emphasis on interactivity .
Created in 1987 , the Disney Stores have been mixed performers for the Californian media conglomerate .
Initially a hit among shoppers , the chain at one point expanded to 600 outlets but lost its sparkle and slipped into the red by 2002 .
Disney sold the business in 2004 to a third - party operator , Children 's Place , before buying back a scaled - down version of the chain last year .
Disney 's consumer products division , which includes the chain , generated revenue of $ 1.7bn in the nine months to June .
Jim Fielding , president of Disney Stores Worldwide , told the New York Times that it was "" time to take risks "" and admitted that the stores had , at times , been a poor reflection of Disney 's brand . ""
Let 's face facts , "" he said .
"" Some of these stores looked like a dog 's breakfast . ""
The revamp will involve an emphasis on recreational activities rather than simply filling stores with aisles displaying Disney 's packaged wares .
Children will be encouraged to watch film clips , press buttons to operate displays , chat with animated characters and even take part in karaoke contests .
The new look will go on display in May at stores in California , Long Island and Madrid .
Jobs has been on Disney 's board since 2006 .
He joined when Disney bought Pixar , the animated film studio he formerly owned .
The 54-year - old entrepreneur , responsible for the popularity of devices such as the iPod , the MacBook and the iPhone , recently returned to work after undergoing a liver transplant ."
2009-10-28,"In January 2003 , Steve Jobs announced to a slightly surprised Macworld audience that "" this is going to be the year of the notebook for Apple "" .
There was a clear ambition to push up the sales of portables – on which margins tend to be better than on desktops .
Jobs was right in spotting an unstoppable trend : the rise of the laptop .
This is a category that now includes not just "" notebooks "" , as Apple always refers to them , but also , since 2008 , the smaller "" netbooks "" .
As Moore 's Law – a halving of cost for the same spec – has applied to processors , RAM and even disk storage , laptops have become not just an interesting option for a second computer , but the primary machine for a lot of people .
Apple did n't quite manage to make 2003 the year in which sales of laptops exceeded those of desktop ; it was July 2005 before that happened , and April 2006 before it began to happen consistently .
But now laptop sales always exceed desktop sales for the company ; in the past quarter , when it sold a record 3 m computers , nearly three out of every four was a laptop .
And though Apple is the leader in this trend , laptops are taking over computing , especially with the rise of netbooks .
Looking at the trends in computer sales , you may wonder when laptop sales will overtake those of desktops worldwide .
The answer is simple : they already have .
For 2009 , 159 m portable machines ( a segment that includes both notebooks and netbooks ) will be sold , compared with 124 m desktop machines , according to the research company IDC .
Gartner says that in the first quarter of 2009 , desktop sales declined 16 % year on year ; laptop sales fell by 3 % , but netbook sales leapt sixfold , so that they now make up 20 % of all laptops sold .
Leaving your desk behind For computer makers , the shift to laptops offers a chance to increase profit margins – although all but Apple still struggle in what has become a commodity market .
( Apple is estimated to have around 75 % of the share of laptops sold in the US priced over $ 999 . )
Netbooks have once again eroded those margins , but the fact that you ca n't build your own laptop , while it is comparatively easy for anyone to take a chassis and build a desktop machine , leaves more margin in that sector .
Those are the bald numbers – but they hide a much more subtle and far - reaching shift in the way we now live our lives , says Richard Holway , the veteran analyst who is chairman of TechMarketView .
"" The obvious and banal answer [ to why laptops are selling better and better ] is that people do n't sit at desks any more , "" says Holway .
"" In about 2002 or 2003 , we started to talk about ' mobile internet devices ' which were , at that stage , only available in one form – your laptop .
Which , I would remind you , weighed about 3 kg , cost £ 1,500 , and was something that was at best luggable even then . ""
But we said then that the world was moving towards a situation where ' knowledge workers ' would do things on the move , from a number of different devices , which had to get smaller and be able to link to the net at broadband speeds , anywhere .
I called it the ' Holway Martini moment ' after the old Martini ad ' Any Time , Any Place , Any Where ' .
This is ' any time , any where , any device . ' ""
The point , Holway says , is that people do n't just want to do computing anywhere in the world –
they also want to do it with a multitude of different devices .
That change could have dramatic effects on how companies think about their investments in computers , and how they should expect people to work .
The spread of mobile internet access has changed approaches to connectivity .
Just as mobile phones evolved over the past 20 years from being a luxury , to an expensive alternative to the landline , to a cheap necessity , so internet access on the move is evolving too : from a near - impossibility to a pricey extra to something that is becoming more affordable , driven by the widening access to 3 G networks , Wi - Fi connections and even WiMax , a sort of long - distance Wi - Fi .
But that does n't only have implications for the makers of laptops and providers of mobile internet connectivity ; it also affects companies that have relied in the past on desktop machines for revenues .
That means , for example , Adobe , whose clients tend to be those in graphics - heavy environments , who need powerful desktop machines to do their tasks – and Microsoft .
It may be significant that both have announced significant falls in revenue and profit ; in July , Adobe even introduced short - time working for its staff as a cost - cutting measure , while Microsoft has announced expense reduction measures .
True , Microsoft receives money for Windows licences ; but it has been hit hardest by netbook sales , because it got less money per installation than for a full - sized notebook or desktop ; and netbook sales have exploded , especially in Europe .
Arguably , every netbook sale until the launch of Windows 7 , even if it has a Windows XP licence , represents lost money for Microsoft ; on a notebook or desktop , it could charge the maker for a pricier Vista licence .
In January , Microsoft announced falling results in which revenue from sales of Windows fell by 8 % "" as a result of PC market weakness and a continue shift to lower - priced netbooks "" .
On the latter , Microsoft is hoping that Windows 7 , released last week , will pull it out of a financial hole ; but netbooks still represent a serious threat to that model , and the launch , expected next year , of Google 's Chrome operating system – targeted , again , at netbooks – could begin to eat into Windows revenue if it gains any significant traction .
A moveable feast
The trend towards laptops has been growing for a long time .
In the US , laptops first outsold desktops in the retail market for a full month in May 2005 , according to the research firm Current Analysis .
NPD Group , which looked at revenue rather than units , saw the crossover happen two years earlier , in May 2003 .
Laptops had inched towards that crucial measure a few times , but in 2008 the US swung over wholesale towards them ; the Los Angeles Times noted in January 2008 that the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railway had bought 4,000 Dell machines – of which 60 % were laptops , in order that rail inspectors could file reports from trucks , and other staff could work from home .
"" They were in a totally tethered world , and now they have no tethering [ to desks ] at all , "" Jeff Campbell , the BNSF 's chief information officer , told the LA Times .
Holway thinks that this is our future and we should adjust to it , because device makers , and those providing accommodation , will cater to it .
"" I 've just been on holiday on a ship which had Wi - Fi in every cabin .
And no , it was n't an oligarch 's yacht – just a cruise ship .
And then I was on the Jordanian desert , where we drove for five hours into the middle of nowhere , to meet some Bedouin and spend the night there .
You could see the stars and everything .
I started wondering what the strange glow near the ground was .
It was all their mobile phones .
And in the morning , on the way out we passed a mobile phone mast about the size of the Eiffel Tower – which they all used to keep in touch .
"" Banking on change
Mobility is n't just for knowledge workers .
Almost everyone needs it , Holway contends : "" I had a man come to fix my front door lock , and he was able to send the invoice and my credit card payment through from the doorstep via his phone .
Community nurses are getting mobile devices so they can plan their day 's work and stay up to date with changes .
"" Where the mobile phone , used for a voice call , used to be the method used for constant connectivity , now it is a mobile internet device , used with data connectivity , that does the same tasks – or multiple ones , such as finding a location , checking details before doing a job , checking details while on the job , sending an invoice , and processing a credit card transaction .
The only places where you might still need desktop machines ?
"" Banks , "" Holway allows .
"" But at the end of the day , the number of jobs that are purely static is going to fall and fall . ""
For that reason success in the future is likely to lie with companies that can make the best mobile internet devices , as those are the ones that have the best chances for growth .
That , too , is not encouraging for Microsoft , which has been pushed into third place in the smartphone market by RIM and Apple , and now faces a significant challenge from Google 's Android : the Taiwanese handset maker HTC , previously responsible for more than 80 % of Windows Mobile sales , is switching to Android .
Losing with netbooks , losing on mobiles : Microsoft may have a problem with the mobile workforce .
In fact , all sorts of expectations are changing . ""
Which company sold the most portable computers in the UK last year ? ""
Holway asks , and leaves the answer hanging . ""
HP ?
Dell ?
No – Acer .
It 's because of netbooks .
Everybody 's buying them . """

Something is killing a number of Apple 's Time Capsule - its wireless , networked , remote storage device launched with great fanfare in January 2008 by Steve Jobs - prematurely .
Suspicions have fallen on the internal design of the system : specifically , that the drives simply overheat power supply dies , killing the electronics .
And once your hard drive power supply has died , you have n't got much hope of resuscitating it .
There 's no external power supply : the power supply unit , rectifier , hard drive , and wireless are all in the same tight box .
( Updated with info from Pim van Bochoven - see below .
It 's specifically the power supply , not the hard drive , that dies . )
The Time Capsule Memorial site , set up only on 12 October by the "" annoyed "" Dutch ex - Time Capsule user Pim van Bochoven , has already got more than 750 registrations from people all over the world whose machines have died after as little as 17 days ' use .
The longest - lived on the site is 643 days - though that 's not much more than 21 months .
The average for those submitted is stubbornly around the 540-day mark .
He says he created it because "" I was annoyed by Apple refusing to acknowledge that there 's a problem .
When my TC died , I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of people who had the same experience in such a small timeframe ( it started around end of August ) .
Instead of ( just ) complaining on discussion boards that Apple never reads , I figured we 'd have a better chance of getting Apple to take notice when we are able to provide a better overview of the scale of this ' thing ' .
And of course , getting enough attention in doing so , not only towards Apple , but also to get as much people who are affected by the massive failure aware of the project . ""
Apple however has declined to replace the systems , saying that they 're out of its one - year warranty .
( However one of the UK users had it fail after just 31 days , and two others had failures in less than 365 days : they should have cases under the Sale of Goods act . )
I asked an Apple representative to comment on this and whether Apple would take any action or could explain why it was happening .
Apple has not responded .
Of course it is not possible to say what proportion of Time Capsules are failing , as Apple has not released sales figures ; but nor will everyone whose device has failed have registered it on van Bochoven 's site .
However any failure is a long way from the claims made at its launch : "" "" With Time Capsule and Time Machine , all your irreplaceable photos , movies and documents are automatically protected and incredibly easy to retrieve if they are ever lost . ""
Apparently Steve Jobs told that to an Apple PR person .
He has n't yet told it to anyone whose Time Capsule has died peacefully in its sleep during the night - leaving them screaming in horror .
What 's the cause of the failures ? ""
Overheated electronics , "" says van Bochoven .
"" Apparently the power supply 's capacitors ca n't take heat for such a long period of time .
Like so many others , I noticed that the TC gets really hot , but I had n't expected this to become fatal in just 18 months time . ""
He thinks that Apple should recall them all : "" It 's tough , but the [ Time Capsule ] thermal design is really a big mistake .
The problem of course is the data stored on the harddisk , which can not be taken out by an average user .
"" There is an option to fix it by creating an external power supply - Ray Haverfield has a site explaining how to do it .
But you might find that unattractive .
For those with long memories , this whole overheating affair will bring back memories of the problems with the early versions of Apple 's first wireless device , the Apple Airport Base Station .
Those , too , turned out to be prone to overheating .
That was back in 2001 .
In fact Apple sometimes seems like it 's prone to problems with thermal cycling : remember the logic board on the iBook G4 ?
Whether this will now lead to some action by Apple is hard to tell .
It may require a class action in the US - but we 'd still say that people in the UK whose Time Capsule fails within a year of purchase have a very good case for replacement ( though we do n't know if you 'll be able to keep the disk with the data ) ; if it fails within two years you might be able to .
On that topic , you 'd need to refer to our Capital Letters consumer section ...
Update : we 've also been directed to the HardMac page which points to hundreds of Apple 's Airport Express ( plug - in Wi - Fi servers ) dying after about 18 months .
And of course Microsoft 's Xbox360 has been plagued by heat - related failure problems .
The fact that this is so widespread does seem to point to something more general - a point we 'll pursue .
Meanwhile I 've asked Apple specifically if it will acknowledge a problem with the design of the Time Capsule , if it will replace them for those older than one year , and if it will guarantee to restore the data from hard drives ( as those should n't be affected by the thermal problems ) .
We await a reply ."
2009-11-09,"The world is a very different place from 30-odd years ago , when a wave of hi - tech entrepreneurs including Steve Jobs and Bill Gates helped start the computer industry as we know it .
But what would those look like if they turned up today ?
Well , here 's one way to find out : I 've agreed to be a judge in a competition called "" The Next Bill Gates "" , alongside former Dragon 's Den investor Doug Richard and Guy Bates , the director of IT supplier XMA , which is sponsoring it .
The idea is pretty straightforward : if you 're planning to go to university starting in 2010 , and you 're interested in technology , then you can put yourself forward as somebody who could really help change the IT industry .
The best candidate wins !
Although Gates notoriously never finished his own degree - quitting Harvard to go and start Microsoft - the winner will get a leg up towards completing their own studies with a prize including £ 3,500 towards their tuition fees , a computer , internship and mentoring .
That 's got to be a good cause .
All you have to do is explain in 100 words - or a one - minute video clip - why you are the next incarnation of Billionaire Bill .
We 'll be watching the entries as they come in and narrowing it down to three finalists next year .
The competition is up and running now at TheNextBillGates.co.uk /shamelessplug"
2009-11-29,"It looks clunky , even clumsy compared to the more evolved versions that followed .
But when the first iPod was launched at Apple 's headquarters in Cupertino , California on 23 October 2001 , it was revolutionary .
"" This is a major breakthrough , "" Apple boss Steve Jobs said , gazing into the future .
And set against the digital music players then on the market , the iPod was a revelation .
The others were fiddly , trivial - looking plastic things cluttered with buttons and dials , appealing mainly to gadget - obsessed geeks with the time to figure out how to work them .
In contrast , the iPod was a sleek digital jukebox that fitted snugly in the palm of your hand ; it could hold one thousand songs – to begin with – and allowed you access to them in just a couple of clicks of its elegant navigation wheel .
If you cared anything at all about music , as soon as you held it and understood how easy it was to use , you wanted one .
It changed everything .
Like a lovesick spouse who refuses to believe the honeymoon is over even after the divorce papers have been served , the big music labels stubbornly club to the notion that we 'd all prefer the sound quality of a CD to the convenience of digital .
Apple has shown just how wrong that assumption was by selling 220 m iPods worldwide , and more than 8.5bn downloads via its online iTunes store .
We all now routinely carry huge libraries of music around on our phones and the music industry , meanwhile , is almost unrecognisable : a worried , slimmed - down shadow of its former bloated self .
"" It could have been shaped like a banana if we 'd wanted , "" said Jonathan I ve , Apple 's senior vice president of industrial design , when we talked about the first iPod .
That it works so well with your computer and the online store , is down to the iTunes software .
That it is simple to use and just so damn desirable is down to Apple 's small , close - knit design team , led by I ve , a 42-year - old from Chigwell in Essex .
He once showed me a notebook in which he had sketched every possible knob , lever , button or control device before settling on the idea of the wheel , and everything on an Apple product is similarly considered , explored , improved and designed to be as easy and as uncluttered as possible .
I ve has a talent for imagining beautiful things that work with minimal hassle .
He changed home computers in 1998 with his translucent iMacs , and has continued to shape the way we work and play , most recently with the iPhone .
Most of the products he creates with his team are radically new .
Often , we 've never seen anything like them .
But it is part of his genius that he empathises with the user , guiding us by look and feel so that almost instantly , what was shockingly new seems familiar .
( With the first iPods , pictured , the screen and wheel were arranged on the front to look like a stereo speaker , subtly telling us that this device was all about the music . )
"" Making the solution seem so completely inevitable and obvious , so uncontrived and natural – it 's so hard ! ""
he smiled , when we first met at Apple HQ seven years ago . ""
But that is what we 're trying to do here .
"" We have talked several times since , and his enthusiasm for this technology is genuine , as is his passion for music : he is proud of the fact that the design studio has by far the loudest sound system in the company , and they rarely work without it playing at full volume .
He is probably the best product designer in the world and certainly the most influential , but finds media attempts to glamorise him as "" the Armani of Apple "" embarrassing .
He lives quietly in San Francisco with his wife Heather – whom he met while taking his degree in industrial design at Northumbria University – and their twin five - year - old boys .
He is so low - key that his friend , the DJ John Digweed , had known him for some time before he realised that Jony did n't just work in the design department at Apple – he ran it , and was a senior vice president of the company .
After college , I ve started a design consultancy in London , joining Apple in 1992 .
But it was n't until 1997 , when Steve Jobs returned to the company he had founded , that I ve and his team were allowed to really show what they could do .
Jobs had a clear – and at the time very radical – vision of the home computer as a digital hub , the place where you created , stored and viewed everything from photos and video to music and movies .
The first iMac came out the following year , transforming personal computers overnight from grim beige boxes to sleek home accessories , and I ve has continued to set the agenda ever since .
With the first iPod , there was nothing to distract you from your music except a pause button , a headphone jack , and a single port to recharge and/or input data .
It was a stunning feat of engineering , with I ve 's trademark attention to detail : the serial number is individually etched onto each unit to avoid an ugly paper sticker , and the wire twists that usually secure cables when you first get them out of the box have been replaced by neat clips .
This does n't necessarily cost more , he points out .
You just have to care .
And he does , obsessively .
Once it was decided that the first iPod would have a white front to match Apple 's range of home computers and laptops , the headphones had to be white as well .
At the time , this was unheard of .
"" People said , ' You ca n't do white headphones , nobody does white ! ' "" he laughs .
"" But I thought it was really nice . ""
I ve works closely with Jobs , but few other company employees are allowed to see what he 's doing behind the tinted windows of his studio .
In an industry where ideas are the main commodity , Apple guards its secrets jealously , and never discusses new products until the moment they are on sale .
Now that he has fulfilled a long - term ambition to create a phone , it 's hard to guess what I ve will come up with next , although a tablet computer has been rumoured for some time .
What is pretty certain , however , is that we will really , really want one ."
2009-12-16,"You might have heard of iFixit before : they 're the chaps that take great delight in doing teardowns of new gadgets - ripping apart , say , a brand new iMac to show you the constituent parts .
That 's all well and good , but if you 're not actually familiar with what iFixit does the rest of the time then perhaps it 's a good time to get acquainted .
The site itself offers DIY repair manuals for all sorts of Apple products - pretty useful for those of us who have locked ourselves into Steve Jobs 's walled garden .
Instead of dragging that busted iPod or unhappy Mac to the Apple store to watch one of the so - called "" geniuses "" stare at it for a bit , you can get a screwdriver and fix it yourself .
Now , this might not exactly chime with the general trend to consumer electronics as something people do n't understand - and remember , we wrote about the death of the manual back in August-
but it 's liberating to do it yourself .
Given how little time most of us spend actually fishing about inside our computers these days , there 's a satisfaction in trying to push towards a more hands - on culture full of people who are n't afraid to take a crack themselves ( anyone who is de facto IT support for their friends and family knows how useful it would be if everybody felt like they could fix their own computers ) .
Anyway , the really interesting thing about iFixit is that the company has just announced that it 's releasing its manuals under Creative Commons licenses - which means that they 'll continue to be free forever , and that you are free to reuse , adapt and build on what 's already there .
Today , we are giving all that content to the world .
Effective immediately , we are licensing all iFixit repair manuals under the Creative Commons BY - NC - SA license .
To my knowledge , this is the largest free release of repair documentation ever .
We are committing to make our repair manuals available to everyone in the world , forever , for free .
Good on them ."

2010-01-03,"He has been likened to Josiah Wedgewood , Henry Ford and Estée Lauder for what Fortune magazine calls his "" intense drive , unflagging curiosity and keen commercial imagination "" : the words of Nancy Koehn , a Harvard Business School historian .
But Steve Jobs , CEO of Apple and Fortune 's chief executive of the decade , has done better than any of these .
People may insist that a Ford is preferable to a Chevrolet , or Lauder 's lipstick to Chanel 's , but they are unlikely to launch into such passionate advocacy of their product as a MacBook or iPhone user .
Jobs has not only second - guessed and devised for the world products it deems necessary to communicate and to entertain itself , but has done so in the language of a higher cause .
When he launched the iPhone in 2007 , Jobs described it not as "" useful "" , but "" revolutionary and magical "" .
His computers , Jobs told Rolling Stone 15 years ago , will make the world "" clearly a better place "" .
Very soon , speculation suggests that there will be further democratisation , with a promised next phase in this digitally eschatological view of history : the Apple tablet computer or iSlate .
The last month of the Steve Jobs noughties saw cyberspace believers make several orbits of excitement as Apple registered an internet domain called iSlate.com .
Jobs is known for launching new gadgets in January , and this one is expected to be an iPhone , iPod , TV , news - stand and more rolled into one .
Another "" new era "" is being hailed with an intake of breath , already , and the timing could not be more apposite : to cap a tumultuous career within his own company , Jobs had taken five months ' leave from Apple after a liver transplant in January 2009 , fuelling perennial rumours about his health .
But he is back and how .
Steve Jobs 's life has been charted in obsessive , unauthorised books , one of which , iCon , made him so angry he banned its publisher Wylie and Sons ' entire list from Apple stores .
Yet Jobs is , as is universally reported , a secretive man , leaving one to pick carefully through the curriculum vitae .
He was born in 1955 , in San Francisco , to Abdulfattah Jandali , a Syrian student and later political scientist , and Joanne Carole
Schieble – but was adopted and raised by Paul and Clara Jobs in the town of Mountain View , California .
At high school , he attended evening lectures by Hewlett - Packard , took a summer job at the company and met Steve Wozniak , with whom he would found Apple .
Although just too young for the Summer of Love , Jobs was within its orbit , dropping out of college to work for Atari video games , "" dressed in rags , basically , "" recalls Al Alcorn , Jobs 's boss .
"" I do n't know why I hired him .
There was some spark , some inner energy . ""
But Jobs took employment only to save for the "" hippie trail "" to India , a spiritual journey undertaken with the man who would become Apple 's first employee , Dan Kottke .
In iCon , Kottke recalls : "" Steve 's devotion to the philosophies of the east seemed to be tied to his quest for other truths – the absolutes and the loopholes in science and electronics . ""
When he returned to California in 1975 , head shaven and wearing robes , Jobs was on a psychedelic adventure .
According to the historian of the computer industry 's psychedelic origins , John Markoff , Jobs is said to have called taking LSD "" one of the two or three most important things "" he had ever done .
The following year , Jobs and Wozniak , a hacker , were ready to design the first commercially successful small computer , the Macintosh , and founded Apple .
For a decade , Jobs led Apple in forging its place – which burgeoning commercial success has not eroded – as the hip , cool , thinking person 's alternative to the PC juggernaut ; before he became Goliath , Jobs played David .
One of those working on the Mac was Bud Tribble , who spotted early how Jobs "" has the ability to make people around him believe in his perception of reality .
It 's a combination of very fast comeback , catchphrases and the occasional very original insight , which he throws in to keep you off balance "" .
In 1985 , Jobs and Wozniak received the first National Medal for Technology from President Ronald Reagan .
But there was disharmony in Apple - land : that same year , after an internal power struggle , the man Jobs had lured from Pepsi to run the company , John Sculley , relieved Jobs of his post .
Jobs 's decade in exile only consolidated his position within Apple by demonstrating that it could not survive without him .
The technology pioneered by the NeXT company he formed would lay a second set of foundations for Apple , as would the premium Jobs put on design at NeXT .
Jobs also bought the Graphics Group , renaming it Pixar and working with Disney on films that would reach billions : Toy Story and Toy Story 2 , A Bug 's Life , Monsters Inc. , Finding Nemo and Ratatouille .
When Jobs married Laurene Powell in 1991 , the union was blessed by a Zen Buddhist monk .
They now have three children and Jobs has another born in 1978 to a San Francisco painter ( a child
he for a while refused to acknowledge as his ) .
According to one unauthorised biography , Joan Baez is among his former lovers .
And yet , unlike Bill Gates , whom Apple believers regard as the capitalist monster , Jobs has shown no interest in philanthropy or worthy causes .
Jobs - less , Apple had gone into decline .
In 1996 , it bought NeXT and before long appointed Jobs as interim CEO , or "" iCeo "" , as he would joke .
It was at this point that Jobs began to define the "" digital lifestyle "" beyond his elite club of Macintosh users , convincing the wider world to "" think different "" , as his slogan urged , with iTunes , iPods , iPhones , MacBook Air and the rest .
In 2000 , Apple was worth $ 5bn ; it is now worth $ 170bn .
Because Apple is such a personally propelled venture , it is a brutal fact that news about Jobs 's health problems is for many news about Apple 's stock price , hence whispers of concern when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2004 , and again during last year 's transplant .
Jobs might still be a Buddhist and greatly admire Gandhi , but that does not make iPhone technology any less attractive to the Raytheon defence contractor , which last year unveiled One Force Tracker , the first of a series of software applications turning iPhone and iPod touch devices into battlefield tools .
On the other hand , Marcus Gilroy - Ware , who teaches online journalism at City University , London – dependent on Steve Jobs 's computers – and also a fine bass guitarist , puts it this way : "" If you are a guitarist , you want to play the best instrument you can find .
It 's the same with a computer – you need the best tools .
Apple 's history , going back to its psychedelic origins , has mostly been about producing these creative tools .
The first two applications on the Mac were a writing program and a drawing program , not spreadsheets . ""
As a Mac owner , I am , according to Jobs , part of a "" peaceful revolution "" , and owner of something of "" beauty "" , the word universally used to describe and distinguish Steve Jobs 's products , and arguably the reason they have become the computers of choice for the mid- to upper - creative classes .
What to say about the beauty of an iPod or Mac ?
Unlike a Grecian urn , no great poet has written an ode to one .
But there have been equivalents of an ode in our time .
Apple products were ubiquitous features of recent television series by Simon Schama and Stephen Fry as they charged around America .
One should presume that these were not sleazy product placements , but that both presenters genuinely believe the visual effect ( and their own veracity ) would be enhanced by an on - screen accessory which pre - Apple directors would have ordered out of the way .
But a Mac can not by definition meet Keats 's stipulation , regarding the Grecian urn , that "" a thing of beauty is joy forever "" – for it is Jobs 's task to make his own ideas redundant .
In its citation , Fortune magazine describes the establishment of Apple stores as going "" deeper than retail "" .
The Apple store in London 's Regent Street on new year 's day had light shows , film workshops and red - shirted sales clergy proselytising the latest iGospel .
The MacNN website claimed that "" Apple 's presence in Regent Street has also been credited with helping to vitalise the area and attract other retailers "" .
The UK has yet to see a proliferation of Apple vending machines at airports , as in the US , where one can buy a spare hard drive as you can a packet of crisps .
But the MacNN site goes on to say that this branch in Regent Street generates three times the revenue per square foot as Harrods – the corner store of the super - rich now easily overtaken by the man we will shortly see , no doubt wearing the usual black polo - neck and sneakers , pulling his next revolutionary magic rabbit out of the iHat . •
This article was changed on 6 January 2010 because we said Jobs 's description of taking LSD as "" one of the two or three most important things "" he had ever done was from the official biography of Steve Jobs on Apple 's website .
This was incorrect .

2010-01-26,"With hours to go until Apple unveils its latest creation – believed to be a keyboardless "" tablet "" computer with a 10-inch touch - sensitive screen – the internet is abuzz with last - minute rumours and speculation about what it will be like , and more importantly , who will benefit most from it .

So with the tablet you 're going to open up the higher education market , the professional market .
The tablet is going to be just terrific . ""
The excitement has risen to levels not seen since Apple launched the iPhone in January 2007 .
Fan sites have vied to produce composite images and ask : "" Is this Apple 's new tablet ? ""
But the key question is about which partners , particularly in games , music and publishing , will join Jobs on stage to show off content specially adapted for the large - scale format , which is expected to have a screen area four times larger than the iPhone 's .
The Guardian has learned that a number of print publishers have been developing applications to be showcased today – including Condé Nast , the publisher of Vogue and Wired magazine , and other European and American print groups .
Other reports suggest developers from the New York Times have been camped for several weeks near Apple 's Silicon Valley headquarters .
Today , the organisation announced it had created a Reader Applications Division , giving "" an operational and financial home to the products that offer a digital reading experience similar to the print platform "" .
Many publishers are believed to be looking to the machine to start an explosion in ebook and electronic magazine and newspaper sales – just as the iPod did for downloaded music with iTunes Music Store in 2003 , and the iPhone for apps ( software applications ) in 2008 . ""
Like the music industry , publishers are now deeply threatened by free content sharing on the internet and Apple are uniquely placed to solve this problem with iTunes , a digital shopfront that 's trusted by publishers and consumers alike , "" said Ben Trewhella , chief technology officer of Mubaloo , which writes iPhone apps for businesses .
Apple is the largest music retailer in the US , and has 99.4 % of the world market for apps , say analysts .
Record labels and authors of apps have struggled with Apple 's grip on their respective markets , complaining of its restrictions to sales .
The new machine is expected to add ereader capabilities , as well as play music , browse the web and play games .
The Apple launch invitation offers few clues and simply invites journalists to "" Come see our latest creation "" against a background of paint - like splotches – and despite months of rumours with growing credence , the invitation itself was only sent out a week ago .
Since then the only other recognition came in a brief statement from Jobs on Monday in a press release about Apple 's financial results , in which he mentioned "" a major new product that we 're really excited about "" .
While some of the rumours verge on the incredible , others have been trying to base their guesses on a scant number of clues and trace evidence .
Website analytics company
Flurry says it has studied what around 50 mysterious devices are being used for in and around Apple 's campus in Cupertino , California , and that they are largely being used to test games and other entertainment software .
Meanwhile , Apple is understood to be talking to a number of mobile phone operators to provide connectivity for the new gadget , suggesting that – like the iPhone – it will have built - in 3G."
2010-01-26,"Apple is notorious for the levels of secrecy it keeps around new products - and never more so than with the impending launch of its tablet computer , which has seen the company clamp down and let only a select few pieces of information leak out .
Why ?
Because Steve Jobs is ( in his words ) "" a big bang guy "" : building anticipation and appetite is part of the marketing game .
So what will Jobs - whose temper has been likened to a flamethrower - make of the latest leak , which came courtesy of the boss of US publishing company McGraw - Hill ?
In an interview on American business news network CNBC , Terry McGraw - the chairman , president and chief executive of the company - let slip a few choice pieces of data that were previously unknown . ""
Yeah , very exciting , "" he told the programme , when asked about his company 's link to the Apple product .
"" They 'll make their announcement tomorrow on this one . ""
All well and good -
but then McGraw went on to offer some new details .
"" We have worked with Apple for quite a while - the tablet is going to be based on the iPhone operating system , and so it will be transferrable .
So what you 're going to be able to do now ... we have a consortium of ebooks - we have 95 % of all our materials that are in ebook format on that one - so with the tabloid
you 're going to open up the higher education market , the professional market .
The tabloid , the tablet is going to be just really terrific . ""
McGraw calls it both the "" tablet "" and "" tabloid "" , so it 's not clear whether either is the actual product name ( something you bet on being called the iPad ) .
And the involvement of various publishers was already widely reported , too .
But the fact that it runs on the same system as the iPhone ?
That 's new , and letting it out early is not something that Jobs is likely to take lying down ."
2010-01-27,"The eyes of a nervous , impatient world will turn towards America this evening , as a powerful leader prepares to outline his vision for a new era .
That will be Steve Jobs launching Apple 's latest iGadget .
And in other news , President Obama will also be delivering his first state of the union address to Congress .
While there has n't quite been the months of hype surrounding the Apple launch this evening , the pundits of Washington have been working up their own mini - lather over Obama 's SOTU .
There 's been no shortage of advice , most of it contradictory ( "" Democrats offer conflicting advice for SOTU , "" reports Politico , in today 's least surprising news article ) .
The single best piece of analysis on the subject is from the Guardian 's very own Jonathan Freedland : First , Democrats have to finish what they started .
It has been pathetic to watch so many throw their hands up in defeat at the first setback .
So , what do we know of the state of the union so far ?
( Apart from the fact , as the Gallup polling organisation reports , that the SOTU has little or no impact on a president 's poll ratings ? )
We know that Obama will somehow be saying sorry for his administration 's various failings over the past year .
According to the New York Times : When Mr. Obama presents his first State of the Union address on Wednesday evening , aides said he would accept responsibility , though not necessarily blame , for failing to deliver swiftly on some of the changes he promised a year ago .
But he will not , aides said , accede to criticism that his priorities are out of step with the nation 's .
Responsibility but not blame ?
That 's a difficult needle to thread – as in , "" I did it
but it 's not my fault . ""
But what of the more concrete proposals ?
Well , there 's the "" spending freeze "" which on closer inspection is a sort of "" spending chill "" since it will only apply to the sliver of the US government budget which is discretionary .
Yet a major theme of the Tea Party protests ( and others ) has been the size of the deficit , as a background drumbeat .
Complaining that these people were nowhere to be seen during the Bush era is n't much help .
Interestingly , Obama appears to be reaching out for the one mildly bipartisan domestic policy arena left to him : education .
Part of this is to be an overhaul of No Child Left Behind act of the Bush era –
and NCLB was the one truly bipartisan piece of domestic legislation that Bush managed to pass through Congress , so that may not be a bad place to start .
There 's a mountain of other analysis - cum - thumbsucking .
What we do n't yet know are the smallbore "" eye - catching initiatives "" beloved of presidents .
Bill Clinton had his riff on school uniforms ( seriously ) , and the v - chip ( for a "" violence chip "" allowing parents to block TV content ) in his 1996 SOTU address .
And who can remember –
I mean , who can forget this groundbreaking policy unleashed by George Bush in his 2005 SOTU :
Tonight I propose a three - year initiative to help organizations keep young people out of gangs , and show young men an ideal of manhood that respects women and rejects violence .
Taking on gang life will be one part of a broader outreach to at - risk youth , which involves parents and pastors , coaches and community leaders , in programmes ranging from literacy to sports .
And I am proud that the leader of this nationwide effort will be our first lady , Laura Bush .
Which of course entirely solved America 's gang problem .
What else do we know ?
Well , it will have a 10 inch screen and run the iPhone operating system ...
sorry , that 's Steve Jobs .
Anyway , Paul Krugman 's not happy :
I do n't think I 'm going to watch the SOTU ; all indications are that it will be deeply , deeply depressing .
For those of you without Krugman 's sunny disposition : tonight we 'll be liveblogging the state of the union from a little before 9 pm eastern time ( that 's 2 am GMT for insomniac West Wing fans ) .
In the meantime , fill in those empty hours by following my colleague Bobbie Johnson 's liveblogging of the Apple launch ."
2010-01-27,"Like everything Apple designs , the iPad is intended to satisfy our cravings for simplicity and clarity .
Steve Jobs had already sneered at the idea of ­netbooks , labelling the cheap , low - powered ­laptops that have proved phenomenally popular with consumers slow and clunky –
but it 's clear that this is the ­market the iPad is aiming for .
On the surface it appears to be little more than an oversized iPhone , a flat , black screen with a single button but underneath it wants to be a laptop .
As one of a small group of people given a sneak , hands - on preview of the iPad , my first impressions were good : it 's hefty but not heavy , feeling solid and responsive in the hand .
The screen is about the size of a large paperback , but it 's just half an inch deep .
That big , glassy screen does leave it vulnerable to breakages , but could also prove ­liberating for people who are used to toting a laptop around with them .
Using it will be familiar to anybody who has tried an iPhone : it uses the same combination of swipes , pokes , jabs and sweeps of the finger of its smaller cousin .
Sweep your hand across its reactive 9.7-inch screen , though , and everything feels more satisfying and natural .
The big problem I had was in trying to understand what the iPad was for : the answer , it seems , is everything .
It attempts to do almost everything that your laptop can , while also offering almost everything your smartphone can do as well .
Surfing the web was a breeze , while it plays video smoothly and ­handles a variety of games pretty well .
You can use any of the existing iPhone applications straight away , though it is disappointing when you realise that they become blocky and almost childlike when expanded to fill the larger screen .
Switched into ebook mode , the way the iPad emulates the printed page feels fairly natural , if not entirely on a par with rival ebook readers such as Amazon 's Kindle .
The backlit screen does n't come anywhere near the clarity of electronic ink , which means it 's going to prove a lot harder on the eyes of bookworms(it 's great for reading in bed , one Apple flunky told me , keen to stress the positive side ) .
But what it loses here , it makes up for with the addition of ­colour and even video .
When you get down to business , the iPad might not be enough for heavy users .
The on - screen keyboard will take a little getting used to : unlike the thumb - driven flash of text messaging , typing on the iPad requires either a single finger stab or putting it down on a flat surface .
But for casual entertainment , it manages to do plenty very well : the sort of thing likely to tempt customers who want a ­lightweight laptop but does n't really need it to do any heavy lifting .
For anyone who loves new technology , getting the first touch of a new Apple device is a little like laying hands on the Shroud of Turin , or seeing a unicorn : the first experience of a mythical object imbued with miraculous properties .
Jobs trumpeted it as exactly that , a magical device that will change the way we use computers in our everyday lives .
And while playing with the iPad was not exactly a religious experience , it 's not hard to see that the gadget , or at least the ideas it contains , will be with us for a long time to come ."
2010-01-28,"I had no plans to buy an iPad
– I have no plans to ever buy an iPhone , and if I do you are authorised to strike me in the face with something sharp and rusty –
so I did n't really follow the frenzy of speculation on what we until very recently referred to as the "" Apple Tablet "" might contain .
Still , I 'm taken aback by the immediate and vocal lack of enthusiasm for Steve Jobs 's new product .
What does it lack ?
What was everyone hoping for that did not materialise ?
What miracles , envisioned in the fevered imaginations of so many cultists and devotees , were not made manifest ?
This is a very rough analogy , but the iPad is a lot like Barack Obama : everyone was able to project their own fantasies and aspirations on a product with which they were mostly unfamiliar , only to sour on it once they realised that it did not live up to their impossible expectations .
Only , with the iPad , it took about seven minutes for the disappointment to set in .
I think this says something about our accelerated culture or how we confuse hype and excitement for the tangible realities of life .
Our ability to trick ourselves into imagining that we 'll get exactly what we want is being outpaced by the swiftness of our disgruntled reactions when things do n't turn out how we planned .
But maybe we should have some hope
( there 's that word ! )
: look at Obama 's State of the Union address on Wednesday night .
An energetic , authoritative leader stood in front of a national audience and managed to remind so many people of what they admired about him in the first place .
It 's possible that the celerity with which we cycle through our emotions might yet lead to a more measured resignation .
Sure , Obama may not be everything we thought we were getting , but we will probably stick with him , given the alternatives .
If Obama is your new iPad , Sarah Palin is your old Kindle .
And Steve Jobs is going to win that battle every time .

2010-01-28,"The Apple iPad – that tablet computer everyone was speculating about – is out , and publishers are hoping that Apple will can offer the same magic for the print world that it did for the music industry with iTunes .
So is digital journalism suddenly saleable ?
After remaking the business of the music industry and re - inventing the mobile phone , Steve Jobs obviously is up for something new , and journalism has got his attention .
The New York Times quoted an internal source : "" Steve believes in old media companies and wants them to do well .
He believes democracy is hinged on a free press and that depends on there being a professional press .
"" Sounds like he has a business model in mind .
Presenting the iPad yesterday , Jobs was joined by the New York Times 's Martin Nisenholtz , the senior vice - president overseeing the paper 's digital operations , to present a crisp Times app for the iPad .
Financially the New York Times has not struck any deals with Apple yet – as Nisenholtz said , it gave them only three weeks to develop the app .
However , this seems likely to be the device that will finally put a price on digital journalism , and not only because the Times is heading towards a metered pay model for its content .
So what does it look like ?
When Nisenholtz introduced the Times application , he said : "" We 're incredibly psyched to pioneer the next generation of digital journalism .
We want to create the best of print and best of digital , all rolled up into one .
"" Which is what they did .
Still there is something new that might be worth paying for : a much stronger focus on design via a 9.7 inch colour display .
This allows the iPad to reintroduce the serendipity and the browsing we know from print : several articles fit on one screen and the size of an article marks its importance .
As seen with some experiments before , video can play inline .
In addition , with Wi - Fi , 3 G and the multitouch interface , it can offer readers more interaction than ebook readers such as Amazon 's Kindle .
Combining a new visual approach with the iTunes payment system , which reaches 100 m credit - card accounts , Apple could help create a way for media companies to change the consumer attitudes of the up till now free digital era .
The New York Times were the only publishing company that was approached by Apple .
However , Condé Nast is preparing for the iPad since quite a while .
Sarah Chubb , president of Condé Nast Digital , said the company plans to have some of their magazines ready when the iPad ships in March .
Stephanie Clifford of the always well informed Times ' Media Decoder blog is as specific as saying that Vanity Fair , Wired and GQ are likely candidatest to be the first .
Sports Illustrated of Time Warner is also ready for take off .
In December , they had their ideas presented by the Thing .
Next Issue Media , the digital initiative of Condé Nast , Hearst , Meredith , News Corporation and Time Inc. announced last month , declined to comment , saying : "" We are certainly paying close attention to all developments in this area ( including today 's iPad announcement ) and are looking forward to seeing new products come to market that will support the kind of highly featured , immersive reading experience we intend to create . ""
For that , the new device has to become popular – and the acceptance of the Kindle says it can .
While the Kindle 's exact sales numbers are not released , it is widely estimated that as of the last quarter 2009 there were about 1.5 million devices sold .
If Steve Jobs would save journalism , it might be possible that publishers would get him the Holy Grail .
If journalism reinvents itself in an extra crisp version for the iPad and other tablet devices , would you have a problem paying for it ?"
2010-01-29,"Apple makes huge strides forward , yet Steve Jobs 's strides stay ever the same .
There they are again , those mid - blue Levis , at the launch of the iPad , the iPod , the iEverything .

There were no apps ( or even a way to build them ) .
A senior Microsoft executive sniped that it was a "" closed system "" that did n't support –

So obviously it must be a dud .
Today ?
Apple has sold 250 m iPods , of which more than 40 m are iPod Touches , and more than 30 m iPhones .
Given that , are you seriously going to be against the iPad ?
Apple 's track record is singular : it makes devices easier to use , and then refines them .
Steve Jobs 's dream for the Macintosh was that it would be a "" computing appliance "" , and the iPod and the iPhone reflect the same aim .
Arguably , the iPad is the apotheosis of Jobs 's dream ; and many people may rather like it .
So now , how could it affect different media industries ?
Charles Arthur Print and publishing First , ebooks and book publishing .
It 's no secret that Amazon is trying to do to book publishers what Tesco has done to UK farmers – establish a dominant position and drive down the prices paid to suppliers .
It 's happening with physical books , and with ebooks , where Amazon imposed a $ 9.99 price and demanded a 70 - 30 revenue split in which it gets the 70 % .
Apple came to publishers offering to let them set ebooks ' prices and keep 70 % of the revenue .
And suddenly last month , ahead of the iPad launch , Amazon reversed its revenue split , though only on some books .
Does that indicate worry on Amazon 's part ?
Are publishers happier with Apple 's plan ?
The fact that Jobs could point to five US publishers having signed up speaks digital volumes .
Publishers are worried that ebooks will do to them what downloaded music has done to the CD business and websites to newspapers : cannibalise their revenues and leave the slimmest of pickings .
Being able to control the price of ebooks is the ideal for them .
But the iBooks platform for selling books may not arrive in Europe for some time .
That 's not surprising ; the iTunes Music Store , opened in the US in April 2003 , did n't reach Europe until June 2004 because of the problem of licensing content .
Books have precisely the same regional licensing issues – which is part of the reason why Amazon 's Kindle has only recently become available outside the US .
For newspapers and magazines , getting onto the iPad is simpler .
All it takes is a custom - written app in which the only requirement is that it does n't use Flash .
The app can be free , paid - for or subscription .
It 's a business model in its own right ; just figure out what you can get people to pay for .
The New York Times showed off its application , which formats its daily content into an iPad - friendly mix .
Meanwhile Sports Illustrated has already demonstrated its idea of an "" electronic magazine for a tablet "" in an intriguing YouTube video showing a suspiciously iPad - like device with a virtual keyboard , pages you flick back and forth , and video .
Quite possibly it has already decided where it can charge people , judging by the time spent dwelling on the video possibilities of its swimsuit issue .
A publisher who had already seen the iPad before its launch believed it would be a saviour : "" Steve believes in old media companies and wants them to do well . ""
Old media companies include Disney , of course , where Jobs is a director .
Though Jobs has never been enamoured of journalists , except where they serve Apple , newspapers may like to think that he is their greatest fan .
But they 're going to have to make the iBooks store work for them .
Jobs is n't going to do it .
CA Television Television applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch give us hints of the future for the iPad .
In 2009 , we saw social networking applications built around live TV on the iPhone .
While many have dismissed the iPad as an iPod Touch XL , the extra screen space will allow new social features on a device that people who would never watch TV with a laptop may feel is at home on the sofa .
As the amount of video content explodes , it becomes more of a challenge to find things you like .
Much of what drove the popularity of YouTube was n't that the video was high - quality , but that you were able to pass along links to videos .
Just as people have been able to share links to their favourite YouTube clips , in 2010 television viewers will be able to share their favourite programmes , and the iPad will be a part of this trend whether through buying TV programmes on iTunes or using apps to recommend programmes .
Augmented reality was all the rage in 2009 , with high - end smartphones developing the ability to overlay information on a view of your surroundings .
Sports drive a lot of innovation in television , and if you want to see a vision of the future , look at Major League Baseball 's application for the iPad .
It overlays a wealth of statistics on video highlights and delivers player information , live audio streams of games and more .
Think of the over - by - over analysis possibilities for cricket while watching the game on the big screen
and you start to see the possibilities for a device to complement live television .
The iPad is first and foremost a media device , and it goes beyond the original iPod model of listening to music and watching video to build on the iPhone model of a world of apps .
The iPad will allow TV content companies to do more than sell their programmes – apps will bring new social and interactive opportunities to TV not easily created for the dizzying array of TV platforms .

It 's all about the app for advertisers .
Figures for the iPhone , which in effect created a marketing platform with the launch of apps , show that 87 % of the 1.5 million - odd owners use apps .

The iPad critically underlines the need to develop big ideas that work across a spectrum of consumer engagement , "" he says .
Barclaycard created an app that spun off its feelgood commercial "" Waterslide "" , which has been downloaded 8.5 m times .
On Christmas day the company registered a massive 250,000 downloads , probably due to people being given iPhones as presents – something Apple will be hoping to emulate with the iPad next Christmas .

2010-02-01,"Apple 's new iPad tablet computer could hamper innovation and cause long - term damage if it becomes a hit , according to experts .
Just as Steve Jobs tries to wow the world with the "" magical "" new device - unveiled on Wednesday at a media - saturated launch event in San Francisco – leading industry figures have told the Guardian that the machine marks a fundamental shift in the way the computer industry works .
The iPad , a 10-inch touchscreen computer that will cost upwards of £ 300 , was greeted by many admirers as a significant step forward .
But in developing it using the closed model of the iPhone , industry insiders said , Apple could wrestle even more power away from its rivals and partners .
"" It 's chilling , "" said Brewster Kahle , a technology veteran and director of the Internet Archive .
"" We may be seeing the iPhone - ification of the Macintosh . ""
The concerns come because – contrary to the predictions of many pundits – the iPad is more like a scaled - up version of the iPhone than a scaled - down laptop computer .
That means it can only run one program at a time , and even then those applications must be approved by Apple before they can be loaded on to the machine .
This is the opposite of the traditional model used by the computer industry , where the makers of operating systems have little or no control over what software their users buy or download .
Kahle told the Guardian that such a lockdown would prevent major innovation from software developers .
"" They really control the horizontal and the vertical by going with the iPhone platform ...
I think it 's discouraging , "" he said .
"" The future is controlled , and it 's controlled by Apple . ""
Referring to some major innovations like web browsers , email and instant messaging , he added that Apple could easily block in favour of developing a competing product or simply limiting new ideas .
"" All of those started out as independent applications by independent organisations that were not in the plan of any of the platform makers , "" he said .
"" If you were to come up with these now on the iPhone , you could n't even get out of the starting gate . ""
Kahle , whose organisation is trying to assemble a vast library of digital assets for access by the public , is not the only person concerned that the move to what Harvard professor Jonathan Zittrain calls "" tethered appliances "" could have long - lasting effects on modern culture .
The Free Software Foundation staged a protest at the launch event and argued that the iPad could set a precedent that would fundamentally change the way we related to technology . ""
This past year , we have seen how human rights and democracy protesters can have the technology they use turned against them by the corporations who supply the products and services they rely on , "" said Peter Brown , executive director of the FSF .
"" Your computer should be yours to control .
By imposing such restrictions on users , Steve Jobs is building a legacy that endangers our freedom for his profits . ""
Apple has previously come in for criticism for its seemingly arbitrary approval policy for applications submitted for use on the iPhone – a system that has seen some applications banned from going on sale for containing "" sexual content "" , while allowing others get through .
Last summer , Google accused its Silicon Valley neighbour of unfairly blocking rival companies from putting their software on the iPhone , a claim that led to an investigation by US regulators .
Kahle , who oversees the OpenLibrary project that aims to put millions of books online , also said that he hoped Apple 's iTunes model would not become as dominant as it has in the music world – and that the company would open up the system to benefit everyone . ""
Apple is going towards having a single store and aggregating everyone into that store .
That is not the web , that is a pre - web world .
We think that you not only want interesting applications that were n't predicted and were n't previously approved by Apple , but you want people to be able to set up and sell and lend books .
Does this do that ?
I see no indications yet . """

I think anything that improves the customer experience with mobile data is welcome and as such I would be very interested in having it . ""
He refused to say whether any talks have actually taken place , but Apple is understood to be scouting for UK wireless partners for the device .
Earlier this week O2 UK chief executive Ronan Dunne said he is also interested in the iPad , but it is unclear exactly how it will be sold this side of the Atlantic .
There is speculation that O2 and Orange have already put in an order for the micro - SIMs needed to provide 3 G wireless connectivity in the iPad .
Orange has already started talks with Apple to sell the iPad in the UK .
The company , owned by France Telecom , was also the first British network to break O2 's exclusive hold on the iPhone .
It started selling the handset last November and is understood to have sold over 200,000 by Christmas .
Vodafone 's third - quarter results yesterday were boosted by sales of smartphones , which pushed the company 's revenues from mobile data services – such as internet browsing – over £ 1bn in the quarter for the first time in the firm 's history .
In the three months to end December , 25 % of all new phones sold by Vodafone across the world were smartphones , up from 20 % in the second quarter of the year , with the bulk of those sales in Europe .
Colao said he expects smartphones to make up between 30 % and 40 % of all the phones the company sells in its next financial year to end March 2011 .
The figures were warmly welcomed by the City as showing signs of recovery in some key European markets such as the UK and Germany , where the company has lost ground to rivals and been battling against the tough economic climate , while its cost - cutting programme is also bearing fruit .
Shares in the company were up almost 5 % after the company raised its forecast for free cash flow for this year by £ 500 m to between £ 6.5bn and £ 7bn and forecast annual operating profits of £ 11.4bn to £ 11.8bn , rather than its initial forecast of £ 11bn to £ 11.8bn .
On a like - for - like basis , revenues fell slightly in the quarter but the decline was far less than in previous quarters .
Overall third - quarter revenues were up more than 10 % to £ 11.5bn as the company benefited from currency fluctuations .
Colao said he was conditionally optimistic about the group 's prospects .
"" I keep my feet on the ground ; I see what I see .
I see a few things going in the right direction .
I see mobile data continuing to grow .
I see a good performance in [ fixed - line telecoms ] .
I see in some markets like the UK and Italy a good performance , but I still see a lot of price pressure in voice and I still see unemployment being a concern in Europe .
"" There had been some speculation , ahead of the results , that shareholders were pushing for a break - up of the company as it has consistently underperformed its publicly quoted peers .
Colao , however , said the size of the company – which has operations from western and central Europe through to Turkey , India and South Africa as well its Verizon Wireless joint venture in the US – not only gives it scale in purchasing , but also an advantage in international roaming rates and helps it to attract business customers""There is a full set of opinions on how to structure Vodafone and we take due notice of all of them , "" he said .
"" The board regularly reviews our corporate structure but there is unanimous consent now that in our opinion the current structure serves shareholders well . """
2010-02-08,"Apple has spent years fine - tuning its incredible reputation for secrecy - doing everything from investigating its own employees when information is leaked to the media to silencing teenage bloggers who appear to know too much .
The latest individual on the receiving end of the company 's appears to be Alan Murray , a senior Wall Street Journal executive who mysteriously deleted a Twitter message he had apparently sent from an iPad during a secret meeting with Steve Jobs .
A juicy report from Valleywag points out that Murray hastily deleted a message he sent to Twitter last week , at exactly the same time that Jobs was doing a circuit of New York 's big print publications like the New York Times and ( yes ) the Wall Street Journal . ""
This tweet sent from an iPad .
Does it look cool ?
"" he wrote on February 4th .
The message quickly disappeared , but it 's still visible thanks to the joys of Google 's cache .
Jobs has a testy relationship with the Journal - which broke the news about his liver transplant last year - but there 's no suggestion yet that Jobs himself got out the flamethrower to burn Murray personally .
The WSJ editor did , however , tell Valleywag that "" Apple 's general paranoia about news coverage is truly extraordinary— but that 's not telling you anything you did n't already know "" .
It 's a great little piece of gossip , but the thing that 's really interesting to me is that Jobs is doing the rounds to try and drum up interest in the iPad .
With the insane amount of coverage the gadget has got in the past few weeks , it 's easy to imagine that everybody is gagging .
Indeed , at the launch event we were told the New York Times had spent several weeks holed up near Apple 's Californian headquarters .
So we know Apple was working in conjunction with some big media groups .
But here 's one of the most powerful individuals in the technology industry out there , himself , trying to convince publishers that they should be producing applications for the iPad .
That tells me there 's a lot at stake here , for Apple and for Jobs himself ."
2010-02-19,"One of this year 's hot topics has been Steve Jobs 's refusal to allow Adobe Flash onto his proprietary devices , the iPhone , iPod Touch and most recently the iPad e - reader .
It seems the Apple co - founder has also taken this message to The Wall Street Journal , visiting the Murdoch - owned paper in New York to demonstrate the iPad .
According to a Valleywag ( Gawker ) blog posting , What Steve Jobs Said During His Wall Street Journal iPad Demo , "" Jobs reportedly said the Journal would find ' It 's trivial to create video in H.264 ' instead of Flash . ""
But video is only one part of the problem .
The post says : "" even assuming the Journal could duplicate its Flash slideshows , infographics and other news apps using iPad - friendly technologies like Javascript , it would take a decidedly nontrivial amount of time and effort to create or acquire such a system , hire staff who understand it as well as Flash , train staff on how to use it , and integrate it into the Journal 's editorial workflow .
It might be a great way to advance web standards like HTML5 , and a great way to get the Journal on more devices , but it would hardly be ' trivial ' .
"" It 's not really about H.264 , because Flash is perfectly capable of playing H.264 videos .
H.264 is just a highly - patented and potentially expensive video codec : it is n't a cross - platform software development system .
But even if Flash lost its grip on the web - based video market , many websites would , for better or worse , continue to use it for other things .
Flash has n't been a huge success on the web because users love it
( I suspect most of us do n't ) , but because developers use it .
Also , Jobs must know that one reason why Flash videos play better on Windows PCs than on Macs is because of problems with Mac OS X , rather than with Flash .
This is n't to suggest that Adobe 's programmers are beyond criticism , of course , but whose are ?
If Jobs wants to do something useful , he could get his own programmers to fix the bloated and slow iTunes application , especially on Windows .
The problem with Jobs 's approach is that it 's costing him credibility .
Valleywag 's post repeatedly harps on the famous Reality Distortion Field , a term Bud Tribble coined ( or borrowed from Star Trek ) in 1981 .
At the wonderful Folklore.org site , it says : "" In his presence , reality is malleable .
He can convince anyone of practically anything .
It wears off when he 's not around . ""
The Wall Street Journal 's take appeared in an op - ed comment by Holman Jenkins , The Microsofting of Apple ? , which says : "" Here 's the bigger worry .
Apple may be succumbing to the seductive temptations of ' network effects , ' in which the all - consuming goal becomes getting its mobile devices into more and more hands simply for the purpose of locking more and more users into iTunes .
"" It concludes : "" Network effects can be a path to power and riches , but ( as Microsoft has shown ) much of the proceeds can also end up being squandered on defensive and paranoid attempts to secure the privileged position .
Pundits have wondered what might become of Apple once its chief aesthete and perfectionist is no longer calling the shots .
An Apple that rolls out increasingly junky devices merely to lock more and more customers into the iTunes - App Store mall is one gloomy possibility . ""
The suggestion that Apple might end up rolling out "" increasingly junky devices "" to lock users into its content shop was probably not the result that Jobs had in mind when he showed off the iPad ."
2010-02-25,"Steve Jobs will be pleased .
Not only did it happen on his birthday , but the 10 billionth song sold through the iTunes Music Store was by one of his musical heroes , Johnny Cash ;
specifically , "" Guess Things Happen That Way "" , which was bought by Louie Sulcer of Woodstock , Georgia , who receives a $ 10,000 iTunes gift card .
Jobs however was not moved to comment on the sale ; instead that was left to Eddy Cue , the company 's vice president of "" internet services "" , who said : "" We 're grateful to all of our customers for helping us reach this amazing milestone .
We 're proud that iTunes has become the number one music retailer in the world , and selling 10 billion songs is truly staggering . ""
Certainly it is - but how quickly will the next 10 billion roll around ?
Looking at the best - selling songs indicates that they have all come from the past couple of years .
There 's another question too : is the number of sales of songs keeping step with the number of iPods , given that it 's the iPod that is reckoned to be the driver of sales ?
Certainly the data ( recorded on Wikipedia ) suggests that sales keep growing .
But iPod sales are growing too - and no matter what replacement period you think there is ( as per our story of last November ) , you ca n't see exponential growth in sales of songs compared to the number of iPods out there .
People who have iPods do n't seem to buy more and more and more songs in the sort of replacement that they did for CDs replacing vinyl ( understandably , as CDs are digital , just like iTunes tracks , and you can rip them ) .
In fact , they seem to track each other fairly closely - so that with sensible estimates of between 100 m and 150 m iPods actually in use ( because although Steve Jobs did say at the iPad launch that 250 m iPods have been sold , not all of those are still working , you can be sure ) , you have to think that music sales are only weakly tracking iPod sales .
The graph above shows how the number of songs sold per day has taken off .
( Note : we 've had to interpolate for the 7bn and 9bn figures , because Apple never announced them .
But given the linear shape of the graph we felt it was fair to use a linear interpolation for them , as they fit other numbers that have been provided . )
Then there 's more bad news : iPod sales fell year - on - year in the most recent Christmas quarter .
So if it 's iPod sales driving iTunes sales , then the signs already point towards an eventual flattening .
Even now , the graph seems to show straight - line growth .
It is surely twilight of the ( dumb ) iPods - for the iPhone and iPod Touch are still doing well , and the iPad looks like it could do well too .
But they 'll never be the rocket that gets lit under the sales of downloaded music .
So it 's a great day for Louie Sulcer , but for the music industry generally , this is only worth one cheer .
Salvation , if it exists , will still have to be found elsewhere ."
2010-03-05,"Apple 's touchscreen iPad tablet computer will go on sale on 3 April in the US , but no specific date – beyond "" late April "" – has been given for its release in the UK and other international locations .
The company declined to set either the selling price for its models abroad , or to name any of the mobile network companies that will be providing connectivity for the more expensive iPad systems , which have 3 G data sims built in .
US customers will be able to pre - order the iPad , which Steve Jobs described as a "" magical and revolutionary product "" , from Friday 12 March , either online or in Apple 's retail stores .
The devices come in two basic forms – with Wi - Fi wireless connectivity , and with both Wi - Fi and 3 G mobile connectivity .
However , only the Wi - Fi versions will go on sale on 3 April ; Apple said only that the 3 G versions will be on sale in "" late April "" .
All the versions of the iPad will go on sale in the UK , Australia , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , Spain and Switzerland at the same time .
The iPad has excited huge interest because it expands the interface of the iPhone , Apple 's hugely successful mobile phone , into a usable "" slate "" computer with a 9-inch screen .
A number of content publishers have thought that it could be a completely new medium for sales of various products – including electronic versions of books , magazines , newspapers , music and films – that they will be able to charge for by selling them through Apple 's iTunes store , which has been a source of revenue for music , film , TV , audiobook and notably "" app "" creators .
In the US , the basic iPad model with Wi - Fi and 16 gigabytes of storage will cost $ 499 .
Apple says that it "" lets users browse the web , read and send email , enjoy and share photos , watch videos , listen to music , play games , read ebooks and much more "" .
The device is 0.5 inches thick and weighs 1.5 pounds – "" thinner and lighter than any laptop or netbook "" and Apple says it can run for up to 10 hours on a single battery charge .
( Tests on other products suggest the figure may typically be only half that . )
In the past few weeks there had been mounting speculation that there were production problems at Apple 's factories in China .
Apple had no comment on that , but the staged release to the international market compared to the US – which makes half of Apple 's sales – suggests it is husbanding its resources .
The announcement notably does not offer any pricing for the UK , nor any details about which mobile carriers Apple might sign up with .
O2 , Orange and Vodafone already offer its iPhone , but none of them are mentioned in Apple 's announcement .
Nor is pricing – which could be key to how well it sells .
Since the announcement of the iPad in January , the pound has slipped against the dollar in international exchange markets , which has led to speculation that Apple is waiting until the last minute to announce the price in order to minimise any losses on exchange - rate volatility .
Macworld magazine , which calculated in February that the low - end iPad selling for $ 499 in the US might have a starting price of £ 388 in the UK , recalculated on Friday that the downturn in sterling would now mean a minimum starting price of £ 400 ."
2010-03-08,"Apple ran its first TV ad for the iPad during last night 's Oscars coverage , while the company 's founder , Steve Jobs , was spotted at the event .
But while past campaigns won viewers over with their creative inspiration , this time Apple 's ad seemed rather basic .
The ad positions the iPad as a device for private entertainment .
That 's it .
You see the airbrushed hands of a man at home picking up the iPad to check out videos , read the New York Times , flip through book pages , check his private mail , and so on .
Apple has aired iPhone commercials during previous Oscars as it often uses high profile TV events to advertise its products and services .
Its excellent 1984 ad that launched the Macintosh computer premiered during the third quarter of the Super Bowl .
Compared with the creativity of the 1984 commercial , the new ad for the iPad is rather disappointing , but it suggests Apple wants the iPad to go mainstream .
The tablet computer will go on sale on 3 April in the US for $ 499 , and hit the stores in the UK and other international locations in late April ."
2010-03-16,"When Apple decided to sue Taiwanese phone manufacturer HTC , it was hard to see it as anything other than a broadside at Google .
After all , HTC makes Nexus One handset , and Steve Jobs has previously told staff that he 's angry because "" We did not enter the search business ...
they entered the phone business "" .
The ever - growing conflict between the two is something I mentioned on Monday , and plenty of people have weighed in on the subject , including former Sun Microsystems boss Jonathan Schwartz , who said that any company launching a software patent lawsuit was basically undertaking an "" act of desperation "" .
But most of the action so far has been from Apple 's side - the accusations about its rivals ( including Nokia , which has in turn accused the iPhone maker of "" legal alchemy "" ) ; the offended and aggrieved statements by Jobs and so on .
So where 's Google in this fight ?
Is it just staying quiet ?
Step forward
Tim Bray , the Canadian technologist best known for his work on XML .
Bray - who has written eloquently on software patents before and who left Sun himself last month - announced over the weekend that he was joining Google 's Android team .
Oh yeah , then he immediately poured fuel onto the fire with an extremely strong broadside about why he dislikes Apple 's approach : The iPhone vision of the mobile Internet 's future omits controversy , sex , and freedom , but includes strict limits on who can know what and who can say what .
It 's a sterile Disney - fied walled garden surrounded by sharp - toothed lawyers .
The people who create the apps serve at the landlord 's pleasure and fear his anger .
I hate it .
I hate it even though the iPhone hardware and software are great , because freedom 's not just another word for anything , nor is it an optional ingredient .
Strong words , and proof that Googlers are prepared to fire back from time to time .
It will be interesting to see how long Bray is allowed to speak his mind like this ( staff commenting , even obliquely , on lawsuits is something most corporate lawyers dislike intensely )
but it 's refreshing to see somebody on either side speaking openly and on the record ."
2010-03-17,"A new US comedy series , iCon , is being developed that will satirise Apple 's co - founder and chief executive , Steve Jobs .
According to cable channel Epix , the show is "" a savage satire centering on a fictional Silicon Valley CEO whose ego is a study in power and greed "" .
The pilot will be directed by Seinfeld veteran Larry Charles , an Emmy - winning TV writer and producer who is also known for directing Borat and Brüno .
"" We are attempting to do nothing less than a modern Citizen Kane , "" Charles said in a statement . ""
A scabrous satire of Silicon Valley and its most famous citizen . ""

2010-03-30,"HTML5 is gaining ground thanks to Steve Jobs 's refusal to allow Adobe 's multimedia plugin Flash onto the iPhone , iPod touch and iPad .
Several video services have created HTML5 solutions to deliver video , among them big players such as YouTube , Vimeo , Ooyala , Kalturea , and , as announced yesterday , Brightcove .
Brightcove is the biggest video service for the media industry and powers streaming video for more than 1,000 customers in over 40 countries , among them newspaper websites including the Daily Telegraph , the Guardian and the New York Times .
The New York Times and Time Inc will be among the first customers to integrate HTML5 , Brightcove said yesterday .
The US network CBS has also started to test HTML5 for building interactive elements that integrate video streams .
HTML5 is a revision of HTML and apart from being much more flexible and therefore interactive than HTML , it does n't require a special player .
The new markup language might not replace Flash , but it is likely that it will become the preferred standard .
That does n't mean Flash is dead .
For online video , Flash video has about 75 % market share at the moment .
It is likely that media companies will use Flash on websites and HTML5 on devices .
Rumours suggest that Google Chrome and the Google Chrome OS could come bundled with Flash .
While the Chrome browser is still in its early stages , integrating Flash into Google Chrome could add a new front to the clash between Google and Apple .
Was that what Steve Jobs and Eric Schmidt talked about , when they were spotted in the Town and Country shopping centre in Palo Alto last week ?"
2010-04-07,"In a CNN interview , Newsweek 's tech columnist Dan Lyons admitted to not having an iPad , about which he 'd written a cover story , whereas rival Time magazine had Stephen Fry and an interview with Steve Jobs .
Basically , Apple encourages publications to compete for its attention , and Newsweek used to get attention when its tech columnist was Steven Levy , author of Insanely Great .
Now it does n't get anything from Apple because it hired Lyons , who famously writes a blog as Fake Steve Jobs .
He told CNN : "" Their head of PR told my predecessor , Steven Levy , to pass * word to the powers that be at Newsweek that Apple was n't happy with the idea that they were going to hire me .
Yes , that happened .
And apple plays this game .
I mean , notice who got iPads and who did n't get iPads .
Notice who got access and who did n't . ""
* Corrected from password in the transcript .
In an email to Business Insider , however , Steven Levy said this was a "" false claim "" : "" Dan was hired after I left and I had no input whatsoever into his hiring .
I did not lobby against his hiring , nor did Apple ask me to lobby against it . ""
Lyons promptly admitted his mistake , telling Business Insider : "" What actually happened is that the complaints from Apple happened immediately after I was hired at Newsweek , not before .
This all happened two years ago and I just remembered it wrong .
I made an off - the - cuff remark on the air and what I said was incorrect . ""
He adds : Here is what happened .
My hiring was announced on June 13 , 2008 .
But my start date was n't until September 2008 .
On June 30 , 2008 , I got an email from my editor at Newsweek saying that Apple was already complaining about me being hired -- before I had even started working at Newsweek .
I followed up and was told that Steven Levy had told the Business Editor at Newsweek that he ( Levy ) had talked to Apple PR and that Apple PR was not pleased that Newsweek had hired me .
Since this story has cropped up here before , it 's good to have a fuller version .
It is , of course , inevitable that companies will have priorities when dealing with publications .
Apple could n't be expected to provide every single publication with a pre - release iPad , or invite every interested publication to the launch .
However , most companies try to deal fairly with the major publications and leading journalists in their field , even when they expect negative coverage .
But if it is favouring Time and excluding Newsweek , Apple is n't dealing fairly with the press and therefore , ultimately , the public ."
2010-04-08,"Apple is taking on the might of Google in the digital advertising industry , hoping to see - off the search engine giant 's attempts to build a powerful position in the burgeoning mobile advertising market .
The move , however , is unlikely to thrill Apple 's mobile phone network partners , such as O2 , Orange and Vodafone in the UK , as it looks set to undermine their own embryonic attempts to try and grab a slice of the mobile ad pie .
Unveiling the latest version - OS 4 - of the software for its highly successful iPhone , which finally brings multi - tasking to the device , Apple boss Steve Jobs also announced the launch of iAd .
The new mobile advertising platform is designed to allow iPhone app developers to create in - app advertising .
Currently anyone who clicks on an advert in a downloadable app is bounced out of it and onto the advertiser 's webpage .
As a result , Apple reckons many users are put off clicking on adverts .
In contrast , iAd will allow full - screen video and interactive advertising content to be served within an application .
The adverts are dynamically and wirelessly delivered to the device .
Crucially , Apple will sell and serve the adverts and developers will receive 60 % of their iAd revenue .
The videos , by the way , are of course in HTML5 and not Adobe 's Flash which Apple is still waging war against .
The move comes after Apple was beaten by Google in the race to buy mobile advertising group AdMob last year .
That deal is being investigated by the US authorities .
In January , Apple acquired rival Quattro Wireless , experts at embedding adverts in applications , for $ 275 m ( £ 180 m ) .
To date , mobile advertising has been all about making existing online advertising more relevant for mobile users when it appears on a handset 's small screen .
Some of the world 's largest mobile phone companies have already bandied together to offer advertisers more information about what their customers are doing while browsing the mobile web .
Existing online players such as Google , meanwhile , reckon the future lies in linking search results with mobile - specific information such as location .
Apple , however , seems to reckon mobile advertising and online advertising are two distinct things .
Jobs reckons the iPhone has created a new advertising category through the 185,000 apps that are available to download from its store . ""
These 185,000 apps do n't exist on computers , "" he said .
"" This is a new phenomenon , this is the first time this kind of thing has ever existed .
We never had that on the desktop , so search was the only way to find a lot of things . ""
The fact that Apple will host the ads also suggests that the Cupertino - based powerhouse will exert some quality control over them , just as it does for apps .
"" I think there will need to be some boundaries .
Like , you ca n't run just ANY ad on ABC .
There are some ads you ca n't run .
But these advertisers are paying to run ads …
I 'm hoping there wo n't be anything other than a light touch , "" he said .
Jobs described iAd as one of the seven "" tentpole features "" of iPhone OS 4 - incidentally did he deliberately mean to go after the Biblical allusion ?
It is perilously close to the Seven Pillars of Wisdom ,
a phrase made famous by TE Lawrence ( of Arabia ) 's autobiography which comes from the Book of Proverbs ""
Wisdom hath builded her house , she hath hewn out her seven pillars "" .
The other ' pillars ' are multi - tasking , the ability to organise apps into folders - useful as iPhone users have now downloaded four billion apps - enhanced mail , iBooks for the iPhone , some new features to keep business users happy , and a new game center .
Many iPhone users and even more developers have been pushing for the iPhone to be able to multi - task ( "" if it can carry on playing music through the iPod feature when doing other things such as browsing the web why ca n't it run my app in the background "" , they have asked , not unreasonably . )
But in order to preserve battery life , Apple has picked seven services which can be run by applications while the phone is running something else .
They are background audio ( so apps like Pandora can be used while doing other tasks ) , voice over IP ( so users can receive Skype calls even when they do not have the app running or the phone is asleep ) , background location , push notifications
( so you can get your Twitter alerts while accessing other apps ) ,
local notifications , task completion ( so you can jump to something else while a web page loads or video downloads to a news app ) , and what Apple calls ' fast app switching ' - essentially it keeps all the data about where you were in the app so it can easily jump back to it .
These features will appear this summer on the iPhone 3GS and iPod touch 3 G ( that 's the one from late last year ) .
Bad news is that iPhone 3 G and iPod Touch 2 G devices will not support multi - tasking .
The iPad , meanwhile , will get OS 4 in the autumn .
Oh and Jobs said Apple has sold 450,000 of them so far and stil intends to be in international markets "" later in April "" .
The team at CCS Insight summed up iPhone OS 4 in their customary succinct manner : Apple previews iPhone 4 software shipping mid - year .
States 450k iPads sold to date .
7 key areas : multitasking , folders ( multiple apps on one icon ) , enhanced email ( unified inbox ) , iBooks , enterprise features , social games platform and iAd .
Analysis : iAd platform ( 60/40 share ) will be cornerstone to continued iPhone success monetising free apps and furthering developer appeal .
Offers Apple lead over Google in mobile advertising .
iPhone 's dominant position in mobile games extended with social elements .
Multitasking limited to key use cases but a step forward ."
2010-04-19,"Engadget seems to have acquired a prototype version of a fourth - generation iPhone – possibly lost by an Apple employee who was using it "" in the wild "" , as the site says that "" apparently the phone was found on the floor of a San Jose bar inside of an iPhone 3 G case "" .
The updated phone is expected to be launched in June , and according to the specifications , the "" iPhone 4 G "" ( as it is being called ) has 80 GB of storage , a front - facing camera , and looks exactly like a Twitpic posted in February ( though possibly it 's been removed by now if the phone was lost by an Apple employee – who , if Steve Jobs finds out about this , can surely look forward to an interesting future in the foundations of some new building ) .
Update : whoever found the iPhone ( which is not Engadget or , see below , Gizmodo ) is required by law to tell the California police .
Will they , we wonder ?
The phone at first booted up into a "" new "" iPhone OS ( probably the iPhone OS4 that was announced last week ) but has since stopped booting – which would indicate that Apple has remotely disabled it .
Some suggestions that it was a Japanese counterfeit have been discounted after images posted in Japan turned out to be faked .
Engadget said yesterday : "" Additionally , a source – who confirms this is the next Apple iPhone – also tells us that the device apparently does have a higher res screen on - board , a front - facing camera , a higher resolution camera with flash , and takes MicroSIM cards
( that 's the little ' button ' around the side you see in the Twitpic which is floating around the internet ) . ""
Update : Gizmodo , the sworn deadly enemy ( something like that ) of Engadget , has upped the stakes , posting a video which it says is the new phone .
( We ca n't show the video here as it 's non - embeddable . )
And it says that it can specify what 's
new : • Front - facing video chat camera •
Improved regular back - camera ( the lens is quite noticeably larger than the iPhone 3GS ) •
Camera flash •
Micro - SIM instead of standard SIM ( like the iPad ) • Improved display .
It 's unclear if it 's the 960x460 display thrown around before –
it certainly looks like it , with the "" Connect to iTunes "" screen displaying much higher resolution than on a 3GS .
•
What looks to be a secondary mic for noise cancellation , at the top , next to the headphone jack • Split buttons for volume • Power , mute , and volume buttons are all metallic The back casing is n't rounded either
- it 's flat .
Hard to tell from the video if it 's really ceramic .. which it might be .
Because what has intrigued people is that the back of the prototype iPhone 4 G seems to have an unusual enclosure .
John Gruber of Daring Fireball also points to a patent that Apple was awarded in 2006 for a "" handheld computing device [ that ] includes an enclosure having structural walls formed from a ceramic material that is radio - transparent "" .
Gruber says that this answers two questions he 's had about the iPhone 4 G leaks . ""
Multiple sources familiar with the next iPhone have confirmed to me that the back is made out of some sort of fancy glass , "" he writes . ""
Now , the thing I 've been curious about ever since hearing about this ' glass ' back is durability .
Everyone knows that dropping your iPhone is like dropping a piece of buttered toast –
there 's a good side and a bad side it can land on .
Put a glass back on these things and , in terms of drop survivability , it 'd be like a piece of toast with butter on both sides , as it were . ""
Ceramics , though , could be glass - like – transparent , yet also tough .
( Or , of course , potentially fragile ; that mug you dropped on the kitchen floor is ceramic . )
The key thing about radio - transparent enclosures being that you 'll get better phone reception with them – or that you can use lower power systems and get the same quality of phone reception .
The use of ceramics is ingenious : the problem with metal casings for phones is that they shield the aerials from the signal ( in a Faraday cage effect ) .
If you can replace that with something that 's both radio - transparent and comparably tough as metal , you 're onto a winner .
According to the patent , the enclosure would be a "" tube - like main body that is extruded in its entirety with the ceramic material "" .
That sounds like quite a manufacturing / engineering feat ; I ca n't think of any ceramics that have been widely used for consumer electronics – and certainly none that are presently used for .
In case you 're thinking "" Bakelite ! ""
, that 's a plastic .
Have I missed a few ?
Apple says in the patent that : "" It should be noted that ceramics have been used in a wide variety of products including electronic devices such as watches , phones , and medical instruments .
In all of these cases , however , the ceramic material have not been used as structural components .
In most of these cases they have been used as cosmetic accoutrements .
It is believed up till now ceramic materials have never been used as a structural element including structural frames , walls or main body of a consumer electronic device , and more particularly an enclosure of a portable electronic device such as a media player or cell phone . ""
The Apple patent is intriguingly broad : it allows for the structure to be used for a mobile phone , media player , handheld computing device , and offers both zirconia and alumina as the ceramic bases .
But why use ceramics rather than cheaper and more easily malleable plastics ?
Apple , after all , has plenty of experience with those ( it pioneered a particular translucent material for the first iMac ) .
The company answers that in item 0018 of the patent filing : "" The lighter enclosures , which typically use thinner plastic structures and fewer fasteners , tend to be more flexible and therefore they have a greater propensity to buckle and bow when used while the stronger and more rigid enclosures , which typically use thicker plastic structures and more fasteners , tend to be thicker and carry more weight .
Unfortunately , increased weight may lead to user dissatisfaction , and bowing may damage the internal parts of the portable computing devices . ""
Besides which the mechanical assemblies mean you get seams , cracks and fastenings – things that Apple finds unacceptable .
( That 's not in the patent .
Just implied . )
And Apple already has its eyes on particular implementations : it suggests that the ceramic enclosure could be applied to future iPod Nanos or its smallest iPod , the Shuffle , or its remote controls .
And they could come in lots of colours : Apple helpfully explains how you make a ceramic for manufacturing ( though of course it 's obliged to , because it wants the patent ) : "" Zirconia may be embodied in a variety of colors including white , black , navy blue , ivory , brown , dark blue , light blue , platinum , gold ( among others ) .
The colors may for example be created by adding doping materials to the ceramic material .
Other materials may also be added including Yttrium , which helps keep the crystalline structure intact across all temperatures especially for maintaining strength as the part cools down .
"" It 's an excursion into the rare earth metals : you 'll be seeing zirconium , yttrium , hafnium , chromium , and possibly others .
Quite aside from the iPhone 4 G details – which look predictable enough , in that you 'd expect a phone with a better camera and so on – the use of ceramics could make a dramatic change to materials .
The original iMac drove a swathe of engineering companies to retool to produce translucent plastics with that "" iMac look "" ; but ceramics hold out a lot more promise ."

Some rights reserved Steve Jobs has defended Apple 's decision not to allow Adobe 's Flash technology on the iPhone , iPod and iPad - and cited a series of reasons why he thinks letting Flash onto mobile devices is a bad idea , including security , battery life and user experience .
[ Update : Adobe 's CEO has responded in an interview with the Wall Street Journal .
Read my take here . ]
In what could best be described as a blogpost on Apple 's site , Jobs says that there are six key problems with Flash - and that the most important reason is that "" letting a third party layer of software come between the platform and the developer ultimately results in sub - standard apps and hinders the enhancement and progress of the platform . ""
Jobs hits out at Adobe 's claims that Flash is "" open "" because 75 % of video on the web is viewed using it . ""
Adobe 's Flash products are 100 % proprietary , "" he responds .
"" They are only available from Adobe , and Adobe has sole authority as to their future enhancement , pricing , etc .
While Adobe 's Flash products are widely available , this does not mean they are open , since they are controlled entirely by Adobe and available only from Adobe .
By almost any definition , Flash is a closed system . ""
He contrasts that with open web standards that Apple has adopted - HTML5 , CSS ( Cascading Style Sheets , used to format sites ) and the programming language Javascript . ""
Apple even creates open standards for the web "" , he says , citing WebKit - the open - source browser code that Apple adopted to create its Safari browser , which is now used by a number of companies including Google .
He rebuffs claims by Adobe that Flash offers "" the full web "" : "" Adobe has repeatedly said that Apple mobile devices can not access "" the full web "" because 75 % of video on the web is in Flash .
What they do n't say is that almost all this video is also available in a more modern format , H.264 , and viewable on iPhones , iPods and iPads .
YouTube , with an estimated 40 % of the web 's video , shines in an app bundled on all Apple mobile devices , with the iPad offering perhaps the best YouTube discovery and viewing experience ever .
Add to this video from Vimeo , Netflix , Facebook , ABC , CBS , CNN , MSNBC , Fox News , ESPN , NPR , Time , The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal , Sports Illustrated , People , National Geographic , and many , many others .
iPhone , iPod and iPad users are n't missing much video .
"" He then takes shots at reliability , security and performance - pointing out that Flash has a bad security record , noting that "" we know that Flash is the number one reason Macs crash "" and that "" we do n't want to reduce the reliability and security of our iPhones , iPods and iPads by adding Flash "" , and putting salt in the wound by saying "" We have routinely asked Adobe to show us Flash performing well on a mobile device "" - pointing to continued delays in its implementation .
"" We think it will eventually ship , but we 're glad we did n't hold our breath , "" Jobs says .
He slams its effect on battery life - "" the video on almost all Flash websites currently requires an older generation decoder that is not implemented in mobile chips and must be run in software "" - and on touch - based devices : "" Flash was designed for PCs using mice , not touch screens using fingers ...
Most Flash websites need to be rewritten to support touch - based devices .
If developers need to rewrite their Flash websites , why not use modern technologies like HTML5 , CSS and JavaScript ? ""
But the most important reason is that Flash comprises a layer of abstraction between the programs and the platform , Jobs says , adding that "" we know from painful experience "" that that leads to sub - standard applications .
The conclusion : Jobs is calling Adobe 's bluff about Flash running on mobile devices - and although Apple is making some efforts to work with Adobe on letting Flash run more efficiently on Mac OSX ( such as the newly - released alpha of a hardware - accelerated Flash decoder ) , Apple is clear about the compromises that Flash would impose - and its unwillingness to bend to them .
Adobe has already abandoned plans to let developers create cross - platform apps compiled in its Creative Suite 5 application to run on Flash and also on the iPhone : Apple effectively outlawed any such apps with its revision to the iPhone developer licence just ahead of CS5 's release .
But by pointing to the continued delays in the release of a fully - featured version of Flash on mobile devices , Jobs - and Apple - also point to the problem Adobe faces : that HTML5 and H.264 may be adopted more quickly than it expected .
The purchase of Palm by HP - which looks likely to implement Palm 's webOS in tablet - style devices - will heighten that .
Although Adobe announced in February 2009 that it would develop a version of Flash Player for webOS , it announced a delay in April 2009 .
There was n't much evidence of it by February 2010 , when it announced it again .
Yet at the time Adobe said "" By 2012 , it expects nearly 53 percent of phones to be shipping with Flash Player 10.1 and that roughly 250 million devices will be supporting it at that time . ""
But 2012 suddenly looks a long way off .
It 's nearly the middle of 2010 , and if you want to play Flash on your Symbian smartphone ( which dominates the smartphone sector in numbers , if not access to websites ) then you have to download a special app .
Not that many people do .
you 'll have Flash Lite - but that 's only a subsection of Flash playing ( see the differences via the FAQ ) .
How about on a BlackBerry ?
Adobe said in April 2010 that it will have support for those "" in the second half of 2010 "" .
That 's the two big ones .
How about the third one , Apple ?
Oh , no .
Well , what about Android ?
Well - that 's promised too .
But Android uses WebKit , and that 's HTML5 , and while Google might like a lot of things , and has even appeared to array itself with Adobe against Apple - why , Android 2.2 is going to support Flash , Andy Rubin of Google told the New York Times - we have to say that we 've heard that one before .
Specifically , April 2009 , when we were confidently told that Adobe Flash Player 10 For Android Due in October .
That was Adobe 's chief executive in an earnings call .
So Adobe has done : promise , promise , promise but not deliver , deliver , deliver when it comes to Flash Player for the mobile .
Reality check :
Apple is one of the biggest sources of mobile internet traffic to most sites that serve video .
If your video site sticks with Flash and your rival 's serves H.264 , guess which one they 'll go to ?
And if the folks at Google Android see that lots of sites are adopting H.264 , will they really fuss about getting Flash playback on their devices ?
You can guess not .
Flash on mobile ?
It 's dead already .
It just has n't been told .
Steve Jobs just sent it the letter . ""
Perhaps Adobe should focus more on creating great HTML5 tools for the future , and less on criticizing Apple for leaving the past behind , "" Jobs concludes .
Put that on Flash 's gravestone .

Some rights reserved The chief executive of Adobe , Shantanu Narayen , has hit back at Apple 's Steve Jobs and the article from earlier today in which Jobs dismissed Adobe 's Flash as belonging to the past , not the future .
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal , Narayen calls Jobs 's article an "" extraordinary attack "" .
A few highlights [ with comments ] -Mr .
Narayan talks about Adobe "" certainly "" shipping on Android 's latest version .
[ CA : is that a full version of Flash Player ?
Or Flash Lite ?
And when ? ]
-The
technology problems [ with Flash ] that Mr. Jobs mentions in his essay are "" really a smokescreen , "" Mr. Narayan says .
He says more than 100 applications that used Adobe 's software were accepted in the App Store .
[ CA : 100 applications that used Flash might have gotten onto the store - but Apple has since decided that it does n't want Flash - written apps .
That 's history now . ]
-Speaking about Mr. Jobs 's assertion that Adobe is the No . 1 cause of Mac crashes , Mr. Narayan says if Adobe crashes Apple , that actually has something "" to do with the Apple operating system . ""
[ CA : probably right .
However , who writes and compiles the version of Flash that runs on Mac OSX ?
PDF plugins do n't crash . ]
-Mr .
Narayan calls accusations about Flash draining battery power "" patently false . ""
[ CA : Mac users are invited to comment . ]
-The Journal wants to know whether Mr. Narayan knows Steve Jobs .
"" I 've met him on a number of occasions , "" he says .
"" We have different views of the world , "" Mr. Narayan says .
"" [ Adobe 's ] view of the world is multi - platform . ""
-Does
Mr. Narayan use an iPhone ?
"" I have a Google Nexus One device , "" he says .
And what about the iPad ?
"" I think it 's a good first - generation device .
I think you 're going to see just tremendous innovation in terms of tablets . ""
Adobe is , in fact , working with "" dozens "" of tablet projects with other companies , he says .
[ CA : we would love to know what those tablet projects are , and who the companies are . ]
Closing comments : Adobe 's rebuttal is n't as detailed as one might have hoped for .
The real question remains : if Apple is n't backing Flash on mobile , then who is ?
There 's lots of talk from Adobe about mobile platforms that are going to support full Flash playback ( rather than Flash Player Lite ) - but little sign of it .
And Adobe does have form in the talking big , delivering small area .
Here 's a Bloomberg piece from January 2009 : "" It 's a hard technical challenge , and that 's part of the reason Apple and Adobe are collaborating , "" [ Adobe chief executive ] Narayen said today in a Bloomberg Television interview from the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland . ""
The ball is in our court .
The onus is on us to deliver . ""
That 's some collaboration .

2010-05-14,"The Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal were both carrying full - page "" We Love Apple "" adverts on Friday morning , but the space was not bought by the Californian technology giant but by Adobe , the web technology firm that is locked in a bitter dispute with Steve Jobs .
The adverts , using a variant of the famous "" I love New York "" motif created by Milton Glaser , have appeared in newspapers including the Wall Street Journal and San Jose Mercury and online on websites including Wired and TechCrunch .
They present the latest front in an increasingly nasty war between the two companies .
Adobe 's web video technology
Flash is not supported by Apple 's iPad or iPhone and Jobs has publicly criticised it for causing battery problems and crashes .
In a blogpost last month , Jobs said the most important reason for keeping Flash off his devices was that "" letting a third party layer of software come between the platform and the developer ultimately results in sub - standard apps and hinders the enhancement and progress of the platform . ""
He contrasted Flash , over which Adobe has control , with open web standards that Apple has adopted - HTML5 , CSS ( Cascading Style Sheets , used to format sites ) and the programming language Javascript .
Today 's adverts follow the large "" We love Apple "" with a pointed list of 13 other things that the company loves : "" We love creativity .
We love innovation .
We love apps .
We love the web .
We love Flash .
We love our 3 million developers .
We love healthy competition .
We love touch screens .
We love our Open Screen Project partners .
We love HTML5 .
We love authoring code only once .
We love all devices .
We love all platforms .
"" What we do n't love is anybody taking away your freedom to choose what you create , how you create it , and what you experience on the web . ""
The adverts appear to have been prompted by Apple 's decision last month to change its iPhone Developer Program License Agreement so that all developers have to write applications for the iPhone and iPod – and by inference iPad – so that they run directly on the device , a move that effectively bans software translation solutions like Adobe 's CS5 .
Adobe 's founders , Chuck Geschke and John Warnock , have posted an open letter on the company 's website – to which the online version of the "" We love Apple "" advert links – arguing that "" freedom of choice on the web has unleashed an explosion of content and transformed how we work , learn , communicate , and , ultimately , express ourselves "" .
They warn that Apple is trying to control the world wide web , something which would damage its evolution .
"" We believe that Apple , by taking the opposite approach , has taken a step that could undermine this next chapter of the web — the chapter in which mobile devices outnumber computers , any individual can be a publisher , and content is accessed anywhere and at any time . ""
Apple responded : "" Yes , we believe in open web standards too , like HTML5 .
Flash is not an open web standard like HTML .
It is a proprietary Adobe product .
Just ask the W3 consortium that controls web standards – they have chosen HTML5 as the open web standard to move forward with . ""
Alan Rusbridger , the editor of the Guardian , complained that the lack of Flash on Apple products - which means no video content is accessible of websites including theguardian.com and the BBC - was an "" extreme irritant at the very least "" in a review of the iPad in the Observer last month ."

Some rights reserved Want to know Steve Jobs 's thoughts on the role of the iPad , Flash , porn ( yes , that word ) , and what Bob Dylan would think of Apple , the company , today ?
Look no further than Ryan Tate 's email back - and - forth with him - which shows that the chief of Apple is , if nothing else , not unwilling to indulge in some email sparring with completely random strangers .
Though Ryan Tate of Gawker ( for it was he ) is more than just random ; he 's also employed by Gawker Media , which owns Gizmodo , which Apple does n't like because ..
oh , just read about it .

[ We think he means viruses and malware . ]
Freedom from programs that trash your battery .
[ We think he means Adobe 's Fl*sh . ]
Freedom from porn .
[ We think he means .. er , porn . ]
Yep , freedom .
The times they are a changin ' [ for younger readers : this is a Bob Dylan reference ; Dylan is one of Jobs 's favourite musicians ] , and some traditional PC folks feel like their world is slipping away .
It is . ""
There follow an argument about Flash , batteries , Objective - C , porn ( "" you might care more [ about not having it ] when you have kids "" , remarks Jobs ) , whether Apple has a private police force that kicked in a Gawker person 's doors ( "" You are so misinformed , "" Jobs retorts .
"" No one kicked in any doors .
You 're believing a lot of erroneous blogger reports "" ) .
Jobs concludes : "" Microsoft had ( has ) every right to enforce whatever rules for their platform that they want .
If people do n't like it , they can write for another platform , which some did .
Or they can buy another platform , which some did . ""
As for us , we 're just doing what we can to try and make ( and preserve ) the user experience we envision .

Plus the not - sleeping thing - most of the emails were sent after midnight California time .
Hell , next you know he 'll be turning up on Twitter .

Meanwhile , if you want to email Jobs , his email is hardly a secret .
( Finding it is your initiative test . )
If you get an answer , do share .
But think of a useful question first .."
2010-05-20,"Google 's announcement that it is making the VP8 video codec available for free as an open source product has not won the approval of Steve Jobs - who has pointed to a blog post by an H.264 developer which says that the codec is "" significantly weaker "" for compression and decoding than H.264 , which Apple backs and uses for HTML5 video .
In an email apparently sent at 4.30am California time to a reader of The Register technology news site , Jobs simply points to the post at http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/?p=377 in response to the question "" Hey Steve - What did you make of the recent VP8 announcement ? "" from Kris Bloe , a software developer from Leeds .
( Note that this conforms to what is becoming the template for getting an answer from Jobs - contains no links , asks straightforward questions , is a bit open - ended . )
Google announced that it was making VP8 open source only on Wednesday - but it has led to fevered reactions since .
Adobe is delighted , as it can use Flash within VP8 .
Others have said that the "" specification "" barely exists : the post that Jobs points to says , in part : "" The spec consists largely of C code copy - pasted from the VP8 source code — up to and including TODOs , "" optimizations "" , and even C - specific hacks , such as workarounds for the undefined behavior of signed right shift on negative numbers .
In many places it is simply outright opaque .
Copy - pasted C code is not a spec . ""
Yet Google has already starting putting YouTube videos into this spec , making it part of a larger web media project it calls WebM , which will be built into its Chrome browser - and which will be taken up by Mozilla 's Firefox ( which so far has been sticking to Ogg Theora , because it had no patents , but has now admitted that that lagged in quality ) .
Internet Explorer 9 will let people install VP8 if they want - but its native support will be for H.264 .
The key questions then become : will VP8 come in for scrutiny from patent attornies ?
The answer there is "" quite certainly "" -
even if not Apple 's or Microsoft 's , there are sure to be people out there who will scour the code in the hope of finding an infringement and hence a payday .
The blogpost Jobs points to comes from the open source X.264 project , which aims to build a free encoding system for H.264 video .
There are already open source decoders for it - notably FFmpeg .
So Jobs does n't think that VP8 is as good as H.264 - and what Jobs thinks tends to reflect what Apple 's engineers think , as they will be driving information to him ( Apple is a very meetings - intensive company ) .
That , plus the fact that the patent trolls investigators will be delightedly printing out the code for VP8 to see whether they can find something it infringes , means that video on the web breaks down to a few choices : Adobe 's Flash ( owned by Adobe ) ; H.264 ( patented like mad ) ; VP8 ( open source but at some risk of patent threats ) .
Meanwhile , if any of you have had email exchanges with Steve Jobs ( his email is in the wild by now ) , do let us know .
Remember : simple , but deep , questions do best ."
2010-05-25,"Having survived liver cancer and being fired by Apple , not to mention negotiations with some of the planet 's toughest business brains , Steve Jobs is hardly shy of a battle – and his latest target is pornography .
He wants to keep it off Apple products .
Given the proliferation of porn on the web , this might seem Canute - ish – and profit - sapping .
Yet so insistent is Apple , many magazine publishers developing "" apps "" for the new iPad , which launches in the UK on Friday , have had to self - censor .
In the offices of the lifestyle magazine Dazed and Confused , the iPad version is mockingly known as "" the Iranian version "" , because of the amount of censorship required to get it approved for Apple 's App Store .
Germany 's Stern magazine saw its app pulled because it runs topless photo spreads , while the newspaper Bild has added bikinis to its topless models .
Jobs has made his thoughts on the topic very clear twice this year .
In April , he told a press conference : "" You know , there 's a porn store for Android [ phones using Google 's software ] .
You can download porn , your kids can download porn .
That 's a place we do n't want to go –
so we 're not going to go there .
"" In an email exchange with Ryan Tate , a writer for the Gawker website , Jobs set out his stall very clearly .
Tate , annoyed by an iPad advert calling it a "" revolution "" , challenged Jobs : "" If [ Bob ] Dylan [ one of Jobs 's childhood heroes ] was 20 today , how would he feel about your company ? . . .
Revolutions are about freedom , "" Tate wrote .
Jobs , an archetypal Democrat , replied in a tone that sounded as though he was channelling George W Bush : "" Yep , freedom from programs that steal your private data .
Freedom from programs that trash your battery .
Freedom from porn .
Yep , freedom .
"" It is not only porn that seems to trouble Apple .
In the last few months , it has banned an app with political cartoons ( by a Pulitzer - winning cartoonist – though it quickly relented ) , and a gay travel guide to New York ( too much skin , and an unflattering caricature of Sarah Palin ) .
Apple points to section 3.3.17 of its developer agreement : "" Materials . . .
that in Apple 's reasonable judgment may be found objectionable ; [ eg ] materials that may be considered obscene , pornographic or defamatory . ""
But the closer you look , the more this looks like the "" freedom "" found in Lord Farquaad 's kingdom of Duloc in the film Shrek – a carefully maintained facade which , given that the iPad includes a web browser , can not help but let the monster of porn and donkey of defamation clatter in , no matter how hard you try to keep them out .
It is not clear where this thread of Puritanism comes from within Apple .
Jobs is famed for sweary tirades at staff which would leave Malcolm Tucker bug - eyed .
He is a Buddhist , but most of all a capitalist .
The only clue is in another email sent to Tate , who threw down the challenge : "" I do n't want ' freedom from porn ' .
Porn is just fine !
And I think my wife would agree .
"" Even though it was past 1.30am , Jobs shot back within minutes : "" You might care more about porn when you have kids . . .
"" Is that the clue ?
In his current marriage – now in its 19th year – Jobs , 55 , has three children ( plus a grown - up child from a previous liaison ) .
Yet it seems unlikely he would manipulate the entire content strategy of a $ 240bn corporation simply to ease his home life .
More likely is that Apple is setting itself – as in so many ways – at an opposite pole to Google , which as a search engine can always be accused of being a gateway to pornography and objectionable content .
By contrast , Apple controls exactly what appears on its App Store ; to make that match the clean lines of its products and adverts , it needs to enforce a "" clean "" approach to content .
There has been collateral damage , though : last year , Apple initially turned down Eucalyptus , an app written by the British developer Jamie Montgomerie , because it provided access to out - of - copyright books via the net – including the Kama Sutra .
After an outcry , Apple backed down and approved the app .
But it was a strange collision of sensibilities .
Montgomerie thinks Apple is perfectly within its rights to decide what it lets through – but also that the fault line will grow . ""
Would an app of images of famous classical art nudes be acceptable ?
Will the big names be treated more leniently than the smaller ones ?
There was at least an outward appearance of a double standard involving Playboy and Sports Illustrated in the iPhone App Store when Apple 's rules were tightened earlier in the year . ""
Phil Schiller , Apple 's vice - president of marketing , made the rather weak claim earlier this year that the reason they were allowed – and others were banned – was that they came from "" a well - known company with previously published material available broadly in a well - accepted format "" .
Which begs the question : how well - known do you have to be , exactly , for Apple to decide your content is OK ?
To that , there is n't an answer .
But Jobs might email one soon ."

2010-05-26,"In January 2000 , Steve Ballmer took over as head of Microsoft .
It was a company that bestrode the technology world , with a market capitalisation of $ 556bn compared with its one - time deadly rival in personal computers , Apple , whose returning chief executive Steve Jobs was gradually nursing it back to health .
Even so , Apple was a minnow : its market value was just $ 15.6bn .
But today at 4 pm New York time , the final step in the transformation was complete as Apple 's market cap of $ 222.1bn ( £ 155bn ) , and rising , passed Microsoft 's $ 219.2bn , which has been on a slow downward path for months .
Taking debt into account , Apple 's business had already passed Microsoft 's in value .
That trend looks like continuing .
This week sees the launch in Britain and eight other countries of Apple 's iPad tablet computer , a format that Microsoft co - founder Bill Gates touted in 2001 but could never persuade manufacturers to make , or customers to buy .
By contrast Apple has already become the biggest tablet computer company in the world since the iPad 's launch in the US on 3 April .
Next month Jobs will unveil the next generation of iPhone – the device that Ballmer dismissed back at its launch in 2007 as having "" no chance "" .
Since then sales of the iPhone have rocketed ; it has become the gateway to the mobile internet and led to an explosion in downloadable mobile "" apps "" .
Digital music David Yoffie , a Harvard Business School professor , told the Wall Street Journal that Microsoft has suffered in comparison with Apple because the consumer market , Apple 's focus , has outpaced the growth of spending on technology by businesses , Microsoft 's traditional area of strength . ""
Apple has had the wind at its back , "" said Yoffie .
"" Microsoft is playing catch - up . ""
But as well as the astonishing success of Apple 's products , Microsoft 's downfall has been caused by Google .
In Ballmer 's 10 years , Google has gone from a loss - making startup to a huge company that dominates the online search industry .
In January 2000 , Google was just a search engine and did not have an advertising platform .
Its AdWords product was n't launched until October .
AdSense , which lets publishers use Google to sell ad space on their sites and is the real money - spinner , only appeared in 2003 .
On Ballmer 's watch , Google has gone from almost nothing to an open wound in Microsoft 's profit stream .
It is a substantial wound , too .
Microsoft 's online services division – encompassing search , Hotmail and its "" Live "" services – last made a profit at the end of 2005 ; since then it has lost almost $ 5bn .
Google has been sucking up all the advertising revenue , and profit , from that sector .
The division made a loss of $ 713 m in its latest quarterly results published in April , up from $ 411 m a year ago .
Former Wall Street analyst Henry Blodget , now head of the Businessinsider.com site , was withering : "" If this business [ online ] were n't hidden within the belly of a monstrous cash - generation engine , Windows and Office , shareholders would have long since revolted and shut it down . ""
Microsoft still makes more profit than Apple or Google , but the question is , can it make profits from anything other than its Windows operating system and Office software suite ?
They still bring in the vast majority of those profits .
Microsoft has other , internal , problems .
This week it announced a radical shake - up in the entertainment and devices ( E&amp;D ) division which makes its Xbox 360 games console , Windows Mobile Phones and Zune music player .
E&amp;D has been another frustration .
First there is Microsoft 's failure to catch the iPod , launched in 2001 , whose success allowed Apple to dominate the market for digital music players and then make a grab for the online music market with the launch of iTunes in 2003 .
Its grip is so tight that the US justice department has recently been interviewing music labels and internet music companies with a view to possibly launching a competition inquiry .
Second , there were problems with Microsoft 's Xbox 360 ; manufacturing flaws meant a $ 1bn writedown and thousands of frustrated customers , as machines overheated and had to be swapped .
The reorganisation of E&amp;D is expected to refocus on Windows Mobile , which has been hurt again by HP 's decision to abandon Windows for its forthcoming tablet computer after buying ailing US smartphone company Palm .
Tablet computers have also started to appear that use Google 's rival Android operating system .
Next month , mobile phone company O2 will start selling the Dell Streak , which runs Android , in the UK .
Niche player Matt Rosoff , of Directions on Microsoft , a private firm devoted to tracking the US company , said the shake - up at E&amp;D looked like Ballmer was "" taking tighter reins over Microsoft 's mobile strategy "" .
He added : "" You see press reports where it is Google v Apple , and Microsoft is n't even considered a player .
It has got to be frustrating for them . ""
In stark contrast , Apple 's stock is expected to keep growing , especially with the iPad launch and then the release of the so - called iPhone 4G.
The release of the latest version of Apple 's phone will also present the Cupertino - based company with the same dilemma it had in the home computer market : whether to remain a fashionable , but lucrative , niche player or go mass - market .
After a shaky start , Google 's Android platform has become a real challenger as more handset manufacturers embrace it and create cheaper devices .
When the iPhone appeared , Ballmer argued it would never be anything other than a niche player .
And he could yet be right ; but Microsoft has done no better .
Sales of its Windows Mobile software for phones have slumped in the past three years , and the platform has been rapidly overtaken first by the iPhone and then by Android , which is given away free to handset manufacturers .
For Microsoft , which depends on paid licences for its software , Android presents an even bigger potential problem than the iPhone .
HTC , formerly Microsoft 's biggest customer for Windows Mobile , is now one of the biggest for Android .
In February , Dan Frommer , of Business Insider , called the idea that Microsoft could charge for Windows Mobile "" joke of the week "" .
"" Microsoft is dead in the water in this business .
If it wants to get moving again , it needs to do everything it can to help itself .
And in mobile software , that means competing for ' free ' with ' free ' .
"" Whether Ballmer will have the stomach to do that is not clear .
But without a winning mobile or search strategy , the market is clearly continuing to write Microsoft down .
If Ballmer can not turn it around , shareholders may finally grow restless ."
2010-05-27,"As the iPad goes on sale in the UK I wanted to write a quick note to update you on the success our Guardian EyeWitness app has generated Stateside over the past few weeks .
After being showcased during the OS4 announcement by none other than Apple CEO Steve Jobs himself , who took a step back onstage to admire it and described it as "" cool "" and "" really nice "" , our app has since been downloaded nearly 90,000 times .
To put that into perspective , it means that around one in every 10 people who bought an iPad now has Eyewitness on their device .
In April , the app also generated 7.5 m page views ( more than our Guardian iPhone app ) so we 're pretty happy with the results .
The user feedback has , likewise , been hugely positive , with comments ranging around the "" pretty slick "" and "" absolutely breathtaking "" level .
Please do rate us and let us know what you think .
I can promise you we do try and read every single one !
The app was conceived to showcase our amazing Eyewitness photography series and , to coincide with the UK iPad launch , we 've asked one of our superb photographers , David Levene , to record his thoughts .
If you 'd like to know more about the app , then please read my earlier blogpost here .
Do let me know your thoughts , whether direct feedback on the app itself or some thoughts as to how you 'd like us to develop and enhance it .

2010-06-01,"Steve Jobs is building up quite a reputation for one - to - one customer support via the medium of email .
This morning he replied to UK developer Mark Ford confirming that iPhone OS 4.0 will include the ability to change font size in SMS - a detail for most , but essential for those with impaired vision .
There has been a steady trickle of these emails from the Apple chief , recently confirming the iPad would not support tethering , why an app was rejected because of its name and a rather snappy comment about a water - damaged MacBook Pro .
There are even a few blogs dedicated to Jobs ' emails , so Ford can now add to those . ""
Well , "" said Ford , "" I did try to get hold of @cliveflint earlier ( I know he 's got iPhone OS 4 )
then thought screw it , I 'll ask Steve . ""
The email in full : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Hi Steve , my wife has very bad eye sight ( she is registered blind ) .
She 's not completely in the dark but she struggles with small text .
She can with most of the text on an iPhone , but not the text in the SMS text bubble .
As far as I know there 's no way to change the font size of the SMS message , although you can change it for email .
I know she could use voiceover , but she thinks it would be embarrassing to have her messages read to her , she tried the zoom function but could n't get on with it on the phone
( it works fine on the iMac ) .
This is the one thing stopping he buying an iPhone , is it likely that future versions of the iPhone OS will allow the text size for SMS to be increased ?

2010-06-02,"There are few companies so tied to the personality of its chief executive as Apple is to Steve Jobs .
He makes few public appearances , bar those evangelical product launches , but even by the super - slick standards of Apple 's marketing regime the opening interview at the D8 conference yesterday was extremely well - timed coming , as it did , six days after Apple 's market value drifted past Microsoft to hit £ 222.1bn .
Here 's a summary of the main points , as diligently noted by AllThingsD 's John Paczkowski : On the battle with Adobe Jobs said Apple has to back the right technological horse , and has made previously gambles by ditching the floppy disk and adopting USB .
"" We did n't set out to have a war over Flash , "" he said .
"" We made a technical decision .
And it was n't until the iPad that Adobe raised a stink ...
Flash has had its day . ""
He wrote the Thoughts on Flash piece because he was tired of Adobe trashing Apple in the press .
What if consumers demand Flash ? asked Walt Mossberg .
"" We 're just trying to make great products .
We do n't think Flash makes a great product , so we 're leaving it out . ""
He said consumers simply would n't buy Apple products if they did n't like them , and that the iPad is currently selling three every second .
Video
The Gizmodo ' lost ' iPhone 4.0 Recounting the story ,
Jobs confirmed that an employee was testing a wireless product .
"" There 's a debate about whether it was left in a bar or stolen ... and the person who found it decided to sell it … and it turned out this person plugged it into his roommate 's computer and that roommate called the police . ""
Video
The ' sweatshop ' factory in China Jobs said : "" Foxconn is not a sweatshop .
They 've got restaurants and swimming pools …
For a factory , it 's a pretty nice factory . ""
He acknowledged that 15 suicides at the plant is very troubling and said "" we send over our own people and some outside folks as well , to look into the issue "" .
On the battle with Google Is Apple now engaged in a platform war with Google ? ""
We never saw ourselves in a platform war with Microsoft ,
either …
Maybe that 's why we lost . ""
Mossberg pushed him on how the relationship with Google has changed because of mobile . ""
Well , they 're competing with us .
We did n't go into search .
They decided to compete with us and got more and more serious . ""
Does he feel betrayed ?
He cut off the questioning : "" My sex life is great - how 's yours ? ""
Apple is not moving into search , he emphasised .
The acquisition of Siri was about AI , not search .
And Apple will not be removing Google from the iPhone and iPad .
Video
But he did acknowledge Apple 's move into advertising with iAds , which he said was to try and improve a format that often takes the user outside the app .
"" People are using apps way more than they are using search , so if you want to make developers more money , you 've got to get the ads into apps . ""
Video iPad came before iPhone Jobs said any tablet that used a stylus "" is a failure "" - he wanted a tablet to be created from scratch using a glass touch screen , and that work happened before the idea of a phone .
"" It began with the tablet .
I had this idea about having a glass display , a multitouch display you could type on with your fingers .
I asked our people about it .
And six months later , they came back with this amazing display .
And I gave it to one of our really brilliant UI guys .
He got scrolling working and some other things , and I thought , ' my God , we can build a phone with this ! '
So we put the tablet aside , and we went to work on the iPhone . ""
Video
What the iPad means for publishing Jobs stuck up for professional publishers , saying some content providers had n't priced aggressively enough and that he did n't want "" to see us descend into a nation of bloggers "" .
"" We need editorial oversight now more than ever .
Anything we can do to help newspapers find new ways of expression that will help them get paid , I am all for . ""
The iPad will develop as a tool for content creation , he said , including video editing .
He admitted Apple "" sometimes makes mistakes "" when it comes to the app approval process , but said 95 % of apps are approved every week and dismissed some coverage of high - profile app rejections as people seeking their 15 minutes of fame .
Apple 's startup culture Apple has no committees and is structured like a startup , said Jobs .
"" I have one of the best jobs in the world .
I get to hang out with some of the most talented , committed people around and together we get to play in this sandbox and build these cool products ...
so what I do all day is meet with teams of people and work on ideas and new problems to come up with new products .
"" When asked if his staff will tell him when he 's wrong , he replied : "" Of course .
The best ideas have to win , no matter who has them . ""
•
Also in Apple news ... Apple is reported to be the subject of an investigation by the Texan Attorney General 's Office into pricing practices for ebooks , reports the Wall Street Journal , specifically with the April launch in the US of the iPad and related iBookstore .
The office has requested documents from HarperCollins , amongst others , as part of an investigation understood to be focused on Apple 's ' agency ' model now adopted by five of the six biggest publishing houses .
On the iBookstore , Apple effectively acts as agency by allowing publishers to set their own prices and take 70 % of that rate , while sellers receive the remaining 30 % ."
2010-06-05,"Steve Jobs will appear before the Apple faithful tomorrow to reveal the latest version of the Californian technology group 's mobile phone .
Nicknamed the iPhone "" 4 G "" – on the basis that the last one was the 3GS , with the "" S "" standing for speed – it will be the summer 's must - have gadget , hitting the UK this month .
But it is also seen as being in the vanguard of an all - out assault on the mobile market .
In the three years since it launched its first handset , Apple has grabbed the headlines and , more importantly , snatched a lucrative share of the more mature mobile phone markets of the US and Europe , where consumers are willing to pay upwards of £ 30 a month to get an iPhone .
Now , speculation is rising that the company is approaching a so - called "" iPod moment "" in mobiles : the point at which it will decide that it can capture a much larger slice of the market by producing more than one device .
The success of the App Store , which has seen iPhone users download billions of applications , coupled with the pressure to have a wide market to attract advertisers to its embryonic iAd platform , is pushing Apple towards diversifying , just as it did with the iPod six years ago when it introduced the iPod mini .
There is also increasing competition from Google 's Android platform .
After two and a half years , handset manufacturers are finally producing compelling Android phones – such as the HTC Desire – and more are slated for release this year , including the mass - market HTC Wildfire .
But rather than unveil a new , cheaper version of the iPhone , Apple is expected to position the iPhone 4 G at the top of the smartphone market and reorganise the existing range .
The company is likely to halt production of the iPhone 3 G – which can not cope with Apple 's new multi - tasking software – and scrap both existing versions of the iPhone 3GS , which have 16 GB and 32 GB of memory .
It will replace them with a new 8 GB version of the 3GS , which is expected to be aimed at the wider market .
The iPhone 4 G – according to mobile industry insiders who have seen one and confirmed widespread web leaks – will be available in two versions : 32 GB and 64 GB .
These will put "" clear blue water "" between it and the mass - market 3GS , as one industry executive puts it .
The 4 G is slightly smaller and slimmer than the current 3GS .
It has an improved 5-megapixel camera with flash and uses micro - sim cards , as seen in the iPad .
It also has a glass back , which greatly assists phone reception .
In the UK , it is expected to be sold by the same mobile phone networks that have the current iPhone : O2 , Orange and Vodafone .
It is unclear whether Tesco Mobile will have the 4 G when it is launched in the last week of this month .
The parallels between Apple 's current position in the mobile phone market and the place it held in the digital music market when it introduced the iPod mini are revealing .
The first iPod appeared in late 2001 , but it was not until 2003 that Apple launched the iTunes store .
One million tracks were sold in the first five days and 70 m in the first year .
That showed Apple there was a real mass market for digital music and was a spur for the creation of the first variant of the iPod line , the iPod mini , the following year .
At the time , Apple was lodged firmly in the high end of the market for digital music players .
The iPod was the benchmark by which all others were measured and Apple had a share of about 30 % .
The iPod mini – replaced at the end of 2005 by the Nano – was designed to grab a large part of the next third down .
In similar fashion , the iPhone has become the handset by which other mobiles are measured , and in markets including the UK it has made Apple the third - largest mobile phone manufacturer after Nokia and Samsung .
It is now a question of how much of the rest of the market – chock full of me - too touchscreen devices from the likes of Nokia , LG and Samsung – Apple wants .
"" I would argue that they may already have reached the tipping point , "" Ben Wood at CCS Insight – a long - time follower of the mobile market – says . ""
The iPhone has become a ubiquitous product in the markets where its pricing is acceptable . ""
He believes that a real driver behind Apple 's growth will be the iAd platform , which Jobs announced this year alongside the new version of the iPhone software – which is also in the iPad .
The new mobile advertising platform is designed to allow iPhone app developers to create in - app advertising .
Currently , anyone who clicks on an advert in a downloadable app is bounced out of it and on to the advertiser 's webpage .
As a result , many users are put off clicking on adverts .
In contrast , iAd will allow full - screen video and interactive advertising content to be served within an application .
Crucially , Apple will sell and serve the adverts , and developers will receive 60 % of their iAd revenue .
"" With iAd , which could be as significant to Apple as the iPod franchise itself , Apple has a tremendous opportunity .
It will provide a further chance to lock in their leading position in application development , "" Wood says .
"" If iAd becomes the kind of phenomenon that Apple appears to be able to create , and becomes as big as it could , then potentially Apple could really disrupt the market by subsidising the iPhone from their iAd revenues . ""
But whether iAd means that Apple needs to go all the way into the low end of the market is doubtful .
"" IPhone users are a segment of the population that has affinity with technology and disposable income , and that is a marketeer 's dream already , "" Wood says .
And Carolina Milanesi , research vice - president at rival analysts Gartner , is not convinced that this is the right time for Apple to go mass market , citing price constraints on the iPhone 's most important feature – its large touchscreen .
"" On the iPod touch and the iPhone , the screen is very important , "" she says .
"" Music is easier [ to do in a mass - market device ] because it is just [ data ] storage , and with the price of storage coming down you can experiment with design .
But when you have applications running on the device , how much dumber can your device become before it is useless ?
And that is where they are going to struggle .
What else do you cut ? ""
Apple could cut its own profits , but it has shown little desire to do that in the past : the switch from the 3 G to the 3GS actually reduced the manufacturing cost of the phone , analysts reckon .
"" Yes , of course , they can expand their addressable market so much quicker , but do they want that ? "" says Milanesi . ""
Just as Jobs says Apple does not want to be the Dell of the PC market , [ so ] Apple does not want to be the Nokia of the mobile market .
"" How true that is will be revealed tomorrow .
Focus on Apple 's factory
While Apple fans will drool over the new iPhone this week , tragic events in China have thrown a spotlight on the human cost of the west 's obsession with shiny toys .
A spate of suicides at the massive Chinese plant run by Taiwanese contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn has called into question working conditions at one of Apple 's largest suppliers .
The Californian company has dispatched a team of investigators to discover why 10 people have killed themselves so far this year .
Management at the Shenzhen facility , which stretches across three square kilometers and employs more than 250,000 people , are trying to solve the problem by hiring counsellors , playing soothing music on production lines , increasing wages and asking new recruits to sign a ' "" no - suicide "" contract .
They are also taking more direct action , installing netting around outdoor stairwells of the dormitory buildings , where workers sleep eight to a room .
Speaking last week , Steve Jobs said Apple was "" diligent "" when it came to understanding the working conditions in the supply chain , auditing its direct suppliers as well as tertiary suppliers .
"" We are over there trying to understand what is happening and more importantly trying to understand how we can help because it is a difficult situation , "" he told the D8 conference organised by All Things Digital .
He said many young workers came from poor rural areas and were away from home for the first time .
"" They are probably less prepared to leave home than your typical High School student going to college in this country .
I think there are some real issues there , "" he said .
But he stressed : "" Foxconn is not a sweatshop .
They have got restaurants and movie theatres and hospitals and swimming pools .
For a factory , it is a pretty nice factory .
"" Some of Foxconn 's workers disagree , complaining the monotonous workload causes depression .
"" I do the same thing every day , "" Xiao Qi , a college graduate who works at Foxconn in product development told Bloomberg Businessweek .
"" I have no future . """
2010-06-06,"Apple 's chief executive , Steve Jobs , is due to unveil the fourth version of the company 's hugely popular iPhone tomorrow – including a screen with up to four times more detail , a camera flash , noise cancellation and longer battery life .
The announcement is expected at the company 's Worldwide Developer Conference in San Francisco , which has drawn thousands of programmers keen to write programs – apps – for the device .
More than 51 m iPhones have been sold since its launch in June 2007 , and a number of developers have made thousands of pounds from selling apps through Apple 's App Store .
But for Jobs the unveiling will be something of an anticlimax – many details about the phone leaked out in mid - April after one of his staff lost a prototype in a bar near the company 's headquarters .
It was sold to gadget blog Gizmodo , where blogger Jason Chen took it apart and posted a video declaring : "" You are looking at Apple 's next iPhone . ""
Jobs prefers to keep details of upcoming products under wraps to heighten expectations .
But with more details known about the new iPhone than any previous model , some of that effect is likely to be diminished .
Yet Apple can revel in having passed Microsoft as the most valuable technology company , based on market capitalisation , and having sold 2 m of its iPad tablet computers worldwide since they went on sale in the US on 3 April – including a highly successful UK launch that saw a queue of over a thousand people outside Apple 's flagship store in Regent Street , London .
Gizmodo 's posting about the new iPhone has turned into a criminal investigation after the roommate of Brian Hogan – who walked out of a bar with the iPhone – contacted police , worried that the phone was stolen .
Hogan had sold the phone to Gizmodo for a reputed $ 5,000 , which had then contacted Apple to see if the phone was a genuine prototype .
Speaking at a conference last week , Jobs acknowledged that Apple had lost "" a wireless product "" and said it was unclear whether the phone was lost or stolen . ""
This is a story that 's got everything – theft , extortion , I 'm sure there 's sex in there somewhere – someone should make a movie of it , "" he said .
He added that some people had tried to tell him not to go after Gizmodo , but he had decided he could not let Apple 's "" core values "" slide – though he did not explain what values those were .
Jobs has recently become notable for personally replying to emails sent from members of the public .
He said that he enjoyed the experience : "" There 's nothing that makes my day more than getting a random email from some person in the UK that they just got an iPad and how it made their day .
That 's what keeps me going . """
2010-06-07,"Steve Jobs revealed the fourth version of Apple 's smartphone , the iPhone 4 , tonight and said the company was bringing its ebook application , iBooks , from the iPad tablet onto the iPhone .
In a move aimed at cornering the ebook market , Jobs unveiled the new version of the iPhone and showed off its display – which he said could show content so clearly it was virtually indistinguishable from text on paper .
That is a clear threat to Amazon 's ebook reader , Kindle , which has struggled to win approval from book publishers despite being launched years before the iPad , which only went on sale in April .
"" Five out of six publishers tell us that sales of their ebooks [ through Apple ] are at 22 % right now , "" Jobs told the company 's annual event focused on new technology in San Francisco .
While Amazon has declined to offer sales figures for the Kindle , despite starting international sales last year , Apple has announced sales figures for its iPhone , iPod Touch and iPad at every opportunity .
Jobs told the audience that the 100 millionth of those devices would be sold this month .
That presents a huge opportunity for book publishers looking for a platform where they can control prices .
Amazon has tried to set prices for ebooks against publishers ' wishes , while Apple has given them freedom to set charges ; it takes a slice of the retail prices in return for hosting them on iBooks .
The iPhone 4 is less than 10 mm thick compared with 12 mm for its predecessor last year , the iPhone 3GS .
The screen has roughly four times as much detail as before .
There is also a front - facing camera , which could be used for videoconferencing , in addition to one on the back for pictures .
Jobs called it "" the biggest leap since the original iPhone "" .
Apple is the biggest technology company by market value , having passed Microsoft at the end of last month .
Though its shares fell by 1.5 % before Jobs began speaking the company 's stock has already gained more than 20 % during 2010 .
The iPhone 4 will be sold in the UK through O2 , Orange and Vodafone .
It includes a gyroscope and a faster processor similar to that in the iPad .
It also offers longer battery life , Jobs said , and uses a ceramic case , giving it improved signal reception ."

Watch the full presentation if you missed it .
The verdict Gartenberg could hardly contain himself : "" Apple has raised the bar for the phone market once again .
With a combination of new hardware and software features , iPhone sets the standard for what the state of the art smartphone experience is . ""
John Paczkowski on AllThingsD pointed out iPhone 4 could be a problem for Flip : "" it was hard to watch Apple 's demo of the device 's HD video camera working in concert with iMovie Monday and not think that it 's going to eat the Flip Video camcorder and Kodak 's Zi8 alive as soon as it arrives at market .
And things do n't look much better for Google 's Android ' superphones ' , though obviously , there 's a much bigger battle to be fought there .
Certainly , the company and its hardware partners have some serious work to do in the months ahead . ""
Fast Company said it feels like a winner , "" It 's eye - catchingly thin , stylish and modern , and hardware upgrades like the screen and processor give the makeover some heft .
You 'll want one .
Everyone will want one . ""
Wired said it will have you drooling , but then published a comparison of iPhone 4 and the HTC Evo 4 G , which has a better camera , larger screen and runs on a better network for US users .
For ZDNet , the sleek design of iPhone 4 still is n't enough to better the Evo , which also has unlimited multitasking , support for Google Voice , and free navigation .
And JC News Network reminds us that this is n't a 4 G phone :
"" This new iPhone 4 does n't mean it is a 4 G phone .
The only 4 G phone as of the moment is the HTC EVO 4G.
It is being powered by Sprint mobile that uses WiMax , the only network provider that offers 4G. """
2010-06-08,"Apple chief Steve Jobs kicked off his speech at the Worldwide Developer Conference last night by dishing out some iPad statistics , and Mashable and duly infographed them : National Public Radio in the US have had 300,000 iPad app downloads since launch ; Beet .
TV did some back - of - the - envelope maths and made that 15 % of all iPads sold .
The New York Times has has 350,000 iPad app downloads on one week , the Wall Street Journal said it had 10,000 active users each week and the Financial Times reports 130,000 since the launch on 28 May.
Under production at Apple :
Search and TV Jason Calcanis took a rare break from his Facebook sabotage campaign to deconstruct Steve Jobs ' interview at D8 last week .
Despite Jobs ' denial that Apple is not working on search or a new TV product , Calacanis told Beet.tv that Jobs is "" an excellent liar "" and that Apple would launch a new Apple TV by next Christmas and produce a search engine within two years .
The search theory was backed by by the guy who literally wrote the book on Google - John Batelle - who also said Apple will be working on a powerful search tool focused on its apps ."
2010-06-11,"So the free lunch - otherwise known as the unlimited data tariff - is over .
O2 said on Thursday that it will no longer be offering new or upgrading customers its "" unlimited "" tariff for smartphone users - principally , it 's believed , the iPhone users , whose numbers connected to O2 have grown from 1 m to 2 m in a year .
O2 is n't the first : Vodafone ended its "" unlimited "" offering last month , and Steve Jobs had barely sat down after delivering his WWDC speech before AT&amp;T announced that it too was ending its "" unlimited "" offering , replacing it with a tiered set - $ 15/month for 200 MB , $ 25/month for 2 GB .
Orange is expected to follow suit in the next few weeks , though when asked the company simply says that it "" constantly reviews its pricing "" .
However the noises we 're hearing from parts of the company suggest that a review will see it follow O2 to dump the "" unlimited "" offering .
Why ?
Because a tiny number of users are slurping huge amounts of data .
And because the mass of users are demanding more and more data ( though lots less than the real slurpers ) .
There 's all sorts of interesting information that we can pull out of this - especially with the help of O2 's chief executive Ronan Dunne , who signed a lengthy post at the company 's blog with a tortuous justification for why the company has changed its rules .
The strange thing is why he has n't come out with the simple reason - because it would make O2 a lot more popular at a stroke .
He goes over the points that were made in yesterday - that 97 % of O2 smartphone users use less than 500 MB , and that only a tiny number use more than 1 GB .
( Interesting to note that Apple - watcher John Gruber , someone who I 'd expect to be a heavy user , says he uses about 500 MB per month .
So he 's clearly just one of the 97 % , even if an outlier there . )
Even so , smartphone users are a problem : "" one streamed YouTube video has the same effect on the network as half a million text messages sent simultaneously , the equivalent of everybody in Newcastle sending a text at once . ""
Well , yes , but nobody made you offer the iPhone , Mr Dunne .
You were the ones who wanted it so much .
This makes it sound as though you like getting peoples ' money , but do n't like offering them a concomitant service to go with it .
However it 's more complicated than O2 getting a bit whiney .
What we 're hearing here at the Guardian though is that Apple itself helped to kill off the "" unlimited "" tag , because it does n't like it being used with services that call it "" unlimited * "" and then explain further down the page in tiny print that that actually * means "" subject to ' fair usage ' "" .
( We understand that Apple vetoed Vodafone 's initial pricing for the iPad data plans for just that reason . )
It seems that just as broadband ISPs became addicted , when the race to sign up customers was on a few years ago , to the phrase "" up to ... "" for their line speeds , so mobile data networks have gotten too comfy with the "" unlimited * "" word - where the asterisk is all - important .
You could even call it Unlimited ™ - which has quite a different meaning from unlimited .
Apple 's weight is n't the real reason for the change , though .
Stay with us .
There 's other interesting stuff in that blogpost : O2 says there that the average user uses 200 MB per month ; that FaceTime , the video calling offering introduced by Apple with the iPhone 4 , will only be available on Wi - Fi ( at least from O2 ) ; and there will be regular texts to let you know how you 're doing on your data allowance .
And if you go over it without buying more , you 'll see your data speed slow down .
Given those numbers , let 's make some assumptions .
There are 2 m iPhone users ( and even more if you add in Android users ) .
That 's a large enough population that you can treat it as a random sample .
I 'm told by one of the networks that data use follows the normal distribution ( aka the bell curve - that mathematical prediction of where the members of a random population will be : it applies for things like height , for example ) .
It 's probably not a perfect normal distribution - there will be a low - end cutoff , because any device connected to the network will use a least a little data .
But for modelling , it 's a start .
So : 200 MB average ; 97 % use less than 500 MB .
Plus those numbers into a normal distribution calculator and you discover that those 0.1 % who are annoying O2 so much consume more than 690 MB of data per month .
That 's about 23 MB per day - roughly a megabyte every single hour .
What , you think , are those folks doing ?
In fact , one network tells me that those people are downloading many gigabytes per month .
That 's quite hard to do on a smartphone .
Is it because of music streaming services like Spotify or We7 or ( in the US )
Pandora ?
The networks say no : audio does n't take up that much bandwidth ( certainly compared to video ) , and they have n't seen much takeup .
So those gigabyte users are n't listening to streams .
( The iPlayer is only available via Wi - Fi on most networks . )
Yet O2 says that while it has doubled the number of iPhone users , mobile data use is doubling every 4 months , equivalent to an eightfold growth every year .
So : lots of growth , but some real extremes .
What is causing it ?
Closer investigation suggests that this is a sort of collateral damage from the rumblings that preceded the Digital Economy Act - that it 's caused by peer - to - peer users who were perhaps worried about the "" three strikes "" talk , and figured that their landlines ( if they have them ) might be monitored or throttled if they download a lot of P2P data ; or they might be surcharged .
For as we 've pointed out before , "" unlimited "" does n't mean unlimited on landline broadband .
So those wary folk - put by one network as numbering "" in the few hundreds "" out of millions - have signed up on "" unlimited "" plans , taken the SIM out of the phone , and then use it in a 3 G dongle to download stuff .
Because it 's unlimited , they can get what they want .
And as they do n't mind how quickly it arrives , the speed is n't a particular issue ; they 're just after volume .
O2 says that 0.1 % of its smartphone users - that 's about 2,000 people - are consuming 36 % of its data .
Other networks indicate the same .
It 's also a bit foolish on the part of the downloaders , because the Digital Economy Act does actually allow for measures to be taken over illicit filesharing over mobile networks .
But possibly the people doing it do n't think they 'll be noticed .
Here 's news : the mobile networks have noticed .
So it 's not really down to the iPhone or Android phones , which are more of an annoyance to the networks , because they make multiple , frequent requests to the network - but those are small amounts ; those are n't the reason why O2 is ending the unlimited package .
It 's because some people took it at its word when it said data access was unlimited .
At this point , your - and our - reaction is "" so tell that 0.1 % to stop being data hogs - shape their bandwidth , send them letters , that sort of thing .
Because obviously you 're not going to want to burden yourself with having to set up new billing for millions of customers just because you 've got 0.1 % who are a bit annoying .
No , that would be silly .
"" It 's certainly puzzling that O2 is n't being clearer about the reasons .
But the networks say they do n't want to annoy those big downloaders .
That 's because they want to keep them as customers ; but as paying customers .
Yet the unlimited contracts are n't being withdrawn ; they 'll simply not be renewed . ""
At some stage , people will want a new handset or a new contract , "" an O2 spokesperson said yesterday .
I would n't be so sure : someone who 's using their iPhone SIM as a dongle really is n't worried about upgrading ; they 've probably got a PAYG SIM stuffed into their iPhone for their phone calls .
They 're not stupid .
Unless O2 - and the other networks - start taking some aggressive action , such as throttling their connections , then the faux - iPhoners will carry on .
It 's a tragedy of the commons , mobile data - style .
Just like spam and comment bots , the tiny number of P2P mobile downloaders are screwing it up for everyone else .
It 's odd that internet evolution is going in reverse here : I thought that ISPs had learnt that offering broadband was far better for retaining customers than the penny - per - minute dialup nightmare of 1990s internet connectivity ( yes , children , we used to have dialup modems , and paid per minute we were connected .
And you could n't use make a phone call while you did ) .
It 's a retrograde move - and even though the networks insist that most people wo n't be affected , the fact is that we 're data - hungry .
Eventually , we 'll all be over the limit .
Will the P2P donglers still be on their unlimited contracts even then ?
One feels that it 's time for the networks , if they 're really serious about offering a good service to all their customers , to have a think about that "" fair use "" clause .
Meanwhile , the 97 % get a little inconvenienced , plus the constant worry that they 'll go over their limit .
That 's actually the worst thing about what 's happening here : that the confidence that you can use the mobile internet anywhere is suddenly gone , replaced by a nagging worry that this page or that service will land you with a big bill .
The mobile internet should n't be like that : it should be like the landline version , where you do n't worry about the megabytes .
It 's not a free lunch - but it 's not a system where the person in front is treating the buffet as an all - you - can - eat either ."
2010-06-12,"When Steve Jobs launched his latest must - have computer to the world , he might not have been thinking about the dolphin market .
But , at the Dolphin Discovery swim facility in Puerto Aventuras , Mexico , Apple 's groundbreaking iPad is engaged in some remarkable groundbreaking inter - species research .
Scientists there are using a waterproofed version of the iPad to help them communicate with a bottlenose dolphin called Merlin . ""
Merlin is quite curious , like most dolphins , and he showed a complete willingness to examine the iPad , "" according to Jack Kassewitz of Miami - based SpeakDolphin.com , who is looking for ways to allow dolphins to better express themselves around humans .
Two - year - old Merlin can tap symbols on the waterproofed iPad and Kassewitz reckons the dolphin will be able to get the hang of a wide assortment of symbols .
"" The use of the iPad is part of our continuing search to find a suitable touchscreen technology which the dolphins can activate with the tip of their rostrums or beaks , "" says Kassewitz .
"" After extensive searching and product review , it looks like our choice is between the Panasonic Toughbook and the Apple iPad .
"" We think that once the dolphins get the hang of the touchscreen , we can let them choose from a wide assortment of symbols to represent objects , actions and even emotions . ""
The work with Merlin is part of a long line of research examining dolphin intelligence .
At the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Mississippi , Kelly the dolphin learned to trade bits of paper for fish every time a trainer passed her tank .
Dolphins are known to be able to keep track of many different relationships within a large social group and have an efficient communication system of clicks and whistles to keep in touch .
They also communicate using touch and body postures , but there is no evidence they have anything we could call a language .
Kassewitz already has some suggestions for the next generations of the tablet computers that could help him with his work .
"" Waterproofing , processor speed , touch - sensitivity , anti - glare screens and dolphin - friendly programs are essential , "" he says .
"" We 'll need fast technology to help us respond appropriately and quickly to the dolphins . """
2010-06-16,"Apple has reported overwhelming demand for its new iPhone 4 model , selling more than 600,000 in a single day on Tuesday which saw ordering websites crash in the US and UK .
In Germany , demand for the new model , which was only unveiled by Apple chief executive Steve Jobs at the start of the month , is running 10 times ahead of that for last year 's model , the iPhone 3GS , reported Deutsche Telekom .
By comparison , when the iPhone 3GS went on sale last year , 1 m were sold in its first three days .
But that debuted in eight countries , whereas the iPhone 4 has gone on sale only in five .
Apple has apologised to people who tried to order the phone and gave up in frustration , saying demand was far higher than it expected .
"" We hope that they will try again .. once the iPhone 4 is in stock . ""
Since its debut in June 2007 , Apple 's smartphone has taken a huge chunk of the smartphone market and forced companies such as RIM , maker of the BlackBerry , and Nokia , which has the lion 's share of smartphone sales , to play catchup .
Nokia issued another profits warning on Wednesday , and its share of the smartphone market is falling every quarter .
In the UK , where Apple is offering the phone without a contract through its online store , Apple 's website crashed as people tried to order it .
And in the US , where it is only available with a contract from AT&amp;T , the telephone company 's website froze as it tried to cope with an avalanche of orders each of which had to be verified on its own servers .
That also led to problems in which some customers saw details of other peoples ' accounts – a reminder of the flaw exposed by a security group last week in which hundreds of thousands of Apple iPad users ' emails were stolen via weak security on AT&amp;T 's site .
As a result of the heavy demand Apple has had to push back the delivery date for phones ordered online , and on Wednesday AT&amp;T suspended orders , citing "" unexpectedly high demand "" .
Apple said "" it was the largest number of pre - orders Apple has ever taken in a single day and was far higher than we anticipated , resulting in many order and approval system malfunctions . ""
Last year in the UK O2 had exclusive rights to sell the new iPhone , and said then that more of those handsets were sold in the first two hours of trading than all handsets in an average day .
This year Apple is selling the iPhone 4 without a contract – at £ 499 for the cheapest version – and O2 , Vodafone , Orange and 3 are competing to offer it on contract terms .
However neither O2 or 3 have yet announced prices , or allowed customers to pre - order the phone .
However the new contracts being offered for the phones have sparked anger among web users , who say that the carriers ' use of the word "" unlimited "" for the amount of data that can be downloaded through the smartphone is misleading .
The companies impose a "" fair use "" cap , while describing the service as "" unlimited "" .
Now , a formal review by the advertising regulator could be about to put a cap on the practice .
This could mean that fixed - line and mobile operators will not be able to use the term "" unlimited broadband "" unless they are offering a genuinely unlimited service – and that means nothing in the small print that lets the provider send warnings to customers if they reach a certain threshold .
The review is being led by the Advertising Standards Authority , reports New Media Age , which will work with two ad industry bodies to make a comprehensive assessment of industry claims and consumer complaints on both broadband speeds and "" unlimited "" tariff penalties ."
2010-06-21,"Two of technology 's biggest names , Apple and Google , are becoming increasingly aggressive as they stake out their claim to the future of mobile – the most important battleground in technology .
A recent acquisition by Apple hints at its increased focus on specialised search for mobile – despite repeated denials by chief executive Steve Jobs that Apple is developing search .
So what is being developed , and why ?
What did Apple buy ?
Apple paid between $ 150 m and $ 250 m for Siri , an innocuous iPhone application that is a voice - controlled personal organiser .
SRI International , the company that developed the app , had roots going back to 1946 exploring various human / computer interfaces , including the mouse .
It received $ 150 m from US military to create an organisational tool for troops .
And we know that the military always has the best technology , first .
What 's the big deal with voice controls ?
The first voice recognition technology surfaced in 1952 , so voice command is nothing new .
Most smartphones have some sort of voice control feature , though deployment of an US accent sometimes produces better results .
But the step change is the rapid growth of an applications market to index and access different functions .
Improved voice control could mean "" take a photo ! "" , "" find train home "" or "" Shazam this track ! ""
– all without fiddling around in menus .
In practical terms , it may also mean less people being run over while they text and trawl through Google Maps , and is great news for the visually impaired .
So what is Apple working on ?
Despite the popularity of smartphones , Apple 's discreet push into voice controls could hint at a second wave of mobile innovation where small rules .
With component technology increasingly compact , a truly powerful , intelligent voice - controlled phone could shed the screen and shrink to the size of an iPod Shuffle .
When can I get my hands on one ?
When someone nicks one from an Apple engineer in a bar ?
Actually , given Apple 's precision - crafted rollout strategy , we 'll probably see a beefed - up voice command built into future iPhone software releases to train us up .
Give Jobs a couple of years ."
2010-06-23,"There are few greater honours in Silicon Valley than a personal gift from Steve Jobs of a yet - to - be - released iPhone 4 .
Or a crash course in micro - blogging from the founders of Twitter .
Technology chiefs in California prepared to lay out the red carpet today for a VIP guest in the shape of Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev .
Kicking off a US visit , Medvedev embarked on a tour of Silicon Valley in a search for tips on establishing a similar technological hub , dubbed an "" innograd "" , outside Moscow . ""
My purpose is not just to see what is going on there , "" said Medvedev at a reception in San Francisco hosted by California 's governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger .
"" I would like to have my visit be translated into full - fledged relations and into co - operation with those companies . ""
In addition to visiting Apple and Twitter , Medvedev 's itinerary includes meetings with top executives from Cisco and Google .
A Russian warship , the Varyag , docked in San Francisco in co - ordination with the trip .
Known to be a technology buff , Medvedev has made it a pet project to create a Russian version of Silicon Valley .
His administration has earmarked Skolkovo , a city southwest of the Russian capital , as the site of the proposed centre of innovation , earmarking $ 500 m ( £ 335 m ) of public investment for the next year alone .
Schwarzenegger , who described the Russian president 's visit as "" very , very beneficial "" for California , joked with Medvedev that he had fond memories of Moscow from filming a 1988 police movie , Red Heat , in the Russian capital .
The California governor pledged to put together a trade mission of technology experts to Moscow to help with the Skolkovo venture .
Medvedev 's delegation was due to meet Google 's chief executive , Eric Schmidt , today after the search engine boss agreed to join the board of Skolkovo .
But industry observers noted that the Russian president had no plans to meet one of his country 's most successful emigres , the billionaire co - founder of Google , Sergey Brin .
The Wall Street Journal noted that in a 2002 interview Brin had been scathing about the land of his ancestry , describing Russia as "" Nigeria with snow "" .
After his trip to Silicon Valley , Medvedev will move on to Washington to meet the US president , Barack Obama , before attending this weekend 's G20 international summit in Toronto .
Part of Medvedev 's economic strategy is build innovative industries to try to ease Russia off its financial dependence on oil ."
2010-06-25,"Apple has issued official guidance - and its chief executive Steve Jobs has issued unofficial guidance - on how to avoid the widely - noted reception problems with the new iPhone 4 when held from below : do n't hold it that way .
The cause has been narrowed down to a circuit being formed when the skin bridges the gap between the left and bottom antennas that form the phone 's outer stainless steel bezel : depending on the conductance of the skin , it can make the phone reception drop off dramatically .
Emailed by the website Ars Technica about the problem , Jobs responded in his normal terse manner : "" Just avoid holding it in that way , "" he wrote - a response from Jobs that was received by a number of gadget review sites and customers in the US .
Or , in Apple 's official statement - which is only being passed out to news organisations which ask for a statement on the problem , rather than sent out ( as happens with iPad or iPhone sales figures ) : "" Gripping any phone will result in some attenuation of its antenna performance with certain places being worse than others depending on the placement of the antennas .
This is a fact of life for every wireless phone .
If you ever experience this on your Phone 4 , avoid gripping it in the lower left corner in a way that covers both sides of the black strip in the metal band , or simply use one of many available cases .
"" The problem emerged within hours of the first iPhone 4 devices being delivered to customers in the US , with dozens posting videos to YouTube showing mobile reception dropping off dramatically when they picked up the phone .
Some users wondered why Apple had not spotted the problem during its testing of the iPhone 4 before its launch , and wondered whether the £ 25 "" bumpers "" that Apple sells to go around the casing - and protect the metal antennas - was an implicit acknowledgement of the problem .
Apple had no comment on Friday on whether it had discovered the problem during testing , or only after the phone went on sale .
Spencer Web , an antenna engineer with Antennasys , notes in a blog post that antennas for mobile phones are generally placed at the bottom of the phone , in order to keep the radiative parts of the phone as far away from the user 's head as possible .
In the US the Federal Communications Commission measures the output of a phone , and the amount of non - ionising radiation given off , in specific tests - but Web says that those would not have picked up the problem : "" when the FCC tests are run , the head is required to be in the vicinity of the phone .
But , the hand is not ! ""
He added : "" The antenna structure for the cell phone is still down at the bottom ( I wo n't address the WiFi nor GPS antennas in this blog entry ) .
The iPhone 4 has two symmetrical slots in the stainless frame .
If you short these slots , or cover them with your hand , the antenna performance will suffer ( see this video I found on YouTube ) .
There is no way around this , it 's a design compromise that is forced by the requirements of the FCC , AT&amp;T , Apple 's marketing department and Apple 's industrial designers , to name a few .
"" There is some speculation that the problem only occurs on some phones because the antennas are usually covered with a clear finishing solution ; if the finish did not cover them properly the phone might be more liable to the problem .
Meanwhile iPhone 4 users are developing their own solutions - which range from the use of duct or masking tape on the bottom edge , painting clear nail varnish over the gap , buying cases to cover the sides of the phone , or - the most expensive option - buying Apple 's "" bumpers "" which cover the edge of the phone .
Meanwhile another problem has appeared on some of the new models : yellow discoloration under the screen .
According to one suggestion , this is due to a chemical used in the fixing process that joins the touchscreen to the glass above it and will fade in a few days .
That remains to be seen ."
2010-06-26,"Want to know the must - have item for owners of the new iPhone 4 ?
A bit of duct tape – or a dab of nail polish .
The reason : despite Steve Jobs 's describing the positioning of the antennae which pick up the mobile signal on the outside of the phone , rather than the inside , as "" brilliant engineering "" , a number of users have discovered that if it is held from the bottom , the signal strength drops off dramatically – because their skin changes the electrical properties of the antennae .
Now , Jobs has informally – and Apple formally – acknowledged the issue : in email replies to owners of the new phones complaining about the problem , Jobs gave a simple response .
"" Do n't hold it that way , "" he told one .
Apple 's slightly longer statement notes that : "" Gripping any phone will result in some attenuation of its antenna performance with certain places being worse than others
…
this is a fact of life for every wireless phone .
If you ever experience this on your iPhone 4 , avoid gripping it in the lower left corner in a way that covers both sides of the black strip in the metal band , or simply use one of many available cases .
"" Some users have found tape or nail polish on the corner is a solution .
With the iPhone 4 having been a sellout in many stores – and Vodafone emailing customers whom it promised supplies to tell them that it can not satisfy them – the problems are an embarrassment for Apple , which had to overcome early problems with wireless reception on its tablet - style computer , the iPad , when that was launched in May.
Dozens of people have posted videos on YouTube showing how the signal reception for 3 G voice and data networks falls off when it is held so that the hand touches the antenna parts on the bottom of the phone .
Companies selling silicone casing for the iPhone 4 report that they have already been busier , as word of the problem has spread , than they were for last year 's release of the iPhone 3GS .
Professor Joe McGeehan , head of the Centre for Communications Research at the University of Bristol , and an expert in mobile antenna technology , said : "" The hand does have a de - tuning effect on the antenna of any mobile phone : it changes the frequency that it responds to due to capacitative effects .
How much it affects it depends on the materials surrounding it .
If previous iPhones did n't have this problem , then you have to ask : what 's changed , and might that be causing it ? ""
Antenna expert Spencer Webb said all mobile phones house the antenna in the bottom of the phone , to minimise the radio output near the head so that the phone will pass safety testing by the US Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) .
"" The iPhone 4 has two symmetrical slots in the stainless frame , "" Webb wrote .
"" If you short these slots , or cover them with your hand , the antenna performance will suffer .
There is no way around this , it 's a design compromise that is forced by the requirements of the FCC , AT&amp;T , Apple 's marketing department and Apple 's industrial designers , to name a few . ""
He said he had upgraded to the new iPhone , despite the concerns .
"" I voted with my dollars , "" he said .
"" Sometimes an antenna that 's not great , but good enough , is good enough . ""
Apple offers a solution : "" bumpers "" which fits around the edge of the phone .
But at £ 29 , they are too pricey for many to consider – and have not pleased people who think their phone should work correctly out of the box ."
2010-06-28,"The Daily Mail website been caught out by a fake Steve Jobs account on Twitter , writing a story claiming that the chief executive said the iPhone 4 would be recalled on the basis on a message from the clearly - marked parody account .
The "" ceoSteveJobs "" account on Twitter plainly says in its biography : "" I do n't care what you think of me .
You care what I think of you .
Of course this is a parody account .
"" But the Mail on Sunday appears to have overlooked this in picking up on a tweet at 0017 BST on Sunday in which the person writing the account said : "" We may have to recall the new iPhone .
This , I did not expect .
"" Had the account belonged to the real chief executive , there might have been the faint possibility of it being true :
Apple has acknowledged problems with reception when the iPhone 4 is held in particular ways , notably from below – though its guidance to customers is simply not to hold it in ways which lose reception .
The tweet was thus quickly picked up by the Mail , which wrote a story that was published at about 11 am on Sunday morning which said that : "" The much - vaunted new iPhone 4 may be recalled , Apple boss Steve Jobs revealed last night .
Posting a message on the social networking site Twitter , the tycoon said … "" and quoted the tweet .
Although the story was taken down later in the day , it was picked up by a number of commentators , and was still being indexed on Google News late on Sunday night – though the URL that it led to did not resolve .
The story is visible on a number of sites which syndicate Mail content .
Although Jobs does not – as far as anyone knows – use social networks such as Twitter or Facebook , he has in the past few months begun to respond to emails sent by customers or journalists .
On the iPhone 4 , he has already replied to at least one customer , suggesting : "" Just avoid holding it that way . ""
More recently , he is reported to have told another customer to "" stay tuned "" over the reception problems – perhaps implying that a forthcoming software update will try to improve the situation ."

WikiLeaks has a problem going mainstream
The content WikiLeaks has released has been shocking .
So why has it has had so little effect ?"
2010-06-29,"Three days after sharing a cheeseburger with Barack Obama , and an iPhone 4 with Steve Jobs ( an hour before the model went on sale in US stores ) , it is back to business as usual for Dmitry Medvedev , the man who presents himself as Russia 's moderniser but struggles to convince .
Moscow 's reaction to a 55-page indictment facing 11 alleged Russian spies , who are said to have been working under deep cover , was to accuse America of resorting to the tactics of the cold war .
But the indictment could not have made comfortable reading for anyone in Moscow who prides themselves on guarding the secrets of the nation .
In it , Russia 's external intelligence service , the SVR , appears to show a professional ineptitude worthy of Inspector Clouseau .
Peter Sellers could not have done better .
The computers through which intelligence whizzed from one agent to the van waiting outside did not work .
The advice given to one agent to "" build up , little by little , relations "" with a New York financier with powerful political connections is laughable .
Their intelligence , computer passwords , emails , encrypted codes , mobile phone calls and even their embarrassing doubts over houses and expenses – all became an open book to the FBI .
The accused have not been charged with espionage , but with conspiracy to act as unregistered agents of a foreign government .
What could be more humiliating than spies who spill the beans before they could even get going ?
The British secret service should be the last to crow .
It has been caught with its fingers in the till in 1994,1996 and 2006 –
the last occasion when one of its agents was filmed ducking into the bushes to touch a rock containing a transmitter .
British recruitment drives for Russian agents have had devastating consequences for their targets , not least when a junior diplomat with mental health problems was used to spy on his father .
Every country is at it .
The larger question is whether these attempts to penetrate political and military secrets are not , in the long run , self - defeating .
Typically spies make hay while the sun shines .
The Soviet Union placed some of its highest - level spies in the British establishment in the 1930s when it was awash with sympathy with communism .
We did it to Russia in the 1990s when anything that was not screwed down in Russia could be bought and towed away to the west .
The ease with which western intelligence operated in Russia in the 1990s was one of the reasons , although not the only one , for Vladimir Putin 's decision to reconstitute the FSB as an instrument of control at home and to increase spying activity abroad .
The tragedy is that neither the liberalism and then collapse of Boris Yeltsin 's corrupt regime nor its polar opposite , the "" managed democracy "" under Putin , answers the underlying question that the nation faces : how to modernise without losing control ?
Is it doomed by fate , history and weather to be authoritarian ?
Can any institution be allowed to work independently of a self - perpetuating clique in the Kremlin ?
For a moderniser like Medvedev , who talks about corruption and lawlessness but fails to do anything about either , the spy affair is especially troubling .
Not because it might affect bilateral relations with Washington .
It will not : the reset button has produced tangible benefits for both sides .
It started with missile defence , a new Start treaty and a tougher Russian attitude to Iran .
But it is continuing in all sorts of ways , from the US backing Russia 's application to join the WTO to the idea that American companies , like Cisco , should spearhead Medvedev 's pet project of setting up a Silicon Valley outside Moscow .
The atmosphere has warmed and it is in neither Obama 's nor Medvedev 's interests for it to freeze up again in a state of "" cold peace "" .
No , the spy affair reminds all sides just how far there is to go before relations between Russia and the west become normal ."
2010-07-01,"The Simpsons once had an episode which , in passing , showed newscaster Kent Brockman announcing "" And now here is a list of celebrities that have been arrested "" , with a zip - fast list scrolling up the screen .
So , rather in that vein , here are things that Steve Jobs has revealed via his email replies - an output system that ought to be making his PR people look to their laurels .
First , Blu - ray : do n't hold your breath .
In fact , let your breath out , because Jobs , who in October 2008 called the Sony - controlled enhanced - DVD format "" a bag of hurt "" ( quote : "" Blu - ray is just a bag of hurt .
It 's great to watch the movies , but the licensing of the tech is so complex , we 're waiting till things settle down and Blu - ray takes off in the marketplace . "" ) , is now suggesting that Blu - ray is just passé .
Responding to a reader at Mac Rumors who asked him how soon Blu - ray drives ( even for reading discs ) would be coming to the Apple Mac , Jobs responded : "" Bluray is looking more and more like one of the high end audio formats that appeared as the successor to the CD - like it will be beaten by Internet downloadable formats . ""
Certainly it 's true that Super Audio CD ( SACD ) and DVD - Audio died a thorough death , especially compared to MP3 , despite offering higher quality audio .
The reader , Siva , demurred : the medium - term benefits of Blu - ray , he pointed out , include being able to do high - density backups ( you can get Blu - ray writers and discs for backup ) , plus the video is higher - quality than you can get online , and MP3 took off because of its lack of DRM .
( He might have pointed out : the short - term benefits include watching Blu - ray films . )
So come on , Steve , how about it ?
No moving Jobs :
"" No , free , instant gratification and convenience ( likely in that order ) is what made the downloadable formats take off .
And the downloadable movie business is rapidly moving to free ( Hulu ) or rentals ( iTunes ) so storing purchased movies or TV shows is not an issue .
"" I think you may be wrong - we may see a fast broad move to streamed free and rental content at sufficient quality ( at least 720p ) to win almost everyone over . ""
The strange thing about Blu - ray and Apple is how completely mulish Apple is being about incorporating it .
You can now get Blu - ray DVD playback on dozens of manufacturers ' machines , because it 's seen as a benefit .
Not though for Apple owners , who ca n't even buy an add - on drive to read Blu - ray discs because the OS wo n't control them .
And another Mac Rumors reader emailed Jobs earlier in the week about those "" reception issues "" with the iPhone 4 .
Jobs 's response ?
"" There are no reception issues .
Stay tuned .
""
Any more ?
Really he should have a Twitter account all of his own .
Most of the replies could fit into 140 characters .
Then again , bad things might happen .
Oh , and since you wanted to know who was on the celebrities list , here it is .
And to quote Kent : "" Remember , if you see any celebrities , consider them dangerous . """
2010-07-02,"Steve Jobs and Bill Gates at AllThingsD , May 2007 .
Photo by Joi on Flickr .
Some rights reserved The email exchange attributed by the Boy Genius Report site to Steve Jobs - in which it was claimed that Jobs told someone to "" Retire , relax , enjoy your family .
It is just a phone "" - was a fake , Apple 's official PR has told Fortune .
The conversation ( which seemed a bit odd : the emailer was very aggressive , and "" Jobs "" surprisingly mellow and wordy , as well as dismissive about the phone ) was emphatically not from Jobs .
Meanwhile , AppleInsider is saying that a similar exchange was being offered to it - for cash - a few days before BGR published it .
This creates an interesting element to what had been a seven - day wonder : Jobs 's apparent tendency to respond , quite randomly , to emails sent from people out in the wide world .
How long has Jobs been doing this ?
There 's a photo purporting to show such an exchange dating back to March 2006 , in which someone emailed steve@mac.com ( an email that was purportedly Jobs 's ) to grumble about how he 'd bought an iMac but now Apple had brought out a new one so his old one was out of date , grumble grumble .
To which "" Jobs 's "" reply was "" The iMac G5 is a splendid computer and will remain so for a long time to come .
Not to worry . ""
Now , that sounds like the sort of Zen - like thing Jobs does say in interviews and press exchanges ; I recall being there once when someone asked him about what measures there were against pirating Mac OSX , and Jobs replied - you have to add the ironical note in your head - "" But that would be bad !
You do n't want to go to hell , do you ? ""
( I wanted to point out that he himself does n't believe in hell , as he 's a Buddhist , but it was n't quite the right time . )
Then - if we allow for the purposes of argument that that was from Jobs ( and not just from an Apple developer or similar inside Apple who was put in charge of the "" steve@mac.com "" address and told to treat it like customer services , except regal ) - it seems to have gone quiet until November 2009 , when he apparently told an outraged developer complaining about the problems with the use of the iPod name and icon in his app to "" Just change the name of your app .
Not that big of a deal .
Steve .
Sent from my iPhone . ""
( The last bit added automatically , of course . )
There are three interesting elements to this : 1 ) a chief executive of a very large technology company responding directly to customers .
Do any others of them do this ?
Did Bill Gates ( famously famous for being billg@microsoft.com , whereas Jobs is allegedly on sjobs@apple.com ) ever do it ?
Not to my recollection .
You could imagine that there might be all sorts of stock market sensitivity if Jobs were really suggesting in any email that there were a software fix coming for the iPhone , since it would imply a problem .
2 ) Apple 's PR has , it must be said , done a woeful job on this .
If the emails are really from Jobs , then he has been routing around them in a way that must be embarrassing : it should really be for customer service or the PR side to make such statements .
If the emails are fake , it has been letting them get out of hand , and by not pointing out that the fake ones more quickly ( even the BGR one washed around the net for a while ) it 's been too slow .
Though possibly Jobs is a bit defensive of his outbox , or something .
3 ) things have developed so quickly that there are now people who see a market in selling purported Jobs emails .
We thought that only worked with phones .
We 're waiting to find out if any of those emails really came from Jobs .
Though we 're not sure if we should hold our breaths ..."
2010-07-15,"Kevin Turner , Microsoft 's chief operating officer , took aim squarely at the iPhone 4 's problems in a speech yesterday .
"" One of the things that I want to make sure that you know today is that you 're going to be able to use the Windows Phone 7 and not have to worry about how you 're holding it to make a phone call , "" he told Microsoft 's Worldwide Partner Conference , adding : "" It looks like iPhone 4 might be their Vista . ""
Certainly , Apple chief Steve Jobs could be said to have invited hubris with his fulsome description of the iPhone 4 's antenna layout , now reckoned to be a key source of the problem .
But what else has Turner had to say about Vista – about which he 's now apparently so dismissive ?
Looking back at his speeches , he seems to have thought it was a great idea .
Just before it was demonstrated live on stage at the Microsoft Small Business Summit in 2007 , he sounded enthusiastic : "" I 'd really like John Stroiney to come up and really help me demonstrate for you Windows Vista , Microsoft Office , and Office for Small Business 2007 , because when you see these products , and the innovation in these products , I think you 'll be as excited as I am . ""
He certainly liked it afterwards : "" You know , you saw a lot of functionality , and you saw a lot of ease of use that we put into that technology , and a great user interface , and all the different things .
Windows Vista and the 2007 Office System is about safe , secure , a great experience , and improving your productivity . ""
His mood had apparently changed by April 2009 , ahead of the launch of Windows 7 : "" The toughness , the tough launch that we had with the release of Vista was very brutal .
The first 18 to 24 months in market was tough .
Why was it tough ?
Because we locked that product down to fix a lot of the security problems . ""
And he added : "" The reason that Windows 7 will be successful is because of the pain we took on Vista . ""
So on that score , will Apple 's soon - to - be - available iOS4.1 software update be it 's Windows 7 , the "" number one product [ they 've ] ever put out from a quality standpoint "" ?
Or , possibly , it 's just dangerous to make comparisons with products that you once feted ."
2010-07-16,"Apple is offering a free rubber "" bumper "" to owners of the iPhone 4 to head off criticism over problems with its signal reception but dismissed suggestions that the device should be recalled .
Steve Jobs , Apple 's chief executive , said the problems had affected only "" a small batch "" of phones , and that it was due to an "" inherent problem "" with smartphones .
"" We 're not perfect , "" he said at a press conference at Apple 's HQ in Cupertino , California .
"" We have n't figured out a way around the laws of physics yet . ""
Nevertheless Apple will offer the "" bumpers "" , which cover the sides of the phone , around the exposed metal antenna which receives the mobile signal .
When users have held the phones by the bottom and left sides it has led to a loss of signal .
People who have already bought a case are entitled to a free cash refund .
Jobs headed off the suggestion that Apple would have to recall the phone , following a media storm which had seen some compare the problems to those faced by Toyota , whose cars suffered problems with the accelerators and brakes .
However the iPhone has not met any of the usual criteria for a product recall , such as spontaneously combusting or causing harm through heat or emission .
Jobs revealed that Apple has sold 3 m of the iPhone 4 since its launch on 24 June .
That indicates that the rate of sales has slowed dramatically , after 1.7 m were sold in the first three days .
But he insisted customer satisfaction was higher than with previous versions : the return rate was just 1.7 % , he said , compared to 6 % for the previous model , the iPhone 3GS released last summer .
The company said it can not make enough bumpers to satisfy demand , but will keep the offer of the free case open until September .
Jobs admitted that there had been complaints about the phone losing signal when held by the left and bottom sides – but said that they were natural for any phone .
He acknowledged they were not perfect but insisted that every phone manufacturer had problems with antenna design and interaction with the body 's tendency to absorb the phone signal .
Apple 's stock rebounded as Jobs began speaking at 6 pm UK time last night .
Apple 's share price fell by 4 % overnight on Tuesday , knocking $ 9.9bn ( £ 6.5bn ) off the company 's $ 230bn value , as speculation grew that the phone might have to be recalled .
Since the iPhone 4 's launch , there have been many complaints about the way that the signal appears to drop off dramatically when it is held with a hand wrapped around its left and bottom sides ( a problem dubbed the "" iPhone Death Grip "" ) .
Apple this week said that it had made a "" simple and surprising "" error in the software that displayed the strength of the signal , and on Thursday night issued a software update which changes how many bars are displayed when the signal becomes weaker .
The iPhone problems now feature in dozens of jokes .
Earlier this week Kevin Turner , the chief operating officer of Microsoft , spoke at a conference about its Windows Phone 7 software .
""
One of the things that I want to make sure that you know today , "" he said , "" is that you 're going to be able to use the Windows Phone 7 and not have to worry about how you 're holding it to make a call . """
2010-07-18,"Google is not used to coming second .
But after three years at the top of MediaGuardian 's list of the 100 most powerful people in the media , the co - founders of the internet search provider have been toppled by the man who gave the world the iPhone and the iPad , Steve Jobs .
It is the first time the Apple chairman and chief executive has topped the annual list , which is published for the 10th time today .
Jobs took the number one position despite a backlash over technical issues with the latest model of the iPhone .
It remains to be seen whether the negative publicity will affect long - term sales of the mould - breaking smartphone , and the chances of Jobs hanging on to the top spot in next year 's list . ""
The iPhone was a game - changer and the iPad is set to rewrite the media landscape , "" said the panel of seasoned media watchers who put together this year 's MediaGuardian 100 .
The Google co - founders , Larry Page and Sergey Brin , took the runner - up spot , one place ahead of the BBC director general , Mark Thompson , who has endured a difficult year and faces an uncertain 12 months ahead .
Will the Conservatives ‑ who have the highest new entry in this year 's list , the culture secretary , Jeremy Hunt ‑ be as tough on the corporation in government as they were in opposition ?
On Friday Hunt accused the BBC of "" extraordinary and outrageous "" waste in recent years , and said the BBC licence fee could be cut .
A resurgent Rupert Murdoch , after two years of decline in the MediaGuardian 100 , bounced back to fourth position ‑ leapfrogging his son James ‑ on the back of his decision to put up paywalls around the online content of the Times and Sunday Times .
"" Paywalls are going to be the big story of the year , "" was the panel 's verdict .
"" The whole of the newspaper industry is watching . ""
The phenomenal growth of social media merited top 10 places for the Facebook founder and chief executive , Mark Zuckerberg , and Evan Williams , co - founder and chief executive of Twitter .
Another digital media player , Mark Rock , who founded the sound - sharing application Audioboo , was among the highest new entries , one place ahead of Erik Huggers , the BBC executive responsible for the iPlayer .
Simon Cowell rose to his highest ranking after another strong year for Britain 's Got Talent and the X Factor , and his money - spinning deal in the US .
It is a sign of his importance to ITV that Cowell is four places ahead of the broadcaster 's new chief executive , this year 's second highest new entry , Archie Norman .
Other entries include Chris Evans , who returned to the list for the first time since 2007 on the back of his record - breaking BBC Radio 2 breakfast show , and Julian Assange , of the global whistleblowing service Wikileaks .
The Sun editor , Dominic Mohan , made the list for the first time , as did Sam and Dan Houser , the brothers behind the best - selling Grand Theft Auto games .
Another strong year for BSkyB saw its chief executive , Jeremy Darroch , make the top 20 for the first time .
There were also high - profile casualties from last year 's MediaGuardian 100 , including the Today presenter Evan Davis , X Factor judge Cheryl Cole , and Jonathan Ross , who bade farewell to the BBC at the weekend after nine years presenting his BBC1 chatshow and 11 years hosting the Saturday morning show on Radio 2 .
Ross was replaced at number 100 by another famous television name coming to the end of a long run this year : Big Brother ."
2010-07-19,"Job : co - founder , chairman , chief executive , Apple Industry : digital media Age : 55 Turnover : $ 42.9bn Staff : 36,800 2009 ranking :
4 Steve Jobs changed the way we consume music ; now he has set out to change the way we consume everything else .
Publishers seized upon the iPad as a potential saviour of the newspaper industry , a revolution in the way we will consume the printed word that could also do good business for books and magazines , as well as further transforming the way we watch TV and films .
It remains early days , of course , and far from everyone is convinced , but history suggests where Jobs leads , the rest of us follow .
It might look like just a giant iPhone , but the iPad turned our conception of a "" computer "" on its head , and possibly with it the media industry as well .
Hence Jobs takes the No 1 position in the MediaGuardian 100 for the first time , after three years in which Google 's Larry Page and Sergey Brin ( and its president , Eric Schmidt ) reigned supreme .
Jobs shared his position in last year 's list with the driving force behind Apple 's epoch - making designs , Jonathan I ve , after the Apple boss took six months off work following a liver transplant .
Our panel was still keen to flag up the contribution of Essex - born I ve – "" without him , Steve Jobs would be nothing , "" said one panellist – but Jobs , with the new iPad and iPhone , but same old black turtleneck , has earned the right to the No 1 spot by himself .
But Brin and Page were not knocked off the top without a fight .
And that was just among our panel : "" Publishers are changing their whole business model because of the iPad "" ... ""
But Apple products are just for the elite , they are not mass market .
Everyone uses Google , every day "" ...
"" The iPhone was a game - changer and the iPad is set to rewrite the media landscape .
"" The MediaGuardian 100 is intended to be a starting point for debate .
It is also a snapshot in time , not just a reflection of the past 12 months , or the next 12 months , and right now Jobs and Apple , the company that he co - founded 34 years ago , are pre - eminent .
It is nine years since Jobs launched the iPod – and seven since iTunes , which led to Apple 's dominance in the digital music market .
Now he is looking to do the same with ebooks .
The initially over - priced iPhone met with a lukewarm response when it appeared in 2007 , but the fourth version launched earlier this year sold 600,000 handsets in a day .
It may not be the biggest - selling smartphone – and the latest version has suffered technical difficulties , the full fallout from which remains to be seen –
but it is the most influential , with rival manufacturers taking their cue from Apple devices .
The same is likely to be true of the iPad , which sold much more quickly than the iPhone and notched up 2 m sales in less than two months .
Jobs said it was "" magical and revolutionary "" , Rupert Murdoch said it "" may well be the saving of the newspaper industry "" , while the Guardian 's editor , Alan Rusbridger , more cautiously greeted it as a "" transformative interim step "" .
Publishers are so excited about the iPad – and the iPhone – because they have the ability to deliver content through downloadable – and most importantly , chargeable – applications .
Total number of applications downloaded so far : more than 5bn .
Apple has so far paid out more than $ 1bn to the burgeoning apps industry it created , taking about $ 428 m for itself .
The iPad , still only three months old , will see the apps industry blossom further .
All this without any porn , which Jobs banned from Apple products , or Adobe 's Flash , which neither the iPhone nor the iPad supports .
Not that Jobs is having everything his own way .
Google , Apple 's erstwhile friendly neighbour , is now a bitter competitor and challenging it head to head in the smartphone , mobile software and digital books markets , and looking at launching a rival tablet to the iPad .
Apple also faces an investigation by US regulators to see if its mobile ad network rules are anti - competitive and was forced on the defensive after a series of deaths at its factory in China .
And then there are the on - going technical issues with the iPhone 4 .
But for the moment , Jobs is on top .
Total sales of the iPhone , iPad and iPod Touch topped 100 m last month and his company 's market capitalisation exceeded that of Microsoft for the first time since 1989 .
Its net profits in 2009 were $ 8.235bn , up 35 % on the previous year .
Not bad for a company which was on the brink of disaster when Jobs returned to it after a 12-year absence in 1997 .
In between he bought a graphics hardware developer which he turned into Pixar and sold to Disney for $ 7.4bn in 2006 .
Apple , said Jobs , is "" not just a technology company , even though we have and invent some of the highest tech in this industry .
It 's more than that .
It 's the marriage of that and humanity .
"" It 's the sort of sentiment which explains why some people love Apple and others loathe it . ""
Older people sit down and ask , ' What is it ? '
"" Jobs once said . ""
But the boy asks , ' What can I do with it ? '
"" Right now , with the iPad , the media industry is asking : "" How can we make some money from it ? """
2010-07-19,"It has been a year of change in the traditional media industry – new editors at the Sun and the Daily Telegraph , new chairmen and chief executives at ITV and Channel 4 – while twice as many people are using Facebook and Twitter as they were this time last year .
The paywalls went up at News International , Steve Jobs launched a tablet computer that may – or may not – be the saviour of the publishing industry , and a once little - known BBC radio station was doomed and then saved by an online campaign , more proof of the power and popularity of social media .
Oh , and the country also elected a new government .
Eventually .
Extraordinary promise
In the 10th year of the MediaGuardian 100 we also have a new No 1 , Apple 's Steve Jobs knocking Larry Page and Sergey Brin from the summit after their three years at the top for founding Google .
Jobs eclipsed his previous high – the runner - up spot in 2006 – on the back of the gamechanging iPhone and the extraordinary promise of the iPad .
It was a choice that generated much debate among our panel of seasoned media watchers , even before last week 's problems , almost as much as the decision to put Rupert Murdoch back above James Murdoch in our media pecking order .
The MediaGuardian 100 focuses on economic , political and cultural influence in the UK .
Murdoch Sr 's ranking fell in recent years as his attention switched to the US and the Wall Street Journal .
With his decision to put paywalls around the Times and the Sunday Times , his gaze returned firmly to these shores and father eclipsed son once again .
It has been another difficult year for the BBC 's director general , Mark Thompson , but we have been saying that since 2007 .
It began with James Murdoch 's attack on the BBC in Edinburgh last year and ends in uncertainty over how tough the new government is going to be on the 88-year - old corporation .
That the BBC is going to shrink is not in doubt , but the suspicion is that the culture secretary , Jeremy Hunt – this year 's highest new entry in ninth place – will not be quite so pugnacious in the coalition government as he was in opposition .
Twitter and Facebook are both represented in the top 10 , with Twitter 's Evan Williams two places ahead of Facebook 's founder , Mark Zuckerberg .
Not everyone was convinced .
"" Twitter is the single most influential thing in my life , "" said one panellist .
"" What ? "" replied another . ""
More than food and water ?
""
New entry
The social media pair straddle a rather old media star , Simon Cowell , who moves to a new high of sixth place .
Cowell 's continuing importance to ITV is reflected by his ranking , four places ahead of ITV 's chairman , Archie Norman .
The second highest new entry earns his place because of the onscreen resurgence of the commercial channel .
We are still waiting to see the impact of Norman 's first hiring , ITV chief executive Adam Crozier , who just missed out .
It was a year when digital media continued to rise .
New entries include Wikileaks 's founder , Julian Assange , Wikipedia co - founder Jimmy Wales and , in 14th place , Mark Rock , the founder and chief executive of Audioboo , the sound - sharing application .
Chris Evans returns for the first time since 2007 , on the back of his record - breaking BBC Radio 2 breakfast show .
Evans is nearly 50 places ahead of the man in charge of BBC Radio , Tim Davie , who suffered a setback when the BBC Trust rebuffed his plans for 6 Music .
Other new entries include Channel 4 's new chief executive David Abraham , Telegraph Media Group chief executive Murdoch MacLennan , Nicholas Shott , the Tories ' favourite media banker , and the internet guru Clay Shirky .
Big risers include Matthew Freud , on the back of his London 2012 Olympics win , and Alexander Lebedev , following his purchase of the Independent , and the BBC 's Nick Robinson , boosted by a good general election .
Slipping down this year 's list are Channel Five 's chairman and chief executive , Dawn Airey , ahead of the station 's likely sale , Sir Michael Lyons , who faces an uncertain future as chairman of the beleaguered BBC Trust , and Sky News 's Adam Boulton who , unlike Robinson , had an election to forget .
Boulton 's furious on - air row with Alastair Campbell was one of the two media bust - ups of the year .
If only the other , when James Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks stormed into the offices of the Independent to berate its editor Simon Kelner , had also been caught on camera .
Brooks is another one of this year 's high - profile fallers , a reflection not only of a difficult year for her but a feeling among our panel that newspapers ' influence was continuing to wane . ""
Far too much credence has been given to the influence of newspapers , "" said the panel .

The election was evidence that they are not the power we once thought .
"" A snapshot of media power today , the MediaGuardian 100 is intended to be a starting point for debate , rather than the end of it .
No list is definitive , nor can it hope to be .
One thing is for sure , however .
This series of Big Brother will be the last on C4 , and the long - running reality show is rewarded with the number 100 spot in the list .
Piers Morgan and the ITV Digital Monkey , both former occupants of the basement slot , made unlikely comebacks .
Will Big Brother do the same ?"
2010-07-19,"Not content with heading today 's MediaGuardian 100 as the most powerful man ( or indeed , woman ) in media , Steve Jobs has now been immortalised in both Sims - style animation and as Darth ' Gates ' Vader 's successor .
Here 's the iPhone 4 antennagate saga as it really happened .

2010-07-20,"Record sales of Mac computers and strong demand for the iPad has helped Apple post its highest ever quarterly earnings .
Steve Jobs declared last night that Apple had enjoyed a "" phenomenal quarter "" , after it smashed analyst forecasts .
Revenues rose 88 % to $ 15.7bn ( £ 10.2bn ) in the three months to 26 June , with net quarterly profit up 78 % at $ 3.25bn .
Jobs also insisted that the iPhone 4 was the most successful launch in the company 's history despite the well - documented problems with the handset 's antenna .
Shaw Wu , analyst at Kaufman Bros , said the results were "" spectacular "" .
The company sold 3.47 million Macs worldwide , and 3.27 million iPads .
"" iPad is off to a terrific start , more people are buying Macs than ever before , and we have amazing new products still to come this year , "" said Jobs .
Apple 's results were released after the close of trading on Wall Street , and its shares jumped by more than 2.5 % in after - hours trading .
Apple 's Mac computers have taken something of a back seat in recent months , with attention being mainly devoted to the iPad tablet computer and the new iPhone .
Last night 's results suggest a growing trend .
"" There is a virtuous circle going on with Apple , as customers who are exposed to the iPhone and iPad also want a Mac , "" said Colin Gillis of BGC Partners in a research note .
Tim Cook , Apple 's chief operating officer , said that around half the Macs sold during the quarter went to new users .
He also revealed that 50 % of Fortune 100 companies in America are either testing or deploying the iPad .
Apple has deferred revenue of $ 175 m to cover the cost of providing cases to address antenna problems with the iPhone 4 , but denied that the issue had hit sales . ""
Let me be clear about this —
we are selling every unit we can make currently , "" said Cook .
"" My phone is ringing off the hook with people who want more supply . "" Sales of the iPhone fell slightly quarter - on - quarter , to 8.4 million from 8.75 million , as customers waited for the launch of the iPhone 4 in late June .
The figures also suggested that the iPod 's best days are well behind it .
Apple sold just over 9.4 million units , the lowest figure since the summer of 2006 .
Apple predicted that revenues in the current quarter would hit $ 18bn , which is higher than analyst forecasts .
Some critics have claimed Apple has been deliberately restricting the availability of the iPad and iPhone 4 to push up demand , a charge Cook robustly denied : "" We are selling both products as fast as we can make them , so we are quoting longer lead times than we 'd like , and we 're working round the clock to alleviate this . """
2010-07-24,"A milestone has been reached , a Rubicon crossed .
With the news , announced on the Guardian 's front page on Wednesday , that ebook sales on Amazon have outstripped hardbacks for the first time , I have decided no longer to pay attention to hi - tech company marketing memos .
That means that next time Mark Zuckerman converts another half billion users to Facebook , Jeff Bezos converts another half million words to Kindle ebook format , or Steve Jobs farts to the left – or will it be to the right this time ?
–
I wo n't be reading .
It 's not that such announcements are n't sometimes genuine news .
The latest Amazon press release , for example , does confirm an admittedly fairly widespread suspicion that when consumers buy overpriced shiny gadgets , they spend a certain amount of money using them .
IPhone users download apps .
ITunes users download songs .
Kindle users download paid - for ebooks ..
No one could deny that ebook readers are catching on .
What surprises me , though , amid the endless "" what format do you prefer ? ""
real and e - navel gazing that goes on whenever someone says "" ebook "" , is how slow this catching on process is proving to be .
Ebooks are cheaper to produce , are n't made out of trees , do n't take up space , do n't weigh anything , do fit in your pocket ( as a whole library ) , can be viewed in a customisable font size , are easily annotated , readable in the dark , better , cleverer and better again .
But still everyone says , oh I do n't know , surely real books are better because , oh I do n't know , you can read them in the bath .
( To which the answer is yes , but you ca n't get real books read aloud to you while you have a proper bath ) .
What news stories like this really show is that the rampant technology fetishism , which runs like e - wildfire through our i - society , is really only skin - deep .
To be sure , the fetishism is real enough , evidenced by the way in which our interest is so often more in the medium than its content .
"" What format do you read your newspapers in ? ""
( not : "" Did you read the news today ? "" ) . ""
Does your phone have a wide enough angle to take in the ceiling of the Sistine chapel ? ""
( not : "" The Sistine chapel 's ceiling is too much to take in in one go "" ) .
If the future develops along the lines being laid by the present , the question of the century wo n't be : "" Where were you when Barack Obama was assassinated ? ""
but "" Did you read about the dematerialisation of Steve Jobs on the iLavatory Mk 3.14 or Mk 3.14159265 ?
Mk 3.1 ?
Oh dear , you must be distraught ? ""
But the reality is that these shallow obsessions disguise a simple , pervasive conservatism .
Imagine if William Caxton had returned to Westminster with his new printing press and everyone had said : "" What 's this newfangled nonsense ?
Hand - copied is much better –
you really get the sense you 're getting something for your money .
( And besides , what are you doing with this euro - tech ?
You ca n't trust it you know . "" )
Sure , there will have been some moaning from the guild of copyists or some such , but you would n't have caught Caxton printing questionnaires asking readers whether they like the new technology or not .
It 's not just media technology , either .
Can you imagine the architects of the great cathedrals trying to get planning permission today , or even obtaining agreement on how best to honour the spirit of the past ?
Hagia Sophia was built in five years following the destruction of the fifth century church , yet it 's taken the architectural , engineering , design and financial might concentrated on Manhattan island nearly nine years to replace the fallen twin towers with this .
We flatter ourselves with endless talk about living at the "" cutting edge "" in an era of "" constant change "" and "" permanent technological revolution "" .
Most of the time , though , by conspiring to keep capacity at a set distance from potential , the progress implicit in the technological cycle of perpetual upgrading is an illusion we use to distract us from the numbingly slow speed at which real change actually takes place .
How else do you explain that , over 80 years after women obtained equal voting rights in this country , we still ca n't get more than four of them round the cabinet table , or more than one woman for every nine men into our company boardrooms ?
Still , at least we can read all about it on the latest iDespair format while waiting distractedly for society to upgrade itself ."
2010-08-10,"The disgraced former Hewlett - Packard boss Mark Hurd , who was ousted on Friday in a sexual harassment and expenses scandal , has found a heavyweight ally in the billionaire Oracle software tycoon Larry Ellison who has blasted the computer company over its "" cowardly "" handling of the affair .
Ellison , a revered figure in Silicon Valley , who is America 's third richest man , waded into a deepening furore over Hurd 's departure today with a furious email to the New York Times in which he stands up for his friend and occasional tennis opponent .
"" The HP board just made the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs many years ago , "" wrote Ellison .
"" That decision nearly destroyed Apple and would have if Steve had n't come back and saved them . ""
In a drama that has enthralled the US business world , Hurd abruptly quit as chief executive of HP last week following an investigation into his relationship with a former actress , Jodie Fisher , who had been hired by the company as a marketing consultant to make appearances at corporate events .
Fisher accused the HP boss of sexual harassment .
Although HP 's board found no violation of the company 's harassment policy , Hurd was accused of making improper expense claims to the tune of some $ 20,000 to cover meals , travel and , in one case , an appearance fee for the 50-year - old actress , whose film credits include restricted R - rated films such as Intimate Obsession and Body of Influence 2 .
Friends of Hurd argue that he has been harshly treated by a board of directors scared by even a whiff of scandal .
Ellison said : "" In losing Mark Hurd , the HP board failed to act in the best interests of HP 's employees , shareholders , customers and partners . ""
The software billionaire said Hurd had spent five years doing a "" brilliant job "" restoring HP to its "" former greatness "" after "" a long list of failed CEOs "" .
Ellison took particular exception to the fact that HP 's board went public with the unproven allegation of sexual harassment against Hurd , claiming , without naming a source , that this was the subject of a narrow 6-to-4 vote by directors . ""
Publishing known false sexual harassment claims is not good corporate governance ; it 's cowardly corporate governance , "" said Ellison , who pointed out that a slump in HP 's shares has already cost investors more than $ 10bn .
"" Those six directors caused HP to lose a nearly irreplaceable CEO . ""
He added that it was "" not credible "" to accuse Hurd of fiddling expenses : "" Mark Hurd , like most other CEOs , does not fill out his own expense reports , so even if errors were made , Mark did n't make them .
What the expense fraud claims do reveal is an HP board desperately grasping at straws in trying to publicly explain the unexplainable ; how a false sexual harassment claim and some petty expense report errors led to the loss of one of Silicon Valley 's best and most respected leaders . ""
Hurd has won plaudits in the investment community for streamlining HP , which was a sprawling business struggling to swallow a takeover of rival Compaq when he took the top job .
HP 's shares almost doubled during Hurd 's tenure and the company made another large acquisition in services firm EDS ."
2010-09-02,"Having cornered the MP3 player , mobile phone and computer tablet markets with the iPod , iPhone and iPad devices respectively , last night Apple announced its latest expansion – into social media – with Ping .
Ping will be integrated into Apple 's latest iTunes software update and will enable users , or "" Pingers "" , to follow musicians , friends and others to see details including what music they 're buying and what concerts they 're attending .
Steve Jobs , Apple 's chairman and chief executive , said the information will arrive in a long stream of updates , similar to the way Facebook and Twitter work .
"" Be as private or as public as you want .
The privacy is super - easy to set up , "" he said adding that users can choose to automatically accept followers or decide on a follower - by - follower basis – similar sounding controls to those on Twitter .
The service is available immediately to more than 160 million iTunes users , Jobs said , and will also be available across the iPhone and iPod Touch ranges .
The feature is believed to have been based on the technology Apple acquired with the purchase of the former online music store Lala.com last year .
The iTunes logo will no longer feature a CD – mirroring the change in the program 's focus .
Jobs unveiled a range of other upgrades to its products and services , including a new version of Apple TV – which will allow users to stream television programmes and films .
The company is also releasing a revamped range of iPods , including an iPod touch with front- and rear - facing camera , Jobs told an assembled crowd of journalists , bloggers and analysts in California .
Until now the Apple TV device was "" never a huge hit "" , admitted Jobs .
The box originally allowed users to buy films and television programmes , but the latest version , which is smaller and , at $ 99 , much cheaper than its $ 229 predecessor , will only allow the renting , rather than purchasing , of content .
Users will pay $ 4.99 for high - definition films on the day they come out on DVD , while the rent of high - definition TV shows will be $ 0.99 , Apple announced .
"" We 've sold a lot of them , but it 's never been a huge hit , "" Jobs said of Apple TV .
The new version will be available within a month .
Jobs also introduced a new design across the range of iPods , including the latest Nano , featuring a rotatable screen and a new Shuffle which sees the return of buttons – its predecessor was voice activated .
The new iPod Touch will have front- and rear - facing cameras , the latter of which will be able to record HD video content , Jobs added ."
2010-09-04,"You have to feel sorry for Sony sometimes .
I mean to say , there it was on Wednesday in Berlin , at the IFA consumer electronics show , launching a new music and video download service called Qriocity ( it 's like "" curiosity "" , only it could n't get the domain name , I suppose )
– and what happens ?
Steve Jobs goes on stage in San Francisco and announces that Apple is having another go at the TV download business .
And guess who gets all the media coverage ?
How are the mighty fallen .
I remember a time when Sony dominated the gadgetry business , when it was a synonym for elegant design and advanced functionality , when Walkmans ruled the world .
It had shops in upmarket malls where young males came to drool .
And now ?
Ask a teenager about Sony and s / he will reply : "" Are n't they the outfit that makes flat - screen TVs and DVD players and other stuff for adults ? ""
Analysing the reasons for Sony 's fall from grace would make for an interesting MBA thesis .
My favoured candidates are a failure to understand software and missing the significance of the internet .
Whatever the explanation , however , the outcome was what we witnessed last week – massive coverage of Steve Jobs strutting his stuff in San Francisco , while over in Berlin poor old Fujio Nishida , president of Sony Europe , might as well have been flogging army - surplus radios in a Baghdad souk .
Which is a pity because the world needs a competitive market in multimedia downloads and , at the moment , Apple looks like scooping the pool .
In his presentation , Jobs announced a new device that will deliver 99¢ rentals of TV shows over the net .
This replaces the old Apple TV device , which was launched in 2007 and stored video purchased from the iTunes store for display on a domestic television set , but which never really caught on .
"" We 've sold a lot of them , "" said His Steveness , "" but it 's never been a huge hit .
"" The device was , he said , "" too complicated for average consumers "" .
The sole fly in his ointment was that only two US networks have signed up to rent their shows via the new gizmo .
One is Fox , a network whose doings passeth all understanding ; the other is ABC , which is owned by Disney , of which Jobs is the largest single shareholder .
But the other networks have stayed aloof , for the very good reason that turkeys eschew Christmas .
They see the day coming when Apple will exert the kind of control over them that it now has over record companies .
Jobs appeared unperturbed by such laggardly behaviour .
"" We think the rest of the studios will see the light and get onboard , "" he said , loftily , before adding that Netflix , the video - rental company , has also climbed "" onboard "" .
Henceforth , first - run HD movies will be available for rental for $ 4.99 on the same day as they are released on DVD .
Netflix executives are doubtless extolling this deal to their shareholders as a brilliant strategic move .
But in fact they are being nice to the crocodile in the hope that it will eat them last .
If the new Apple service / device proves a hit , then the movie studios will indeed get onboard the iTunes bandwagon , in which case they will begin to wonder why they need Netflix as an intermediary .
But I digress .
Since nothing interests the mainstream media as much as television , Jobs 's announcement of the new Apple TV device attracted most of the attention .
In the process , another Apple initiative went under - reported – a new "" feature "" in the latest version of iTunes .
It 's called Ping and is described as "" a social network for music "" .
And it starts with 160 million members , the current number of iTunes users .
The idea is that you can elect to "" follow "" – and be followed by – your friends , so that you know what music they 're playing and vice versa .
And , quite by accident , there 's a "" buy "" button somewhere conveniently to hand .
"" It 's like Facebook and Twitter meet iTunes , "" said Jobs , which is a bit rich , not to say misleading .
"" As far as I can tell , "" writes John Battelle , a well - known commentator on these things , "" they in fact do n't ever meet .
You ca n't leverage your networks on Facebook and Twitter in Ping .
It 's another closed Apple system , another Apple universe in a gilded gift box . ""
Dave Winer , one of the elder statesmen of the web , signed up for Ping on launch day and found that he 'd been assigned the username "" scriptingnews "" .
"" They did n't give me a choice of name , "" he writes .
"" That 's the name I chose when I got my first iPod or whatever got me logged into their store the first time .
I never would have chosen to be scriptingnews on a social network .
Not at all obvious how to change it , if I can .
""
Welcome to Steve 's Walled Garden .

Wake up , Sony ."
2010-09-07,"Google will launch its Google TV service , which it intends will bring the web to TV screens , in the US this autumn and around the world next year , its chief executive , Eric Schmidt , said today .
In its sights will be a slice of the £ 117bn global TV advertising market – which it will want to add to its online advertising revenues , which totalled $ 22.9bn ( £ 14.94bn ) in 2009 .
The announcement , just a week after Apple 's chief executive , Steve Jobs , unveiled a miniaturised version of his Apple TV , which lets people rent films and TV shows , and stream content from YouTube , shows that the television set has become the new battleground for the two companies , which are also competing for market share in the smartphone and tablet computer markets .
On the latter topic , Schmidt told the closing session of the IFA consumer electronics show in Berlin that Google will announce partnerships later this year with computer companies making tablet computers rivalling Apple 's iPad , and that they will use Google 's new Chrome operating system for computers rather than its Android product , which has been used so far on smartphones and a slew of tablet computers announced at the IFA show .
Schmidt said the Google TV service , which would allow full internet browsing via the television , would be free , and that Google would work with a variety of programme makers and electronics manufacturers to bring it to consumers .
But Google does not envisage becoming a programme producer in its own right , as that does not fit its model – which is to use other people 's content rather than to create its own .
The only content that Google produces itself is Street View , which has been the source of a number of privacy complaints in various countries .
"" We will work with content providers but it is very unlikely that we will get into actual content production , "" Schmidt told journalists after his speech .
Google TV will consist of software written by Google embedded into hardware made by other companies : in the US , Schmidt said , it will launch on three products – an HDTV set and a Blu - ray player from Sony , and a set - top box from Logitech .
Google will also run a marketplace for small apps to run on Google TV .
The content will use Adobe 's Flash Player , used on video sites such as YouTube and Vimeo .
Demonstrations of the TV at the show suggested that it will look like a simplified computer interface , with widgets offering information about the weather , time and calendar , but also with links to web browsers , Facebook , email and YouTube .
However , there is still doubt about how easy it will be to integrate content intended for viewing on a computer with that for a TV set .
Google 's own guide for developers says that "" all input devices for Google TV will have QWERTY keyboards "" but adds that "" users needs interactions that are fast and easy to do – at a distance , with one hand , in the dark .
"" It also hints that people may be able to control the screen via a mouse , but admits that "" mouse control is difficult "" on a TV set that is on the other side of the room from the user ."
2010-09-15,"You may have heard that Steve Jobs is a ninja .
No ?
Yes , the fabulous rumour that has been circulating -
and I ca n't think why it has n't immediately been dissected by Lost
In Showbiz - is that Jobs was stopped at a Japanese airport and told that he could n't take his ninja throwing stars on board his private jet .
SPA !
magazine reported ( possibly a better verb would be something more like "" writted "" ) it , and then Bloomberg , which is never going to let the chance slip to see what effect a crazy story might have on a company 's stock price , reported the report .
To which Apple , sighing and rolling its eyes , said that while Jobs did visit Kyoto in July , "" the incidents described at the airport at pure fiction "" .
No matter !
That hardworking team at Next Media Animation ( whose slogan should be "" no story 's so weird that we ca n't make it even weirder with our strange avatars "" ) , has pitched in with its own video .
Or , as John Paczkowski puts it so perfectly over at AllThingsD , "" Shurikens on a plane ! ""
( Certainly , Jobs would be up to the linguistic demands of such a film . )
Of course this does raise the point that ( 1 ) Apple did n't actually deny that Jobs is a ninja - bit of wiggle room there .
Or perhaps he does have the ninja stars , but he was n't stopped .
Ah - ha !
We also wonder what Apple - made ninja stars would look like .
Fewer points ?
Really , really shiny ?
Made of super - sharp eternium steel ?"
2010-09-20,"As a freelance journalist , much of your spare time is spent trying to get information from people who at best could n't give a crap about your article , and at worst are actively hostile to the idea of some grubby writer getting his or her hands on their precious secrets .
That a journalism student has had a similar response from Apple is not exactly unusual .
Take for example this recent response from the Department of Health to a Freedom of Information request I filed , scripted presumably by the writers of ' Yes Minister ' : "" The Department neither confirms nor denies that it holds information falling within the description specified in your request .

My relationship with them deteriorated to the point where they wrote a press release about me ( you can find my response to that here ) .
Even before that , my relationship with their spokesperson Cristal Sumner could best be described as frosty .
While the Department of Health were unhelpful in a stylish and entertaining sort of way , the BHA were just plain uncooperative , as you can see in the following exchange .
Referring to a comment Cristal had made about homeopathic remedies struggling in clinical trials because they needed to be "" individualised "" to specific patients , I asked her : "" does this not apply to the mass - produced remedies made by companies like Nelson 's , and sold off - the - shelf to millions of customers at Boots ?
These clearly are n't holistic or individualised treatments , since patients wo n't receive a personal consultation or assessment . ""
In other words , if homeopathic remedies need to be individualised , surely the mass produced ones are inferior ?
The reply was a curt : "" The BHA supports a person 's legal right to buy and use homeopathic medicines . ""
And those are mild examples .
I get abuse from people on a weekly basis , like the following : "" You are so dimwitted that you can not see the wood for the trees , you will still be kissing the shoes of your muslim overlord 's when they decapitate you , that is how stupid and dangerous you really are .

"" The point being that if you 're going to start out in journalism , you 'd better develop a thick skin , because there 's no rule that says people have to be nice , or helpful , or not threaten you with eternal damnation .
For that reason you have to be polite , persistent , diplomatic , and willing to probe a story from many different angles .

Filling your e - mail essay with snark directed at someone you need help from , and who probably did n't even know you existed until the contents of your spleen spontaneously appeared in their inbox .

So , obviously , being a wannabe journalist , since the story was about Apple , she contacted its press office .

Subject : Re : Mr. Jobs - Student Journalist Concerned about Apple 's MediaRelations Dept .
Dear Mr. Jobs , ""
As a college student , I can honestly say that Apple has treated me very well ; my iPod is basically the lifeline that gets me through the day , and thanks to Apple 's Final Cut Pro , I aced last semester 's video editing project .
I was planning to buy a new Apple computer to add to my list of Apple favorites .
Because I have had such good experiences as a college student using Apple products , I was incredibly surprised to find Apple 's Media Relations Department to be absolutely unresponsive to my questions , which ( as I had repeatedly told them in voicemail after voicemail ) are vital to my academic grade as a student journalist .
For my journalism course , I am writing an article about the implementation of an iPad program at my school , the CW Post Campus of Long Island University .
The completion of this article is crucial to my grade in the class , and it may potentially get published in our university 's newspaper .
I had 3 quick questions regarding iPads , and wanted to obtain answers from the most credible source :
Apple 's Media Relations Department .
I have called countless times throughout the week , leaving short , but detailed , messages which included my contact information and the date of my deadline .
Today , I left my 6th message , which stressed the increasingly more urgent nature of the situation .
It is now the end of the business day , and I have not received a call back .
My deadline is tomorrow .
Mr. Jobs , I humbly ask why Apple is so wonderfully attentive to the needs of students , whether it be with the latest , greatest invention or the company 's helpful customer service line , and yet , ironically , the Media Relations Department fails to answer any of my questions which are , as I have repeatedly told them , essential to my academic performance .
For colleges nationwide , Apple is at the forefront of improving the way we function in the academic environment , increasing the efficiency of conducting academic research , as well as sharing and communicating with our college communities .
With such an emphasis on advancing our education system , why , then , has Apple 's Media Relations team ignored my needs as a student journalist who is just trying to get a good grade ?
In addition to the hypocrisy of ignoring student needs when they represent a company that does so much for our schools , the Media Relations reps are apparently , also failing to responsibly handle the inquiries of professional journalists on deadlines .
Unfortunately , for a journalist in the professional world , lacking the answers they need on deadline day wo n't just cost them a grade ; it could cost them their job .
Thank you very much for your time and consideration .

To :
Chelsea Isaacs Subject : Re : Mr. Jobs - Student Journalist Concerned about Apple 's MediaRelations Dept .
Please leave us alone .
Sent from my iPhone We have had no response from Apple on whether the emails are legit .
We 're quite confident that they come from within Apple ( they come from the 17.x.x.x IP range , which is assigned to Apple)-
but there seem to be three possibilities for who 's writing them : 1 ) Steve Jobs .
This is the most likely answer , though there has been an instance where Apple 's PR people have - shockingly - roused themselves to say that one such conversation is a fake , though in that case the person having the conversation had been hawking it around for money .
Isaacs has n't asked for money , and has answered our questions .
2 )
Someone inside Apple who has been given the job of answering as though they 're Steve Jobs to random emails from outside .
If that 's the case , they 're not covering themselves in glory .
3 )
Someone inside Apple who has been assigned this email address , and is responding as best they can , but ca n't really handle it .
Whichever it is , Apple would probably do well to stop that person sending responses to people outside Apple .
Honestly , it does n't look good .
And it might also make sense for Apple 's PR department to recruit a couple more people .
Chelsea Isaacs , meanwhile , joins the vast ranks of journalists who 've put media queries into Apple and never heard back .
Unfortunately , it 's not what you 'd call an exclusive club .
And as far as we know , she did n't get the answers about the iPad either ."
2010-09-23,"Mark Zuckerberg probably likes Forbes today : the magazine has named him the 35th richest – as in most valuable – person in the US , passing Steve Jobs ( 42nd ) and Rupert Murdoch ( 38th ) on the way .
The co - founder of Facebook , aged 26 , is estimated to be worth $ 6.9bn ( £ 4.4bn ) , based on his shareholding in the social networking site , which boasts 500 million members worldwide .
The value is calculated based on recent investments in his company by outside businesses in return for shares .
That has tripled since last year – the largest relative increase on this year 's Forbes US rich list .
The complete Forbes list of the 400 richest people in the US is topped , as it has been for years , by Bill Gates , the co - founder of Microsoft , who has since left it to carry out charitable work in the developing world .
His shares in the company are valued at $ 54bn – up by $ 4bn from last year .
Zuckerberg is one of only eight members of the US list under 40 .
Two of the others are co - founders of Facebook – one of them , Dustin Moskovitz , is the youngest on the list , born just eight days after Zuckerberg , and worth $ 1.4bn .
Two others of the under-40 set are the co - founders of Google , Sergey Brin and Larry Page , both worth $ 15bn and aged 37 , making them equal 11th on the list .
The list shows the dominance of technology companies in creating value in the US .
Out of the top 50 , 13 are in technology companies .
After Gates , the third most valuable is Larry Ellison , chief executive of the database company Oracle ( $ 27bn ) ; other technology companies including Microsoft , Amazon ( Jeff Bezos , 18th with $ 12.6bn ) , Apple
( Jobs is valued at $ 6.1bn from his shares in Apple and Disney Pixar ) , SAS Institute ( which makes business analytics software ) , Google ( Eric Schmidt , the chief executive , is 48th at $ 5.45bn ) , eBay ( co - founder Pierre Omidyar is 47th with $ 5.5bn ) .
Murdoch , the News Corp chairman and chief executive , is valued at $ 6.2bn .
The listing also shows that the stock market has been kind to the billionaires : where last year , a fortune of $ 950 m was enough to get you into the top 400 , the entry price has risen again to $ 1bn .
In all , the 400 are worth a total of $ 1.37tn , compared with $ 1.27tn last year – an increase of nearly 8 % , compared to the stock market 's rise of just 1 % .
Most benefited from growth in their companies : after a dismal 2009 , when 314 out of the 400 saw a fall in their wealth in the wake of the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers and the banking crisis , the top 10 this year gained $ 24.9bn in value ( after dropping $ 40bn in value last year ) , and 217 of the list are now worth more than a year ago .
Only 84 have seen decreases in their calculated wealth ."
2010-09-23,"Mark Zuckerberg , the 26-year - old co - founder of Facebook who today overtook Steve Jobs and Rupert Murdoch on the Forbes rich list , has afforded TechCrunch a big interview to shed some light on the rumoured "" Facebook phone "" .
The internet was abuzz this weekend when speculation began growing about a Facebook - branded mobile phone ; a chain - reaction of modestly - informed conjecture began with a TechCrunch article on Sunday .
Now Zuck has sought to clear the air - with TechCrunch in particular - saying such misinformation makes partners ( Apple and Google , among others )
"" think that we 're trying to compete with them , that makes them not want to work with us "" .
And : "" If I knew who leaked it to you , I would 've fired them already "" .
Facebook is not out to compete with manufacturers or companies building operating systems , Zuckerberg clarified : "" What I can say generally is that our goal is not to build an operating system from scratch , or else not to design hardware from scratch .
Our goal is to make it so that we can design the best integrations in the widest variety of phones . ""
[ ... ] I mean , who knows , 10 years down the road , maybe we 'll build our own operating system or something , but who knows .
That is more history than we 've had so far with the company , so it is really hard to predict that far out . ""
And on the decidedly woolly "" Facebook - branded phone "" moniker quickly attached to the supposedly top - secret project , he said no conversations had reached the "" level of detail "" necessary for any manufacturer to carry its branding , saying : "" So , do we have any conversation with someone to do deep integration ?
I 'm sure we do .
And I 'm sure we 're talking to them about marketing . ""
Taking a chunk out of Google 's recent pronouncements on adding "" social layers "" to existing products , he added : "" One thing that I think is really important — that I think is context for this , is that I generally think that most other companies now are undervaluing how important social integration is .
So even the companies that are starting to come around to thinking , ' oh maybe we should do some social stuff ' , I still think a lot of them are only thinking about it on a surface layer , where it 's like ' OK
, I have my product , maybe I 'll add two or three social features and we 'll check that box ' .
That 's not what social is . ""
Zuckerberg said the company is ploughing more development time into HTML5 as a way to standardise the site across different platforms .
"" It 's kind of a disaster right now , "" he said , pointing to the number of times one product has to be written .
"" I really hope that the direction that this stuff goes in is one where there 's more of a standard and again I think we have some people who are pretty good at working on this
and hopefully we can capitalize on that because frankly we do n't
…
we have 4 or 500 engineers at the company , it 's pretty hard for us to build a lot of new products and build them all for these different platforms . ""
So if something like HTML5 becomes a big standard then that would be hugely valuable for us .
So we 'll help push that .
I imagine that over the long term that will be the solution to this problem that you 're talking about .
How is Facebook appropriating its time across mobile devices ?
His answer : "" So , iPhone is the one we 're investing in the most now , and Android increasingly .
If Windows Phone 7 takes off , then I 'm sure we 'll put resources on that . [ ... ]
So maybe we 're not building a lot of specific stuff for RIM and Blackberry , but the HTML5 stuff that we 're doing will work there .
[ Though it wo n't on Windows Phone 7 , which wo n't support HTML5 for some time - Charles Arthur ] "" [ ... ]
But I think the main message that I would hope that you guys would come away with from our strategy is that our goal is breadth not depth , "" Zuckerberg surmised .
Got that ?"

2010-10-14,"Next week Apple will release its fourth - quarter fiscal earnings report and , if projections are correct , it will be yet another record - breaking quarter for the electronics monolith , with revenues in excess of £ 13bn .
Needless to say , it 's been a good year for Steve Jobs and the rest of the gang in Cupertino .
The world 's No 1 electronics brand 's stock is at a record high that analysts say will continue to rally throughout 2011 due to increasing global demand for the iPad .
But there is a minor threat that the feel - good vibes of Apple 's supernatural profits will be undermined by a different kind of report .
Released earlier this week , Workers as machines : military management in Foxconn is a critical evaluation of the company that manufactures iPhones and iPads , among other brands of gadgetry .
Produced by the non - profit organisation Students and Scholars against Corporate Misbehaviour ( Sacom ) , the report contains the findings of a four - month investigation of the working conditions at the Foxconn factories in Shenzhen and Hangzhou , where 17 workers killed themselves earlier this year , many of them by jumping out of factory windows .
In addition to the numerous issues explored in the report , which include allegations of illegal labour practices and unsafe facilities , it contends that Foxconn workers are subject to a management culture of "" absolute obedience "" .
According to the report , factory employees are disciplined if they fail to make production quotas or spend too much time in the bathroom .
Punishment may take the form of public humiliation , confession or the rote transcription of quotes from Foxconn chairman ( and Taiwan 's richest man ) Terry Guo , which include such gems as : "" Hungry people have especially clear minds "" and "" a harsh environment is a good thing "" .
The report 's descriptions of the Foxconn work and dormitory environment reads like an Orwellian laundry list .
Those who do n't return to their room before the 23:30 curfew are forced to "" volunteer "" for janitorial duty .
Workers are not permitted to talk , nap , laugh or stretch while they work .
Those required to stand while working are instructed to stand like a soldier .
Foxconn security guards , who some workers consider more of a private police force , often insult and sometimes physically attack the workers .
The report also claims that the promises of a pay raises made after the suicides failed to materialise , or were offset by other deductions .
Specific to Apple 's recent fourth - quarter triumph , the report quotes a Foxconn engineer who states that during the production of the first - generation iPad , workers had to work 12 hours per day and were only permitted to rest every 13th day .
In response to the report , Foxconn has stated that it "" strongly and categorically rejects "" the allegations and that "" Foxconn is certainly not perfect , but we take our responsibility to our employees very seriously and we are committed to giving each and every one of our more than 937,000 employees in China a safe and positive working environment and compensation and benefits that are competitive with all of our industry peers . ""
Meanwhile , when contacted Apple maintained that they are "" committed to ensuring the highest standards of social responsibility throughout our supply base "" .
Jobs has yet to personally comment on the Sacom report , but when news of the suicides surfaced in June , he insisted that Foxconn was "" not a sweatshop "" and that "" Apple does one of the best jobs of any company understanding the working conditions of our supply chain "" .
Although a number of electronics firms outsource their production to Foxconn , those protesting the conditions at the company are focusing their ire on Apple .
In their report , Sacom point out that the Apple supplier code of conduct was designed to protect workers from the very abuse they have witnessed , but claims that the majority of Foxconn workers have no knowledge that such a code exists .
The iPhone 4 currently retails at £ 599 , but is estimated by iSupply , a technology research firm , to cost a mere $ 6.54 ( £ 4.12 ) to manufacture - that is , put together - in China ( the researchers estimate the cost of the components , which come from various sources , at a further $ 187.51 ) .
If , as Jobs has stated , Apple is indeed aware of the working conditions at Foxconn , and if the Sacom report is factual , then it 's only fair to assume that Apple has taken a rather pragmatic position on its code of conduct and concluded that you ca n't make £ 16bn per quarter without crushing a few spirits .
Perhaps electronics consumers have simply come to accept the unsavoury side of outsourced mass production .
As demonstrated by Banksy 's recent Simpson 's couch gag , the imagery of an Asian sweatshop is anything but shocking .
It 's been woven so tightly into the fabric of western economies that it 's come to be expected .

Transcript courtesy of Seeking Alpha or listen to it here . ""
As most of you know , I do n't usually participate in Apple 's earnings calls since you are all in such capable hands with Peter and Tim .
But I just could n't help dropping by for our first $ 20 billion quarter .
I would like to chat about a few things and then stay for the rest of the Q&amp;A if that 's alright . ""
First , let me discuss iPhone .
We sold 14.1 million iPhones in the quarter which represents a 91 % unit growth over the year - ago quarter and was well ahead of IDC 's latest published estimate of 64 $ growth for the global smartphone market in the September quarter .
And it handily beat RIM 's 12.1 million Blackberry 's sold in their most recent quarter ending in August .
We 've now passed RIM , and I do n't seem them catching up with us in the foreseeable future .
They must move beyond their area of strength and comfort into the unfamiliar territory of trying to become a software platform company .
"" I think it 's going to be a challenge for them to create a competitive platform and to convince developers to create apps for yet a third software platform after iOS and Android .
With 300,000 apps on Apple 's App Store , RIM has a high mountain ahead of them to climb . ""
Well , what about Google ?
Last week , Eric Schmidt reiterated that they are activating 200,000 Android devices per day .
And have around 90,000 apps in their App Store .
For comparison , Apple has activated around 275,000 iOS devices per day on average for the past 30 days with a peak of almost 300,000 iOS devices per day on a few of those days .
And Apple has 300,000 apps on its App Store . ""
Unfortunately , there is no solid data on how many Android phones are shipped each quarter .
We hope that manufacturers will soon start reporting the number of Android handsets they ship each quarter .
But today that just is n't the case .
Gartner reported that around 10 million Android phones were shipped in the June quarter and we await to see if iPhone or Android was the winner in this most recent quarter . ""
Google loves to characterize Android as open , and iOS and iPhone as closed .
We find this a bit disingenuous and clouding the real difference between our two approaches .
The first thing most of us think about when we hear the work open is Windows which is available on a variety of devices .
Unlike Windows , however , where most pc 's have the same user interface and run the same app , Android is very fragmented .
Many Android OEMs , including the two largest , HTC and Motorola install proprietary user interfaces to differentiate themselves from the commodity Android experience .
The users will have to figure it all out .
Compare this with iPhone , where every handset works the same . ""
Twitter client , Twitter Deck
[ actually Tweetdeck ] , recently launched their app for Android .
They reported that they had to contend with more than 100 different versions of Android software on 244 different handsets .
The multiple hardware and software iterations present developers with a daunting challenge .
Many Android apps work only on selected Android handsets running selected Android versions .
And this is for handsets that have been shipped less than 12 months ago .
Compare this with iPhone , where there are two versions of the software , the current and the most recent predecessor to test against . ""
In addition to Google 's own app marketplace , Amazon , Horizon and Vodafone have all announced that they are creating their own app stores for Android .
So there will be at least four app stores on Android , which customers must search among to find the app they want and developers will need to work with to distribute their apps and get paid .
This is going to be a mess for both users and developers .
Contrast this with Apple 's integrated App Store , which offers users the easiest - to - use largest app store in the world , preloaded on every iPhone .
Apple 's App Store has over three times as many apps as Google 's marketplace and offers developers ' one - stop shopping to get their apps to market easily and to get paid swiftly . ""
Even if Google were right , and the real issue is closed versus open , it is worthwhile to remember that open systems do n't always win .
Take Microsoft 's PlaysForSure music strategy , which use the PC model , which Android uses as well , of separating the software components from the hardware components .
Even Microsoft finally abandoned this open strategy in favor of copying Apple 's integrated approach with their Zoom Player , unfortunately leaving their OEMs empty - handed in the process .
Google flirted with this integrated approach with their Nexus One phone . ""
In reality , we think the open versus closed argument is just a smokescreen to try and hide the real issue , which is , what 's best for the customer , fragmented versus integrated .
We think Android is very , very fragmented and becoming more fragmented by the day .
And as you know , Apple 's provides with the integrated model so that the user is n't forced to be the systems integrator .
"" We see tremendous value in having Apple rather than our users ' be the systems integrator .
We think this is a huge strength of our approach compared to Google 's .
When selling to users who want their devices to just work , we believe Integrated will triumph Fragmented every time .
And we also think our developers can be more innovative if they can target a singular platform rather than a hundred variants .
They can put their time into innovative new features rather than testing on hundreds of different handsets . ""
So we are very committed to the integrated approach , no matter how many times Google tries to characterize it as closed .
And we are confident that it will triumph over Google 's fragmented approach , no matter how many times Google tries to characterize it as open . ""
Second , I 'd like to comment on the avalanche of Tablets poised to enter the market in the coming months .
First , it appears to be just a handful of credible entrants , not exactly an avalanche .
Second , almost all of them use seven - inch screens as compared to iPad 's near 10-inch screen .
Let 's start there .
One naturally thinks that a seven - inch screen would offer 70 % of the benefits of a 10-inch screen .
Unfortunately , this is far from the truth .
The screen measurements are diagonal , so that a seven - inch screen is only 45 % as large as iPad 's 10-inch screen .
You heard me right ; just 45 % as large "" If you take an iPad and hold it upright in portrait view and draw an imaginary horizontal line halfway down the screen , the screens on the seven - inch tablets are a bit smaller than the bottom half of the iPad display .
This size is n't sufficient to create great tablet apps in our opinion . ""
Well , one could increase the resolution of the display to make up for some of the difference .
It is meaningless , unless your tablet also includes sandpaper , so that the user can sand down their fingers to around one quarter of the present size .
Apple 's done extensive user - testing on touch interfaces over many years , and we really understand this stuff .
There are clear limits of how close you can physically place elements on a touch screen before users can not reliably tap , flick or pinch them .
This is one of the key reasons we think the 10-inch screen size is the minimum size required to create great tablet apps . ""
Third , every tablet user is also a smartphone user .
No tablet can compete with the mobility of a smartphone , its ease of fitting into your pocket or purse , its unobtrusiveness when used in a crowd .
Given that all tablet users will already have a smartphone in their pockets , giving up precious display area to fit a tablet in our pockets is clearly the wrong tradeoff .
The seven - inch tablets are tweeners , too big to compete with a smartphone and too small to compete with an iPad . ""
Fourth , almost all of these new tablets use Android software , but even Google is telling the tablet manufacturers not to use their current release , Froyo , for tablets , and to wait for a special tablet release next year .
What does it mean when your software suppliers says not to use their software in your tablet ?
And what does it mean when you ignore them and use it anyway ?
"" Fifth , iPad now has over 35,000 apps on the App Store .
This new crop of tablets will have near zero . ""
And sixth and last , our potential competitors are having a tough time coming close to iPad 's pricing , even with their far smaller , far less expensive screens .
The iPad incorporates everything we have learnt about building high value products from iPhones , iPods and Macs .
We create our own A4 chip , our own software , our own battery chemistry , our own enclosure , our own everything .
And this results in an incredible product at a great price .
The proof of this will be in the pricing of our competitor 's products which will likely offer less for more . ""
These are among the reasons we think the current crop of seven - inch tablets are going to be DOA , Dead on Arrival .
Their manufacturers will learn the painful lesson that their tablets are too small and increase the size next year , thereby abandoning both customers and developers who jumped on the seven - inch bandwagon with an orphan product .
Sounds like lots of fun ahead . ""
So thank you , and let me turn it back to Peter for the Q&amp;A session . ""
Later , in the Q+A , he is asked about Flash ( "" we love Flash memory "" he deadpans ) and then about tablet 's effect : Q :
Can you help us understand how you think about the business a year or two years down the road in terms of size of your overall business , impact on enterprise , education , anything you can give to help us on that front ?
Steve Jobs ""
Well , the iPad is clearly going to affect notebook computers .
And I think the iPad proves
, it 's not a question of if , it 's a question of when .
And I think a lot of development and progress that will occur over the next few years .
But we 're already seeing tremendous interest in iPad from education , and much to my surprise , from business .
"" We have n't pushed it real hard in business , and it 's being grabbed out of our hands .
And I talk to people everyday in all kinds of businesses that are using iPads , all the way from Boards of Directors that are shipping iPads around instead of board books , down to nurses and doctors in hospitals and other large and small businesses . ""
So the more time that passes , the more I am convinced that we 've got a tiger by the tail here .
And this is a new model of computing which we 've already got tens of millions of people trained on with the iPhone .
And that lends itself to lots of different aspects of life both personal , educational and business . ""
So , I see it as very general purpose , and I see it as really big .
And the timing , one could argue about the timing endlessly , but I do n't think one could argue that it 's going to happen anymore . ""
Q on tablets : Some of those players may try different things and strategies like Tattering and Flash , multi - tasking , less content and app restrictions and subsidized pricing .
And just wondered if you think that , that may create itself a more fragmented market and how you see that rolling out with regard to Apple ?
Steve Jobs : : "" I have a hard time envisioning what those strategies you mentioned are .
I mean , in terms of pricing , so far , the little we 've seen , the tablets with far less functionality are having a hard time matching us in price .
Flash has n't presented any problem at all .
As you know , most of the video on the web is now available in HTML 5 .
And having the iTunes media store and over 35,000 apps on the App Store for iPad dwarfs anything else .
And we think we have a very good product here
that 's going to be hard to match , and we 're not done .
We 're working on a lot of things for the future . ""
So I do n't know exactly what these strategies are .
And we 've priced iPad pretty aggressively .
So we 're out to win this one .
"" Are smartphones a zero - sum game ?
Jobs : "" Well , as you know the largest market of phones today around the world are not smartphones .
And so over the next several years , many of those non - smartphones are going to convert to smartphones .
And the pie is going to continue to grow , and I think there will be room for some number of companies to be successful .
But eventually , as most of those phones do convert to smartphones , it will turn into a zero sum game or at least a lot closer to that . ""
But I think right now it 's a battle for developers and a battle for the mindshare of developers and a battle for the mindshare of customers .
And right now iPhone and Android are winning that battle .
"" On tablet sizes : "" First of all , Nokia makes $ 50 handsets , and we do n't know how to make a great smartphone for $ 50 .
We 're not smart enough to figure that one out yet , but believe me I 'll let you know , when we do .
So our goal is to make a really breakthrough great product .
Make the best product in every industry that we compete in And to drive the cost down , while constantly making the products better at the same time .
That 's what we did with iPod . ""
We updated our products many times every year , with better functionality often times at the same price , and sometimes at a lower price .
And it was the relentless improvement , and in some cases a lower price that was able to be our competition .
And yield the market share that it did .
And as you know , we have a very low market share in the phone market in the single digits , in terms of all the handsets .
And we have a very high market share now in Tablets , because we 're the first mover . ""
But we do n't think about it that way .
The reason we would n't make a seven inch Tablet is n't because we do n't want to hit a price point , it 's because we do n't think you can make a great tablet with a seven inch screen .
We think it 's too small to express the software that people want to put on these things .
And we think as a software driven company , we think about the software strategies first . ""
And we know that software developers they 're not going to deal real well with all these different size products , when they have to redo their software , every time a screen size changes .
And they 're not going to deal well with products where they ca n't put enough elements on the screen to build the kind of apps they want to build . ""
So when we make decisions on seven inch tablets , it 's not about cost , it 's about the value of the product when you factor in the software .
You see what I 'm getting at ?
So we 're all about making the best products at aggressive prices .
And that 's what we will do and that 's what we 've done with the iPod , and that 's what we will do with the iPad as well . ""
But wo n't rivals come in and take share ?
"" You 're looking at it wrong .
You 're looking at it as a hardware person in a fragmented world .
You 're looking at it as a hardware manufacturer that does n't really know much about software , who does n't think about an integrated product , but assumes the software will somehow take care of itself .
And you 're sitting around saying , "" Well , how can we make this cheaper ?
Well , we can put on a smaller screen on it and a slower processor , and less memory . ""
And you assume that the software will somehow just come alive on this product that you 're dreaming of , but it wo n't .
Because these app developers have taken advantage of the products that came before with faster processors , with larger screens , with more capabilities that they can take advantage of to make better apps for customers . ""
And it 's a hard one because it throws you right back into the beginning of that chicken and egg problem again to change all the assumptions on those developers .
Most of them will not follow you , most of them will say , "" I 'm sorry , but I 'm not going to go back and write a watered down version of my app just because you 've got this phone that you can sell for $ 50 less and you 're begging me to write software for it . ""
"" What about the cash pile ?
"" Of course that 's been suggested to us .
We strongly believe that one or more very strategic opportunities may come along that we 're in a unique position to take advantage of because of our strong cash position .
And I think we 've demonstrated a really strong track record of being very disciplined with the use of our cash .
We do n't let it burn a hole in our pocket , we do n't allow it to motivate us to do stupid acquisitions . ""
And so I think that we 'd like to continue to keep our powder dry because we do feel that there are one or more strategic opportunities in the future .
That 's the biggest reason .
And there are other reasons as well that we could go into .
But that 's the biggest one . ""
Finally : Why do you think you have an advantage on the price point for iPad versus the pc manufacturers ?
Steve Jobs
"" Well , I think part of it is because engineer so much of it ourselves .
The A4 chip inside it is an Apple creation ; everything , again , as I mentioned from the battery chemistry to the enclosures .
And we 've learned a lot .
We 've learned a lot from the miniaturization we 've done on iPods and iPhones .
And we 're a very high volume consumer electronics manufacturer .
"" So I think we 've learned a lot .
We 've developed a lot of our own components where other have to buy them on the market with middlemen , getting their cut of things .
I think we 're a systems architect and know how to build systems in a very efficient way .
So I think this is a product we 've been training for , for the last decade . """

Some rights reserved Everyone 's piling in over Steve Jobs 's dissection / rant / tirade / dismissal over Android in Apple 's earnings call on Monday .
Jobs fumed at Google 's constant portrayal , as he sees it , of the Android v iPhone contest for customers as one between "" open "" and "" closed "" : he pointed out that Android is n't open in the utter sense ( because carriers can do things to it ) and also that it leads to fragmentation .
That , in fact , is the real division : between an integrated approach like Apple 's , and a fragmented one , as he sees Google 's as being .
So .
Andy Rubin , Google 's head of Android ( formal title : VP of engineering ) , pitched in with one of the geekiest tweets ever : "" the definition of open : "" mkdir android ; cd android ; repo init -u git://android.git.kernel.org / platform / manifest.git ; repo sync ; make "" "" Which , translated out of CommandLine , means : you too can build Android , the OS , by grabbing it from git .
( Look , there 's Android ! )
Unfortunately this is as disingenuous as people are accusing Jobs of being , as that does n't mean that Google will approve your phone , or that you 'll have access to the baseband software that the phone needs .
You ca n't get what you want for free .
Here the path forks , in the best open source ways .
First , Rubin 's tweet might persuade those who love to root their phone that
yeah ,
Android is really open .
But the proportion of people who want to recompile their phone OS is even smaller than the number who want to root their phone , and that proportion is vanishingly small compared to the number of people who buy smartphones .
You 'll be standing in the street a long time before you can stop someone who 'll react with pleasure when you tell them "" Hey , you can compile Android 's code from source yourself so you can install it on an Android phone you 've already got ! ""
So while Rubin 's code might carry bragging rights , in the scheme of things it 's meaningless .
You can compile Darwin , which underlies Apple 's Mac OSX , but that does n't mean your Dell will boot up with an Apple screen .
This is the point made rather forcefully by Joe Hewitt , a Facebook staffer who has a long list of open source accomplishments : helping create Firefox , building the dev / debug tool FireBug , and working on Facebook 's ' Touch ' mobile website and its native iPhone application ( which TechCrunch suggests he may have built singlehandedly )
Anyhow , on his Twitter account , Hewitt took Google , and Rubin , to task :
# 1 : "" How does Android get away with the "" open "" claim when the source is n't public until major releases , and no one outside Google can check in ? ""
# 2 "" Compare the Android "" open source "" model to Firefox or Linux if you want to see how disingenuous that "" open "" claim is . ""
# 3 ""
Until Android is read / write open , it 's no different than iOS to me .
Open source means sharing control with the community , not show and tell . ""
# 4 ""
I think it is the lack of visibility into daily progress that bothers me about Android more than the lack of write access . ""
( Google does n't let people know what 's being developed in code , or let them view how it 's progressing - unlike , say , projects like WebKit or Firefox , where everyone can view the changing source , try it out themselves and even offer suggestions ; though on WebKit being an external contributor is a privilege that has to be earned . )
A little later : "" Point I am trying to make is , Rubin bickering with Jobs is a farce , because both refuse to share the one thing that matters : control . ""
Of course Jobs has never pretended that Apple has handed over control of the iPhone 's OS to anyone else .
Google , though , is having a go .
Now , over on the other side of the fork , we have Jim Balsillie
, co - CEO of BlackBerry maker RIM , who has decided to pitch in , because Apple dissed his company too .
( Balsillie is the one who did n't go up and show off a block of wood painted black with a decal - sorry , prototype - when announcing the RIM PlayBook almost a month ago .
That was Mike Lazaridis . )
In case anyone had forgotten about the PlayBook
( we had n't , Jim ; we 're just waiting to see working models ) , Balsillie jumped in .
Speaking at the Gulf Information Technology Exhibition , he first said that there will be a 64 GB version of the PlayBook with a 5300mAh - milliAmp hours - battery .
The iPad has a 25Wh battery , but unless you know the voltage they 're operating at , you ca n't know how long they 'll last .
On a notional 5V , the PlayBook 's battery would last longer . )
Then he got on to the topic of Apple and what Jobs had said ( which included the assertion that 7 "" tablets will be "" dead on arrival "" ) : "" "" For those of us who live outside of Apple 's distortion field , we know that 7 "" tablets will actually be a big portion of the market and we know that Adobe Flash support actually matters to customers who want a real web experience .
We also know that while Apple 's attempt to control the ecosystem and maintain a closed platform may be good for Apple , developers want more options and customers want to fully access the overwhelming majority of web sites that use Flash . ""
A question as we pass that point : which customers need those Flash sites ?
I thought that the PlayBook was going to be aimed at corporate customers .
OK , it might be embarrassing for advertising companies when their front pages do n't load on an iPad , but perhaps they 'll get the message that nobody enjoys having their self - importance thrust in their face .
What corporate customers have a dramatic need to access Flash sites ?
YouTube and Vimeo work fine on iPads , and that 's where a stack of the video most corporates might want to access lives .
Corporate would - be tablet users , tell us in the comments what Flash sites you need to access which do n't have an HTML5 alternative .
( Internal ones are fine . )
I 'm suspecting that web metrics via Omniture might be one : those use Flash to display metrics .
Oh , look , Adobe owns Omniture .
"" We think many customers are getting tired of being told what to think by Apple .
And by the way , RIM has achieved record shipments for five consecutive quarters and recently shared guidance of 13.8 - 14.4 million BlackBerry smartphones for the current quarter . ""
Apple 's leap in sales of iPhone and iPads does n't suggest customers are getting tired of it , though it 's entirely believable that they 're not loving it in Google or RIM .
As to the phone sales , the guidance that RIM 's offering would only exceed Apple at the top end of the forecast ; we 'll have to wait for the results to see if that happens . ""
"" Apple 's preference to compare its September - ending quarter with RIM 's August - ending quarter does n't tell the whole story because it does n't take into account that industry demand in September is typically stronger than summer months , nor does it explain why Apple only shipped 8.4 million devices in its prior quarter and whether Apple 's Q4 results were padded by unfulfilled Q3 customer demand and channel orders .
As usual , whether the subject is antennas , Flash or shipments , there is more to the story and sooner or later , even people inside the distortion field will begin to resent being told half a story . ""
"" Though Apple ca n't do much about when their comparable quarters end , it will be interesting to see how RIM 's sales go .
It seems to have escaped the threat of being cut off in India and the United Arab Emirates - but governments seem increasingly edgy about its excellent security .
If it had lost those countries , it would have been in a big hole ; it will be interesting to know what sort of compromises to customer data security it has had to make there .
The accusation of padding is a dangerous one - once you start suggesting that other companies have been pushing their numbers , you 're into risky territory because every little thing you do is subjected to the same harsh light you wanted on others .
It 's been clear that Apple struggled with demand ( the white iPhone remains as mythical as the snark , though perhaps it will pop up in the announcement tonight ) .
Balsillie is entitled to hit back at Apple , but it 's a risky strategy : better to let the earnings speak for themselves .
And of course if we were to actually see a PlayBook being used by someone in the wild , or even in RIM 's offices , that would reassure us greatly that it has n't all been a big "" suggest we 'll have a tablet
Real Soon Now before we do n't have any corporate customers left who do n't have an iPad "" sort of scheme .
Where does this leave us ?
With •
Apple not being open .
But you knew that .
•
Google 's Android not actually being open in the sense that most open source projects are •
RIM coming off looking both niggling on the phones question , a touch too aggressive on the "" padding "" note , and desperate for people to think well of the PlayBook , which might turn out to be a fantastic piece of hardware .
But hardware is of course only half the story , as Jobs pointed out : "" "" You 're looking at it wrong .
You 're looking at it as a hardware person in a fragmented world .
You 're looking at it as a hardware manufacturer that does n't really know much about software , who does n't think about an integrated product , but assumes the software will somehow take care of itself .
And you 're sitting around saying , "" Well , how can we make this cheaper ?
Well , we can put on a smaller screen on it and a slower processor , and less memory . ""
And you assume that the software will somehow just come alive on this product that you 're dreaming of , but it wo n't .
"" RIM has a real challenge ahead of it - as indeed do the Android tablet makers .
And that 's before we get to Windows 7 on tablets ..."
2010-11-03,"You 'll recall Steve Jobs , who in the middle of his duffing - up of rival tablets during Apple 's earnings call last month , criticised the 7 in would - be iPad rivals on the basis of their area .
Specifically , he said : "" I 'd like to comment on the avalanche of tablets poised to enter the market in the coming months .
First , it appears to be just a handful of credible entrants , not exactly an avalanche .
Second , almost all of them use seven - inch screens as compared to iPad 's near 10-inch screen .
Let 's start there .
One naturally thinks that a seven - inch screen would offer 70 % of the benefits of a 10-inch screen .
Unfortunately , this is far from the truth .
The screen measurements are diagonal , so that a seven - inch screen is only 45 % as large as iPad 's 10-inch screen .
You heard me right ; just 45 % as large . ""
If you take an iPad and hold it upright in portrait view and draw an imaginary horizontal line halfway down the screen , the screens on the seven - inch tablets are a bit smaller than the bottom half of the iPad display .
This size is n't sufficient to create great tablet apps in our opinion . ""
( Transcript courtesy Seeking Alpha . )
Of course on hearing that , my first thought was : can that be right ?
My second was : how can we figure this out ?
And my third was : Pythagoras .
It turns out to be pretty easy to use Pythagoras 's theorem to figure out the area of a tablet , once you 're given the screen diagonal length and the ratio ( R ) of the height to length .
( It 's left as an exercise for the reader to figure out why it makes no difference whether you record the horizontal or vertical pixels first . )
So let 's plug in the figures for the iPad , and - for example - the Samsung Galaxy Tab .
iPad : 9.7 in diagonal , 1024x768 : area = 45.16 square inches .
Galaxy Tab : 7 in diagonal ,
1024x600 : area = 21.37 sq in .
In other words , the Galaxy Tab 's screen is 47 % of the size of the iPad .
It would be larger if it were 1024x768 or 800x600 ( which gives the same height / length ratio ) : that would make it 23.52 sq in , which is 52 % of the iPad size .
But there seem to be constraints on Android tablets displays .
There 's plenty more , but one fact stands out : in all the data on all the tablets I 've collected , there is n't a single one that 's bigger in screen area than the iPad , including those with 10.1 in diagonals : the 1024x600 ratio limits the area ( again , it 's an exercise for you , dear reader , to figure out what the maximum size of a 10.1 in diagonal would be , and what shape the tablet would have to be ) .
So what do we learn ?
Well , apart from Jobs rounding down the numbers in a way that does n't favour rivals ( not quite a surprise ) , it really is the case that those 7 in tablets have less than half the screen area than an iPad .
That , I think , really does mean they 're likely to be better for consumption than creation ( I 've been trying a Galaxy Tab for a few hours , and it certainly shows a nice film , and it 's not bad for maps , and pretty nice for scrolling through mobile sites ) .
But it 's not immersive in the same way as the iPad .
And of course there 's then the question of price .
But we 'll take a closer look at prices and sizes and other details in the near future .
But for now , have you compared the two sizes ?
And do you think it makes any significant difference if the Android tablets are n't as big ?

2010-11-16,"Later today Steve Jobs will make a song and dance about finally securing the Beatles ' back catalogue for iTunes .
Ringo and Macca may even join him , to tell us all what a momentous occasion this is .
The momentousness will be there for all to see .
Except on iTunes of course .
iTunes remains the place you go to because it 's the easiest way of filling up your iPod , rather than a destination for music lovers to explore and enjoy ( the addition of the ill - conceived Ping wo n't change that ) .
Could n't the biggest band in the history of pop have found a way of placing their music online without it becoming just another commodity in Apple 's gadget - flogging industrial complex ?
I used to work at Last.fm , and in 2007 there was talk of EMI teaming up with the social networking site to build a dedicated Beatles hub to stream and sell the Fab Four 's tracks online .
A desire to squeeze as much cash as possible from fans ( by offering only full albums rather than individual songs , for instance , something they ca n't do on iTunes ) was obviously a concern .
But nonetheless , there was an opportunity for the Beatles to find a home that would curate their music as much as sell it .
Last.fm does this well by placing music in a social and historical context , celebrating its rich lineage – as do bespoke online stores such as Warp 's Bleep , Rough Trade and a brilliant boutique MP3 store called Ten Tracks , which offers bundles of 10 songs a month from independent labels for only £ 10 a year .
This is not about singling out the Beatles for special treatment , though of course they deserve it .
But the addition of such celebrated music to an online store that is n't really about music at all ( it 's about selling expensive white boxes ) is perhaps symbolic of the way in which popular songs – magical things , each with its own history , influence and effect – are ill - served by iTunes .
We know Steve Jobs is a businessman first and a music fan second .
And we know – as iPod and iPhone owners – that convenience trumps everything .
So the Beatles are finally online –
that 's to be applauded .
The Beatles on iTunes ?
Not so much ."
2010-11-21,"Rupert Murdoch , head of the media giant News Corp , and Steve Jobs , the chief executive of Apple , are preparing to unveil a new digital "" newspaper "" called the Daily at the end of this month , according to reports in the US media .
The collaboration , which has been secretly under development in New York for several months , promises to be the world 's first "" newspaper "" designed exclusively for new tablet - style computers such as Apple 's iPad , with a launch planned for early next year .
Intended to combine "" a tabloid sensibility with a broadsheet intelligence "" , the publication represents Murdoch 's determination to push the newspaper business beyond the realm of print .
According to reports , there will be no "" print edition "" or "" web edition "" ; the central innovation , developed with assistance from Apple engineers , will be to dispatch the publication automatically to an iPad or any of the growing number of similar devices .
With no printing or distribution costs , the US - focused Daily will cost 99 cents ( 62p ) a week .
According to the US elite fashion industry journal Women 's Wear Daily , the Murdoch - Jobs "" newspaper "" will be run from the 26th floor of the News Corp offices in New York , where 100 journalist have been hired , including Pete Picton , an online editor from the Sun , as one of three managing editors .
The editor of the Daily has not been announced , but observers are assuming it will be Jesse Angelo , the managing editor of the New York Post and rising star in the News Corp firmament .
Angelo , who was at school with Murdoch 's son Lachlan , was formerly editor of the Post 's business section and has recruited the tabloid 's gossip columnist Richard Johnson to run the Daily 's Los Angeles bureau .
Other staff include Sasha Frere - Jones , a music critic at the New Yorker , who will oversee arts and culture .
News Corp 's pattern of hiring for the project suggests that video will be a major component of the new publication .
The 79-year - old Murdoch is said to have had the idea for the project after studying a survey that suggested readers spent more time immersed in their iPads than they did – comparatively speaking — on the internet , where unfocused surfing is typical .
Sources say Murdoch is committed to the project in part because he believes that the Daily , properly executed , will demonstrate that consumers are willing to pay for high- quality , original content online .
Murdoch believes the iPad is going to be a "" game changer "" and he has seen projections that there will be 40 million iPads in circulation by the end of 2011 .
A source said : "" He envisions a world in which every family has a iPad in the home and it becomes the device from which they get their news and information .
If only 5 % of those 40 million subscribe to the Daily , that 's already two million customers . ""
But Murdoch 's success with internet ventures is mixed .
The Times recently said it had gained more than 100,000 paying customers for its web edition , while the Wall Street Journal now has more than two million readers behind a partial paywall .
But MySpace , once the leading social networking site , which Murdoch paid $ 580 m for in 2005 , is now an also - ran in the field , and Murdoch is running counter to current thinking that web publications need print editions to justify themselves to advertisers .
Apple has been expected to announce a subscription plan for newspapers based on the model of its iTunes music download service , but some publishers have been unwilling to let Apple in as an intermediary or let it control pricing the way iTunes has done in the music business . ""
Obviously , Steve Jobs sees this as a significant revenue stream for Apple in the future , "" Roger Fidler , head of digital publishing at the Donald W Reynolds Journalism Institute , told the San Jose Mercury News recently .
And with Apple expected to dominate the tablet market until compelling competitors are introduced , Murdoch may have no choice but to ride with Jobs .
According to Women 's Wear Daily , Jobs is "" a major fan "" of the newsprint patriarch : "" When the project is announced , do n't be surprised if you see Steve Jobs onstage with Rupert Murdoch , welcoming the Daily to the app world . ""

2010-11-21,"Enter the iTunes store and the wares of only one band are prominently on display in the run - up to Christmas 2010 : the Beatles , a group that split up in 1970 but once again brought to our attention because last week their music went on sale in a legal digital format for the first time .
Like everything associated with the Fab Four , the hype was intense , with Sir Paul McCartney saying : "" It 's fantastic to see the songs we originally released on vinyl receive as much love in the digital world as they did the first time around "" ; and the widow of his songwriting partner , Yoko Ono , commenting : "" In the joyful spirit of Give Peace
A Chance , I think it is so appropriate that we are doing this in John 's 70th birthday year . ""
Quite what this cold commercial partnership should have to do with buying karma remains moot , but what is certain is that this deal concluded a long dispute between the Beatles ' label , Apple , and the company of that name created by Steve Jobs and responsible for the iPod and iTunes .
This dated back to 1978 and while relations were improving by the time of the launch of the iPhone in 2007 , when Jobs featured the Beatles ' music in a keynote presentation , it has taken fully three more years for this deal to be concluded .
Unsurprisingly , Ringo made the most pithy comment last week , saying he would be "" particularly glad to no longer be asked "" about the matter .
Part of the hesitation on the Beatles ' part may have been that the band have always been heavily protective of their music , keen never to devalue the brand by giving away their songs too cheaply : when the disruptive effects of the internet were first felt within the music industry , one common response was to start selling CDs at heavily marked - down prices , but McCartney and co never succumbed to this pressure .
Nor is it likely to be coincidence that the iTunes deal was only concluded a full year after all the Beatles ' albums were remastered and reissued on CD , rather than at the same time : this way , the band get yet another turn in the spotlight .
For now , iTunes is the only digital carrier of the Beatles catalogue , but an EMI spokesman has said this special treatment will only last "" into 2011 "" , holding out the promise that Baby , You 're Rich Man will soon be available on a multitude of digital platforms , including services such as Spotify ( although possibly , in that instance , as part of the offering to premium subscribers ) .
Such a flurry of excitement forgets the fact that existing fans will no doubt have bought the remastered CDs , and ripped them to their computers ; the question is whether there is a new group of music - lovers so used to buying digitally that this move will introduce them to the band for the first time .
This is the generation that so prioritises speed and convenience , the almost frictionless ease of the digital sphere , to the extent that they would spend £ 17.99 for the version of the Beatles ' Red compilation available on iTunes , rather than the £ 7.99 that the CD costs on Amazon .
Evidence that the appetite is there is already available : towards the end of the week , the iTunes album chart was dominated by another boyband from the north , Take That ( whose career spans almost 20 years , compared to the Fabs ' eight ) , but The Beatles ' Blue and Red compilations made the Top 20 , as well as Sgt Pepper , with another 10 of their albums in the Top 75 .
This was before contestants on The X Factor took it in turns to essay covers of the Beatles ' catalogue last night .
Viewers visiting iTunes afterwards to buy the recordings of those performances , as is now the practice with the show , were able to pick the original versions if they preferred : another canny piece of business all round , and still not a comparison by which the Beatles themselves would likely suffer ."
2010-11-23,"It might be a little less high - spec'd than an iPad or iPhone but that did not stop Apple 's first computer selling for £ 133,250 at auction in London today .
The sale price of the Apple I , with a processor thousands of times slower than an iPad , proved the power of the company 's brand even in relation to products more than 30 years old .
The computer , one of only 200 such models ever made , was sold at Christie 's together with its original packaging and a signed letter from Steve Jobs , current CEO of Apple Inc and one of Apple Computer 's co - founders .
When the Apple I was launched in 1976 , it was the only personal computer to come with a fully assembled motherboard , making it ready to use straight from the box provided the user supplied a case , keyboard , power supply and display .
The computer , which was discontinued the following year , sold for $ 666.66 at the time ( $ 2594 at today 's price ) , allegedly because co - founder Steve Wozniak liked repeating digits .
The auctioned Apple I eventually went to Italian businessman and private collector Marco Boglione , who made his offer over the phone .
His brother Francesco Boglione , who attended the auction in person , told Associated Press that Marco 's purchase was a testament to his love of computers .
Steve Wozniak , who agreed to add an autographed letter to the lot , was present at the auction .
He described the event as a historic moment for his work , given that it was up for sale alongside technological greats such as an Enigma , the German code - making machine , and also writings of British mathematician Alan Turing , considered one of the founders of modern computing .
However , the Turing papers failed to find a buyer .
Boglione said his brother 's newly purchased Apple I would likely be returned to working condition and eventually join a collection of Apple computers .
Many of the patrons had studied the sale catalogue using mobile technology such as Apple 's iPads and iPhones .
"" It is a fitting illustration of how computers have revolutionised the world , "" said Christie 's Julian Wilson ."
2010-11-29,"In an age of throwing spaghetti at the wall to determine the ' what sticks ' of publishing success , Rupert Murdoch is a veritable Julius Caesar ; his taut ballista loaded with steaming linguine .
In his latest publishing adventure Murdoch has thrown in his considerable lot with the Apple empire and Steve Jobs ( who makes an unlikely Cleopatra ) , to produce a post - print ' newspaper ' exclusively for the iPad .
The Daily has caused huge interest on both sides of the Atlantic , as Murdoch prepares to invest a rumoured $ 30 m ( £ 19.2 m ) employing a hundred people to work on it .
No - one else experiments with the verve and chequebook of News Corporation , and few can afford to .
Only Sir Richard Branson it seems , who is fond of a bit of spaghetti flinging himself , is diving into the app world with a printless magazine in a similar fashion , so far code named ' the Project ' .
The template for The Daily experiment is very familiar to anyone who took an interest in Murdoch 's plans for the now defunct The London Paper , which was produced entirely in isolation from his other news titles at Wapping on the entirely sensible grounds that , as it addressed a new market of casual younger commuters , it should not be infected by the thinking of his existing daily press .
Such is the compressed nature of the digital speculation cycle , many are writing off the iPad experiments as failures before the first download .
This is not hard to do .
First of all , it is not at all clear what would constitute success for an iPad ' newspaper ' .
If it is to quickly reach profitability , which does seem unlikely , even with a projected doubling of the iPad universe to 15 million users in the next twelve months , the take - up rate for the subscription app would have to be astonishingly high for it to cover costs .
Murdoch like so many is caught between wanting revenues to reach the levels they have for packaged print products , and to retain some influence through publishing news products .
The iPad is seen as being very appealing by the non - digital for a couple of reasons .
The first is that you surrender control only to Steve Jobs , not the rest of the internet .
He is able to dictate what goes into the store and what is banned , he is able to exercise editorial control if he chooses in a way not even the most autocratic news agent would dare .
This is a good reason for any news organization to remain highly sceptical of Apple .
The second is that you have a slightly more certain fix on revenues .
But only slightly .
There is no evidence yet of long - term subscription and buying patterns on an iPad or how habit forming the technology might become .
The 99 cents a week charge is the ' purchase of no consequence ' level Murdoch wanted for newspaper pricing when he started the price war first for the Sun and then for the Times in 1990.Although at the moment the project seems scaled for failure – 100 journalists ( some of them , like Sasha Frere - Jones , quite famous ) is a huge workforce for a digital start - up .
Even Facebook began in a front room .
A more interesting question though for publishing is what if it succeeds ?
If Murdoch can get what he and his company wants from an app led strategy , it leaves one wondering where the future for his non - digital newspapers might lie .
Given his loathing of the open internet , and his lack of success on it ( a MySpace purchase which now looks akin to being lead investor in Betamax in 1982 ) , it is evident that News International would prefer the Times as a download than a walled - up website .
The iPad experiment will be met by other publishers pushing more aggressively with open standards .
At least one major US publisher is debuting a Google collaboration in the apps field in the imminent future .
It might even end up competing with the rumored 9 December launch for the Daily .
Joining Murdoch in the US celebrity news and human interest market are his old adversaries at the Daily Mail and General Trust , who now run an English language news site second only to the New York Times in scale , and with a very US - centric growth plan in their pockets .
This is a battle between open and closed just as it is a battle against obsolescence .
If Murdoch fails he might rue the $ 30 m wasted against better advice , although the wider publishing industry will benefit from the lessons .
In the unlikely case of success , it might just be that we are witnessing the Murdoch empire beginning to exit print altogether ."
2010-11-29,"When Steve Jobs in January described the new iPad tablet computer as "" magical "" , PC manufacturers perhaps did n't imagine that the magic would be to subtract money from their bottom line and add it to Apple 's .
But that 's how it 's turning out .
The research firm , Gartner , has slashed its forecast for the number of PCs that will be sold this year from 363.5 m to 352.4 m .
And that higher figure was itself a downgrade from March , when the company thought that 366 m PCs could be sold this year .
The reason for the downgrade is growing interest in Apple 's iPad and similar tablet computers , allied to shrinking budgets among consumers .
The abrupt drop is part of a trend that will become a long - term one , according to Ranjit Atwal , Gartner 's research director .
"" Over the longer term , media tablets are expected to displace around 10 % of PC units by 2014 , "" he said , adding that the new forecasts reflect "" expectations of weaker consumer demand , due in no small part to growing user interest in media tablets such as the iPad "" .
Other analysts think that growing user interest can already be quantified .
Last week , Citigroup 's analysts forecast that 35 m tablet computers , including 26 m iPads , will be sold in 2011 – and that those will lop off 11 m PC sales that would otherwise have been made by companies such as HP and Dell .
Craig Berger , of FBR Capital Markets , offers higher estimates for 2011 – of 40 m tablets sold by Apple and 30 m by other companies – and says that the economics of tablets "" are not good for PCs "" .
He calculates that every five tablets sold means two lost PC sales .
Berger 's numbers would suggest 28 m lost PC sales – and given that Gartner has already trimmed its numbers by 10 m this year since the iPad launched , Berger 's figure might not be fanciful .
Meanwhile , Gartner forecasts that worldwide PC shipments for 2011 will reach 409 m units , a 15.9 % increase from 2010 – but substantially reduced from its earlier estimate of 18.1 % growth for next year .
It 's entirely possible that further downgrades will follow .
Is this the end of the PC business that has sustained dozens of PC makers , and Microsoft in particular , over the decades since the launch of the very first version of Windows on 20 November 1985 , just over 25 years ago ?
Microsoft makes its money from the licences for Windows on PCs , plus sales of its Office suite to a sizeable proportion of PCs that are used by businesses .
But if the PC sales engine starts to slow , so will Microsoft 's .
And Gartner has bad news on the business front too : it predicts that by 2013 , 80 % of businesses will support tablet computers for their staff , and that rather than providing employees with business services and devices – that is , PCs – 90 % will support corporate applications on employees ' own consumer phones , tablets and laptops .
Ray Ozzie , who last month stepped down as Microsoft 's chief software architect – a post previously held by Bill Gates – has already warned the company about this scenario .
In October , in an elliptical farewell email , which he also put on his blog , he urged its executives to look ahead to a "" post - PC world "" and warned : "" Those who can envision a plausible future that 's brighter than today will earn the opportunity to lead . ""
Or , to put it another way , those who stick to the PC - centric view will get left behind .
The PC market 's growth is not uniform .
It has almost stopped in the US and Europe .
The only bright light at present is emerging markets such as Asia , which Gartner says are driving sales : by the end of next year such countries will make up more than 50 % of the world PC market , while "" mature "" markets – especially the US and Europe – will face "" mounting challenges "" as both businesses and consumers put off new purchases and instead buy smartphones or tablets instead .
And even in emerging markets the story is not all good news for the traditional PC companies .
"" There is a good chance that consumers will simply leapfrog PCs and move directly to alternative devices in the coming years rather than following the traditional pattern of purchasing a PC as their first computing device , "" suggests Gartner , blaming PC makers ' failure to innovate .
Chip speeds are not doubling as they once did ; where a decade ago , faster graphics and processors were guaranteed every few years and made new PCs a must - have , most people now have more computing power than they need .
And even though Microsoft can say that Windows 7 is its fastest - selling version of Windows ever , the reality is that many businesses are downgrading their licences and instead running Windows XP , from 2001 , while many consumers are also sticking with XP .
That could mean that companies which usually head the PC sales numbers will see their revenues head south too , unless they can leap onto the tablet bandwagon .
HP , Acer and Toshiba – which , along with Dell and Lenovo , make up the top five sellers worldwide – have all announced moves into the tablet market , although analysts predict they will find it tough amid brutal price competition .
Oddly , the only computer maker that seems immune to this cannibalisation of the market is Apple , which has seen its computer sales grow significantly faster than the market this year .
Maybe Jobs was right .
The iPad is certainly having a magical effect on his company – even if not on any others .

2010-11-29,"It was recently reported that Apple boss Steve Jobs – responsible for infesting the world with iPods , iPhones , iPads and other iCrap – had banned a cartoonist from one of his apps because his material was "" objectionable "" ; and then that Jobs had changed his mind and allowed "" professional political satirists and humorists "" back on his systems .
What was interesting about this story had nothing to do with the caprice of digitocrats , but lay in the reaction of the liberal chatterati .
Many people expressed surprise and concern that Jobs should behave like that , presumably because they 'd thought him a shiny new mixture of Gutenberg , Einstein and Buddha .
I doubt , however , if the cartoonist was surprised .
Cartoons as a medium , particularly political ones , occupy a curious , not quite respectable twilight place in the realm of journalism , often integral to the topography of a newspaper but also more than slightly semi - detached .
Partly that 's because cartoons ' relationship to other media , whether it 's newspapers or one of Jobs 's latest gizmos , is parasitical .
For nearly half a millennium , following the invention of printing , satirical engravings and etchings existed quite happily on their own .
Hogarth and Gillray sold all their work as individual prints , retailed from shops and kiosks that stretched from Charing Cross to St Paul 's , and Cruikshank was doing the same long into the middle of the 19th century and after Punch had killed off most of the rest of the trade .
In fact , the first daily political cartoon appeared in this country as late as 1900 , when Francis Carruthers - Gould started working for the Westminster Gazette .
There is a spirit of independence woven into cartoonists ' spiritual DNA .
However much a good cartoon will enhance the journalism surrounding it , both its purpose and its effect is always to lower the tone .
After all , one of the first and most enduring insults to be coined about popular journalism – calling it the Yellow Press – came courtesy of an 1890s cartoon , The Yellow Kid , which both Pulitzer and Hearst ran in their respective papers during the New York circulation wars of the 1890s .
So however useful we cartoonists are as licensed idiots , we 're not quite safe either , not least because as satirists it 's our job
– and our vocation – to mock the rich and powerful , a group which rather noticeably and inconveniently includes the kind of people who own and edit newspapers and other media .
Sometimes , a proprietor or editor will actually encourage dissent among a paper 's most instinctive dissidents
It served Lord Beaverbrook and his cartoonists , including David Low and Vicky , to make a thing of their caricaturing him in his own papers .
But this was a rare example of something less like free speech than self - indulgence .
For the most part , however , we keep schtum and cleanse our souls now and again by sneaking in coded messages
( Carl Giles used to have tiny vignettes of Rupert Bear being tortured to death hidden in the background of his cartoons ) .
We hope they wo n't notice , though sometimes we wish they will , and otherwise we just hunker down , swallow our pride and moan at interminable length in private to our colleagues about both proprietors and editors .
Sometimes , though , it pays to go public .
Apparently , after Rupert Murdoch took over the Sunday Times , he saw a Gerald Scarfe cartoon of Ronald Reagan and was heard to mutter : "" Poor old Ronnie .
We got ta get rid of this pinko artist ! "" , although the only authority we have for this story is Scarfe himself , still working at the Sunday Times nearly three decades later .
When I was working on Scotland on Sunday during the Iraq war , the editor and I waged a war of attrition of our own – he wanting me to illustrate his ( pro - war ) editorials , while I insisted I was a visual columnist entitled to express his own opinion .
For the war 's duration , I usually won , but in the months following , I 'd be phoned by the art director after I 'd filed to be told the editor had had "" a better idea "" .
I drew his idea for three weeks and then resigned by an email telling him that if he had such brilliant ideas for cartoons , maybe it was time he learned to draw .
That was bridling in the extreme , though I felt happier afterwards .
Usually , like most people , we bend with the wind , but sensible editors will allow their cartoonists as free a rein as reasonable , within the bounds of public decency .
That , after all , is why we 're hired in the first place .

2010-12-08,"Here 's a copy of a message I sent to Mr. Jobs with my holiday wish : Make It Easy
For People
To Donate
To Charities
With Their iPhones .
If you agree , you can send Mr. Jobs a message too by signing this online petition .
If Apple does n't stop being a Grinch to nonprofits and change its iPhone donation policy , I 'm switching to the Android which way more voluntary - sector friendly .
Dear Mr Jobs , Apple is a leader when it comes to technology innovation
and I have been an Apple fan for years , but at the moment , your company is also making it harder to do good in the world .
Specifically , your iPhone policy discourages people from donating to nonprofit organizations .
And when nonprofits are struggling to raise money for their important programs and donors want to help , why make it so hard for those us who want to iGive to charities on our iPhones ?
Voluntary sector organisations here in the UK play a critical role in society and NGOs around the world for that matter , and they need to be able to connect to their supporters using the tools those supporters find most comfortable .
At the same time , people want easy ways in which they can help the organizations they believe in .
In difficult times , this support is even more important .
By restricting donations from the iPhone so severely , you are suppressing philanthropy on the iPhone : creating a barrier between your customers and the nonprofits they care about , hurting the ability of both to create positive change , and stifling philanthropic innovation .
That 's not being a good corporate citizen !
I understand that Apple does not "" want to be held responsible for ensuring that the charitable funds make it to the final destination , "" but there are technical and logistical solutions to this dilemma .
Other companies are using them , and their customers respond every day with their wallets .
Please change your policy on donations : free us to give from our iPhones with one click .
By doing so , you empower your customer to change the world : through the good work done by nonprofits everywhere .
Sincerely , Beth Kanter CEO Zoetica and Co - Author Networked Nonprofit

2011-01-11,"Rupert Murdoch and Steve Jobs are planning to do a double act by jointly introducing Murdoch 's iPad - only newspaper , The Daily , at a special event later this month .
According to Yahoo 's Cutline blog , the News Corporation mogul and the Apple magnate will launch the i - paper at the San Francisco Museum Of Modern Art .

2011-01-17,"The news that Steve Jobs is taking a second open - ended leave of medical absence broke as the US stock markets were closed for Martin Luther King day
â€ “ saving Apple 's stock from what would have almost certainly been a precipitous fall in other circumstances .
In Germany , the stock dipped by 8.3 % in after - hours trading , an indicator of how keenly Jobs 's presence is felt at the company he co - founded in 1976 .
When he made a similar announcement in 2009 , the stock was briefly suspended after falling more than 10 % in the hours after he announced his leave of absence .
Yet it recovered even during his six - month break , continuing an upward path that has continued undiminished , leaving Apple now as the second - largest by market capitalisation in the world .
Many investors and analysts see Apple as Jobs 's creation â€ “ and him as the engine of its progress .
He is cited as the person that final design decisions flow through , and in who the "" DNA "" of the company resides .
Every new product that comes out of Apple has Jobs 's fingerprints on it
â€ “ usually literally .
In March 2010 , financial magazine Barron 's attempted to estimate Jobs 's value to Apple , and came up with a figure of $ 25bn ( Â£15.7bn ) .
The company 's present capitalisation is $ 319.7bn .
The company 's executives will certainly face tough questioning on Wednesday night when they release its latest quarterly results .
Though Tim Cook , the chief operating officer who has taken charge before when Jobs has had needed medical leave , excels at managing the company from day to day , he does not have the showman 's ability that ignites the passions of Apple 's many fans â€ “ and it is not clear whether he has driven any of its design products .
Yet for someone else such as the charismatic head of marketing Phil Schiller to be promoted over Cook 's head might create internal tensions .
The question is who could possibly follow Jobs if the worst happens .
His request for medical leave is almost certainly connected to the islet cell neuroendocrine cancer of the pancreas ( a rare , survivable form ) that he was treated for in 2004 , and the consequent liver transplant he received in April 2009 .
Apple has firmly resisted attempts to set out how it will find a chief executive to succeed Jobs .
In a regulatory filing earlier this month setting out plans for its shareholders ' meeting on 23 February , the directors recommend voting "" AGAINST the shareholder proposal entitled ' Amend the Company 's Corporate Governance Guidelines to adopt and disclose a written CEO succession planning policy ' "" .
That recommendation will have a particular poignancy at the meeting next month â€ “ and may even find shareholders abruptly seeking clarification on precisely those lines ."
2011-01-17,"Steve Jobs , Apple 's chief executive , who has survived a rare pancreatic cancer , is taking a medical leave of absence from the company almost exactly two years after he took a similar one , during which he received a liver transplant .
The news was announced when US stock markets were closed for a public holiday , almost certainly saving the company 's stock from a precipitous fall .
In after - hours trading in Frankfurt on Monday it fell $ 22 , or 9 % .
When Jobs took a similar leave of absence in 2009 , the stock was briefly suspended after falling 10 % on the US market .
Apple 's remaining executives are sure to face a grilling on Wednesday night when announce the company 's quarterly results
â€ “ though those are expected to report booming numbers from its Christmas quarter , with its iPhone and iPad products , as well as its Macintosh computers , all forecast to have sold well .
The the company 's chief operating officer , Tim Cook , who has been at the company since March 1998 , will take over the day - to - day operations of the company â€ “ though in an email to staff
Jobs said that he will "" continue as CEO and be involved in major strategic decisions for the company "" .
He added : "" I love Apple so much and hope to be back as soon as I can .
In the meantime , my family and I would deeply appreciate respect for our privacy . ""
Apple executives in Europe declined to provide any further detail on the reason for Jobs 's absence or its expected length .
Many investors and analysts see Apple as Jobs 's creation â€ “ and him as the engine of its progress .
He is cited as the person through whom final design decisions flow , and in whom the "" DNA "" of the company resides .
Every new product that comes out of Apple has Jobs 's fingerprints on it
â€ “ usually literally .
In March 2010 , Barron 's attempted to estimate Jobs 's value to Apple , and came up with a figure of $ 25bn â€ “ though that will be now be substantially higher .
Jobs was diagnosed with islet cell neuroendocrine cancer of the pancreas in 2004 â€ “ a rare , and treatable form of the disease .
After some delay , he was treated in summer 2004 and seemed to make a full recovery .
But in January 2009 he took medical leave , and in April 2009 received a liver transplant .
But Professor John Neoptolemos , a pancreatic cancer specialist from Liverpool University , said on Monday night that for most patients in those circumstances a liver transplant is a mistake , because it requires the use of immunosuppressant drugs to prevent tissue rejection â€ “ and that can in turn allow the cancer to return in the transplanted liver and other parts of the body .
There are treatments available , including radiotherapy and new drugs produced by Pfizer , which he said "" should help stabilise "" a patient in that situation .
Professor Neoptolemos emphasised that he has not seen any of Jobs 's medical details , and that the medical literature is unclear about survival rates following liver transplants in the wake of islet cell cancer .
During Jobs 's absence , Apple will be run by Tim Cook , his chief operating officer , who ran the company in 2009 while Jobs was away for six months due to the transplant .
Carolina Milanesi , vice - president of mobile devices for the research company Gartner , said that Jobs 's absence need not mean the end of Apple . ""
The timing of the announcement [ when markets were closed ] shows that timing is part of being good at your job .
I think that this time around , compared to 2009 , people know that Tim Cook can do a good job .
As a consumer , I do n't care who 's running the company
â€ “
I just care about the products I can buy . ""
She added : "" It 's true that Jobs is the captain of the ship .
And if you lose the captain for a period , then you are lost for a while .
But then there are other people who can steer the ship to a safe harbour . ""
Apple has firmly resisted attempts to set out how it will find a chief executive to succeed Jobs .
In a regulatory filing earlier this month setting out plans for its shareholders ' meeting on 23 February , the directors recommend voting "" against the shareholder proposal entitled ' Amend the company 's corporate governance guidelines to adopt and disclose a written CEO succession planning policy ' "" .
That recommendation will have a particular poignancy at the meeting next month â€ “ and may even find shareholders abruptly seeking clarification on precisely those lines .
The signoff in the email sent to all employees contrasts with the wording of his 2009 email , when Jobs signed off saying that he would "" look forward to seeing you all this summer "" .
He returned in June .
This one is more open - ended ."
2011-01-17,"Apple chief executive Steve Jobs , who has survived pancreatic cancer , is taking a medical leave of absence from the company almost two years after he took a similar one , during which he received a liver transplant .
The announcement by Apple today will rekindle speculation about long - term survival prospects for Jobs , 55 , following his treatment for cancer in 2004 .
In an email sent to all Apple employees this morning , Jobs said : "" At my request , the board of directors has granted me a medical leave of absence so I can focus on my health .
I will continue as CEO and be involved in major strategic decisions for the company .
"" I have asked Tim Cook to be responsible for all of Apple 's day to day operations .
I have great confidence that Tim and the rest of the executive management team will do a terrific job executing the exciting plans we have in place for 2011 .
"" I love Apple so much and hope to be back as soon as I can .
In the meantime , my family and I would deeply appreciate respect for our privacy . ""
The move mirrors the arrangements Apple made in 2009 when Jobs took a six - month leave of absence .
Cook , Apple 's chief operating officer , took over the day - to - day running then as well .
Jobs received treatment for a rare , and survivable , form of pancreatic cancer in 2004 .
He returned to the company later that year , but made few public appearances until 2006 .
In mid-2008 speculation about his apparent loss of weight led to Apple denying that there had been any after - effects from his surgery , which used a method called the "" Whipple procedure "" , which removes sections of the duodenum .
It was after that that Jobs eventually had to take his first bout of medical leave , leading to a liver transplant in April 2009 ."
2011-01-17,"Apple 's chief operations officer joined the company in March 1998 , having been lured there by Steve Jobs from PC maker Compaq , then one of the biggest forces in Windows PCs , and before that at IBM .
His specialism was in getting supply chains – the process of getting the right materials to the right place at the right time – to work correctly .
Now aged 50 , Cook graduated from Auburn University with a degree in industrial engineering in 1982 , and followed it with an MBA .
Then he went into the computer - making business .
Arriving at Apple , he found a company whose supply chains were falling apart through a confusion of models , incompatible parts , and bad organisation .
Cook shook them by the neck and tightened them up until Apple rivalled Dell , then the most efficient PC - making machine in the business , for minimal stock levels .
Yet this has been done without rancour .
The story is told of one of his first meetings at Apple , where as the newly appointed senior vice - president for worldwide operations he observed that there were serious problems with a manufacturing plant .
"" This is really bad , "" Cook said .
"" Someone should be in China driving this . ""
Half an hour later he looked at the operations chief , who was also in the meeting , and asked plainly : "" Why are you still here ? ""
Born in Alabama , he loves the outdoors – notably cycling –
Cook is not a showman ; he has none of the magician 's tricks of the reveal that Jobs employs .
In fact , in all his time there , he has never lifted the cover off a new Apple product , be it software or hardware , in front of an audience , although he has led plenty of earnings calls with analysts , and kicked off some presentations to the press .
The question that remains is whether he could be Apple 's chief executive .
Cook 's specialism is in making the day - to - day business work .
But Apple is a company that needs someone with a grand vision at its helm .
Cook has done everything else – but he has not so far shown a sign of being able to do that ."
2011-01-18,""" The cult of the chief executive exists , although whether or not it is overblown depends on the chief executive .
But in Steve Jobs 's case , he really is a genius . ""
So says one Wall Street analyst when asked to sum up the man who founded Apple , achieved mythical status in the computer world , got ousted from his own company , then returned to become widely acknowledged as a legend .
So as Jobs once again steps aside from the iPod and iPhone - maker because of health reasons â€ “ which last time caused a 10 % drop in the company 's share price â€ “
what next for the booming technology group ?
Can it prosper without its visionary leader ?
Avi Greengart , an analyst with Current Analysis added : "" All of Apple 's executives are competent .
Steve 's approach has been institutionalised .
The problem is : Steve Jobs has a remarkable track record â€ “ not just of making bold moves but of getting them right .
So even if his replacements do exactly what Steve Jobs would have done , it 's still not Steve Jobs . ""
Tim Cook , Apple 's chief operations officer , is the man tasked with standing in for Jobs and is viewed as his most likely successor .
He has been at the company since March 1998 , has a reputation on Wall Street as a safe pair of hands , and ran the company for most of 2009 when Jobs was on medical leave and received a liver transplant .
Still , it is an unenviable task stepping in for a man with such a huge name â€ “ especially in an age obsessed with the cult of the chief executive .
But is it a media invention ?
In their 2003 paper , Believing One 's Own Press : the Causes and Consequences of CEO Celebrity , academic Matthew Hayward and colleagues argued : "" By glorifying CEOs and exaggerating their efficacy , journalists direct the public 's expectations , interactions , and aspirations towards CEOs and away from other people who also contribute their talent and efforts in deciding upon and implementing firm action . ""
It begs the question : how many chief executives are truly indispensable ?
Joseph Lampel , a professor of strategy at Cass Business School , said : "" During the past 20 years shareholder value has been the measure of a great CEO .
But Enron was hailed as a great company purely on shareholder value .
Lord Browne of BP the same .
In retrospect we have serious doubts about that .
A great CEO is exceptional not only in terms of [ share ] performance but also in terms of new products , entering new markets , transforming the organisation and enthusing it with attitude . ""
Microsoft 's Bill Gates , IBM 's Louis Gerstner and General Electric 's Jack Welch may fit into that category .
Gerstner is largely credited with turning around IBM 's fortunes and his reforms have stuck â€ “ the shares have almost doubled since he stood down as chief executive in 2002 , outperforming most benchmarks as well .
Microsoft shares have performed less well since Gates took a back seat , although some market watchers continue to believe the company is progressing .
"" The financials have done exceptionally well [ since Gates stepped down ] , "" said one Wall Street analyst .
"" Every aspect [ has done well ] except the share price . ""
In the UK , chief executive watchers are less than enthused about identifying a great British business leader .
Tesco 's Sir Terry Leahy ? ""
A fine CEO not a great CEO , "" says one analyst .
Sir Richard Branson ? ""
Was great , now a brand ambassador . ""
Sir James Dyson ? ""
The jury 's out . ""
Lord [ Arnold ] Weinstock , perhaps ? ""
Hmm .
We may have to go back that far , "" said another analyst .
Still , by some measures even Weinstock fails to achieve greatness as his succession planning was less than perfect .
His successor focused the company on IT and communications , renaming it Marconi .
It became one of the City 's most memorable dotcom disasters and Weinstock 's contemporary Lord Hanson was moved to observe : "" It will surprise no one that he died of a broken heart when , after retirement , he realised he had made the one mistake of his brilliant career in turning over his company to a bunch of total incompetents . """
2011-01-18,"Apple tonight reported record revenues for the second quarter in a row , with profits of $ 6bn and revenues of $ 26.74bn – up 77.5 % and 70.5 % respectively .
Shares had fallen at the start of today during early trading in New York , when stock markets reopened following Monday 's holiday and investors digested the news that Apple 's chief executive , Steve Jobs , was taking another open - ended period of medical leave .
The break is his third since being diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer in 2004 .
However , shares increased by 4 % in after - hours trading , and the company announced that during the Christmas quarter it sold 7.3 m iPads – as many as it sold in the previous two quarters – taking the total sold to 14.5 m copies since its introduction in April .
The iPhone also saw strong growth , with 16.24 m sold in the most recent quarter – its best ever .
In a statement , Jobs said : "" We had a phenomenal holiday quarter , with record Mac , iPhone and iPad sales .
We are firing on all cylinders and we 've got some exciting things in the pipeline for this year , including iPhone 4 on Verizon .
"" The results were announced after markets closed , with Apple 's stock finishing the day down 2 % , having earlier fallen by 4.1 % to $ 334 in early trading .
Investors , meanwhile , are wondering about plans for a successor if Jobs is unable to return to the company , despite saying in his email to staff on Monday that he would continue as chief executive and be involved in major strategic decisions .
Tim Cook , the chief operations officer who stands in for Jobs during his absence , has been in the company since March 1998 and is viewed by Wall Street as a safe pair of hands .
He ran the company for most of 2009 when Jobs received a liver transplant .
But questions are expected on whether Apple has enough new products and innovation in the pipeline to stimulate further growth .
Though the iPad was designed and completed while Jobs was away , he is understood to have been closely involved in its development .
Richard Windsor , global technology specialist at Nomura , said : "" Steve Jobs is seen by the market to be a major force in Apple 's strategic direction .
If his pancreatic cancer has returned , one could be quite worried .
"" Apple 's market value means that shifts in its stock price can pull down or lift the market . ""
The market 's reaction to Steve Jobs 's surprise medical leave from Apple today will underscore the importance of the tech sector on the S&amp;P 500
…
What happens next to Apple will therefore dominate what happens in the sector , "" said Bryan McCormick , analyst at optionMonster.com .
Without new products , Apple 's growth would likely stall : sales of the iPod –
that led Apple 's rapid growth in 2004 – are already in decline .
Apple differs from Microsoft , which is able to rely on regular , substantial income from its Windows and Office monopolies to fund new ventures .
Despite the announcement about Jobs , analysts such as Kaufman Bros and Thinkequity raised their long - term forecasts for the share price , to $ 415 ( up $ 10 ) and to $ 390 ( up $ 15 ) respectively .
Most analysts reckon the stock could still head towards $ 390 , which would put it close to Exxon 's world - leading $ 392bn market capitalisation .
Observers have focused on an apparent rivalry in the mobile market between Apple 's iPhone and Google 's Android mobile operating system .
But the signs are that Android is not weakening Apple ; instead the two are taking market share in the US , particularly from RIM , the Canadian maker of the BlackBerry .
Apple passed RIM for the number of phones sold in the US in the third quarter , and RIM is struggling to maintain market share .
The iPhone , meanwhile , is expected to receive a sales boost in the US after Verizon , the largest US mobile network , with 93.2 m subscribers , announced last week it would begin selling Apple 's phones from the end of this month .
That will be in addition to AT&amp;T , with 89.8 m subscribers , which has sold the device since its inception in June 2007 .
In a conference call in 2009 , Cook summed up Apple 's strategy : "" We believe we 're on the face of the Earth to make great products , and that 's not changing .
We believe in saying no to thousands of projects so that we can really focus on the few that are truly important and meaningful to us …
Frankly , we do n't settle for anything less than excellence in every group in the company , and we have the self - honesty to admit when we 're wrong and the courage to change .
And I think , regardless of who is in what job , those values are so embedded in this company that Apple will do extremely well . ""
But questions remain over who would provide a strategic focus for the company without Jobs .
The iPad and iPhone are viewed as being products of his vision .
He is also seen as having been essential to the company 's success , notably in negotiating contracts with content providers such as record labels and film companies ."
2011-01-18,"Apple shares fell by 4.1 % to $ 334 in early trading in New York today when stock markets reopened following Monday 's holiday and investors digested the news that the chief executive , Steve Jobs , was taking another open - ended period of medical leave .

Investors and analysts were also preparing for the company to announce its latest figures for the quarter ended 31 December , due tonight .
Analysts reckoned the company could report more than $ 21bn in revenue and $ 4.6bn in earnings .
In the third quarter it reported a record $ 20.3bn revenues and $ 4.3bn in profit .

But questions are expected about whether the company has enough new products and innovation in the pipeline to stimulate further growth .
Though the iPad was designed and completed while Jobs was away , he is understood to have been closely involved in its development .
Richard Windsor , global technology specialist at Nomura , said : "" Steve Jobs is seen by the market to be a major force in Apple 's strategic direction .
If his pancreatic cancer has returned , one could be quite worried .
"" Apple 's market value mean that shifts in its stock price can pull down or lift the market . ""
The market 's reaction to Steve Jobs ' surprise medical leave from Apple today will underscore the importance of the tech sector on the S&amp;P 500
…
What happens next to Apple will therefore dominate what happens in the sector and the S&amp;P as well , "" said Bryan McCormick , analyst at optionMonster.com .
Without new products , Apple 's growth would stall : sales of the iPod music player that led its spurt of rapid growth in 2004 are already in decline .
In that sense it is unlike Microsoft , which is able to rely on regular , substantial income from its Windows and Office monopolies to fund new ventures .
Despite the announcement about Jobs , analysts such as Kaufman Bros and Thinkequity raised their long - term forecasts for the share price , to $ 415 ( up $ 10 ) and to $ 390 ( up $ 15 ) respectively .
Most analysts reckon the stock could still head towards $ 390 , which would put it close to Exxon 's world - leading $ 392bn market capitalisation .
Apple is expected to report strong growth in sales of iPhones and iPads , both of which have proved extraordinarily profitable and popular .
Analysts estimated ahead of the earnings announcements that Apple sold 6.5 m iPads in its fourth quarter , compared with 4.3 m in the previous period , although the company ran vigorous promotions on the products through mobile networks before Christmas which may have boosted sales .
Observers have focused on an apparent rivalry in the mobile market between Apple 's iPhone and Google 's Android mobile operating system .
But the signs are that Android is not weakening Apple ; instead the two are taking market share in the US particularly from RIM , the Canadian maker of the BlackBerry .
Apple passed RIM for the number of phones sold in the US in the third quarter , and RIM is struggling to maintain market share .
The iPhone meanwhile is expected to receive a sales boost in the US after Verizon , the largest US mobile network , with 93.2 m subscribers , announced last week it would begin selling Apple 's phones from the end of this month .
That will be in addition to AT&amp;T , with 89.8 m subscribers , which has sold the device since its inception in June 2007 .
In a call with analysts in 2009 , Cook summed up Apple 's strategy : "" We believe that we 're on the face of the Earth to make great products , and that 's not changing .
We believe in saying no to thousands of projects so that we can really focus on the few that are truly important and meaningful to us … frankly , we do n't settle for anything less than excellence in every group in the company , and we have the self - honesty to admit when we 're wrong and the courage to change .
And I think , regardless of who is in what job , those values are so embedded in this company that Apple will do extremely well . ""
But questions remain over who would provide a strategic focus for the company without Jobs .
The iPad and iPhone are viewed as being products of his vision .
He is also seen as having been essential to the company 's success , notably in negotiating contracts with content providers such as record labels and film companies ."
2011-01-18,"Apple shares fell by 4.1 % to $ 334 in early trading in New York today when stock markets reopened following Monday 's holiday and investors digested the news that the chief executive , Steve Jobs , was taking another open - ended period of medical leave .
The break is his third since being diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer in 2004 .
Investors and analysts were also preparing for the company to announce its latest figures for the quarter ended 31 December , due tonight .
Analysts reckoned the company could report more than $ 21bn in revenue and $ 4.6bn in earnings .
In the third quarter it reported a record $ 20.3bn revenues and $ 4.3bn in profit .
Investors will be wondering about plans for a succession if Jobs is unable to return to the company , despite saying in his email to staff on Monday he would continue as CEO and be involved in major strategic decisions for the company .

2011-01-23,"Welcome to the land of media mystification where no tablet is set in stone .
On the one hand , Rupert Murdoch , spending more millions , is due to launch the Daily – his new digital newspaper for iPad users – standing side by side with the legendary Steve Jobs , the real big Apple .
On the other hand , he ca n't : Steve , as the world now knows , is off sick again .
On the one hand , Apple sold more than 17 m iPads last year , and analysts forecast 44.6 m sales in 2011 .
On the other hand , hopes that this will prove a launching pad for newspaper fortunes look a little on the wan side .
The latest research from Knowledge Networks shows that a mere 13 % of iPad users are likely to download an app for a magazine or paper they already pay for – and that out of a current average of 24 apps per user , only six involve payment .
On the one hand , screen size shrinking along with expectations ( the latest Guardian and Daily Mail apps for iPhone connections cost £ 3.99p a year and £ 8.99p respectively , creating a tiny paywall around digital news services free on the web ) .
On the other hand , Benedict Evans at the revered Enders Analysis , is tearing his hair .
"" To be worth it , a paywall has to earn more than you lose in ad revenue from a lower audience – so why is the Guardian charging under £ 4 ? ""
And on the other , other hand , Enders sometimes gets it wrong .
On the one hand , the Daily will cost subscribers 99 cents a day ( not so far off a print newspaper price ) and the Independent 's "" i "" app is aiming for 20p a time , exactly the same as in print .
On the other hand ( see the Guardian , Telegraph , Mail and many more ) entry to news websites will be free , and apps wo n't amount to much more than 1 % of the print cover price .
On the one hand , James Murdoch thinks print subscribers who migrate to web / pad subscriptions leave their old print - reading loyalties behind , which may be one reason why ( post - paywall )
Times circulation was down 14 % year - on - year in December .
On the other hand , the two quality papers with free upmarket news websites – the Telegraph and the Guardian – were also down 10.2 % and 11.8 % ( and might privately ascribe some of that loss to iPhone app seepage ) .
On the one hand , then , we all know what we 're doing and where we 're going .
On the other hand , search me !
I have n't a clue ."
2011-01-25,"What happened the last time you called into work sick ?
A sympathetic sentence from a colleague , possibly .
Some quality time alone with Cash in the Attic , certainly .
In due course came re - entry , with the brackish waters of the office closing overhead as swiftly as if you 'd never left .
When Steve Jobs announced last week that he would be spending some time away from Apple , he promptly knocked £ 12.5bn off the value of his employer .
News of his sick leave made front pages and even had Wall Street analysts bemoaning the loss of a "" genius "" .
Jobs has always been the best repackager in the technology industry .
Over the past decade , he 's alchemised the plain old MP3 player into the iPod , turned the corporate road warrior 's mobile - email - browser - whatever into the iPhone and transformed the ugly tablet PC into the iPad .
And last week , even as he took medical leave , the Apple boss did it again , setting the seal on the transformation of the chief executive into the figurehead of his own corporate cult .
The man business hacks call iGod has been playing this game for decades .
Down the years photos show him in that unchanging Boomer outfit of black mock turtlenecks and stonewashed denim — instant recognisability in an anonymous industry .
Then there are his gnomic utterances and the annual religious convention , the Macworld Expo in San Francisco , where Jobs regularly turns up to lay hands on his devotees .
This is free advertising for a company that needs to flog its products by the millions , of course – but the cult also numbers Apple 's own staffers .
"" It 's Beatlemania , "" one former executive told the New Yorker in 1997 just as Jobs turned up on the company 's Cupertino campus again , after 12 years away .
The saviour was back .
True , before Jobs rejoined the fold , the question most commonly asked about the company he co - founded was how long it had left before making the corporate obituaries .
Yet that does n't make its turnaround solely the work of one heavily stubbled mastermind , who saved a company through his singular vision , taste and liberal use of the i- prefix .
The messiah talk ignores the fact that Apple has around 46,600 full - time employees and another 3,000 temporary staff – including some of the best designers and marketers in the business .
Far from being a semi - mystical software visionary , Jobs is a ruthless office politician ( during his long campaign to take back his company , reported the New Yorker in that 1997 article , one Apple alumnus warned : "" Steve is going to fuck Gil [ Amelio , the former CEO ] so hard his eardrums will pop . "" )
Nor does it take into account the way in which global supply chains minimise the role of any one individual , no matter how powerful .
Take , for instance , the iPad : the display panel is probably from a Korean contractor , the backlight will have been knocked up by a Taiwanese firm and the GPS is likely to have been made in Germany .
Then there is the battery ( Chinese , perhaps ) , the flash memory ( which could well be from Japan 's Toshiba ) and the case ( Taiwan , again ) .
Jobs is part of a widespread trend among chief executives to put themselves forward not as managers , but as leaders .
Follow the coverage of the Davos summit this week and count the number of times a corporate finance officer for some accounting - software company or other is described as a business leader .
Elite MBA programmes boast of how they will turn students into "" change agents "" .
As I type , the January 2007 cover of Harvard Business Review stares back at me . ""
The Tests of a Leader "" , it blares , under a photo of some shirt - sleeved young Turk doing push - ups on a boardroom table . ""
Managers do things right , leaders see the right thing is done , "" said Warren Bennis , founding father of Leadership studies .
The implication was clear : a manager was good at painting by numbers , but a business leader was more akin to Turner .
The result has been a tremendous boost in chief - executive power , according to Dennis Tourish , an academic at Kent University .
He points out that just before Enron imploded it was run like a cult , with Jeff Skilling exercising huge control and influence over who was recruited , how they worked – and who got laid off .
And while Enron was an exception , Tourish points out that Jack Welch as boss of General Electric had similar power . ""
Business leaders typically only have yes - men – no one to stand up to them . ""
In the end what the leadership talk appears to add up to is an alibi for bosses taking much more money out of the companies they run .
There is John Thain who , even as he ran Merrill Lynch into the wall , demanded it pay $ 1.2 m to redecorate his office , including $ 35,000 for a "" commode on legs "" .
Then there is Mark Hurd , who ruled Hewlett - Packard with the iron law of pay for performance – until he was himself drummed out of office last August for alleged corporate malfeasance and took a severance package of $ 34.6 m .
And for Team GB , we have Fred the Shred and his outsize pension , and BP 's Tony Hayward receiving millions for his role in turning the Gulf oil spill from a tragedy into a farce .
Set against that lot , Jobs looks like an exemplar .
But he is really the best example of an unhealthy trend ."
2011-01-25,"The announcement that Steve Jobs is to step down as chief executive of Apple for health reasons had an immediate impact on share prices and has prompted discussion about whether it is good for a company to be so identified with one individual .
The so - called cult of the chief executive is also recognised in the public sector .
These are individuals who are credited with turning around failing organisations or for making mediocre organisations great .
Some come in at a point of crisis work their magic and go on to bigger and greater things , others build over a good many years and go only reluctantly when retirement beckons .
Whichever type they are they present the problem of what happens when they leave .
But how many chief executives are truly indispensable ?
There are high profile chief executives like Barry Quirk at Lewisham council and the chief executives of the most improved authorities – according to the Audit Commission – like Martin Reeves at Coventry city council and Joanne Roney in Wakefield .
There are also consistently top performing authorites like Kent county council , which lost popular chief executive Peter Gilroy last May.
While no one could argue about the achievements of these authorities , many would consider it a backhanded compliment to label their chief executives as "" cult "" figures .
I 'm sure even Steve Jobs , credited as he is for making Apple a globally successful company , has a very competent team of senior managers beneath him and that Apple has some of the brightest and most innovative people in the industry working for them .
So why is the stock exchange so nervous ?
Put another way why does any successful organisation , service or team worry about the impact of a high - profile leader leaving unless they think what has been achieved is all down to that individual .
Some of this can be explained by natural anxiety along the lines of ' what if the replacement is n't any good or wants to change everything ? '
There may be a concern that some of the most able and experienced managers will see this as the time to go – their loyalty being to the individual not the organisation .
New chief executives ( like new senior managers ) want to surround themselves with their own appointments – people who think like them and do n't keep referring to how things were done under the predecessor .
So some closely associated with the old order may be encouraged to go .
There may be concern that these changes of key personnel will adversely affect the organisation , albeit in the short term .
It could be that the charismatic , high - profile and highly - regarded leader 's achievements were down to their sheer force of personality – people at all levels in the organisation believed in this person and were prepared to go along with their vision and their decisions because they liked and respected them .
Nothing wrong with that you say , we want and need leaders who inspire their staff .
Well in my view we do n't .
This type of leadership may be very effective in a crisis but this "" cult of the leader "" is very damaging for an organisation in the longer term .
To use a sporting analogy , this would be the difference between a great team and a great club .
A great team goes a whole season without losing , a great club is one that has a succession of successful teams ; even though the individuals change the philosophy behind it , the way the club is run does n't change .
In organisational terms the culture is not ' follow the leader ' , the culture is based on a shared set of values , a shared vision of the future and an agreed way of doing things .
This will not change even if the leader does .

2011-02-13,"As I write , the most valuable company in the world , in terms of market capitalisation , is Exxon Mobil .
This is a huge corporation , based in Texas and operating across the world .
It drills for , and refines , oil ; sells thousands of oil - derived and petrol - related products ; and operates in all the major markets in the world .
In the UK , it owns Esso , for example , and the chances are that if you bought engine oil or other lubricants in the last year you were purchasing an Exxon product .
And last Thursday morning it was worth $ 416.3bn .
Question : on the same morning , what was the second most valuable company in the world ?
Another oil giant ?
A global retailer such as Walmart ?
A multinational mining company ?
Answer : none of the above .
It was a California - based computer manufacturer that makes outrageously expensive products for the wealthy consumer .
Its name is Apple Inc and last Thursday its shares were trading at just under $ 360 apiece .
It 's surprising enough to see a mere technology company challenging an energy giant for top billing .
But it 's even more astonishing when one looks at the history of the two companies .
In 2002 , for example , Exxon 's market cap was $ 300bn , whereas Apple 's valuation that year peaked at $ 9bn in April .
Go back even further – to 1996 – and you find that Apple was a company that most people believed was heading for the knacker 's yard , with its shares priced at $ 24 and sliding .
So what happened to change things ?
The answer is that Steve Jobs returned .
He had co - founded the company in 1976 ( with Steve Wozniak ) , but left in 1985 following disagreements with the board .
He then went on to found another computer company ( NeXT ) and a film animation company ( Pixar ) while his successors at Apple fumbled and the company embarked on its tailspin to oblivion .
In 1996 , with disaster looming , Apple bought NeXT – and its technology – and Jobs came with it .
The following year , he became chief executive at a salary of $ 1 a year .
The rest is history .
Jobs is a charismatic , messianic visionary – a fanatic for elegant design and high - end functionality .
He is an incredibly demanding boss , but also an inspiring leader .
And he is one of the technology world 's toughest negotiators .
Apple 's recovery under his leadership began with a major revamp of its computer products , but only really took off when he began his bid to capture the market for online music with the iPod / iTunes combination .
Having achieved that , Jobs turned his attention to the mobile phone business , which he is currently turning upside down .
Latest figures reveal that the Apple iPhone has 17.25 % of the "" smartphone "" market and an astonishing 4.2 % of the total mobile phone market .
And this despite not having a phone at all until 2007 .
Watching Jobs in action , I 've always had the feeling that there 's something eerily familiar about him .
But it was n't until I read a new book , The Master Switch , by Columbia law professor Tim Wu , that the penny dropped .
The book chronicles the history of the major communications industries of the 20th century and finds that pivotal moments in their evolution came when an entrepreneur arrived to offer consumers higher quality , production values and/or greater ease of use than were being delivered by the incumbents .
The visionary entrepreneurs of Wu 's century were men such as Theodore Vail ( who built AT&amp;T into a powerful monopoly ) , Adolph Zukor ( who created the vertically integrated Hollywood studio system ) and David Sarnoff ( who founded NBC and led RCA ) .
In each case , these men saw in the chaotic openness of a nascent industry an opportunity for someone who could offer dependability , quality and ease of use .
Which is why Steve Jobs comes to mind .
Prior to the arrival of the iPod , for example , there were lots of portable MP3 players and a host of different programs for ripping , organising and playing music tracks on PCs .
But getting tracks from PC to player – and keeping the two devices synchronised – required technical knowledge .
Early adopters love such challenges .
But the average consumer does not , which is why , when Jobs launched the iPod , he was pushing at an open door .
This is why attempts to compare Jobs to computer entrepreneurs such as Bill Gates or Larry Ellison fall wide of the mark .
He 's not really a computer guy at all .
Computers are incidental to his vision .
He 's a media mogul in the old style .
And if things keep going the way they are , his company might be the most valuable in the world this time next year ."
2011-02-23,"Apple has fought off investor demands that the company outline succession plans for its ailing founder Steve Jobs , on medical leave with cancer .
Shareholders seeking to force the company to lay out a clear post - Jobs strategy for Apple lost a vote on the issue at the technology firm 's annual meeting in San Francisco .
Jobs has created one of the world 's most powerful companies and is a hands - on manager who has overseen the launch of hit after hit for Apple , from the iMac to the iPod and iPad .
Jobs , who turns 56 on 24 February , was diagnosed with a rare type of pancreatic cancer in 2004 and has had health issues ever since .
This month the influential Institutional Shareholder Services ( ISS ) , which advises pension fund investors , backed a shareholder proposal to require Apple to disclose a succession plan for Jobs .
Jobs is so closely tied to the company 's image and products that Apple 's share price reacts to every fresh rumour about his health .
Apple has avoided talking publicly about its plans for when Jobs leaves the company . ""
ISS believes that shareholders would benefit by having a report on the company 's succession plans disclosed annually , "" ISS said in a statement .
"" Such a report would enable shareholders to judge the board on its readiness and willingness to meet the demands of succession planning based on the circumstances at that time . ""
The meeting was led by Tim Cook , Jobs 's second in command .
Cook was elevated from chief operating officer to acting CEO in January when Jobs took medical leave .
Cook and Apple 's board lost a vote suggested by shareholders that board directors must be elected by majority vote .
This year is the first that shareholders have been able to request that succession plans be made public .
The change was made after unexpected high - profile departures at drugs group Pfizer and computer firm Hewlett - Packard .
Since Jobs announced he was going on medical leave , stories have emerged about his continued involvement with Apple and its product developments .
He has been seen around Silicon Valley and last week attended a dinner for top tech executives held by the US president , Barack Obama .
The fight for greater disclosure is being led by a construction workers ' pension fund based in Illinois , which owns Apple shares worth £ 2.5 m .
It follows investor anger over the handling of Jobs 's medical leave in 2008/2009 .
Jobs was absent for six months , but the news that he had had a liver transplant came after Apple dodged questions about his health and a week after the increasingly gaunt chief executive had said his recent weight loss was caused by a treatable hormone deficiency . ""
Disclosure is necessary , particularly in a public company where the leadership is obviously so important to investors , "" said Charles Elson , chair of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware .
Jobs 's status had become "" a drama "" , said Elson .
"" Is he there ?
Is he not there ?
He 's out with Obama .
He 's sick .
It 's too much .
I 'm all for board discretion but in this case it 's too much and investors need clarity . ""
The battle over disclosure comes as Apple prepares to launch the second generation of its hit iPad .
The company has so far sold 15 m iPads , creating a new category of touchscreen tablet computers , but is now facing stiff competition .
Cook is expected to unveil a new generation of thinner , faster iPads at an event in San Francisco on 2 March ."
2011-03-02,"It 's not hard to read Steve Jobs ' surprise appearance at Wednesday 's iPad 2 unveiling as a mark of desperation .
Is Apple so in need of a boost to its share price that it needed to haul Jobs out of medical leave ?
The audience was thrilled that Jobs showed up : "" We 've been working on this product for a while , and I did n't want to miss it .
Thank you for having me , "" he told the audience .
All Things Digital 's Kara Swisher said it would be so .
But was his appearance designed to distract us from an underwhelming launch ?
His introduction seemed to try even harder than usual to build up Apple and to knock its rivals - from ebook and app download numbers to dismissing the competition 's attempts at tablets .
What were we left with after that ?
A faster processor , a dual - core A5 chip , that will mean it can operate twice as fast and render graphics up to nine times faster .
A front - facing camera that will allow Apple to push Facetime , but was an obvious omission from the first iPad and one that Apple , rather annoyingly deliberately held back so it had something to add this time around .
A less logical rear - facing camera - who 's going to use the iPad to shoot anything ?
Those improvements could all have been made to the original iPad , though you ca n't count a black and white version as an improvement .
Lighter , thinner , maybe .
Is there really much incentive to buy an iPad 2 ?
The stats Apple revealed are more impressive , all designed as part of that share - boosting drive : 100 m iPhones shipped , 200 m iTunes accounts and more than $ 2bn paid to developers .
That means Apple 's own revenue from apps has been $ 6.6bn
[ Apple takes 30 % commission - not 70 % ! ]
$ 2.8bn .
If the news industry does n't revolt , and if Apple 's rivals do n't make too much headway on paid - for apps , Apple will be making a lot more in that direction .
But Steve Jobs ' appearance undermined Apple 's obligation to cultivate a new public face of Apple , apparently for the short - term benefit of a stock - price boost .
Long term , that 's succeeded in keeping the succession the main story ."
2011-03-02,"Apple 's Steve Jobs has made a surprise appearance to show off the company 's updated version of its iPad tablet computer , and to knock copycats which he said had not yet caught up with the company 's original version released last year .
The newer iPad , which adds a front camera for video calls and a camera on the back for taking pictures , is thinner and faster than its predecessor .
It is also available for the first time in white .
It will retail for the same price when it becomes available from 11 March in the US and from 25 March in the UK and other countries .
Though he looked frail and thin , the presence of Jobs , 56 , instantly boosted the company 's stock price by $ 3 ( Â£1.83 ) , a 1 % rise , and he was given a standing ovation from the audience of industry figures and executives in the Yerba Buena centre in San Francisco .
In January , Jobs took indefinite medical leave from working at the company he co - founded â€ “ believed to be due to a recurrence of the cancer first diagnosed in 2004 .
He was , however , animated as he said : "" We 've been working on this product for a while , and I did n't want to miss it .
Thank you for having me . ""
Dismissing rivals ' attempts at producing alternatives to the iPad as high - priced and low - selling , with few applications available for them , he also had news that underlined Apple 's increasingly aggressive moves into the ebook market .
Jobs said that the publisher Random House is joining the iBooks scheme for the iPad , bringing 17,000 publications , and that there had been 100 m ebooks downloaded in the past year .
Separately , he pointed to Apple 's increasing grip on the online content market , noting that the iTunes Store , through which books , music , films and apps are sold , now has 200 m accounts worldwide â€ “ making it the biggest credit card account holder on the web .
Meanwhile , he said , Apple has now sold 100 m iPhones , and developers have earned $ 2bn from selling apps on Apple 's online store .
"" We 've sold 15 m iPads in nine months , that 's more than every tablet PC [ from Microsoft ] ever sold , "" he said .
"" We got over 90 % market share .
Our competitors were flummoxed . ""
Industry reports from Apple suppliers suggest that the company hopes to ship around 40 m of the devices this year .
However , analysts are still predicting that products based around Google 's free Android operating system will eventually overhaul Apple .
Adam Leach of the research company
Ovum said : "" Devices based on Google 's platforms will only overtake those based on Apple 's platform by 2015 , when we forecast 36 % and 35 % market shares respectively of a total market with shipments of approximately 150 m units in 2015 .
This compares with Ovum 's estimate of 10 % for Google and 90 % for Apple at the end of 2010 . ""
Microsoft has still failed to make any impact on the fast - growing market , which is beginning to show signs of eating into its traditional stronghold of PCs , from which it derives most of its revenue .
In the US , PC sales have begun to flatten , partly because people are buying tablets instead , analysts say .
Microsoft might not have a response to Apple 's and Google 's platforms before 2012 , when it is expected to release a new version of Windows designed for tablets .
Meanwhile other companies including BlackBerry maker Research in Motion and Hewlett - Packard have announced that they will release tablets based on their own software later this year .
The new iPad will continue to solidify Apple 's stranglehold on the tablet market according to Forrester Research analyst Sarah Rotman Epps .
iPad 2 will claim 80 % of the US tablet market this year according to Forrester 's projections .
Of the more than 24 m tablets that will be sold to US consumers in 2011 , at least 20 m will be iPads .
Shiny new Apples Thinner , lighter , faster â€ “ Apple has added a touch of Air to the second version of the iPad .
The front and rear - facing cameras , the biggest omission from iPad 1 , have nowarrived , though the iPad is an unwieldy camera .
A gyroscope catches up with iPod Touch and iPhone , and the new A5 processor means better screen performance and faster graphics .
Obsessives will lust after the trophy - white iPad â€ “ whose promised cousin the white iPhone 4 never appeared â€ “ while a pleasant surprise was the fingerprint - removing smart case .
But Steve Jobs 's surprise appearance , which instantly upped Apple 's share price by 1 % , may have helped boost an underwhelming launch , which largely consisted of bragging about the iPad 's dominance and introducing features that were always notably absent from the first iPad .
Jemima Kiss"
2011-03-02,"We know what 's expected with the launch on Wednesday night of iPad 2 .
Not a teleporter , unfortunately , but a sensible list of improved features we 've explained before on PDA – plenty of which , like the camera , should arguably have been included on iPad 1 in the first place .
There 's the predictable slew of buzz - building reports overnight , the most unlikely of which comes from the usually infallible Kara Swisher on All Things Digital who says Steve Jobs himself is mulling an appearance .
That 's based on sources who say it is unconfirmed , but that if he does show up it would be a cameo role .
A cameo may be , but this would be a very bad idea .
Apple may want to reassure shareholders after speculation about Jobs ' health , rumours about Jonathan I ve wanting to relocate and coverage of former executive Paul Devine who could face 20 years in prison after admitting fraud .
But a brief appearance by Jobs is only likely to focus speculation on how healthy he seems , undermine the status - building of possible successors who need to lead the show this time round and take attention away from iPad , which should be enough of a boost for Apple .
Also , the guy is on medical leave , and this constant speculation on re - involving him in the daily Apple show is rather naive .
To re - cap , we 're expecting : a lighter , thinner iPad , possibly with a curved back ; a front - facing camera to enable Facetime , though a less - logical rear camera is also possible ; a new 128 GB version ; a three - axis gyroscope ; a mini - USB universal charging port ; and MobileMe is due an overhaul that will introduce a swathe of cloud - based features .
April is the likely release time for the US .
Apple will also add a few surprises , the most dramatic of which would be retinal display .
We think that 's unlikely give the extra demands on battery power , though perhaps they 've worked out a way round that .
A new global iPad could also run on GSM and CDMA networks , which is another possibility .
But what else will Apple have thought of ?
We hope for some more writer - friendly tools .
As @ThwartedEfforts commented last week , iPad is "" fine for idle surfing and games , but ... even editing a short email requires beta blockers "" .
@ParkyDR also suggested a self - wiping screen to get rid of fingerprints , which we love .
In anticipation of iPad 2 , Random House has tweaked its ebook pricing , reports paidContent , so that it can set the retail price , and then gives booksellers a cut .
Previously , publishing houses had sold wholesale and allowed retailers to discount , which is why Amazon sold ebooks at a loss to encourage sales for the Kindle .
Also overnight , we learnt that all this fuss might be for not very much at all .
Cult of Mac has been told by one Apple Insider that the iPad 3 will be the one really worth waiting for .
That 's expected later this year , says the report – though less than six months from iPad 2 , that seems way too soon .
The source also confirmed rumours of the GSM / CDMA model , faster chip and more Ram and both cameras . ""
The new MobileMe service will store music , TV shows , and films that were purchased from the iTunes store , "" claims Cult of Mac .
""
The staffer also said that there was talk inside Apple of being able to upload all your music and videos to the cloud whether it was purchased from iTunes or not . ""
This may finally be where music streaming service Lala , Apple 's 2009 acquisition , finally bears fruit ."
2011-03-03,"One of the more intriguing buzz - phrases from last night 's launch of the iPad 2 was "" post PC ' , initially used by chief executive Steve Jobs as a catch - all category for Apple 's iPod , iPhone and iPad products .
However , he came back to the idea right at the end of his presentation , specifically relating it to tablets .
"" Our competitors are looking at this like it 's the next PC market , "" he said .
"" That is not the right approach to this .
These are post - PC devices that need to be easier to use than a PC , more intuitive .
The hardware and software need to intertwine more than they do on a PC .
We think we 're on the right path with this . ""
This rhetoric was quickly picked up on by Forrester analyst Sarah Rotman Epps , who published a blog post hailing the iPad 2 , and running with the post - PC rhetoric . ""
In a post - PC world , consumers have a more intimate relationship with their devices .
They use them on the couch and in bed and not just at their desk .
They show their devices to other people ( 40 % of iPad owners in Forrester 's surveys report regularly sharing their iPad with other people ) .
"" You could just as easily call this "" a couch potato world "" if you were being flippant .
Loafing about on the sofa emailing , surfing and social networking is one of the key uses for the new generation of tablets , even if Apple 's TV ads have yet to feature a man in his pants tweeting abuse about The X Factor 's Wagner .
Give it time .
What 's interesting is how apps can tap into these behavioural patterns .
The trends can seem contradictory .
Many games developers see tablets as a chance to make richer , more immersive games , because people are playing for longer sessions on the sofa , rather than in five- or 10-minute bursts on the go .
On the other hand , apps are emerging that are designed around the way the user 's attention may be flitting to other forms of entertainment in their living room , such as music or TV .
Social app GetGlue , which enables people to check in Foursquare - style to TV shows , albums and other media , is one well - established example .
In the US , broadcaster ABC has released a pair of iPad apps for use while watching specific shows –
My Generation and Grey 's Anatomy – using a combination of the iPad mic and audio watermarks to synchronise the app 's content with the show .
As more research emerges about tablet usage patterns , developers will have more to go on when coming up with innovative app ideas for these devices – although this second - screen behaviour is just as applicable to smartphones and netbooks .
Developing apps for the post - PC era ?
It 's a bombastically naff corporate motto for the taking .
You might prefer the earthier version though : making apps for couch potatoes .
Steve Jobs might raise an eyebrow at the lingo , but he 'd surely approve of the sentiment ."

A feature about reconstructive surgery performed on Harry Berger – a victim of the Cumbrian shootings in 2010 whose limb was rebuilt thanks in part to lessons learned in conflict zones – referred to a pioneering surgeon , Harold Gillies , who practised in Sidcup , Kent , in 1917 .
His work there was at Queen Mary 's hospital , not Queen 's hospital as we had it ( War wounds , 1 March , page 18 , G2 ) .

That should have been alleging lack of impartiality ( or to put it another way , Ferguson was alleging partiality ) ."
2011-03-16,"Sencha , which recently tested the Motorola Xoom to see how its browser compatibility stacks up for HTML5/CSS3 developers , has now got its hands on an iPad 2 to see how its browser compares in the HTML5/CSS3/Javascript field .
( Sencha , as a reminder , provides open - source web application frameworks and tools to major Enterprises and independent developers - including Best Buy , Dell , Salesforce.com and Adobe . )
For the iPad , being able to deal well with HTML5 and CSS3 ( and having good Javascript ) is essential because - as pretty much everyone in the technology field knows -
it does n't do Flash ( and you can read Steve Jobs 's reasoning if you need a reminder why ; it 's actually interesting to revisit what he said then , in April 2010 , to see whether any of the points there have changed ) .
So how does the dual - core A5 chip in the just - released ( but hard to get ) iPad 2 running iOS match up against Motorola 's dual - core Tegra 2 chip in the just - released Xoom running Android 3.0 ?
According to Sencha , the iPad 2 beats the Xoom handily in pretty much all of the speed tests that they ran ; intriguingly , according to Sencha 's tests , the original iPad beats the Samsung Galaxy Tab on every single performance test on the WebKit browser ( which they both have in common ) ; it even matches the Xoom on a couple .
Just as interesting is how the iPad 2 performs against the Xoom , since that 's what developers who are trying to produce HTML5 products in the future will want to know .
According to Aditya Bansod , who also carried out the testing on the Xoom , the iPad 2 scores 100/100 on the Acid3 test , although as with the Xoom there are small rendering issues , such as wrongly - coloured squares in some places .
Next , browser features , investigated via a product called Modernizr : "" Modernizr found support for SVG , CSS 2D transforms , CSS 3D transforms , CSS transitions , WebGL and Web Sockets .
Interestingly enough , Modernizer reported that there was no Inline SVG although we were able to try a few demo sites and saw that it did in fact work , and it also reported that the browser supports WebGL , which we could n't get to work .
As we found in our earlier scorecards , just because a browser says something is there , it does n't mean it works .
All the other HTML5 features except the ones mentioned worked beautifully .
"" It 's the performance testing of the browser that shows the big improvements in the iPad 2 ; pretty much everything on the browser front is doubled compared to the first - generation machine .
There are six demos that you can try out your favourite HTML5-compatibie browser on ( let us know how IE9 copes ) ; Bansod says that "" Without a doubt , the iPad 's Mobile Safari browser has the best CSS3 support of any mobile browser we 've seen .
"" Another interesting point is embedded HTML5 audio and video : "" Again , the iPad 2 nails it .
Audio plays back quickly and lets you pause and resume .
Video comes up quickly and streams without issue in the browser page .
The iPad 2 's media support is solid . ""
But that might be moot : Apple looks unlikely to go with Google 's WebM codec , which Google seems to be pushing increasingly hard over H.264 ( which Apple decodes in HTML5 ) .
The jury 's still out on whether H.264 in mobile HTML5 will fall down a gap between Flash on the desktop and WebM on Google properties .
One question that arises from the benchmarking : given that Google Chrome is such a fast browser , and it 's also based on WebKit , why does WebKit perform comparatively slowly on Android ?
Is it a poor Javascript implementation , or something else ?"
2011-03-24,"Bertrand Serlet is a very smart guy : you do n't get to be in charge of one of the development of one of the principal desktop operating systems ( and more to the point , you do n't survive Steve Jobs 's flamethrower management style ) without having a brain something like the size of a planet .
In fact he 's been working with Jobs since 1989 , which means he 's come through 22 years where he 's held his own with him .
This may make Serlet the longest - standing co - worker with Jobs .
Serlet is in the news because of the announcement on Wednesday that he is leaving Apple and his role as senior vice president of Mac software engineering ; that job will be taken over by Craig Federighi , who demonstrated the next version of Mac OSX ( dubbed "" Lion "" ) last October .
Federighi , like Serlet , is also an ex - NeXT Computer guy ; NeXT was the company Jobs set up after leaving Apple in 1985 .
Over at the WSJ 's AllThingsD site , John Paczkowski says the departure was a planned transition , with Serlet gradually selling off shares and looking towards doing some sort of academic study .
But Serlet 's fingerprints are all over core elements of Cocoa , the Objective - C programming language used on Mac OSX .
So Serlet leaves at a time when the rivalries between Microsoft , Apple and Google are growing ever more intense .
He 's a computer scientist .
He 's also , as you may have noticed from his name , French .
Which leads us to this example of how there 's still some way to go before computers really have everything down pat .
The video below shows Serlet poking fun at Vista at Apple 's Worldwide Developers Conference in 2006 .
Pretty standard stuff .
But now go and watch it on YouTube - and turn on the little option ( which does n't come up in the embed ) of "" Transcribe audio "" .
This uses Google 's whizzy speech - to - text system which works on what people say and gives them as subtitles .
However , it 's challenged enough when it comes to Steve Jobs : can you guess what it means when it transcribes him saying "" But is now called Mr "" ?
Maybe so .
But we think you 'll find it more difficult to reverse - engineer this part . ""

Serlet is certainly going to be missed - but the Google Transcribe tool probably wo n't be among those mourning his departure .

2011-03-25,"Apple chief Steve Jobs made a point of knocking rivals ' "" copycat "" tablet computers at the iPad 2 launch earlier this month .
Samsung , RIM and Motorola "" are n't even catching up with the first iPad "" , he said .
Apple did n't need to launch a second - generation iPad .
The original commands around 80 % of the US tablet market .
It is less than a year out of the box .
But when Jobs can improve on one of Apple 's products , you can rest assured that he will .
Thinner , lighter and faster than its predecessor , the iPad 2 has a smaller footprint than the original – plus two cameras and extra software such as GarageBand .
At 241 mm tall , 186 mm wide and 8.6 mm thick , Apple 's iPad 2 is the sleekest tablet computer on the market .
Its minimalist outer shell is complemented by a new "" smart cover "" that removes all the smears that come with thumbing and prodding the screen .
Unlike its older brother , the iPad 2 has rounded edges , meaning it can be held more comfortably for longer .
And at 100 g lighter , it is noticeably more comfortable to hold than its predecessor , which could become uncomfortable if held in the same position for more than 10 minutes .
The greatest departure from the original iPad is its speed .
Apple claims that loading apps , playing games and browsing the internet are up to up to twice as fast as on the original .
Certainly , internet browsing is the most striking difference .
Fixtures on the average internet page tend to load all at once –
Flash excepted , of course – and sometimes five or six seconds ahead of the original iPad .
As an owner of the original iPad , I 've never felt that performance was lagging ( then again , I also own a 20-month - old iPhone 3 G ) , but the iPad 2 's A5 dual core processor makes it much more responsive to touch .
The graphics upgrade is really only noticeable when playing £ 5.99 shoot - em - up games or streaming long - form programming such as the iPlayer .
For most people , I suspect the greatest immediate draw to the iPad 2 will be the cameras .
Apple was slammed when it did n't include them in its first edition and later claimed it to be users ' most - wanted function .
Sadly , the cameras on this device are left wanting .
Leaving aside the question of whether people really want to wave a 10inch x 7inch computer around in public , the VGA - quality front and rear - facing cameras – for video and stills – are pixel - poor and not flattered by the iPad 's high - quality screen .
The rear - facing camera is put to best use with FaceTime , Apple 's video - calling function .
Which leads us to software .
The iPad 2 includes a string of media apps which first - generation owners wo n't ever get a look at .
Apple 's popular music - making software GarageBand ( which iPad 1 users can get if they upgrade to iOS 4.3 ) is great fun and a boon for those with rambunctious young kids knocking about the house .
Warning : it does n't come with headphones so do n't turn the volume up too loud .
Apple 's movie - making app , iMovie , also finds a new home on the iPad 2 .
Precision editing was never one of the iPad 's strong points – writers bemoan spending hours hovering over misspelt words before the cursor would respond to the change –
so the iPad seems an unnatural home for iMovie .
Frankly , uploading to the web or to a synced Mac is so painless that iMovie could happily gather dust for most users .
( A new hall - of - mirrors - style app called Photo Booth is so pointless it wastes good real estate
– it ca n't be deleted . )
Despite the faster processor and enhanced graphics , the iPad 2 's battery life is on a par with the original ; long - life performance is one of the device 's strongest selling points .
My one qualm has to be the amount of time it takes for the iPad to charge – inordinately long compared with drain time .
Apple 's attention to detail shines through with the new "" Smart Cover "" .
At the iPad 2 launch , Jobs spent so much time demonstrating this magically magnetic clip - on sheath that I thought it would inevitably be a flop .
In fact , the Smart Cover promises to shut out all the third - party manufacturers that churned out dog - eared cases for the iPad 1 .
Overall , the iPad 2 offers a string of incremental but important improvements on its predecessor .
It remains a stretch ahead of the pack – though not quite "" lapping the competition "" , as Apple would like to make out – and it is hard to find any serious shortcomings with the second - generation tablet .
However owners of the original iPad should not feel too sore about the upgrade : you do n't need to buy a new tablet .
Those waiting to buy their first tablet could do much worse than the iPad 2 ."
2011-04-12,"The publishing brainboxes who dreamed up the title of the Apple founder 's authorised biography were presumably delighted that iSteve :
The Book of Jobs works on so many levels .
But seldom has a title been so excruciating on every one of them .
Still , at least the name of Steve Jobs 's book gives some clue about the contents therein .
The compulsion to ape various comics ' tossed - off tomes with a punning title is increasingly leading to otherwise serious autobiographies being given a title with a double meaning that has no meaning ( step forward Christopher Hitchens and Hitch-22 ) or just an achingly dull joke .
Then again , there is something lovable about a spectacularly awful pun .

2011-04-13,"An inside look into the life story of Apple boss Steve Jobs , a revolutionary book from a rising star of popular science , and a sought - after debut drawing on Edith Wharton 's The Age of Innocence are among the books causing a stir at this year 's London Book Fair .
Despite the tough economic times , and worries over the health of the high street , the fair – celebrating its 40th year - is bustling again after the washout in 2010 when the Icelandic volcano kept international visitors away .
Former PM John Major 's stirring tale of derring - do in the British music hall has been announced , as has The Lennon Letters , coming in the autumn .
Meanwhile the tricksily titled iSteve : The Book of Jobs , out in 2012 , will be notable as the first biography with which the Apple co - founder has agreed to co - operate .
The author , journalist Walter Isaacson , has had the benefit of three years ' worth of interviews with the 56-year - old mogul , who remains on medical leave of absence from the company after serious health problems .
Ursula McKenzie , head of publisher Little , Brown , promised the biography would offer "" a unique insight into the life and thinking of the man who has single - handedly transformed the world for all of us and in ways we never thought imaginable "" .
Quantum of Life by Iraqi - born theoretical physicist Professor Jim al - Khalili , who is presenting a high - profile BBC Radio 4 documentary series this autumn , sparked an auction which raged on the eve of the fair .
Transworld 's Sally Gaminara – who edits Richard Dawkins and Stephen Hawking – eventually won the book with a six - figure bid , calling it a "" new direction and a cutting - edge examination of how physics is revolutionising biology "" .
And another hotly - contested auction was fought over a first novel by Francesca Segal , daughter of Love Story author Erich Segal .
Chatto and Windus secured Temple Fortune , described as "" age - old tale of love , temptation , confusion , commitment and coming to terms with the choices we 've made "" .
The novel recasts Edith Wharton 's tale The Age of Innocence from its 1870s New York setting into that of a close - knit Jewish community in contemporary north London , where a young man experiences pre - wedding jitters .
A follow - up to the novel Push , the story of illiterate 16-year - old Precious Jones , filmed as Precious , was also announced at the fair .
Author Sapphire has written a sequel , telling the story of Precious 's orphaned son Abdul , and the book will be published in August .
The fair has also seen the customary bandwagon - jumping , with acres of Scandinavian crime being bought and sold , with a Finnish serial - killer tale set in a futuristic Helskinki , The Healer by Antti Tuominen , among the hottest properties .
A vogue for fictional Gypsy weddings also appears to be on the way ( publisher Cornerstone snapped up Gypsy Wedding , the novel ) , and numerous book proposals have been offering ripostes to Amy Chua 's hotly debated parenting memoir Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother ."
2011-04-20,"Apple 's quarterly earnings grew by 95 % to $ 6bn ( £ 3.65bn ) and revenue by 83 % to $ 24.7bn compared with the year - ago quarter , but sales of its iPad tablet stuttered to just 4.7 m after a huge Christmas rush in the previous quarter .
However , the number of iPhones sold , 18.6 m , more than doubled from the 8.75 m a year ago , and also maintained quarter - on - quarter growth from the 16.2 m sold in the last three months of 2010 , suggesting that demand for the company 's phone remains strong and is still growing .
Tim Cook , the chief operating officer , who is in charge while chief executive , Steve Jobs , is on medical leave , said the earthquake and tsunami in Japan would cut revenues by $ 200 m in the current quarter but that there was no disruption at all to the company 's supply chain after Apple moved quickly to secure it .
"" We do n't expect any effects , but the situation remains unpredictable , "" he said .
Of Jobs , Cook said : "" We see him on a regular basis and he continues to be involved in major strategic decisions , and I know he wants to be back full time as soon as he can . ""
He added that despite the numbers for iPads in the quarter just ended , present demand was "" staggering "" and that it was being rolled out to many more countries .
"" We sold every one that we could make . ""
The company 's vulnerability to seasonal demand , and the public 's expectation that it would update its iPad early in the year , meant that revenues and profits were slightly lower than the previous quarter covering the Christmas period .
However , Peter Oppenheimer , the chief financial officer , said the launch in mid - March of the revised iPad 2 had seen a huge boost in demand : "" We 're thrilled with its momentum , "" he said .
"" We sold every iPad 2 that we could make and would have liked to have more . ""
The iPhone generated $ 12.3bn of revenue , up 126 % on the year before , at an average selling price of $ 660 , up from $ 620 a year ago , helped by rapid sales growth in the US of 155 % as it started to be sold on Verizon , the largest mobile carrier in the country , along with AT&amp;T , which reported strong results earlier on Wednesday .
Sales of the iPod music player , once the barnstorming driver of Apple 's growth , continued to fall both in annual and quarterly comparisons , to 9 m , down 17 % year - on - year , having peaked in the Christmas period of 2008 .
The $ 6.40 per - share earnings figures beat professional analysts ' estimates by nearly $ 1 , 19 % higher than forecasts of $ 5.37 .
Analysts had also expected that iPhone sales would barely budge compared to the previous quarter .
Oppenheimer and Cook suggested that the iPad will see rocketing sales in the current quarter , despite the comparatively disappointing numbers in the quarter just ended .
"" Demand has been staggering , "" Cook said .
"" I 'm still amazed that we 're heavily backlogged .
However , I 'm extremely pleased with the manufacturing ramp .
I 'm confident that we can produce a large number of iPads in this quarter . ""
He was unsure , however , whether that would be sufficient to meet demand .
Apple 's products are being challenged more broadly by products using Google 's free Android operating system in both smartphones and tablets .
In smartphones , Android is reckoned to have the largest share worldwide , though tablets struggle to compete with the iPad .
Cook said that he felt "" very , very good "" about Apple 's future products compared with Android , and added that "" our business proposition is very strong – iPhone 's integrated approach is materially better than Android 's fragmented approach "" .
Oppenheimer pointed to the large proportion of Fortune 500 companies testing the iPhone and iPad , saying this showed corporate acceptance of the devices .

2011-04-21,"Smartphones running Google 's Android software collect data about the user 's movements in almost exactly the same way as the iPhone , according to an examination of files they contain .
The discovery , made by a Swedish researcher , comes as the Democratic senator Al Franken has written to Apple 's chief executive Steve Jobs demanding to know why iPhones keep a secret file recording the location of their users as they move around , as the Guardian revealed this week .
Magnus Eriksson , a Swedish programmer , has shown that Android phones – now the bestselling smartphones – do the same , though for a shorter period .
According to files discovered by Eriksson , Android devices keep a record of the locations and unique IDs of the last 50 mobile masts that it has communicated with , and the last 200 Wi - Fi networks that it has "" seen "" .
These are overwritten , oldest first , when the relevant list is full .
It is not yet known whether the lists are sent to Google .
That differs from Apple , where the data is stored for up to a year .
In addition , the file is not easily accessible to users : it requires some computer skills to extract the data .
By contrast , the Apple file is easily extracted directly from the computer or phone .
Google had not responded to requests for comment at the time this story was published .
Senator Franken has asked Jobs to explain the purpose and extent of the iPhone 's tracking . ""
The existence of this information - stored in an unencrypted format - raises serious privacy concerns , "" Franken writes in his letter to Jobs . ""
Anyone who gains access to this single file could likely determine the location of a user 's home , the businesses he frequents , the doctors he visits , the schools his children attend , and the trips he has taken - over the past months or even a year . ""
Franken points out that a stolen or lost iPhone or iPad could be used to map out its owner 's precise movements "" for months at a time "" and that it is not limited by age , meaning that it could track the movements of users who are under 13 .
Another security researcher , Alex Levinson , says that he discovered the file inside the iPhone last year , and that it has been used in the US by the police in a number of cases .
He says that its purpose is simply to help the phone determine its location , and that he has seen no evidence that it is sent back to Apple .
However documents lodged by Apple with the US Congress suggest that it does use the data if the user agrees to give the company "" diagnostic information "" from their iPhone or iPad .
Apple has still not commented formally on the purpose of the file , despite repeated requests from the Guardian .
The discovery that Android devices - which are quickly becoming the best - selling products in the smartphone space - also collect location data indicates how essential such information has become to their effective operation . ""
Location services "" , which can help place a user on a map , are increasingly seen as important for providing enhanced services including advertising - which forms the basis of Google 's business .
Eriksson says he uncovered the files after seeing coverage about the iPhone file . ""
Following the latest days internet outrage / overreaction to the revelation that iPhone has a cache for its location service , I decided to have look what my Android devices caches for the same function , "" he wrote at the site where he has provided computer code to examine the file .

2011-04-24,"Paul Allen , the billionaire co - founder of Microsoft , has lashed out at internet rivals such as Apple and described Google as "" evil "" .
After his views on his co - founder , Bill Gates , emerged last month when extracts from his memoirs were published in the US , Allen is now focusing on his rivals .
He describes Steve Jobs , the boss of Apple who is on medical leave , as "" monomaniacal "" .
In an interview with the Sunday Times , Allen criticises Sergey Brin and Larry Page , the co - founders of Google , for their corporate mission statement : "" Do n't be evil "" .
Allen talked about their "" elbows and claws "" in their pursuit for growth .
"" I chuckle when I see people pushing the boundaries all the time of what they can do to monetise things , capture things – and then say , we 're not evil , as if their default is not to push the boundaries , "" Allen said .
"" If your default is to push the boundaries , to just go for it , and then see if you get pushed back , then do n't say you 're not evil , "" he added .
Google was criticised after it emerged that while it was gathering the images for its Street View site , it was also collecting information on email addresses and passwords .
In his autobiography , Idea Man , Allen describes how he and Gates were inseparable at school in Seattle but their relationship later soured and he describes Gates as a sarcastic bully who tried to force him out of the company .
Allen describes how Gates brought in Steve Ballmer , the current boss , and how after returning from fighting Hodgkin 's lymphoma he heard the pair trying to reduce his influence – and confronted them about their intentions .
It sparked Allen 's resignation and he refused an offer to buy him out for $ 5 a share – a sensible move given the share price is now $ 25 and his fortune is estimated at $ 13bn ."
2011-04-25,"Steve Jobs has responded to the mounting questions about iPhones collecting location data for up to a year - a revelation that could lead to privacy investigations by some European governments .
In a characteristically terse email , apparently sent directly from his iPhone , the Apple chief executive - who is officially on medical leave from his company , and has been seen only briefly in public since January - insisted that "" we do n't track anyone "" , and instead aimed his ire at Google , claiming that "" they do "" track users .
The exchange , documented by a reader of the MacRumors website who emailed Jobs ( whose address is well - known online ) , appears to be legitimate .
Apple has not commented on its provenance .
The reader asked Jobs : Could you please explain the necessity of the passive location - tracking tool embedded in my iPhone ?
It 's kind of unnerving knowing that my exact location is being recorded at all times .
Maybe you could shed some light on this for me before I switch to a [ Google Android ] Droid .
They do n't track me .
Jobs 's reply , in full : Oh yes they do .
We do n't track anyone .
The info circulating around is false .
Sent from my iPhone While it is certainly true that Android phones do gather anonymised location information , Google has insisted that the collection is opt - in , with a clear dialogue which the user is presented with before proceeding .
In addition , Google 's system only retains the most recent 50 mobile cell masts and 200 Wi - Fi networks seen , and in a form that is hard to access .
By contrast Apple 's seems to collect an almost unlimited amount in a form which is easily accessible to anyone who gets their hands on the phone .
Apple has also confirmed to the US Congress that iPhones and iPads collect location data when permitted by the user , and buried in the lengthy license document for the iTunes Store ( used to synchronise data ) is an 86-word paragraph which gives the company the right to access location data collected by the user .
However the data is all anonymised , with no personal details of the user or physical addresses for the phone .
Jobs 's claim that "" we do n't track anyone "" is arguably true , in that Apple could not target named individuals .
However the benefits of the location - tracking services to targeted advertising based on whether a phone is being used are clear to both Apple and Google .
Jobs 's assertion that "" The info circulating around is false "" is hard to analyse , given that he does not say which information he is referring to .
But hundreds of people have posted maps online showing how their iPhone or iPad has tracked their movements ."
2011-04-27,"Towards the end of the iPad 2 launch event in March , Apple chief executive Steve Jobs told the assembled journalists about his company 's position at the intersection of "" technology and the liberal arts "" .
A multiplayer iPhone poetry game would seem to slot neatly into that vision , although phrases like "" rub my magic member "" , "" sniff my glorious exploding spraying monster "" and "" juicy monkey muscle ""
might not be quite what Jobs was thinking of .
That 's the language awaiting anyone who downloads one of the more interesting iPhone games to be released in recent weeks : Prose With Bros. Developer Evil Laugh Games calls it the "" first ever multiplayer competitive poetry game "" , available in free and paid versions .
Released on 20 April , it is already picking up word - of - mouth buzz .
Poetry ?
Fridge poetry to be specific .
Prose With Bros is based around the idea of stringing together virtual word - tiles into cogent sentences , and doing it better than opponents in the two - player online battles that form the basis for the game .
Each player is given the same 50 words to construct their prose , and after submitting the results , other players vote on which is best over the course of the next 24 hours .
It 's that crowdvoting aspect that makes Prose With Bros interesting .
The first thing players see when firing up the game is a battle to vote on , and give virtual ' kudos ' if a sentence is particularly clever – with the sentences being read out by the iPhone .
Swiping down on the homescreen shows a player 's battles that are currently being voted on , complete with a live score – shown as percentages of the vote .
The problem – although admittedly it 's a selling point for a healthy portion of the game 's current player base – is that the tone has quickly dived downwards .
Why ?
Here 's a list of the kind of words being offered up to players to wax lyrical with : stuff , spicy , love , kumquat , slap , body , beg , pants , poke , chubby , bratwursts , filthy , midgets , member , banana , spraying , fireman , juicy , meatballs , dangly .
It 's fair to say the early Prose With Bros community has taken to the rearrangement task with gusto , and the voting is rewarding the ruder fare ( yes , translation : poncey Guardian writer is grumpy because their carefully constructed fridge poetry is being trounced by barely - readable guff about chubby members ) .
The serious point is that currently , the game is sliding towards a much narrower gameplay focus - to be as rude as possible – which sells short the inventiveness behind the game itself .
Evil Laugh Games is well aware of this , adding a section to its App Store listing warning that "" Prose with Bros is not intended to be , but can quickly become , NSFW ...
We 're currently exploring ideas to add the option for users to be able to turn on a dirty - filter so that you do n't see these sentences if you do n't want to . ""
Prose With Bros has the makings of a cult hit rather than an Angry Birds - style chart juggernaut , but its appearance on the App Store shows there is still room for innovation – and yes , filthy spraying dangly bratwursts – in the apps world ."
2011-04-29,"South Park returned to US television on Wednesday night and wasted no time tackling the controversy surrounding Apple and its alleged "" big brother "" tendencies .
The sharply satirical and topical animated show , now in its 15th season , latched on to the recent revelations that Apple 's iPhone and iPad keep track of everywhere you go , and stores the data in hidden files on the devices .
In the episode , which also parodies the 2010 Dutch horror film The Human Centipede , Apple chief Steve Jobs decides to create a new product – a HumancentiPad , a hybrid of the iPhone , iPad and three human beings .
One of the boys from South Park , Kyle Broflovski , is chosen to take part in the experiment after he carelessly clicks on "" I agree "" without reading the new iTunes terms and conditions .
The result can be seen below .
Elsewhere in the episode , South Park 's resident misanthrope
Eric Cartman gets rather upset when his mother refuses to buy him an iPad , offering to buy him the cheaper "" Toshiba HandiBook "" instead .
This is not the first time that technology icons have come under the withering gaze of South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker .
In 2007 , the show won an Emmy award for the episode Make Love Not Warcraft , which lovingly parodied the online roleplaying game World of Warcraft .
That episode was created with the support of World of Warcraft developer Blizzard .
And recent series have featured episodes about Facebook , Bill Gates , the internet and the movie Tron .
Critical reaction to the HumancentiPad episode has been largely positive .
Writing at the Entertainment Weekly website , Ken Tucker said : Joining together two wildly disparate elements , one of the best - known entities in the world ( Apple and its products such as the iPad ) and one of the least - known ( the cult film The Human Centipede ) , the half hour was an unspeakable pleasure .
IGN.com critic Ramsey Isler says the ridiculousness of user agreements and those who do n't read them is a point well made : We should all be a wee bit more cognizant of exactly what we 're agreeing to ( although the enforceability of unreasonable terms in EULAs can always be judged by the courts ) .
But the bigger issue here is one of putting your faith in a corporate giant that may not have your best interests in mind .
Myself , I thought the episode was largely hilarious – particularly the selfish Cartman 's foul - mouthed tirade when his mother refuses to buy him an iPad .
And big respect to Stone and Parker for not taking the easy route and making jokes at the expense of Jobs 's ongoing cancer battle – fair play for attacking the company , and not the man .
But I do wonder if maybe the Human Centipede references were not a step too far .
What did you think ?
Have you seen the episode , and if so , will you be queuing outside the Apple Store when the HumancentiPad hits the shelves ?
And if you have n't seen it yet , here 's a clip ..."
2011-05-09,"An extraordinary picture of life within Apple , in which Steve Jobs is trying to create a "" university "" to teach incomers how the business makes decisions , keeps a "" top 100 "" coterie who are told key decisions ahead of time and bawls out entire teams for failures emerges from an article published in Fortune this week .
The article ( which is not yet online ) indicates that Apple is driven by Jobs 's personality : "" the creative process at Apple is one of constantly preparing someone - be it one 's boss , boss 's boss , or oneself - for a presentation to Jobs , "" writes Adam Lashinsky , who calls him "" a corporate dictator who makes every critical decision - and oddles of seemingly noncritical calls too "" .
One key element of the company that had not previously been disclosed is the existence of a "" Top 100 "" , not necessarily based on seniority , who gather every year for a three - day session at a sequestered location - one without a golf course , at Jobs 's insistence .
Attendees are discouraged from marking the dates on their calendar or discussing it .
They get to see super - secret new products before anyone else ; the iPod , unveiled ten years ago , was first shown off at one such meet .
But Apple also runs an extremely tight ship , with tiny product groups ; just two engineers were given the task of writing the code to convert the Safari browser to run on the iPad , a task that on its face seems like a huge undertaking that other companies such as Microsoft or Google might have devoted dozens of people to .
Jobs 's reputation as a manager who takes no prisoners is reinforced with an anecdote from the time in 2008 when the relaunched MobileMe cloud service had significant outages .
Jobs called the MobileMe team together to the Town Hall Auditorium on the campus . ""
Can anyone tell me what MobileMe is meant to do ? ""
Jobs began .
On getting a response describing it , he replied : "" So why the fuck does n't it do that ? ""
A 30-minute tirade followed - and a new person was put in overall charge of the group .
( Many of the developers left the group soon afterwards . )
Despite being on medical leave from the company , Jobs personally took charge of Apple 's response to "" Locationgate "" , over the revelation that iPhones and iPads retained a file which could effectively track the owner 's movements .
The article is presently only available as a paid download via the Fortune app on Apple 's iTunes Store , or as an Amazon "" single "" costing 69 pence to be released on 10 May - though it will be published in full for free access online in time .
The thinking behind that paywalled - for - a - period strategy is worth examining : Dan Roth , managing editor of Fortune Digital , told Peter Kafka at AllThingsD that "" We 're trying to figure out the best way of releasing journalism online "" - which means trying to monetise a high - interest story by keeping it paid - for over a limited period .
Previously it could n't do this , but now that it can offer the iPad app to print subscribers for free ( following a deal made with Apple ) , it can .
"" There was this feeling that we 're sort of pissing off our subscribers , "" by publishing the magazine 's best stories on the Web , often before paying customers got their hands on them , [ Roth ] says .
"" The problem was there was n't anything we could have offered them before .
"" The article is fascinating , with in - depth analysis of Apple 's working based on dozens of interviews .
A teaser post ( "" 6 things I never knew about Apple "" ) from Philip Elmer - DeWitt on Friday led to a burst of interest that has seen the article being written about repeatedly , despite not being online .
Other information revealed in the article includes : •
Every Monday the executive team holds a meeting which reviews the entire business progress and products under development - in which 80 % will be unchanged from the previous week •
Every Wednesday Jobs or Tim Cook , the chief operating officer , chairs a marketing and communications meeting •
Responsibility is taken seriously :
Jobs tells anyone who becomes one of the 70-odd vice - presidents in the company that there is no acceptable excuse for not getting things done ; he contrasts that with a janitor who might not be able to get access to a key to unlock a door for work .
•
every executive action , product or project has a "" DRI "" - directly responsible individual - who carries the can ( or laurels ) for its outcome .
•
only the chief financial officer is reponsible for costs and expenses that translate into profit and loss ; Jobs reckons that Sony , for example , has too many divisions to create a viable iPod , iPad or iPhone competitor - a view paraphrased as "" it 's not synergy that makes [ Apple ] work
, it 's that we 're a unified team . ""
•
the "" Jobs culture "" extends through the company ; everyone is meant to know what Jobs would think , so that they can do it without reference •
Jobs wants to institutionalise his way of running and driving the business , and to that end has created an "" Apple university "" inside the company - for which he hired an academic , Joel Podolny , from Yale Management School in 2008 .
Commenting on the details in the article , Horace Dediu noted : "" Podolny has been building an understanding of how Apple is run .
He 's then been asked to codify this understanding into a curriculum that can be taught to Apple employees . ""
•
Sometimes , the company spares no expense : it got the London Symphony Orchestra to record some samples used in its iMovie movie - making software ; it sent a camera crew to Hawaii to film a wedding for a demo video , and then staged one in San Francisco using its own staff as guests , groom and wife • Walt Mossberg , the veteran computer writer and reviewer at the Wall Street Journal , is referred to by Jobs as "" our friend "" who was "" no longer writing good things about us "" after the MobileMe debacle .
Comment :
the question that many companies ask is : how could we get as profitable as Apple ?
How could we get as big as Apple ?
And how could we get as nimble as Apple ( which has grown roughly 60 % of its multi - billion - dollar revenues from two products , the iPhone and iPad , that it only started selling less than four years ago ) ?
It seems like the answer might be : structure yourself more like Apple .
The problem with companies that grow bigger is that they lose the ability to move like a startup .
Apple , it must be said , has probably undergone every incarnation a company can - startup , successful ingenue , mismanaged flop , basket case , imminent bankrupt , recovery prospect , surprise hit , behemoth .
It might be that some sort of business Darwinism has been going on inside it .
But in that case , it 's even more useful for business people to know how it works - so they can reach the final point without dicing with the "" bankrupt "" stage ."
2011-05-31,"Steve Jobs is to take to the stage at Apple 's Worldwide Developer Conference in San Francisco next week to launch the next generation of Apple 's mobile software , iOS 5 , the company has confirmed .
The appearance will only be Jobs 's second public one this year .
In January , he announced that he was taking medical leave from the company for unspecified reasons – though they are believed to be complications arising from his surgery in 2004 to remove a neuroendocrine tumour from his pancreas .
He then appeared unannounced to present the iPad 2 in March .
Since then his public appearances have been limited , though a photograph had appeared of him at a dinner with other Silicon Valley notables with President Barack Obama in February .
Since then he has not made any other public appearances , though he has occasionally responded to customer emails over matters such as the iPhone 's apparent tracking of user location .
In a rare advance announcement , Apple confirmed WWDC 's key software announcements with iOS 5 , the next version of its iPhone operating system , due to preview alongside Mac OS X 10.7 Lion , the eighth version of the Mac OS operating system .
( Eighth ?
Because it started at 10.0.0 in March 2001 . )
Both were widely expected and will be detailed in the keynote speech led by Jobs and "" senior Apple executives "" – expected to include head of marketing Phil Schiller and Scott Forstall , head of iOS development .
Apple also confirmed that it will unveil "" iCloud "" , which it described as its "" cloud services "" offering .
Given that Apple already offers some of those services through its MobileMe paid subscription product - including calendars , email , web hosting and file storage – there will be intense interest around iCloud .
The expectation is that it will effectively upgrade iTunes , allowing users to stream music directly to their devices .
Apple has reportedly signed three of the four major music labels , with Universal close to signing .
That would be a riposte to Google and Amazon , which have unveiled cloud music services that reviewers have so far been underwhelmed by .
Amazon in particular did not get any licensing from music labels – meaning that people can only stream music that they have either bought or uploaded to the service .
The expectation is that iCloud may allow users to stream any song that they already own , an echo of Michael Robertson 's plans implemented in the 1990s at MP3.com .
That was shut down by lawsuits from the record companies .
• Lion is expected to include improvements to Apple Mail , Finder and iCal , a "" reading list "" and "" Mission Control "" and the introduction of some successful user interface features from the iPad , such as more semi - transparent windows for less important elements such as downloads in progress on a browser .
The mention of iCloud could also indicate a move to include a feature not unlike cloud - based file storage service Dropbox .
Other elements introduced by Lion include the ability to resize windows by dragging any part of the edge – something Windows users have been used to for decades .
Latest leaks suggest that the overall colour scheme has continued to be toned down – a persistent theme in each Mac OS X version .
The OS overall looks "" flatter "" , with user interface elements given less apparent depth .
AppleInsider has a long - running guide to changes in Lion .
• iOS 5 is expected to integrate further with Lion , and offer new "" widgets "" that will display custom information on the device 's home screen – a response to Google 's lead in providing "" notifications "" ( about arriving emails , statuses , messages and so on ) on Android .
While iOS has a substantial lead in developers and app downloads over Android , the rapid evolution of Google 's product has left a number of influential users calling for a better notification system than the passive "" updated icon with a number "" or active "" modal dialog "" which blocks other activities .
Apple last June hired Rich Dellinger , who designed the notification system for Palm 's webOS , away from that company and back to the company where he worked between 1999 and 2006 .
The expectation is that his input will be crucial to iOS 5 .
•
One more thing ?
As always , the rumours that Jobs will reveal some extra bit of hardware to wow the crowd persist .
Some are suggesting a refresh of the MacBook Air ; others have not given up hope of seeing the iPhone 5 ( or 4S , or 4 G ) .
A report in the International Business Times labelled the next iPhone as iPhone 4S with a faster processor and 8-megapixel camera , as well as compatibility with both GSM and CDMA networks ."
2011-06-05,"Apple 's chief executive , Steve Jobs , will make a rare public appearance on Monday to show off a new music subscription and content sharing service called iCloud , and new software to power the iPhone .
Jobs , 56 , is unexpectedly breaking his medical leave from the company to appear at its Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco .
Music industry sources indicate that Apple has now signed up the four major music labels in the US â€ “ Sony , Universal , EMI and Warner Music â€ “ for iCloud .
It is thought that it will provide a music streaming service in the US similar to that available in Europe from Spotify .
However it is not clear whether the music elements of iCloud will initially be available outside the US .
Reports by the New York Post suggest that Apple has had to make upfront payments to the labels of between $ 100 m ( Â£61 m ) and $ 150 m to secure their business and ensure that it gets a lead over Spotify and rival music services launched in March and May from Amazon and Google .
Jobs is also scheduled to show off the new version of the software to run the hugely successful iPhone â€ “ but analysts are not expecting to see a new version of the device itself before September .
They think that Apple is shifting its timing so that iPhone releases come closer to Christmas , in order to boost seasonal sales .
The Apple chief will have an audience of app developers who may also be keen to know how the company is going to protect them from a growing number of threats from patent holders in the US , where software can be patented .
In the past two months more than a dozen developers for the iPhone have been sued by companies which claim to have patents covering the systems they use , and demanding payments .
The developers , though , hope that Apple will seek to protect them because if developers are scared off there will be fewer apps for the iPhone and iPad â€ “ which will hit Apple 's sales .
Jobs 's presence is surprising because he announced in January that he would be taking time away from the company for unexplained medical reasons .
It is believed that they are related to his surgery in 2004 for neuroendocrine cancer in the pancreas , a treatable condition , and a subsequent liver transplant .
Jobs appeared very gaunt in pictures published this year , such as at a dinner with Barack Obama in February and his only other public appearance , to launch the iPad 2 tablet in March ."
2011-06-06,"Yes , like everyone , you 're too impatient to wait until Apple 's Worldwide Developer Conference ( WWDC ) actually starts :
you want to know what 's going to be unveiled right now !
Let nobody say that the internet has in any way whatsoever affected our ability to endure delayed satisfaction .
( Perhaps unrelated : children who are able to sacrifice short - term gratification for longer - term reward do better in later life .
OK , where were we ? )
We know that there are going to be at least three things announced this Monday at WWDC when Steve Jobs ( first surprise : he has been on medical leave since January ) will come up and show off iOS 5 , Mac OS X 10.7 ( "" Lion "" ) and iCloud .
That we know any of what 's going to be in the speech is a surprise : usually Apple just keeps it a complete secret .
Wild cards : the possibility of some hardware of some sort .
New iPhone ?
New Time Capsule ?
New cable ?
Who knows ?
It 's not as if WWDC has never seen new hardware ; in fact it 's been about 50 - 50 in our recollection .
Not always thrilling – there was the year everyone got a ( gasp ! )
webcam – but hardware , nevertheless .
So , what should you expect ?
Here 's our guide to what 's up , with extra help on how likely they are .
Likely iOS5 :
•
Better multi - tasking •
Deep integration of Twitter and Facebook •
iCloud integration so you can play / stream music over Wi - Fi and maybe 3 G • New notification system to replace
the dire "" stop everything !
You 've received a text message ! ""
modus interruptus , and instead something more like Android 's pull - down bar • Widgets – another Android , um , borrowing – that let you link directly to turn your Wi - Fi/3G / sound / whatever on or off .
Lion • Availability in the autumn • Priced at $ 129 • update process made feasible through the Mac App Store • Dropbox - like synchronisation between devices , which will bridge the gap to the iPad ( which otherwise requires horribly convoluted efforts to transfer files wirelessly )
iCloud •
You hook up ( yet another new version of ) iTunes , it scans your music library , all the songs you own "" appear "" in the cloud for you to listen to when you like , where you like , on an authorised Apple device .
•
Music discovery system to find new stuff , rather like Last.fm , powered by Ping .
( Remember Ping ? )
Hardware •
Actually , nothing falls into "" likely "" here , though the Time Capsule wireless backup hard drive is long in the tooth .
Wild cards •
Some commentary on patent - holding companies that are suing Apple developers .
Less likely iOS5 •
Fix for the alarm clock bug •
OTA ( over - the - air )
OS updates .
Apple is a slave to iTunes here , but if Google 's Android can manage incremental updates that are downloaded during quiet periods , it is n't witchcraft .
The challenge is how to revert if your phone is bricked .
•
Split - pane views of multiple apps on the iPad , rather like Microsoft showed off on Windows 8 last week .
•
An App Store for Apple TV ( see below )
Lion •
Lower price than $ 129 ; Apple likes to make money by dangling features in front of people iCloud • TV and movie episodes you 've bought "" appear "" in the cloud too .
Not very likely , because the TV and movie studios have been silent on this , and do n't really like the idea of their stuff being available via the cloud .
Hardware • Apple TV update .
OK , so it was introduced in September 2010 , and all three of the people who bought it really love it .
But what is it really for ?
Maybe it need a touch of iCloud , plus some apps , and it can really make TV into something that Apple can get its hands on .
Not that anyone else – Google or Microsoft included – has managed this .
Wild cards •
Someone from Microsoft showing up to demo the next version of Microsoft Office for Mac running on Lion .
That stuff is sooo 2001 .
Really improbable iOS5 • New folder system that reorganises itself according to what apps you actually use Lion • Immediate on - sale as soon as Jobs finishes speaking .
iCloud •
That it will be free .
Apple learnt its lesson about free cloud services years ago with iTools , which hax0rs used to store hacked files by the thousand ; part of the logic of moving to the paid - for .Mac
( as it became ) was to flush them out .
Hardware • iPhone 5 , to go on sale in July .
There has n't been enough noise from the supply chain ( to which people are listening very carefully ) for this to be likely .
Expect it in September .
Wild cards •
Apple to buy Lodsys and MacroSolve , the two companies that have been hassling app developers over claims of software patent infringement .
Utterly impossible •
Steve Jobs welcoming Steve Ballmer onto stage and announcing that they 're going to put Windows Phone 7 onto the iPhone .
Seriously , we suspect that if Jobs and Ballmer ever touched hands , it would be like matter and antimatter meeting ( you decide which is which ) .
If anyone knows of a documented occasion when they 've met , we 'd love to hear from you ."
2011-06-06,"Steve Jobs launched a slew of new services on Monday evening , including an online music offering that promises to let people listen to songs bought online on any Apple device with an internet connection .
The iCloud service will be free to use and be available in the autumn .
For an extra $ 25 a year , users can use the service to access any songs on their computer .
"" Some people think the cloud is just a big disk in the sky , "" said Jobs .
"" We think it 's way more than that . ""
Jobs said the service would be increasingly important "" for those people who want to be completely PC - free "" , suggesting that in future people will want to operate using solely their phones and tablets and bypassing computers altogether . ""
The idea of the PC as the digital hub has broken down in the past few years , "" he said .
Jobs , who has remained chief executive of Apple despite being on medical leave for the past six months , looked gaunt as he appeared in front of a crowd of more than 5,200 developers and media at the Moscone Center in San Francisco .
After receiving a standing ovation at the opening , he gave a few brief words of welcome before quickly handing over to Phil Schiller , head of product marketing .
Jobs returned almost 90 minutes later to introduce iCloud .
The company also showed off new software for the iPhone intended to make it more competitive with Google 's Android phone software , which has roared past Apple 's iPhone to take a 36 % share of the smartphone market .
The iOS 5 software , which will run on iPhones introduced since June 2009 , mimics a number of features available on the Google software .
But Apple also indicated that it is seeking to undermine BlackBerry maker RIM 's position in the market , by offering iMessage , which allows people to send messages directly to other iPhones or iPads – very like the BlackBerry Messenger feature which has proved hugely popular with teenagers and users in Middle Eastern countries .
RIM 's stock has fallen by 40 % in the past three months as investors worry that its growth has stalled compared with Apple and Android phones .
Apple 's iCloud may have required an enormous investment .
It is understood to have built a data centre in North Carolina with an estimated cost of $ 1bn and measures half a million square feet .
In 2004 Jobs was treated for neuroendocrine cancer of the pancreas and in 2009 had a liver transplant .
Doctors have questioned whether the 56-year old could be suffering the effects of immunosuppressive drugs needed for the transplant .
Apple 's launch of iCloud contrasts with similar offerings from Amazon and Google , which launched theirs in March and May.
Amazon 's "" music locker "" immediately ran into criticism from the record industry after its launch because it did not seek their permission to let users listen to music stored in their online lockers – a system that some labels argued required a per - play payment .
Google managed to sign a number of the record labels , but not enough to cover everyone , and so its content is limited .
Apple 's only covers songs bought from its iTunes Music Store , and not any of the user 's own content .
For users , however , the lockers are cumbersome because they have to upload any tracks they want to listen to , which would be a slow process even for the few hundred tracks that people typically own .
Apple also sought to emphasise its strength in contrast to rivals , especially companies making tablets to compete with its iPad .
Scott Forstall , head of the iPhone software team , said a total of 25 m iPads have been sold – implying that 5.5 m iPad 2s have been sold in the past two months .
At that rate , Apple could surpass its Christmas sale of 7.3 m for the spring quarter , even while dozens of rivals struggle to sell more than half a million .
Forstall said that more than 15bn songs have been bought from the iTunes Store , 14bn apps have been downloaded for the iPhone , iPod and iPad , there have been 130 m downloads from the iBooks store , and that developers have received $ 2.5bn on sales of apps ."
2011-06-06,"Today , Steve Jobs came out of his medical leave early to reveal Apple 's new cloud service , the iCloud , at the company 's Worldwide Developers Conference in California .
In a world of iAppliances , it is easy to get overwhelmed .
For example , is it possible to watch programmes from the iPlayer on my iPad ?
Is my iPod synced to my iTunes ?
What kind of iRain is likely to fall from the newly launched iCloud ?
Let 's start at the very beginning .
What is the ' cloud ' ?
Once , you would do your work on your personal computer and save it onto your hard drive .
And there it would sit , accessible only to you ( and maybe a few other select users on a local network ) , and could only be manipulated ( edited ) if you had the right software on your device .
The cloud overcomes this limitation – all you need is connectivity ( pretty much universal , with the internet ) , and a cloud provider ( a company that facilitates access to the cloud or their data servers ) .
This means that any computer which is connected to the internet ( including mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets ) is connected to all the same applications and files .
In terms of online storage , it creates better conditions for collaborative work ; for example , a change made to a Word document would be available to users on different computers because the information is synchronised across all computers .
The need for carrying around physical storage devices is eliminated .
Hundreds of millions of us already use the cloud everyday , to share photographs , music and video clips .
It is , like love , all around .
The cloud signals , by and large , the end of "" stuff "" .
Where is all the information in the cloud actually stored ?
The information in the cloud ranges from the personal but unimportant to the highly sensitive .
So where is it all kept ?
If it is lost , can it be recovered ?
And is it secure ?
The data in the cloud exists on servers , and these are mirrored onto other servers to keep data secure and available .
That way , if one cluster of servers falls over , then data is available from servers in another data centre or elsewhere in the same location .
For example , Google 's index is mirrored across thousands , if not millions of servers .
So if your data was to be lost , it is more or less guaranteed that they would find it .
While it would be easy to find the information , it is no surprise that organisations do not willingly yield the details of where the physical servers are located .
And why would they ?
No one wants to be held to ransom or attacked .
Even so , if an attacker were to gain physical access to the servers , it is unlikely that they would gain any really useable data .
Uses of the cloud Web - based email ( like Gmail or Hotmail ) has been acting in the cloud for a long time .
People use their email accounts to back up the files on their personal computers – and this information can be held securely and indefinitely in the cloud .
In addition to being a hugely successful online retailer , Amazon also provides cloud - computing services by renting out space on its powerful servers to customers worldwide .
In April an Amazon cloud failure took out social - networking sites Foursquare , Reddit and Quora .
What is the iCloud ?
It is , quite simply , a content - sharing service on the cloud .
Sources from the music industry have indicated that Apple has signed up with the four major music labels – EMI , Sony , Universal and Warner Music , to provide a music - streaming service in the US .
Some are suggesting that the iCloud is designed to be the new iTunes – in which music , videos , podcasts etc will be available for streaming .
What are the best cloud - based sites ?
Dropbox.com and YouSendIt.com are just two of the most used cloud - based sites .
Dropbox was created in 2007 by two MIT students who were "" tired of emailing files to themselves to work from more than one computer "" .
It 's a free service that let you share your documents easily .
YouSendIt.com allows you to store and send large files over the web .
Spotify is a music - streaming service launched in 2008 .
Previously free , it recently capped its free usage at 10 hours a month , with a premium membership allowing for unlimited listening at £ 9.99 a month .
It has approximately 10 million users .
Amazon launched its cloud player in March , which gives users 5Gb of storage space to upload songs and play them from any number of Android devices .
Google Docs is a free web - based storage service .
It allows users to create and edit text , spreadsheet and slide show documents in real time with other users .
Google has also released Music Beta , a streaming service announced last month ."

2011-06-07,"So where - where - is the iPhone 5 ?
( Or , as we 've been hearing from informed sources , what will actually be called the iPhone 4GS / iPhone 4 G ? )
Obvious answer : not at WWDC .
Second obvious answer : it 's coming in September / October , and will be right up there when iOS
5 comes out of beta and is released properly .
This might seem blindingly obvious , but lots of people were hanging on to the hope that Apple would launch the iPhone 5/4GS/4 G on Monday .
The fact that it has n't - unlike the past two years , when it has announced new versions of the iPhone at , guess where , WWDC - indicates that Apple is shifting its strategy in phones .
Presently , Apple 's phone market segmentation strategy is to sell the newest model ( the iPhone 4 , now around a year old ) at the highest price , and the second - oldest model ( the 3GS , two years old ) at a lower price .
Hence you can find carriers such as Orange selling the 3GS for free with a Â£25 per month contract , while the iPhone 4 is still has an upfront price plus a Â£30+/month contract .
Presently this is as much segmentation that Apple is able to achieve , because it was locked into the yearly release schedule .
That 's not surprising ; Apple was a comparative newcomer to the mobile phone industry .
Remember how the original iPhone could n't forward SMS or send MMS ?
How we laughed .
Now Apple is a serious player .
And ( we 're hearing from the supply chain )
it is shifting the release date of the newest phone to September / October , which means a lot can change .
Why the iPhone is not like the iPod
A few months back there was lots of talk about Apple working on an "" iPhone nano "" which would cost Â£125 .
This was nonsense ( not that this stopped lots of sites from writing it ; wheat , chaff , who cares ) but the reason that some were taken in by the idea of a "" low - end iPhone "" was that this sort of segmentation - start at the top ( iPod classic ) and own it , and then diversify down to the middle ( iPod mini ) and finally scoop out the low end ( iPod shuffle ) .
Great strategy if you dominate the market and plan to continue doing so ; it worked for a long time for Nokia until smartphones arrived in force , when suddenly it stopped working .
But Apple has nothing like a commanding share of the overall mobile market , nor of the smartphone market .
( In the first quarter , when it had the largest revenue in the entire mobile market , it had a 17 % share of the worldwide smartphone market , and about 4 % of the entire 428 m mobile phone market . )
So what can it do ?
An "" iPhone nano "" wo n't work , partly because it just ca n't segment the market into "" featurephone "" and "" smartphone "" in the way that Nokia has .
Why the iPhone 5 will be like the iPhone 4 Instead , look to Apple to consider iPhone updates on a six - monthly basis .
One model in September / October ; another in March / April .
That allows for incremental differences between versions which provides the updraft for sales , which carriers will like .
But it also means that Apple does n't have to sweat too hard on how different to make the next handset - unlike the present situation , where every new model has to blow the bloody doors off .
Yet it also means that it will have a wider range of handsets to offer over time because of the natural segmentation of age : the iPhone 4 , iPhone 4GS , some time next spring , the iPhone 5 ; in the autumn , the iPhone 5 G ( or whatever ) .
And so on .
The ages of the devices will create the tiers , which will allow it to slice the market into different price tiers and compete with Android - and more importantly RIM , which Apple clearly has in its sights as a rival to be crushed ( why else introduce iMessage , which looks like a clone of BlackBerry Messenger ? ) .
So that 's it : if you 're wondering where your iPhone 5 ( 4GS/4 G ) is , it 's being built in a factory in China .
And Apple is getting ready to unveil a completely different way of slicing and dicing the phone market .
The questions that remain : â€¢ how well can Nokia 's Symbian smartphones resist at the low- and middle - end , given that the iPhone is already taking much of the top - end business ?
â€¢ can RIM stem the churn away from its platform ( put at 3 m lost to the US user base since September 2010 by Horace Dediu ) ?
â€¢ are Android phones from Samsung and HTC going to be able to challenge for the top - end smartphone that the iPhone has ?
Android use is growing faster in the US over the past year ( 6 m to 27 m , compared to 12 m growing to 20 m iPhone users by Dediu 's calculation ) ."
2011-06-07,
2011-06-07,"Cloud - based consumer data services might not be new , but the iCloud service Apple announced last night marks a major step towards the mainstream .
Returning from sick leave for the string of announcements at Apple 's World Wide Developer Conference , chief executive Steve Jobs made the most significant statement of the night : "" We 're going to demote the PC and the Mac to just be a device – just like an iPad , an iPhone or an iPod Touch .
We 're going to move the hub of your digital life to the cloud . ""
Veteran Apple commentator John Gruber said that "" demotion "" of the Mac will come to define a new era for Apple .
"" iCloud will shape the next 10 years the way the iTunes - on - your - Mac / PC digital hub shaped the last 10 , "" he wrote .
"" This is a fundamentally different vision for the coming decade than Google 's .
In both cases , your data is in the cloud , and you can access it from anywhere with a network connection .
But Google 's vision is about software you run in a web browser .
Apple 's is about native apps you run on devices .
Apple is as committed to native apps – on the desktop , tablet , and handheld – as it has ever been . ""
Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said the move will encourage consumers to stay within Apple 's ecosystem of gadgets , from phones to desktop computers . ""
Apple is increasing the likelihood that consumers buy multiple Apple devices , "" he told clients .
"" What 's new is that Apple will be giving away iCloud for free ( we had expected it to be priced between $ 25-$99 a year ) .
This will allow Apple devices to automatically share contacts , calendars , messages , photos , apps , and music purchased on iTunes ; sharing non iTunes music will cost $ 25 a year . ""
Munster compared that the Amazon 's Cloud Drive , which could cost up to $ 200 a year .
For Apple 's rivals , iCloud presents a major challenge .
Google started offering cloud - based services to the mainstream through its Gmail service in 2004 , but Apple 's third and soon - to - be - opened data centre in North Carolina puts it ahead , said Forrester analyst Frank Gillett .
"" Google is worth watching as a number two player but will struggle to match Apple .
Microsoft , with no articulated vision for personal cloud , lags significantly . ""
Mike Abramsky of RBC said iCloud is likely to be a huge boost for Apple 's device sales . ""
By ' cutting the cord ' to the PC , Apple may expand its addressable device market by 4x , addressing the handset users who have a phone but not a PC .
We believe we may see new devices in time , based off iCloud services . ""
The announcement marks a major move for Apple away from the desktop PC as the central hub of digital activity , acknowledging the consumer shift towards mobile phones and iPads .
Apple said last night that it has now sold 200 m iPhones , iPads and iPod Touch devices , though it was careful to open the event by heralding the success of the Mac computer by saying sales have grown 28 % compared to a 1 % slump in PC sales .
In contrast to the warm welcome from analysts , Apple 's stock fell 1.57 % in response to the announcements , with traders apparently unimpressed by the series of software updates and iCloud announcements because they were not backed up by a new iPhone release ."

2011-06-07,"Rob Grimshaw , managing director of the Financial Times website , has said the paper is in a "" Mexican standoff "" with Apple but does not need a deal with the technology giant to make its digital strategy work .
The Financial Times upped the ante in its standoff with Apple – which is trying to keep 30 % of subscription revenues and retaining key customer information for digital publications bought through its app store – by launching an app that readers can download without having to go to the iTunes store on Tuesday .
The move came the day after Apple co - founder Steve Jobs unveiled details of the company 's new Newsstand service for digital newspaper and magazine products , which will form a new section of the App Store .
Grimshaw said accepting the technology company 's print app subscription terms would be a "" backward step "" .
He added that the FT was in a "" Mexican standoff "" with Apple and had made a "" hard - headed , pragmatic business decision "" to draw a line in the sand and not cave - in to the company 's demands .
"" It would be a backward step for us to go into relationships where we are denied access directly to readers , the existing business has been driven by that , "" Grimshaw said .
"" We are also wary what we pay to third parties .
With the existing model we do n't pay anything , now while I do n't rule it out giving away a third of the revenue is not right .
"" The FT has managed to build up a subscriber base of more than 200,000 online digital subscribers and Grimshaw does not believe it is critical to do a deal with Apple to get a paid - for app on the iPhone and iPad .
He added that the FT had analysed data and noted that it gets more than half of its mobile traffic from people using the internet browser on their smartphone or tablet – not from using specifically tailored apps . ""
Users are turning the browser itself into a channel , "" he said .
Apple , like Google , has often used its market - leading position to dictate terms of deals to media companies and developers .
Grimshaw said that while Apple could easily afford not to do a deal , the FT 's new HTML5-based app was not developed just to take on the California - based company .
"" We have continued discussions with Apple all the way through the period [ of development ] , we have a relationship and we do n't want to throw it all away , "" he said .
This is just about the terms we want to put in place .
Their terms do n't work for us .
They wo n't move , we hope they will .
It is a bit of a Mexican standoff . ""
Grimshaw added that the new app launched was a "" big strategic play for us "" and something that "" goes wider than Apple "" .
The new app will initially be optimised for the iPad and iPhone but will be adapted for other tablets and smartphones including Android - based devices from manufacturers such as Samsung and Motorola , as well as BlackBerry products . ""
The idea originated in the middle of last year when we realised how much effort was involved in making apps for all the devices available , "" Grimshaw said .
"" It was months of work and as apps get more complicated was going to become a bigger and bigger problem and cost .
This is the main thrust of our strategy for mobile development , it is not just about making a commercial point [ to Apple ] . ""
He added the company would not necessarily pull out of any app store , however it will only do "" native app "" development for specific stores where it is necessary .
Trouble has been brewing between the FT and Apple since February when Marjorie Scardino , the chief executive of parent company Pearson , made the point that publishers should not have to kowtow to Apple . ""
The important thing to remember is there are many , many tablets coming out and multiple devices ...
[ from ] Kindle to mobiles , "" she said at the time .
"" If indeed Apple are not happy to give us customer data then maybe we will get it somewhere else . ""

2011-06-09,"Steve Jobs gave a masterclass in how to charm your local council planning meeting this week , personally presenting for 20 minutes on its ambitious plans for a new headquarters in Cupertino .
The small Californian town , which is part of the patchwork of cities that make up the sprawl of Silicon Valley , has become synonymous with Apple , which employs 2,800 people at the base on Infinity Loop .
With a very different persona to the one we see at Apple 's product announcements , Jobs was authoritative but humble , and personal enough to give anecdotes about growing up in Cupertino .
He was also disturbingly thin and at times seemed breathless , and when one councillor asked on Apple 's no - smoking policy he snapped : "" Both my parents died from lung cancer , so i 'm a little sensitive on that topic . ""
The vision of a vast , circular building is designed to impress .
Jobs told the council that through its experience building retail stores , Apple has developed a specialism in building the biggest curved pieces of glass in the world for architectural use .
Jobs , who has a summer job as a teenager at Hewlett Packard when it used own the land , said there used to be apricot trees on the site and wants to plant apricot orchards .
The 150-acre site will be 80 % landscaped , he said .
Ground breaking will start next year and the campus will be finished by 2015 .
It will be four storeys high , hold around 12,000 people and have its own auditorium .
Perhaps future WWDCs will be held here , instead of the Moscone Centre ?
"" We put on presentations , much like we did yesterday , but we have to go to San Francisco to do them .
""
One councillor asked how Cupertino residents will benefit from Apple 's new campus in the city . ""

It 's rare to see Apple chief Steve Jobs out these days , so this 20-minute presentation on the company 's plans for a massive new campus in Cupertino is fascinating .
The building he 's introducing is pretty spectacular , and he manages a masterful mix of authoritative scene setting and due deference to the council that , at least theoretically , will have the choice to veto the project .
As Jobs pointed out though , it 's hardly likely that Cupertino council is about to turn down the city 's largest taxpayer and company that has put the tiny Californian city on the map .
Expect completion in 2015 .
I have some sympathy with this ( ex ) customer of the Alamo Drafthouse cinema in Austin .
Not for leaving a slightly incoherent and unnecessarily rude voicemail message ( satisfying as it must have been ) but for her explanation .
She says she was thrown out for texting , which is evidently a cast - iron rule of the cinema .
But unless it 's really in someone 's face , is that really a dismissible offence .
Talking on a phone , yes .
Not turning your phone to silent , as she said she did , yes .
But is a bit of discreet texting really that bad ?
I have been on the receiving end of some extremely bad customer service , though never in the US .
But I think throwing her out seems a little harsh .

2011-06-11,"Is it the charisma of Steve Jobs that gives Apple its wholesome image ?
Or perhaps just the natural , crunchy image of coolly designed computers for the discriminating masses ?
Could Rupert Murdoch revolutionise the brand of News Corp by calling it something cuddly , like Koala Inc ?
The person to ask first could be Pearson chief Marjorie Scardino and thus the supreme overlord at the FT – which last week decided to take on Apple head on over its grotesquely penal policy on apps .
You want your paper or magazine on subscription at the iTunes store ?
That will be 30 % for Apple straight off , with no arguments , thanks – and no information on who your digital readers are either .
So the FT app would go it alone , sold direct with no cut for Jobs : and reluctant iPad app customers everywhere wished it a pink flush of success .
That 30 % take put pads and smartphones on an equivalent footing to the toiling newsagents who display and sell you print papers – and at a notable disadvantage to the subscription schemes newspapers run for themselves .
A penal step too far .
Result :
A quiet Apple climbdown at last , a more flexible balance between charges on publishers ' own sites and the iTunes store ( though no change yet on the 30 % take or data release ) .
When you stand up to a bully , it seems , second thoughts quickly follow .
That really is Le Crunch ."
2011-06-17,"While everyone was salivating over the launch of Apple 's iCloud last week , Steve Jobs 's other product launch garnered less attention .
This was Apple 's colossal new headquarters building in Cupertino , California –
a gigantic white UFO sitting in 150 acres of landscaped parkland , designed for 12,000 workers .
For obvious reasons , it has already been dubbed the "" mothership "" .
Nor has its designer been widely publicised , but we can reveal it 's good old Norman Foster –
who else ?
Foster 's people would n't reveal any details , but there are some in this video of Jobs presenting the scheme to Cupertino City Council , where it was received just as rapturously as a new iPad .
"" We do have a shot at building the best office building in the world , "" Jobs tells the awestruck councillors .
"" I really do think architecture students will come here to see this . ""
So what about the design ?
Foster has obviously taken a leaf out of Apple 's chief designer Jonathan
I ve 's book – sorry , iPad .
It looks like the circular trackpad of a giant iPod .
If you run around the building very quickly , does a giant playlist light up in the sky ?
Mind you
, by the time it 's finished in 2015 , it could look out of date .
The purity of the four - storey doughnut 's impact on the landscape is also slightly compromised , it emerges , by other buildings on the site , including a four - storey car park .
But none of the councillors seem to raise any objections ; they 're too busy geeking out their celebrity guest .
"" The word spectacular would be an understatement , "" grovels one of them , Mr Smithers - style .
Just to drive the point home , Jobs mentions that Apple is the largest taxpayer in Cupertino , and hints that if he does n't get his way , Apple will take their business elsewhere .
Presumably the whole building will be able to take off and land in New Mexico , or something .
More good news for Foster and other British architects at this year 's spurious but intriguing Best Tall Building awards .
Foster 's 80-storey Dubai tower , known as The Index – an energy - efficient , Italian futurist - looking affair – won in the Middle East and Africa category .
Wilkinson Eyre won the Asia award for their colossal but elegant Guangzhou International Finance Centre – all 103 storeys of it .
And Anglo - German architects Sauerbruch Hutton won the Europe award for their tasteful , low - energy Frankfurt office building , KfW Westarkade .
The other winner was Frank Gehry 's stunning Eight Spruce Street , a shimmering , steel - clad skyscraper that looks better than anything we 're likely to find on the nearby World Trade Centre site .
Though it does go by the pretentious name New York by Gehry , which makes it sound uncomfortably like a perfume .
Richard Rogers probably wishes he 'd had Apple - style planning meetings over the Chelsea Barracks redevelopment in London .
Instead , his design was controversially rejected when Prince Charles threw a royal spanner in the works last year , complaining about that vulgar hi - techie stuff to the Qatari royals .
No surprise that the revised design for the £ 3bn scheme is expected to be approved by Westminster council today , although the Qatari developers are said to be trying to reduce the amount of affordable housing in the scheme .
No surprise , either , that the new plan , by Squire and Partners , Dixon Jones and landscape architect Kim Wilkie , is considerably more "" traditional "" , laid out around London squares .
Whoever designs the actual buildings will have to adhere to a preordained design code , which insists they "" work in sympathy with surrounding character areas and architectural types without resorting to pastiche "" .
Apparently Prince Charles is pleased .
After all this high - flying power architecture , we finally come right down to earth – to a little spot underneath a motorway flyover in east London .
Here , a delightful temporary structure is under construction called Folly for a Flyover , as part of this year 's Create festival .
As designers Assemble explain , it 's almost a stage set of a building , with curtain walls of wooden "" bricks "" made from salvaged timber , hung from scaffolding and held in place by cords running through the bricks .
The pitched roof of the folly will poke out between the two roadways , and next to it are steps that serve as an outdoor seating area .
Not only is the folly ingenious and low - impact , it poetically turns a patch of dead urban space into a living venue .
As the romantic engraving suggests , it 's intended to feel like a forgotten piece of architecture which existed long before they built the A12 over the top of it – a building with a fictional history .
Assemble , a collective of young designers and artists , were also behind last year 's Cineroleum , a temporary cinema in a disused petrol station in Clerkenwell .
This serves a similar function : it 'll be a bar / cafe during the day , and in the evening you 'll be able to watch films and performances on city themes , while traffic rumbles overhead , the Olympic building site bustles nearby and barges
chug past on the canal .
Sounds like the quintessential London summer experience ."
2011-06-23,"Apple has removed an application called ThirdIntifada from its App Store following complaints that it encouraged and glorified violence against Israel .
Israeli minister of public affairs Yuli Edelstein sent an email to Apple chief executive Steve Jobs calling for the "" immediate removal "" of the application .
He described ThirdIntifada as "" an anti - Israeli and anti - Zionist application that ( ... ) calls for an uprising against Israel "" , according to Haaretz .
The Simon Wiesenthal Centre also complained about the app , which it said "" contains anti - Israel content – articles , photographs of ' martyrs ' and stories – and updates its users on further incitements to protest and violence . ""
Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said the app was removed "" because it violates the developer guidelines by being offensive to large groups of people .
"" Intifada is the Arabic term for two violent uprisings against Israel over the past two decades .
The free application encouraged followers to share opinions and organise protests against Israel .
The app also linked to a website that helped organise recent violent clashes with Israeli troops along the country 's borders with Lebanon and Syria .
In March , Facebook pulled a page called the Third Palestinian Intifada from its site , which called for one million supporters to join forces in an uprising against Israel after Friday prayers on 15 May."

56 Turnover : $ 65.2bn Staff : 46,6000 ( September 2010 ) 2010 ranking : 1 Absent most of the year from his official post as chief executive of Apple â€
“
he took open - ended medical leave in January â€ “
Steve Jobs nevertheless casts a long shadow .
He has popped up twice to front product launches , once in March to announce the second - generation iPad , and again in June to unveil the iCloud system , which aims to make PCs and owning music a thing of the past .
And last week he announced record second quarter profits of $ 7.3bn , up 124 % , year on year .
( He also appeared the following day to persuade his local council in Cupertino , California , to approve a giant new building for Apple . )
For publishers , the iPad has become the consumption device of choice and the trendy way to showcase content .
From being an object of some derision â€ “ just an enlarged iPhone ?
â€
“
it has cemented its importance for Apple by has sold more than 28 m since launch ( along with 82 m iPhones ) , and persuaded content creators of all sorts , including Rupert Murdoch , that it is a viable platform for their output .
Apple 's App Store delivery method has become a bone of contention for magazine and newspaper publishers unhappy at Apple 's skimming off 30 % of any purchase price , but despite attempts from rivals offering Google 's Android software to challenge its position , the company has the market almost to itself .
Having topped the MediaGuardian 100 last year Jobs is beaten to the top of this year 's list by Mark Zuckerberg , in part because he has done nothing in the past 12 months to match the impact of the launch of the original iPhone or iPad , and in part because questions inevitably remain over his medical condition .
Nobody is quite sure where the combination of visionary zeal and relentless drive will come from if Jobs 's absence becomes prolonged .
Despite a lukewarm reception in 2007 , the iPhone is now going strong .
With a new version , or even two , expected in September , Apple has overtaken Nokia , once the dominant maker of smartphones , in that sector .
The key is in its apps .
Though these existed long before Apple joined the mobile market , it was the iPhone which made them mainstream and hundreds of thousands have been created since 2008 .
Every content producer now seems keen to build one .
The iPad 's iBooks store was expected to be an excellent shopfront for ebooks , but sales have been slower than publishers expected , with Amazon 's Kindle instead winning more acceptance â€ “ and attention â€ “ from readers .
Even the Kindle app on the iPad seemed to offer a better choice and use than iBooks .
Apple , however , still looks unstoppable .
It was on the brink of disaster when Jobs returned to it after a 12-year absence in 1997 .
In between he bought a graphics hardware developer that he turned into Pixar and sold to Disney for $ 7.4bn in 2006 .
He also founded NeXT Computer , which Apple bought in 1996 for its technology â€ “ and to get Jobs back .
It turned out to be money well spent ."
2011-08-13,"Steve Jobs may once have said "" It 's more fun to be a pirate than to join the navy "" , but Apple 's status as an outsider is long gone .
Last week , Jobs 's company completed its long journey from underdog to top dog when it briefly overtook oil giant Exxon Mobil to become the largest company in the world by market capitalisation .
As the price of oil tumbles amid fears of a new recession in western economies , Apple appears immune .
Sales of iPads and iPhones are unstoppable .
Silicon is now bigger than oil , at least when it comes in an Apple casing .
For several hours on Tuesday , Apple surpassed Exxon as the most highly valued company , at one point by as much as $ 7bn ( £ 4.3bn ) .
The US oil company had reasserted itself by the end of the day , closing at a capitalisation around $ 1.5bn higher , but on Friday morning they traded places again , with Apple peaking at a value of $ 351bn , and Exxon bottoming at $ 350bn .
We have been here before with technology stocks .
Riding high on the supremacy of its Windows operating system , Microsoft overtook General Electric in 2002 .
Before that , Cisco , the network infrastructure manufacturer , had topped the league .
What is startling about Apple 's valuation is that its $ 65bn revenues , predicted to rise to $ 108bn this financial year , are less than a quarter of Exxon 's projected sales of over $ 470bn . ""
How is it that a company that much smaller could be that much more valuable relative to revenues ? "" asks Andy Serwer , managing editor of Fortune magazine , who keeps a close watch on the world 's largest companies .
"" The answer is growth .
Apple is growing like a rocket . ""
Back in 1997 , when Jobs returned to the firm he had co - founded and then been ousted from , Apple was near bankruptcy .
It languished in 273rd position in Fortune 's 500 largest US companies listing , which ranks by revenues rather than capitalisation .
And it was worth just $ 2bn , beaten into submission by Microsoft 's operating system and the Dell and Hewlett Packard PCs that ran it .
Things hardly improved overnight .
But then the first iMacs arrived , in rainbow colours and bubble casings that combined the computer 's processing unit and screen in one sleek package .
In 2001 the first iPods appeared .
By 2006 , the year before the original iPhone , Apple was valued at $ 60bn .
Four years and a mobile phone revolution later , in May 2010 , the company 's market capitalisation had overtaken that of Microsoft .
Now there is just Exxon left to beat .
Market watchers believe the two companies will jockey for position for a while .
Exxon 's valuation will follow the oil price , which was at $ 100 a barrel in the spring , and is now around $ 85 .
In January , Exxon was worth $ 27bn more than it is now .
Apple is up $ 40bn over the same period .
"" Exxon is a prisoner of oil prices , "" says Serwer .
"" If its revenues go up a lot it means the price of oil went up .
It is not selling that many more barrels .
Apple is coming up with new products , and people are buying them like crazy . ""
Can Apple continue to grow at such a breakneck pace ?
The fifth iteration of the iPhone is expected in the autumn , and rumours are spreading that it will be accompanied by a cheaper model for emerging markets .
Apple watchers have nicknamed it the "" iCloud iPhone "" , suggesting it will save on manufacturing costs by using "" cloud computing "" ( remote storage accessible via the internet ) rather than large internal memory chips to store information .
Apple is saying nothing on the subject .
A device that could be almost entirely subsidised by mobile networks and supplied free or cheaply to customers might help Apple grow in big new markets like China .
With 62 % of its revenues coming from outside the US in the last quarter , there is room for more internationally .
The company set new records at its third quarter results in July .
Sales increased 82 % year on year , and profit was up 125 % .
The iPad tablet computer is gaining traction , selling 9.25 m in the quarter , up 183 % on the same period in 2010 .
Sales of the iPhone were up 142 % .
Jobs 's speciality is taking emerging technology and popularising it .
Apple dominates because it has reinvented the music industry , the mobile phone , and the computer several times over .
Other digital music players were on sale before the iPod , but nobody bought them .
Apple provided pretty kit that worked well , with a legal , user - friendly iTunes website to supply the music .
Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi cites FaceTime , the internet - based videophone feature on iPhones , as a good example of the company 's genius for reinvention .
"" How long have we had video calling in Europe ?
It 's been years and nobody has ever used it .
Why is everyone with an iPhone interested suddenly in FaceTime ?
Because it 's easy to use
and they do n't have to worry about cost [ other than the standing cost of the internet connection ] .
"" She says the brand is now so trusted , and holds such cachet , that consumers will fork out for technology they do n't really understand , confident that it will somehow improve life .
"" It 's about the brand , and you want it because it 's cool
and it 's the latest thing , even if you might not be quite sure what you do with it .
You figure out what you 're going to do with an iPad once you 've bought it . ""
Technology is a more exciting product than oil , but is it really more valuable ?
Forrester analyst JP Gownder thinks its importance will only grow .
"" Oil is a fundamental part of the economy and will be for a long time , but personal technology manages so many aspects of our lives .
For those who can afford it , it is absolutely critical in a world where our work and personal lives are indistinguishable , where we are always on and always connected . ""
Apple will not always be the dominant tech company .
No one knows what will happen if Jobs 's health problems force him to step away from the firm altogether , and rivals are growing fast .
Sales of mobile phones which run on Google 's Android operating system have overtaken the iPhone and now Nokia .
Incorporated 1998 , floated in 2004 with a $ 23bn market capitalisation , Google is now valued at $ 179bn .
And IBM , the ultimate 1980s technology brand , is making a comeback .
In the last five years its share price has gone from $ 80 to near $ 180 as its management tour the world winning contracts to build IT systems for the post offices , government agencies and utility companies of the biggest emerging markets .
It is now the world 's fifth most valuable company , just behind Microsoft .
Milanese says Amazon , the world 's dominant home entertainment retailer , may catch everyone by surprise by doing for films and TV shows what it did for books with Kindle . ""
Rumours have it they are thinking about a tablet .
If they find the right vehicle to push all that content , they have a very good opportunity to reach the markets where people have money .
"" Others will emerge to seize Apple 's booty , but , for now , its ship looks unsinkable ."
2011-08-16,"Google and Apple are engaged in a replay of the war Steve Jobs lost against Microsoft two decades ago .
They are vying to create the dominant operating system for the computers of the future – our smartphones .
To strengthen its hand , Google has marshalled a legion of Motorola footsoldiers .
The Motorolans , as Google chief Larry Page referred to them , come in both human and patent form .
Android 's success has prompted its biggest rivals to start buying up patents in the hope of killing off the operating system that is used in nearly half of new smartphones .
The $ 12.5bn splashed out on Motorola can chiefly be justified by the protective shield of its considerable intellectual property .
More interesting are the business - building reasons for the deal .
The biggest headache on Android 's horizon is n't litigation , but fragmentation .
Unlike Apple , Google relies on other companies such as Samsung , HTC and of course Motorola to make its handsets .
It can not tightly control the user experience .
For phones to work properly , their software has to be constantly updated , but on many Android phones this does not happen and customers are beginning to cotton on .
The mini software downloads or "" apps "" that allow us to find a street map or play the Angry Birds game are to smartphones what records are to record players .
There 's little point in having one without the other .
Unfortunately , older phones ca n't always use the apps available in the Android store .
Before Apple and Google entered the market , there were dozens of operating systems and developers were unable to build and market apps which were guaranteed to work .
The openness of the Google system is recreating fragmentation , the very problem it was created to solve .
Motorola is a gamble .
Google has a chance now to make phones as good as Apple 's , but if rival manufacturers feel pushed aside , they could desert the Android ranks ."
2011-08-24,"Steve Jobs has resigned as chief executive of Apple , to be replaced by its chief operating officer , Tim Cook , in a surprise move that may signal that the 56-year - old co - founder of the company is losing his battle with cancer .

In a statement on Wednesday night , Apple said that it had appointed Cook , who was recruited to the company by Jobs in 1998 , and had elected Jobs chairman of the board .
Apple 's shares fell by 7 % in after - hours trading , as market digested the impact of Apple losing its charismatic leader , who had led it back from near - bankruptcy after rejoining in 1996 to become the world 's most valuable company by market value earlier in August . ""
Steve Jobs is not your typical CEO .
He is both a visionary from a technology industry perspective as well as a micro - manager , "" said Ashok Kumar , an analyst at Rodman and Renshaw .
"" To say that he is instrumental or key in the turnaround of Apple 's fortunes would be a gross understatement . ""
Fred Wilson , a venture capitalist , said : "" I 'm sad .
He 's the greatest entrepreneur ever . ""
No reason was given for the resignation , but Jobs has been battling medical problems for the past seven years .
He was diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer of the pancreas in 2003 and operated on in July 2004 .
Although he returned to work within a few months , in April 2009 he received a liver transplant .
Medical observers suggested that the long - term effects of the required autoimmune drugs could mean that the cancer would return .
Jobs made a small number of public appearances in 2011 , launching a new version of Apple 's iPad tablet , attending a dinner with US president Barack Obama and other technology chiefs , fronting the launch of new software from Apple in June and presenting plans to the Cupertino council the next day .
But he looked increasingly frail and thin , which looked increasingly like the effects of a spread of the initial cancer . ""
Steve 's extraordinary vision and leadership saved Apple and guided it to its position as the world 's most innovative and valuable technology company , "" said Art Levinson , chairman of Genentech and a member of Apple 's board .
"" Steve has made countless contributions to Apple 's success , and he has attracted and inspired Apple 's immensely creative employees and world class executive team .
In his new role as Chairman of the Board , Steve will continue to serve Apple with his unique insights , creativity and inspiration . ""
Analysts â€ “ who had previously pressed Apple to publicise its CEO succession plan , without success â€
“ said that Cook was a safe pair of hands , but wondered whether the company would have the same drive . ""
[ Tim Cook ] is very highly regarded internally at Apple .
From a succession perspective they could not possibly identify a better candidate .
He has a track record to back it up , "" said Kumar .
"" What Steve Jobs leaves behind is a very deep and a broad bench and so they will continue in his footsteps . ""
Shannon Cross of Cross Research said : "" It wo n't affect next the iPad or next iPhone .
Apple 's product line - up is well set .
Steve , keep in mind , has been training people at Apple and there is a culture at Apple
that is very strong .

2011-08-25,""" The Macintosh turned out so well "" , Steve Jobs â€ “ who resigned as CEO of Apple last night
â€ “ once told the New York Times , "" because the people working on it were musicians , artists , poets and historians who also happened to be excellent computer scientists . ""
And the people who bought the first Apple Mac computers were often architects , designers and journalists .
One way or another , Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak , creators of the Apple Macintosh computers in the 1970s , came up with a line of products that â€ “ though clunky at first â€ “ had great appeal , and continue to excite those engaged in design and the media ; those who were best placed to sow the Apple seed .
The very first Apple computer to go on sale in 1976 , in a wooden casing , had a lashed - together look that hinted strongly at its roots in a Californian garage .
From a purely aesthetic point of view , it might have come from an old Buck Rogers comic book .
When Apple II emerged a year later , boasting colour graphics and a plastic case , these revolutionary computers â€ “ compact , easy to understand and use , and entertaining â€ “ began to sell in larger numbers .
But the real revolution in easy - to - use desktop computer design was the Macintosh 128 K , launched in January 1984 .
It featured a mouse , a separate keyboard and a tiny screen with graphic commands that even an exhausted Fleet Street journalist could adapt to .
And yet despite their ingenuity , and the revolutionary impact they had on millions of working lives , no one could call early Apple products things of beauty .
We used them to produce early issues of Blueprint magazine , a monthly devoted to architecture , fashion and design , yet they seemed lacklustre compared to many of the gleaming 80s designs we published .
But everyone was fascinated by Jobs and Wozniak , these awkward ambassadors for a new era in design and media .
One of Jobs 's greatest contributions to design was the promotion of Jonathan I ve , the brilliant young British designer , to senior vice president of industrial design at Apple Inc in 1998 .
Jobs had been away from Apple for some years â€ “ creating Pixar and thus Toy Story in the interim â€
“
yet when he came back , he teamed up with I ve to create a range of hugely appealing products .
The first was the colourful iMac of 1998 , a bold attempt to break away from the dull world of beige and grey plastic computer cases .
With its oddball marriage of boiled sweet colours and transparent plastics , the iMac was certainly eye - catching , and it also sold â€ “ two million in the first 12 months .
But Jobs and I ve really got into their stride in 2001 with the iPod MP3 player , a small , minimalist design that evoked the work of the legendary German designer Dieter Rams , who had done so much since the 1950s to make Braun products , from record players to electric shavers , sell in prodigious quantities worldwide .
The iPhone ( 2007 ) and iPad three years later have seen the Jobs - Ive design partnership come to fruition .
These lightweight yet well - made , jewel - like objects , with their crystal - clear screens , finally imbued the design of computers and digital gizmos with a seductive quality .
Once seen and touched , sales were made .
Packaging and advertising were all of a piece with these sleek new products , as are the latest Apple showrooms â€ “ as much clubs as shops for Apple customers .
The minimalist quality â€ “ that has worked so well aesthetically and commercially in recent years â€ “ is what Jobs had been seeking all along .
An unostentatious man , he has worked over four decades to fuse the complexities of computer operations with an ease of use and finally a gracefulness and beauty that must have seemed not so much out of the question or improbable in the mid-1970s , but irrelevant .
What mattered then was to make new technology work for everyone , and like the first steam locomotives , aircraft , typewriters or telephones , Jobs 's first designs seem archaic today .
His contribution to both technology and design has been enormous .
Amazing , really , how quickly those artless wooden and glum plastic boxes have become â€ “ with a little help from friends and colleagues
â€ “ objects of modern desire ."
2011-08-25,"Why is Steve Jobs regarded by so many as a genius ?
As CEO of Apple , Steve Jobs was like a French chef : he strove to create great products and had great dramatic flair for presentation .
On the product side , he was a pioneer in embracing the techniques of top - class industrial design for the company 's hardware and usability for its software .
Key elements like graphical interfaces , desktop publishing and networking ( both wired and wireless ) were not created at Apple , but Apple was the first to deploy them .
Products had to be not just great but insanely great .
An extraordinary number of top - class people worked at Apple in the early days to make that possible .
As important was his ability to wow audiences with Apple 's new products .
No one who saw it has forgotten the company 's 1984 Super Bowl ad that announced the Macintosh .
His personal demonstration of the new machine to a theatre full of shareholders was another classic : at a time when computers were silent , glorified typewriters , on stage when he turned on the Mac , it spoke : "" It sure is great to get out of that bag . ""
Later introductions of the iPhone and the iPad were just as sensational .
Other CEOs can sell products and/or companies ; Jobs could make people believers .
In 1981 , fellow long - time Apple colleague Bud Tribble dubbed this charismatic effect the "" reality distortion field "" .
Is his departure a problem for the Apple brand ?
There is a school of thought that holds that it 's dangerous for a public company to tie its public image too tightly to a single "" rock star "" CEO because of the immediate loss of confidence should anything happen to that CEO .
Yet , there are benefits , too .
Jobs 's magnetic effect on the media has certainly brought Apple greater publicity than it could have bought , just as everyone always wants to know what Warren Buffett and Bill Gates think , but it does n't hurt either Twitter or BlackBerry that their CEOs are relatively unknown .
Microsoft is a good example here :
Bill Gates departed apparently seamlessly from day - to - day involvement at Microsoft in 2008 , seven years after relinquishing the CEO job to Steve Ballmer .
The gradual nature of that transition undeniably helped smooth the way .
The immediate drop in Apple 's share price does not mean that the company is in trouble .
It 's now seven years since Jobs 's first cancer diagnosis ; it was surely prepared for his departure .
Any concern must be longer term , around whether the company will be able to continue its technology leadership and consumer focus .
Who is his successor , Tim Cook ?
Tim Cook 's CV shows a long history in the computer business with 12 years at IBM .
He joined Apple in 1998 and became chief operating officer in 2007 .
He has been acting CEO during all of Jobs 's medical absences since 2004 .
Cook is widely credited with excellence in managing operations , manufacturing and logistics .
While that may not sound exciting , it is the bedrock upon which new visions can be built ."
2011-08-25,"Steve Jobs 's resignation as Apple chief executive has wiped billions of dollars off its stock market value as traders fret over the company 's long - term future without its visionary leader .
The news of Jobs 's departure sent Apple shares falling nearly 3 % at the start of trading on Wall Street , knocking around $ 10bn ( Â£6.1bn ) off the company 's value .
The fall was slightly better than the 5 % decline predicted before trading began , and meant Apple shares were changing hands for $ 365 each .
They rose above $ 370 by late morning and were trading just 0.6 % down in mid - afternoon .
Apple stock has enjoyed a stellar run under Jobs â€ “ just two weeks ago Apple briefly became the world 's most valuable company , The shares had hit a low of $ 3.19 in July 1997 , a few months after Jobs rejoined the company he had co - founded in 1976 .
They climbed steadily to almost $ 200 by the end of 2007 thanks to the success of the iPod and the iPhone , and resurgent demand for Apple 's desktop and laptop computers .
Apple stock fell back below $ 90 in early 2009 , as shares slumped around the world , but quadrupled after that â€ “ thanks to a stream of record - breaking profits and impressive new launches , notably the iPad .
Shares in some of Apple 's rivals rose in Asia overnight , as investors anticipated that Apple might stumble .
Samsung Electronics , which is embroiled in a legal battle with Apple over its tablet computer , gained 2.4 % , while smartphone maker HTC closed 1.35 % higher .
Jobs 's departure has been anticipated for some time , and his successor Tim Cook is highly respected .
Many analysts believe Apple remains in safe hands , especially as Cook has been running Apple since the start of 2011 , when Jobs took his third period of medical leave since being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2004 . ""
While this marks the end of an era for Apple , it 's important to remember the there 's more to Apple than any one person , even Steve Jobs , "" said Michael Gartenberg , research director at Gartner .
"" Continuing as chairman , Mr Jobs will continue to leave his mark on both the company and products even as he transfers the reins to Mr Cook . ""
Ovum chief analyst Jan Dawson believes it would be illogical for Apple 's value to fall immediately .
"" The short - term selloff of Apple shares immediately after the announcement is driven by fears that Apple will not continue to perform as it has , once Steve Jobs leaves the CEO role .
However , these fears appear relatively unfounded at least in the short term .
Tim Cook , formerly COO [ chief operating officer ] and now CEO , has been in day - to - day charge of Apple not only since January , but during two previous periods when Steve Jobs 's health prompted extended absences .
On all three occasions , Steve Jobs was nevertheless involved in major decisions and continued to set strategy for the company .
His new role as chairman suggests this will continue to be the case even if he does not sit at a desk in Cupertino for eight hours every day . ""
Dawson acknowledged , though , that Jobs 's move has long - term ramifications for the company . ""
Steve Jobs has provided both strategic vision and personal leadership at the top of the company , as arguably the most visible and well - known CEO of any technology company today .
Tim Cook will not step easily into either of these roles , as a safe pair of hands but hardly a visionary or a charismatic figure . """
2011-08-25,"In a special programme we discuss the career of Apple guru Steve Jobs as he steps down from his role as chief executive .
Jemima Kiss , Charles Arthur and Dan Crow of UK
startup Songkick share their thoughts on the effect Jobs has on computing and the company that just two weeks ago became the world 's biggest ( by market capitalisation ) .
Dan , who worked with Jobs on his return to the company in the mid-90s suggests that Steve may be the greatest marketer of our time , because of his ability to understand products and what people find exciting in them .
Apple co - founder Steve Wozniak also shares a story from a turning point during the early years of the company â€ “ the launch of the Mac â€ “ and how Jobs 's tyrannical reputation was evident even then .
We also discuss Apple 's new chief executive Tim Cook , and ask what the future now holds for Apple ."
2011-08-25,
2011-08-25,"The entrepreneur 's entrepreneur , Steve Jobs has fascinated and mystified the tech business community for more than a decade steering Apple from near - bankruptcy to become the most valuable company in the world .
Under Jobs , Apple has become the exception to every business rule , expanding into markets that might have seemed outside Apple 's core strengths â€ “ not least music , with the iPod and iTunes , and mobile phones , with the iPhone .
Its expertise , though , was in understanding and creating consumer electronics in whatever form .
Co -
founder Steve Wozniak , speaking to Bloomberg , last night defined Apple 's success as being about the way products are developed as much as the products themselves . ""
Steve had been very disciplined and forthcoming in reasons for running things certain ways .
At Apple great products are not the important thing â€ “
it 's where those products come from and so much of that was down to the way of thinking of Steve Jobs , "" said Wozniak .
"" The people around somebody who thinks in great ways like that and thinks ahead â€ “ they admire that and what to be like that â€ ¦ Apple is not going to change drastically or suddenly hit the tubes
â€
¦
I just hope that Steve is happy and feels that apple is in the best possible place for the future .
His goal is not money .
His personal goal is to be the implementer of technology that would improve people 's lives
â€
“
that 's what he was born for , he told me once . ""
TechCrunch 's Saul Hansell described Jobs as "" the patron saint of perfectionists "" .
"" We all know lots of people who are nice .
We know many people who are smart .
We 've seen a bunch of corporate leaders who have the rare combination of skills to surf the waves spawned by Moore 's Law , "" wrote Hansell . ""
But it 's hard to think of anyone besides Steve Jobs who through the sheer force of will , self - confidence , vision and perfectionism could upend the powerful forces of technology to make so many products that delighted so many people precisely because they were improbable . ""
For those wondering why so much attention has been paid to the departure of one chief executive , veteran Wall Street Journal reporter Walt Mossberg explains : "" Most people are lucky if they can change the world in one important way , but Jobs , in multiple stages of his business career , changed global technology , media and lifestyles in multiple ways on multiple occasions , "" wrote Mossberg . ""
He did it because he was willing to take big risks on new ideas , and not be satisfied with small innovations fed by market research .
He also insisted on high quality and had the guts to leave out features others found essential and to kill technologies , like the floppy drive and the removable battery , he decided were no longer needed .
And he has been a brilliant marketer , personally passionate about his products .
"" Ovuum chief analyst Jan Dawson noted that Steve Jobs has been the architect of major shifts in music , mobile phones and personal computer markets , yet also generated resentment and criticism over Apple 's proprietary and closed approach . ""
The short - term sell - off of Apple shares immediately after the announcement is driven by fears that Apple will not continue to perform as it has , once Steve Jobs leaves the CEO role .
However , these fears appear relatively unfounded at least in the short - term â€ ¦ his new role as chairman suggests this will continue to be the case even if he does not sit at a desk in Cupertino for eight hours every day . ""
Longer term , however , if Steve Jobs 's health is indeed behind his resignation , as many have speculated , and his condition worsens to the point that he can no longer be involved in even occasional decision making at the company , there are reasons to fear that the company will struggle to emulate its recent success .
Steve Jobs has provided both strategic vision and personal leadership at the top of the company , as arguably the most visible and well - known CEO of any technology company today .
Tim Cook will not step easily into either of these roles , as a safe pair of hands but hardly a visionary or a charismatic figure . ""
At Gartner , research director Michael Gartenberg said that despite Jobs 's influence , Apple is much more than a one - man company . ""
While this marks the end of an era for Apple , it 's important to remember the there 's more to Apple than any one person , even Steve Jobs .
Continuing as chairman Mr Jobs will continue to leave his mark on both the company and products even as he transfers the reigns to Mr Cook . ""
Perhaps a hint of Jobs 's announcement came last week , technology writer Bob Cringely suggested , when the publication date for the much - anticipated authorised Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson was moved forward from March 2012 to 21 November .
"" We know there is such a plan â€ “ there has to be , Apple 's moves have been too deliberate , if inscrutable , to be some executive random walk .
But nobody near the top has ever tried to explain where the company is going , preferring to be mysterious instead .
Bill Gates had Nathan Myhrvold write his book for him , but Steve is classier than Bill .
I believe Walter Isaacson 's book will also function as Steve 's technology manifesto , part of his legacy .
"" Once we have the grand plan , then it may make more sense just who should lead that plan 's execution during what will clearly be Apple 's best quarter in its 34-year history . ""
Steve Jobs is setting up this ( and us ) for another grand reveal â€ ¦ just one more thing . """
2011-08-25,"Steve Jobs may effectively be gone from Apple , but he is far from forgotten by those who worked inside and outside with him .
His style in dealing with customers could be astonishingly blunt , yet never what you would call directly rude .
His email address became known around the web , and people would contact him through it .
Those emails began to be collected by various blogs .
And while Jobs might have been known as a great communicator when up on a stage in front of an audience , when dealing through email , "" terse "" barely begins to describe it .
Here 's a selection : September 2010 : Customer : "" Steve , Enjoyed the presentation today .
But â€ ¦ this new iTunes logo really sucks .
You 're taking 10 + years of instant product recognition and replacing it with an unknown .
Let 's both cross our fingers on thisâ€
¦ . ""
Jobs : We disagree .
June 2010 :
Customer : "" Any reason battery performance on a 3GS running iOS4 should be worse than it was running OS3 ? ""
Jobs :
Nope .
June 2010 :
Customer : "" Mr Jobs , Newsweek just ran an ' obituary ' for the Mac saying the mac has been ' relegated to the steaming dung heap of the past ' .
I hope he 's wrong .
I believe and hope that the Mac will remain a vibrant , vital part of Apple 's future and one of its ( admittedly many ) product lines .
So , as you view it , does the mac have a long and important history ahead of it ? ""
Jobs : Completely Wrong .
Just wait .
May 2010 :
Customer : ""
Do you hate Adobe and their products ( Photoshop , Illustrator , etc ) or do you just hate their view on Flash ? ""
Jobs :
I respect and admire Adobe .
We just chose to not have Flash on our devices .
May 2010
: Customer : "" Why no printing on the iPad ?
What gives ? ""
Jobs :
It will come .
And then there was the entire thread between Jobs and Ryan Tate of Gawker in May 2010 , in which Jobs suggested that the iPad and Apple Store combination offered "" freedom from porn "" .
( Context : Gawker 's parent company faced legal charges over its display of the then - unreleased iPhone 4 prototype , and there had been some police presence at a Gawker writer 's house in California . )
Here 's how it went .
Tate began : "" If [ Bob ] Dylan was 20 today , how would he feel about your company ?
Would he think the iPad had the faintest thing to do with ' revolution ' ?
Revolutions are about freedom , "" Tate wrote after seeing an iPad advert .
Three hours later , Jobs replied : "" Yep , freedom from programs that steal your private data .
Freedom from programs that trash your battery .
Freedom from porn .
Yep , freedom .
The times they are a changin ' , and some traditional PC folks feel like their world is slipping away .
It is . ""
There follow an argument about Flash , batteries , Objective - C , porn ( "" you might care more [ about not having it ] when you have kids "" , remarks Jobs ) , whether Apple has a private police force that kicked in a Gawker person 's doors ( "" You are so misinformed , "" Jobs retorts .
"" No one kicked in any doors .
You 're believing a lot of erroneous blogger reports "" ) .
Jobs concludes : "" Microsoft had ( has ) every right to enforce whatever rules for their platform that they want .
If people do n't like it , they can write for another platform , which some did .
Or they can buy another platform , which some did . ""
As for us , we 're just doing what we can to try and make ( and preserve ) the user experience we envision .
You can disagree with us , but our motives are pure . ""
And then a final , very Jobs - ish little parting shot : ""
By the way , what have you done that 's so great ?
Do you create anything , or just criticise others [ sic ] work and belittle their motivations ? ""
Yet Tate himself said that "" came away from the exchange impressed with his willingness to engage "" .
Tersely , of course ."
2011-08-25,"Dictator .
Tyrant .
Genius :
Steve Jobs 's ferocious perfectionism is the stuff of Silicon Valley legend .
Very much the entrepreneur 's entrepreneur , the charismatic , ruthlessly ambitious former Apple CEO has built a legion of devotees who worship Apple with nothing less than religious devotion â€ “ from fanboy geeks to design obsessives and business graduates and , more recently , an increasingly mainstream customer base .
Apple is the exception to every business rule .
Where the trend is openness and collaboration , Apple is more proprietorial and closed than ever .
Where tech businesses fail if they expand into content , Apple has come to redefine music and is a major player in digital books , TV and publishing .
And where it is seen as far too risky for a business to depend on one all - powerful CEO , Jobs ( left ) has been that person for Apple , a company defined by his personality and vision .
Dan Crow , who spent four years as Apple 's senior engineering manager , saw the transformation after Jobs rejoined the company in 1996 . "" Within 18 months he 'd completely transformed Apple both internally and externally and it was really the force of his personality that did that . ""
Rivals pore over Apple 's methods â€ “ from tiny product groups and strictly enforced secrecy to an internal "" university "" where company successes are analysed and the strategy reinforced by an academic .
And behind all this is Jobs .
As Wired 's Frank Rose once wrote , he was "" far more compelling and ultimately more successful than the string of glossy - tongued managers "" . ""
Can anyone tell me what MobileMe is meant to do ? ""
Jobs barked at a meeting in 2008 . ""
So why the fuck does n't it do that ?
"" he went on , beginning a 30-minute tirade detailed by Fortune magazine .
"" You 've tarnished Apple 's reputation .
You should hate each other for having let each other down . ""
In 2000 , a meeting between Jobs and an education firm ended with Jobs screeching across the table : "" You 're shit !
Your company 's shit !
It 's nothing compared to mine ! ""
his spittle flecking the table , according to the Boing Boing website .
Crow saw the infamous tyranny firsthand , working on development of the Quicktime video software where Jobs managed "" every last pixel of the interface "" .
His particular talents for marketing and his instinct for creating desirable products also come with an intimidating management style .
"" He 's a perfectionist micromanager and will accept absolutely no compromise to his vision , "" Crow said .
"" The flipside is that you end up building something extraordinary
â€ “ our team ended up building elegant and refined software
we did n't believe we were capable of building .
Being part of that was career defining â€
“ he brings out the best in people .
"" Jobs began his second period of health - related medical leave more than 18 months ago , since when he has looked increasingly gaunt during select public appearances .
Though doubtless a reflection of his tenacity and commitment to Apple , this carefully graduated exit has minimised any sudden dive in Apple 's stock value and prepared shareholders for a succession .
Even his departure has been micromanaged .
Is Apple 's future really entwined with Jobs 's personality ? ""
Even when Steve is n't personally involved in a product , his philosophy is so well understood in the company that it pervades everything Apple does , "" said Crow .
"" It 's hard to see how that influence can remain at the level it is now because Steve is such a personality , and his influence is a very powerful tool in the company that is used to maintain standards . ""
Although he 's surrounded by very smart people from Tim Cook down , that influence will fade over time .
Apple is a company founded in his image . """
2011-08-25,"From Wall Street to Tokyo , it 's the question on everyone 's lips : Will Apple be the same without Steve Jobs ?
Do n't be daft : of course it wo n't .
Jobs is the strategic visionary behind a suite of products that have taken the world by storm and propelled Apple 's share price to a level which , briefly , made it the most valuable company in the world .
Small wonder the company 's stock fell on news Jobs was standing down as chief executive , while the price of Asian rivals such as Samsung and HTC Corporation shot ahead .
Has the world forgotten how Apple was on its knees in the mid-1990s , with analysts giving it little more than six months to live ?
It was only when Jobs returned to head the company he helped to found in the 1970s that its star began to rise again , as its leader moved into his most creative phase , unveiling the iPod , iPhone and iPad , and launching the iTunes music store to the delight of consumers around the globe .
The Apple mystique and a powerful brand name have enabled it to enjoy profit margins that are twice as fat as those of competitors .
Few people in the technology industry can rival Jobs in sensing how products should look and feel , or what will sell .
Apple products have been able to command premium prices because they are pleasing to the eye and easy to use – something Jobs understands only too well .
It is disingenuous for people to dismiss the idea that a single individual ca n't make all the difference when it comes to running large companies : we have seen time and again how the quality of leadership can make or break corporations .
Jobs is without doubt the creative force that has made Apple into one of the biggest business success stories of recent decades , and few would question the widely held belief that without him , the company would have struggled to survive .
But that is not the same as saying Apple in 2011 is about to go the way of the dinosaurs and be wiped off the face of the earth .
It has been known for some years that Jobs 's health has been failing ; chief operating officer Tim Cook , who replaces him , was brought in to run the company in January after Jobs went on medical leave for a second time .
Since February , Apple 's share price has advanced more than 25 % at a time when Jobs was on the sidelines .
Apple has had time to plan for the day when he finally steps aside , and in truth , there is plenty of home - grown talent to be found within the organisation .
So in the short term , Apple 's customers should n't notice any difference ; a number of big product launches are in the pipeline , such as the iPhone5 .
And the long term ?
The jury is out on that one ."

2011-08-25,"Apple 's new chief executive Tim Cook vowed to stick to Apple 's "" unique principles and values "" as investors marked his first day as successor to founder Steve Jobs by selling shares and marking the company 's value down by more than 5 % , or about £ 10bn .
In taking over from Jobs , widely regarded as a genius for giving the world such groundbreaking products as the iPod and iPhone , Cook faces one of the toughest challenges in corporate history as he strives to maintain Apple 's position as the world 's foremost technology firm .
Earlier this month Apple briefly passed the oil behemoth Exxon to become the world 's most valuable company just 14 years after flirting with bankruptcy .
In a company - wide email on Thursday , Cook , who has been at Apple for 13 years , told staff : "" I want you to be confident that Apple is not going to change .
I cherish and celebrate Apple 's unique principles and values .
Steve built a company and culture that is unlike any other in the world and we are going to stay true to that
– it is in our DNA .
We are going to continue to make the best products in the world that delight our customers and make our employees incredibly proud of what they do . ""
The first challenge for Cook 's reign will be the expected unveiling of the next versions of the iPhone , widely anticipated within the next six weeks as Apple aims to capitalise on its leadership of the mobile phone industry , where it has risen from nothing to having the largest revenue and profits in just under five years .
In the computer market , its small sales have still grown faster than the rest of the Windows - based market for 20 successive quarters .
And its iPad tablet still dominates the fast - growing market , despite competition from dozens of rivals using Google 's free Android operating system .
Reports said that Jobs spent his final day as chief executive at the Apple campus in Cupertino , California , where he worked a full day , and that he intended to be an "" active "" chairman of the company .
Although he gave no reason for his departure , announced late on Wednesday , medical observers believe it is linked to the rare neuroendocrine cancer for which he was treated in 2004 , and the liver transplant he received in April 2009 .
Cook , 50 , was until Wednesday the company 's chief operating officer , and had been acting CEO since January .
He has long been seen as the natural successor .
But even as investors were selling the stock – it later recovered to be down only 1.1 % –
business analysts were insisting that Cook would have at least two years in which to rely on products that Apple will already have under development .
The departure of Jobs , the visionary who has set out Apple 's philosophy for decades – first between 1975 and 1985 , and then from 1997 to this year – had been seen by some investors as cause for alarm at the company , which is now more valuable than rivals such as Microsoft , Dell and Intel .
But Gartner Research analyst Michael Gartenberg suggested that customers would continue to be loyal to the brand .
Without Jobs , he believes the company 's challenge will be the same as it was with him : continuing to find ways to raise the bar with its consumer electronics . ""
Yes , this is quite some transition …
but it does n't mean Apple itself will fundamentally change , "" he said .
"" Certainly Apple 's competition would be foolish to think this is a situation they could somehow capitalise on . ""
Richard Windsor at Nomura said : "" By its own admission , Apple 's pipeline is several years long , so if innovation were to stop dead overnight it would still be some time before the effect was felt .
That said , the launch of the next iPhone already delayed from the anticipated July launch will be even more important now than it already was .
If the hardware is not impressive ... then the company may be seen to be losing momentum . ""
Richard Gardner at Citigroup advised investors to buy the stock if it drops , saying Jobs had laid a strong foundation , and that he expected it to gain market share for years . ""
In our view , [ Cook ] is a tough but well - regarded leader who will continue to hold Apple employees to an extremely high standard of performance , "" he wrote .
"" The quiet man with similar goals Steve Jobs is famous for his temper , while Tim Cook is described as soft - spoken .
Jobs is a Californian known for his new age interest in vegetarianism and spirituality , but Cook , who is from Alabama , loves American football .
And while Jobs enjoyed rockstar - like fame , the intensely private Cook toiled for years in obscurity , an operations wonk who made the proverbial trains run on time .
But now it may be the things that Cook shares with Jobs that will matter most as he takes over as boss of one of the world 's coolest companies .
One of those characteristics is said to be sheer competitiveness . ""
He 's not in it for the fame or the ego or the money .
He 's in it to win , "" said Greg Petsch , his boss at Compaq Computer during the late 90s .
"" The guy is just a phenomenal operating executive , "" said Mark Briggs , who was Cook 's boss at Intelligent Electronics from 1994 to 1997 .
Briggs remembers a highly analytical executive , focused on metrics , who overhauled the company 's supply chain . ""
He just works all the time , that 's his life . ""
Cook has a strong record as a stand - in .
When Jobs was first ill in 2004 Cook took charge and things went so well he was made chief operating officer .
In his second stint , Apple 's stock rose 62 % .

In Motion .
After months of near - constant negative headlines around the company 's BlackBerry devices , it has just unveiled a genuinely innovative new music service built on top of its crown jewel : the BBM messaging app .
And yet the unveiling happened just as Apple CEO Steve Jobs resigned , sucking the blogosphere 's attention and energy away from any other technology story .
BBM Music deserves to regain some of that attention though : it has plenty of potential , and is far from a me - too rival to popular music services like iTunes , Spotify and Pandora .
Powered by British music services firm Omnifone , it has licences from all four major labels in the bag in time for the launch today of its closed beta in the UK , US and Canada , with a global rollout to follow later this year in those countries plus Australia , Columbia , France , Germany , Indonesia , Italy , Malaysia , Mexico , Netherlands , Saudi Arabia , Singapore , Spain , Thailand , Turkey and the United Arab Emirates .
The basic facts : BBM Music will be a subscription service costing $ 4.99 a month in the US , although how that converts elsewhere in the world has yet to be announced .
Users will choose 50 songs from the BBM Music catalogue for their profiles , which can be used to create playlists , and cached locally on their BlackBerry smartphone for offline listening .
50 songs ?
That 's not much , but this is where the BBM angle kicks in .
Users will also be able to access the 50 songs of any of their BBM contacts who subscribe to the service .
That means a theoretical choice of 100 songs if one friend signs up , 200 songs if three do , and 2,000 songs if 39 do .
And so on .
RIM has not given details of any upper limit , but in an interview with BerryReview , senior project manager Nick Patsiopoulos says "" during the beta the BBM Music connections is limited to 140 BBM Music contacts until launch but it can scale past there "" .
Licensing agreements are likely to be the key factor in whatever ceiling is eventually set .
The BBM Music app itself is built around an activity stream of the songs friends are adding to their profiles , as well as the friends they are sharing those tracks with , and the playlists they are creating .
Users can comment on one another 's songs , and fire up full BBM chats from within the application .
The app also ties into Amazon 's MP3 music store to buy and download tracks beyond the 50-song limit , with the choice of partner being slightly surprising , given RIM 's previously close relationship with British firm 7Digital .
BBM Music is interesting and genuinely disruptive in the wider scheme of music services .
An addressable user base of 45 million BBM users is a strong base to start from , although BBM Music is more likely to appeal to BlackBerry 's younger customers rather than its business users .
There are some pitfalls in store .
First : will those younger users be willing to pay for a subscription music service , even if it is tied into BBM ?
Second : how will it stack up to competition from other streaming services which offer desktop as well as mobile access , with no 50-song limit ?
RIM 's launch of its BBM Social API means those services can build BBM into their own BlackBerry apps , after all .
Perhaps most importantly , BBM Music 's success will be tied to the overall performance of RIM itself .
It 's a bold and innovative move , but its long - term prospects will depend on the success of the current wave of BlackBerry 7 OS handsets , but more importantly on how next year 's new generation of devices running RIM 's QNX software perform .
RIM 's challenge remains proving that it can halt its sliding market share against fierce competition from iPhone and Android , but at least BBM Music shows its strategy is not just about playing catch - up ."

2011-08-26,"Your life achievements have n't properly been recognised until they 've been rendered into faintly dodgy CGI by the Taiwanese outfit NMA .
( Tiger Woods , you were so honoured . )
But we 're happy to say that Steve Jobs , who resigned as chief executive of Apple on Wednesday , has been duly recognised .
( In fact it 's come up so fast that we suspect they might even have had this prepared , which we did n't think they were allowed to do under their "" make it look as weird as possible "" conditions .
To say that it 's a figurative - nay , symbolic - rather than literal representation only begins to scratch the surface .
As Bitterwallet points out , "" Obviously , it covers all the key points in the life of Jobs – the LSD - fuelled epiphany , that time he gave birth to a computer , the vicious lightsaber fight with Bill ' Darth Vader ' Gates and his subsequent bout with the Grim Reaper .
It 's all there – a fitting tribute if ever we saw one . ""
To which we 'd add that it also has the time he fought off an attack of killer Android bots in his boardroom , upon which he was helped by someone who we ca n't actually recognise but seems to be wearing a rainbow flowerpot on his head .
Mark Zuckerberg ?
Honestly , it 's like Madame Tussauds in there .
Anyway , enjoy .
It 's like Picasso was writing and reporting the news , is n't it ?"
2011-08-27,"Steve Jobs 's resignation was the most discussed in corporate history .
Because his illness has been public knowledge for so long , and because Wall Street and the commentariat viewed his health as being synonymous with that of his company , for years Apple share prices have fluctuated with its CEO 's temperature .
If all the "" Whither Apple without Jobs ? "" articles were laid end to end , they would cover quite a distance â€ “ but they never reached a conclusion .
Still , you could understand the hysteria .
After all , he 's the man who rescued Apple from the near - death experience it underwent in the mid-1990s .
When he came back in 1996 , the company seemed headed for oblivion .
Granted , it was a distinctive , quirky outfit , but one that had been run into the ground by mediocre executives who had no vision , no strategy â€ “ and no operating system to power its products into the future .
Jobs came back because Apple bought NeXT , the computer workstation company he had started after being ousted by the Apple board in 1985 .
By acquiring NeXT , Apple got two things : the operating system that became OS X , the software that underpinned everything Apple has made since ; and Jobs as "" interim CEO "" at a salary of $ 1 a year .
But it was still a corporate minnow :
a BMW to Microsoft 's Ford .
Fifteen years later , Apple had become the most valuable company in the world .
It was the greatest comeback since Lazarus .
Because only an obsessive , authoritarian , visionary genius could have achieved such a transformation , it 's easy to see why Wall Street has had difficulty imagining Apple without Jobs .
He was , after all , the only CEO in the world with rock star status .
And Apple is a corporate extension of his remarkable personality , much as Microsoft was of Bill Gates 's .
But Jobs has something Gates never had â€ “ a reputation so powerful as to create a reality distortion field around him .
This field has blinded people to some under - appreciated facts .
While it is true , for example , that Apple â€ “ under Jobs 's influence
â€ “ is probably the world 's best industrial design outfit , it is also a phenomenally well - run company .
Proof of that comes from various sources .
For example , not only does it regularly dream up beautiful , functional and fantastically complex products , but it gets them to market in working order , on time and to budget ; and it has continually done so despite exploding demand .
Compare that with slow - motion car crashes such as Hewlett Packard 's Touchpad , RIM 's BlackBerry Playbook or Microsoft 's Vista operating system .
Then there 's the way that Apple â€ “ in the teeth of industry scepticism â€ “ made such an astonishing success of bricks - and - mortar retailing with its high - street stores .
Or ponder the fact that it became the world 's most valuable corporation without incurring a single cent of debt .
Instead , it sits atop a $ 78bn ( Â£48bn ) cash mountain : enough to buy Tesco and BT and still have loose change .
Compare that with the casino capitalism practised by so many MBA - educated company leaders in the US .
And finally there is the stranglehold Apple now has on a number of crucial modern markets â€ “ computers , online music , mobile devices and smartphones .
If you ask people what Steve Jobs is best remembered for , most will name a particular product .
If they 're from my ( baby boomer ) generation , it will probably be the Apple Macintosh , a computer that changed many of our lives in the 1980s .
Younger generations will credit him with the iMac , iTunes and the iPod .
Today 's teenagers will revere him for the iPhone .
But there 's a good argument that Jobs 's greatest creation is Apple itself in its post-1996 incarnation .
If that 's true , the great test of his career legacy is whether the organisation he built around his values will endure and remain faithful to them .
What are those values ?
He usually expressed them as aphorisms and , as news of his resignation spread , people began raking through them for clues .
Many focused on what he said to John Sculley , CEO of Pepsi , when he was trying to persuade him to run Apple . ""
Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugar water , "" he asked , "" or do you want to change the world ? ""
( Sculley accepted the invitation , then presided over Jobs 's expulsion . )
But for Jobs it was a serious question .
What he was asking , as the blogger Umair Haque put it , was : "" Do you really want to spend your days slaving over work that fails to inspire , on stuff that fails to count , for reasons that fail to touch the soul of anyone ? ""
Jobs is famously fanatical about design .
In part this is about how things look ( though for him it also involves simplicity of use ) .
When the rest of the industry was building computers as grey , rectangular metal boxes , for example , he was prowling department stores and streets looking for design metaphors .
For a time he thought the Mac should be like a Porsche .
At another stage he wanted it to be like the Cuisinart food - processor .
When the machine finally appeared in 1984 , Jack Tramiel , the grizzled macho - boss of Commodore , thought it looked like a girly device that would be best sold in boutiques .
What Tramiel did not realise â€ “ and Jobs did â€ “ was that ultimately computers would be consumer products and people would pay a huge premium for classy design .
In that sense he is the polar opposite of the MBA - trained , bean - counting executive . ""
The cure for Apple is not cost - cutting , "" he said in 1996 , when the company was on the rocks . ""
The cure for Apple is to innovate its way out of its current predicament . ""
At another point he said : "" When you 're a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers , you 're not going to use a piece of plywood on the back , even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it . ""
This delight in elegant work has always been the most striking aspect of Jobs 's celebrated speeches introducing new Apple products in San Francisco .
As he cooed over the iMac or the iPhone or the iPad , words like "" beautiful "" , "" amazing "" and "" awesome "" tumbled out .
For once they did n't sound like cynical , manipulative corporation - speak .
He spoke from the heart .
It goes without saying that he is impossible to work with ; most geniuses are .
Yet he has built â€ “ and retained the respect of â€ “ the most remarkable design team in living memory , a group that has been responsible for more innovation than the rest of the computer industry put together .
For that reason , when the time comes to sum up Jobs 's achievements , most will portray him as a seminal figure in the computing industry .
But Jobs is bigger than that .
To understand why , you have to look at the major communications industries of the 20th century â€ “ the telephone , radio and movies .
As Tim Wu chronicles it in his remarkable book , The Master Switch , each of these industries started out as an open , irrationally exuberant , chaotic muddle of incompatible standards , crummy technology and chancers .
The pivotal moment in the evolution of each industry came when a charismatic entrepreneur arrived to offer consumers better quality , higher production values and greater ease of use .
With the telephone it was Theodore Vail of AT&amp;T , offering a unified nationwide network and a guarantee that when you picked up the phone you always got a dial tone .
With radio it was David Sarnoff , who founded RCA .
With movies it was Adolph Zukor , who created the Hollywood studio system .
Jobs is from the same mould .
He believes that using a computer should be delightful , not painful ; that it should be easy to seamlessly transfer music from a CD on to a hard drive and thence to an elegant portable player ; that mobile phones should be powerful handheld computers that happen to make voice calls ; and that a tablet computer is the device that is ushering us into a post - PC world .
He has offered consumers a better proposition than the rest of the industry could â€ “ and they jumped at it .
That 's how he built Apple into the world 's most valuable company .
And it 's why he is really the last of the media moguls ."
2011-08-28,"Ten years is , of course , a long time in media .
Ten years ago , if you wanted to download some music , your best bet was Napster or one of the filesharing systems such as LimeWire or KaZaA.
There were legal services , but they were so dire they would n't pass much muster today
: there was PressPlay and MusicNet ( from rival groups of record companies ) , which required $ 15 a month subscriptions for low - quality streaming ( when most people had dialup connections , not today 's broadband ) .
You could n't burn to CD .
They were stuffed with restrictive software to prevent you sharing the songs .
What happened ?
Steve Jobs happened , mainly .
The hardware and design team at Apple came up with the iPod ( initially intended to be a way to sell more Macintosh computers ) , and then followed the iTunes Music Store – a great way to tie people to Apple by selling music .
In 2003 Jobs persuaded the music companies – which would n't license their songs to bigger names like Microsoft – to go with him because , he said , Apple was tiny ( which it was , at the time ) .
The risk if people did start sharing songs from the store was minimal , he argued .
The record labels looked at Apple 's tiny market share ( a few per cent of the PC market ) and reckoned they 'd sell about a million songs a year , so they signed up .
Apple sold a million in the first week of the iTunes Music Store being open ( and only in the US ) .
It sold 3 m within a month .
It 's never looked back .
Nowadays Apple sells TV shows , films , books , apps , as well as music .
We take the explosion in available content for granted .
But without Jobs , it 's likely we would n't be here at all ; his negotiating skill is the thing that Apple , and possibly the media industry , will miss the most , because he got them to open up to new delivery mechanisms .
Content companies have been reluctant to let their products move to new formats if they are n't the inventors , or at least midwives .
Witness Blu - ray , a Sony idea which wraps up the content
so you ca n't ever get it off the disc ( at least in theory ) ; or 3D films .
Yet neither is quite living up to its promise , and part of that comes down to people wanting to be able to move the content around – on an iPod , iPhone , iPad or even a computer – in ways the content does n't allow .
Apps downloaded directly to your mobile ?
Carriers would never have allowed it five years ago .
Flat - rate data plans ?
Ditto .
But all good for content creators .
Jobs pried open many content companies ' thinking , because his focus was always on getting something great to the customer with as few obstacles as possible .
In that sense , he was like a corporate embodiment of the internet ; except he thought people should pay for what they got .
He always , always insisted you should pay for value , and that extended to content too .
The App and Music Store remains one of the biggest generators of purely digital revenue in the world , and certainly the most diverse ; while Google 's Android might be the fastest - selling smartphone mobile OS , its Market generates pitiful revenues , and I have n't heard of anyone proclaiming their successes from selling music , films or books through Google 's offerings .
Jobs 's resignation might look like the end of an era , and for certain parts of the technology industry it is .
For the content industries , it 's also a loss : Jobs was a champion of getting customers who would pay you for your stuff .
The fact that magazine apps like The Daily have n't set the world alight ( yet ? ) is n't a failure of the iPad ( which is selling 9 m a quarter while still only 15 months old ; at the same point in the iPod 's life , just 219,000 were sold in the financial quarter , compared with the 22 m – 100 times more – of its peak ) .
It 's more like a reflection of our times .
So if you 're wondering how Jobs 's departure affects the media world , consider that it 's the loss of one of the biggest boosters of paid - for content the business ever had .
Who 's going to replace that ?"
2011-08-31,"Two recent and apparently unrelated media events have conspired to make me think of ways in which the consolidation of the global sustainability industry is likely to happen over the next decade .
The first was yet another listing of sustainability leaders , the second the news that Steve Jobs was stepping back at Apple , a company not widely known for its sensitivity to environmental and sustainability issues .
Finding myself listed as one of the top 100 sustainability leaders was nice , of course , but what really struck me in skimming down the list was that the movement is now so broad that I did n't know a fair number of those listed , while quite a number that I thought should have been included , were n't there .
Steve Jobs stepping down from his CEO role at Apple , for what looks like the last time , ensured an even bigger battery of media spotlights than usual was directed at both the man and his company , which recentlyâ€ “ albeit briefly â€ “ became the world 's most valuable business .
As a long - time Mac user , I regretted the changing of the old guard at Apple , even if Jobs plans to remain as chairman , but then I read John Noughton 's latest take on the Jobs phenomenon and suddenly found myself looking through and beyond Jobs .
Noughton pointed out that Apple 's design team has been responsible for "" more innovation than the rest of the computer industry put together . ""
Jobs has been a seminal figure in the industry , clearly , but Noughton went on to say that he represents something even more profound . ""
To understand why , "" he said , "" you have to look at the major communications industries of the 20th century â€ “ the telephone , radio and movies .
As Tim Wu chronicles in his remarkable book , The Master Switch , each of these industries started out as an open , irrationally exuberant , chaotic muddle of incompatible standards , crummy technology and chancers .
The pivotal moment in the evolution of each industry came when a charismatic entrepreneur arrived to offer consumers better quality , higher production values and greater ease of use . ""
Working away on a new book in recent months , I have been struck by how extensive and complex the sustainability business has become .
I 'm not sure it ever went through an equivalent irrationally exuberant phase , though perhaps you could say there were elements of that in the buildup to the 15th UN climate change summit in Copenhagen in 2009 .
From the point of view of customers , though , you could certainly say that there is a chaotic muddle of competing , if not always incompatible , standards in the field .
There has been crummy technology over the years , no question , and a fair few people who you might call chancers â€ “ though sometimes , perhaps , that 's simply another word for entrepreneurial .
Rightly or wrongly , as I have interviewed leading - edge innovators , entrepreneurs and investors through the summer , I have had a growing sense that the sustainability sector is now headed towards a series of consolidations .
By 2020 , if I am right , we will be looking out upon a transformed landscape in terms of sustainable business .
So , if Theodore Vail was the telephone sector consolidator with AT&amp;T , David Sarnoff the radio consolidator with RCA , and Adolph Zukor the movies consolidator
, it 's interesting to speculate whether the name of the key sustainability consolidator will be American , European , Asian â€ “ or something else entirely ?

2011-09-12,"Felix Dennis ' battles with the establishment are the stuff of legend , most famously with the 1971 Oz obscenity trial , but also with the way he shook up magazine publishing with Dennis Publishing , and most recently with his emergence as a poet , to initial suspicion from the literary world .
The latest establishment figure to arouse his wrath is Apple , and its now - former CEO Steve Jobs .
The Guardian interviewed Dennis in the run - up to the release of the iPad app of his Tales From The Woods poetry anthology , at a point when he was wondering how to get the app into the hands of reviewers and literary friends before its debut . ""
With a poetry book I can send 100 copies out to reviewers and other people , and even do it in advance and get their response , "" he says .
"" It 's difficult with iPad : how do you send it out for free , and how do you even disseminate it before it goes into their store ?
I have huge issues - as does everybody - with the great difficulty of dissemination and the restrictions on distribution that Apple have introduced with their devices . ""
Apple has a promo code that allows app publishers to send 50 free copies to reviewers every time they launch or update an app , and Dennis ' PR team did use that before the launch .
However , there is a strong sense that his concerns around Apple go beyond the mechanics of pre - release reviews into the wider question of its role as gatekeeper for the App Store .
"" I know this is Apple 's world and we just live in it , but we did fight a lot of battles over hundreds of years not to have one man deciding what people can disseminate , "" he says .
"" There were wars .
People died !
This might be Steve 's world , but I think this is going to come back to haunt him . ""
[ Note : the interview took place before Jobs ' resignation as Apple CEO ] .
Dennis has been disseminating verse since 2001 , when he gave his first public poetry reading , with a nationwide tour following the next year , as well as his first anthology , A Glass Half Full .
Tales
From The Woods is his sixth collection , published in 2010 by Ebury Press and already reprinted once in its hardback edition - a rarity for a modern poetry collection .
The approving comments from critics , authors and celebrities at the start of the book is a far cry from the literary establishment reactions when he first started publishing and performing his poems .
"" I 'm an entrepreneur , a businessman .
I 've got a lot of money , and that does n't go very well with the whole starving artist in a garret routine , "" says Dennis .
"" It did n't play well , and there was a certain amount of snootiness going on .
But it helped to have one or two champions early on : people like Stephen Fry , Melvin Bragg and Robert Wood at the Wordsworth Trust . ""
Besides his six volumes of poetry , Dennis has his own website where hundreds more unpublished poems are housed , and proudly reveals that the Bodleian Library is archiving the site 's contents regularly to keep a permanent record .
He 's not worried about the unfinished nature of some of these poems .
"" It 's giving readers the opportunity to look over the poet 's shoulder into his notebook , "" he says .
Now there 's the iPad app for Tales
From The Woods , which launches at an auspicious time for poetry on the App Store – Faber 's iPad app for T.S. Eliot 's The Waste Land recently topped charts around the world and earned back its costs in less than two months .
"" It will be interesting to see just how new poetry is going to fare as an app , "" he says , before enthusing about the multimedia features of the new application , which include audio and video performances . ""
Every now and again , you find one of these arrows pointing downwards , and there I am on stage reading the damn poem ! "" he says .
"" I think the audio feature is really well done , and there is music with many of the poems too . ""
How does Dennis feel about apps more generally ?
He happily admits that he does n't carry a mobile device himself , describing this state as "" the last luxury in the 21st century "" , although he 's keen to stress that he keeps apace with new technology . ""
The reason I do n't carry a mobile phone is I do n't want people to know where I am ! ""
he laughs .
"" People think I 'm just an old Luddite , but that 's untrue .
I buy every new gizmo as it comes out , play with it until I understand how it works , and then give it away . ""
Dennis has strong views on the apps and mobile device market , though : specifically that the people making both tend to concentrate too much on younger , more tech - savvy people .
Dennis claims that even the "" very clever people "" working for his magazine company are unwilling to discuss this issue , but thinks there is a gaping hole in the market for someone willing to make a device aimed at older people .
"" If you want to make a fortune , produce a thing like the iPad , make it very light , and preload it with stuff that people over 65 and 70 years old want to see : web addresses , apps , anything you want , "" he says .
"" Make the buttons absolutely huge and only have a few of them , and put that on the market at 100 quid for people to buy their grandmothers .
You would sell millions !
My mother is 93 , and if there was an app on a machine that she could see properly showing all the houses that have been sold for 100 miles around , she 'd be on it night and day ...
"" There have been mobile phones aimed at older people , so it is surely only a matter of time before someone takes up Dennis ' challenge .
In the meantime , what about that magazine company with clever young people making apps ?
Dennis says that Dennis Publishing 's "" low - to - non existent debt "" and roster of lucrative brands is giving it the chance to experiment , building a team to build apps for some of its key titles .
He says that the car magazine Evo 's iPad app is doing well , while its technology - focused stablemate has been downloaded more than 200,000 times .
Dennis Publishing also launched Padder in July 2011 , which is described as "" an iPad magazine app for the iPad on the iPad about the iPad "" , which has so far published three issues available as in - app purchases .
Next up : an iOS app for The Week , one of the company 's most popular brands .
The app will be based on the print edition rather than its US website , and will be free to access for existing subscribers , with issues sold in - app to other people .
"" It 's a very beautiful thing , I 'm really interested to see how well it does , "" says Dennis .
"" It has taken us a long time to agree in a consensual way about what should be on this website , and what should be on the app .
I 'm not going to pretend it 's not been fraught , but we have a really great plan now . ""
Dennis is also enthusiastic about the way sponsorship will work within the app , but warns that it will reflect the same editorial - first attitude of the print edition of The Week . ""
If you pick up any issue of The Week , there are 35 pages of editorial every issue , and they only allow a certain number of pages of ads , "" says Dennis .
"" I do n't want to irritate my readers : it 's by far the most subscribed - to magazine in Britain in terms of paid subscriptions .
I 've always said that I love our advertisers and they 're very welcome to the party : but I 'm not throwing this party for them . ""
This interview took place before the release of the Viz Profanisaurus iPhone app , which went live on the App Store in early September .
At the time Apps Blog spoke to Dennis , the app was finished but had yet to be approved by Apple .
"" I know it 's going to be hugely popular , "" he says .
"" It 's not a dictionary , which is what everybody forgets .
It 's the longest - standing joke apart from Mornington Crescent , and it 's all made up by readers .
I think people are going to be getting this app out in the pub after they 've had a few drinks . ""
Apple 's approval of the app headed off the risk of a public argument with Dennis about censorship on its App Store , which in the context of his career so far , would certainly have been interesting to watch .
"" If they turn it down , then I 'm going to war , "" says Dennis .
"" There are laws in this country .
No one is going to argue that this is pornography …
"" Thankfully , Apple did n't argue that either .
The Profanisaurus app sailed through its approval process , as did Tales From The Woods ."
2011-09-21,"Apple is expected to introduce the next version of its iPhone on 4 October , when the new chief executive Tim Cook will demonstrate his grip on the company after having taken over from Steve Jobs in August .
The unveiling is also expected by many to include a simpler version of last year 's iPhone 4 – which has become the best - selling smartphone in the world since its launch in June 2010 – which will allow Apple to attack China 's huge market .
The expectation around the launch was heightened on Wednesday night when Al Gore , a member of Apple 's board , let slip while speaking in South Africa that "" new iPhones [ are ] coming out next month .
That was a plug . ""
Toby Shapstak , editor of Stuff magazine in South Africa , who was at the meeting where Gore spoke , told the Guardian : "" I listened to my voice recording , and he clearly said [ iPhones ] plural . ""
Cook 's appearance would be his first in public since he took over from Jobs , who has been on medical leave since January but fronted three public events for the company until his resignation .
Cook ran the company 's day - to - day operations during Jobs 's previous medical absences in 2004 and 2009 , and for the first half of this year .
He has been at Apple since 1998 and is credited with turning its manufacturing and supply operations around .
Apple did not return a request for comment ahead of publication .
Internet rumours have suggested that the new model will have a slightly larger screen than the existing iPhone 4 , and that it may include an NFC ( near field communication ) chip which would enable it to be used with payment services such as Google 's Wallet service , which launched in the US earlier this week .
That would allow it to compete with Google 's Nexus S phone , released at the end of December , which contains an NFC chip , and other forthcoming phones from handset makers .
News of the anticipated iPhone release , which was reported by John Paczkowski of the news website AllThingsD , helped push up Apple 's stock in early trading in New York , where it gained more than $ 7 ( £ 4.40 ) or 2 % , having already risen by 10 % compared to the Nasdaq index on which it is listed in the past week .
The launch is surrounded by secrecy , with component makers in the Far East who supply parts and assemble the new iPhone reluctant to leak any details about their work for fear of losing contracts with Apple .
Testimony in a recent court case in the US detailed how a Samsung employee gave details of screen sizes to US analysts ahead of the release of the iPad ; Apple cut Samsung 's contract soon afterwards .
Valued at $ 387.1bn , Apple is presently the biggest firm by market capitalisation on the US stock market , having swapped places with the previous largest , the oil company Exxon , since mid - August .
Expectation of a revised version of the iPhone , which is expected to be called the iPhone 5 , have been buzzing around the internet for months .
Analysts and observers also claim Apple will introduce a low - end smartphone to grab a wider market share from rival handset makers offering Google 's Android mobile operating system , which is now the best - selling mobile OS worldwide with around 40 % market share on new handsets .
Some speculation suggests Cook might unveil a "" phone "" which leaves out voice capabilities but includes 3 G data capabilities to replace its high - end iPod Touch , which presently has no phone capabilities but offers the other functionality of an iPhone , such as a touch screen and app downloads .
Programmers building apps for the forthcoming version of the iPhone software , iOS 5 , were warned on Sunday that Apple is wiping old backups made using test versions of that software on Thursday .
Many have taken that to mean a final version is imminent .
That is the software that will run on any revised iPhone , so the two would certainly be released at the same time .
About 24 m iPhones were sold in the second quarter of the year , making Apple the biggest seller of smartphones worldwide , ahead of Korea 's Samsung and Finland 's Nokia .
It is also the biggest mobile phone company both by revenue and profit , having passed the former leader Nokia there in the second quarter .

2011-09-22,"Meg Whitman faces a daunting task as she takes the job at one of world 's biggest technology companies .
The firm 's last three bosses have all left under a cloud .
Carly Fiorina clashed with the company 's beloved founding family and was dubbed the "" anti - Steve Jobs "" for all she did for HP .
Her successor , Mark Hurd , was axed amid scandal involving a former porn star and accusations of fiddling his expenses .
Léo Apotheker lasted 11 months and presided over a halving in the firm 's value .
The company 's board is reportedly so dysfunctional most of them did n't even interview Apotheker , they were too busy arguing .
Whitman , former boss of eBay , is set to take over from Apotheker immediately , the company announced today .
She has the advantage of being available as she is both a non - executive director of HP and failed to secure the last job she really wanted , the governorship of California , after spending a record $ 144 m on her campaign . ""
Meg is a technology visionary with a proven track record of execution .
She is a strong communicator who is customer focused with deep leadership capabilities , "" HP chairman Ray Lane said in a statement .
She is also a woman who , according to court documents , is referred to as "" Good Meg "" or "" Evil Meg "" by colleagues and who once ended up with a $ 200,000 legal bill after pushing over an underling in a meeting .
Margaret Cushing "" Meg "" Whitman , 55 , is a Harvard grad who cut her teeth in toyland .
She was in charge of Mr Potato Head among others at Hasbro and went on to work for Walt Disney before becoming one of Silicon Valley 's most successful executives .
She joined eBay , the online auction firm , in 1998 when it had just 30 employees and was instrumental in turning the firm into a global giant .
In the process she built a $ 1.3bn fortune and became one of the hottest tech executives in the valley .
She is also one of the more notorious .
Her career post - eBay has been patchy .
The auction giant has been at war with Craigslist , the free listing site , for a number of years .
In court documents it was revealed staff had dual nicknames for Whitman and that in her frustration with Craigslist brought out the "" monster "" .
It was n't the only time her aggressive side had been displayed .
Whitman once shoved a communications officer , a move that ended in a law suit and a reported $ 200,000 settlement .
And the California voters proved immune to her tactics .
With a total spend of $ 144 m , mostly of her own money , Whitman spent $ 43 for each of the 4,127,391 votes she received in the 2010 election , losing to Jerry Brown , who spent $ 36 m .
During the campaign it was revealed that Whitman herself had not voted for 28 years , a record she described as "" atrocious "" and had ruthlessly dumped her longtime housekeeper when it emerged she was an illegal alien - and consequently a political liability .
HP will be hoping they have hired eBay Meg not California Meg .
The knives are already out . ""
Worst politician ever to run worst tech company ever , "" said Gawker when she was appointed .
But for a woman who clearly relishes a challenge , perhaps HP is the next best thing to running California .
They 're both massive and maladjusted .
And if it all goes wrong she , can always put her stuff on eBay ."
2011-09-23,"CEO , Apple Inc Taking over from a charismatic and influential predecessor is never easy , but when that man is Steve Jobs , the pressure is of a different order .
It 's lucky , then , that Cook , named as Apple 's new CEO when Jobs stepped down unexpectedly in August , is known as a pretty unflappable sort of guy – added to which , he 's familiar enough with the territory , having joined Apple in 1998 as its chief operating officer .
And he 's certainly not afraid of hard work –
he likes to be up and emailing his colleagues by 4.30am and has been known to hold Sunday evening telephonic staff meetings to get everyone in the mood for the coming week .
But why should that catapult him from nowhere into the top 10 ?
Because even if you do n't yet own an iPad , or even an iPhone , Apple is going to revolutionise the way we read , not merely by diverting our eyes from printed page to handheld screen , but by changing the experience completely .
As publishers focus increasingly on value - added apps – such as Faber 's enhanced edition of The Waste Land , complete with video , performance and notes – our choice of devices becomes critical .
With its track record of human - friendly design , its vast marketing budget and its unparallelled management of brand loyalty , Apple is likely to lead the way ."
2011-09-27,"Apple will unveil the next - generation iPhone 5 on 4 October .
According to a typically cryptic invitation sent out to the media on Tuesday , Apple will host an iPhone event at its headquarters in San Francisco next week .
The event is expected to be Tim Cook 's first outing as chief executive since he took over from Steve Jobs on 25 August .
The unveiling is also expected by many to include a simpler version of last year 's iPhone 4 – which has become the best - selling smartphone in the world since its launch in June 2010 – which will allow Apple to attack China 's huge market .

Apple had not returned a request for comment ahead of publication ."
2011-09-27,"Amazon is set to join the tablet wars as it launches a rival to Apple 's best - selling iPad , a device that has made digital tombstones of all the competition so far .
The online retailer has released no details ahead of Wednesday 's press conference in New York , but the device is reportedly called Kindle Fire , to tie in with its existing ebook reader .
If the Fire does prove to be an iPad rival it will pitch the brainchildren of Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos , two of Silicon Valley 's most innovative tech giants , against each other in a battle analysts say will present the biggest challenge yet to Apple 's dominance of the tablet market .
With so little detail available Gartner analyst Michael Gartenberg said he was reluctant to speculate too much . ""
But it feels like something big is about to happen , "" he said .
Apple has increasingly encroached on Amazon 's business in recent years as its iTunes store has poached more music , movie and now books and magazine sales .
Amazon has been building its online presence , too , and entered the hardware business with the launch of Kindle .
The retailer is the biggest online books seller and the US 's second largest seller of music online after Apple 's iTunes , and it has been increasingly building up its online movies and TV sales and rentals business .
The company signed a deal with Fox this week that it said means it now offers more than 11,000 movies and TV shows available via its Amazon Prime service .
Amazon is also competing with Apple to offer a cloud - based media storage service that would allow customers to access anything they buy on any device connected to the internet .
Amazon has its own app store already and access to the purchasing habits of its millions of customers and their credit card accounts .
"" Amazon has tremendous reach .
That makes a huge difference , "" says Gartenberg .
The retailer has a very different approach to Apple , he said , but that is what may make them Apple 's biggest threat to date . ""
The Kindle for Amazon was about selling books and magazines .
Apple 's business is about selling devices .
You are looking at very different approaches , "" he said .
Amazon hopes its brand recognition and loyal book - buying customer base will enable it to do battle with Apple , which produced 75 % of the tablets sold this year .
Research firm Forrester reckons the Kindle tablet could sell between 3 m and 5 m units in its first year .
But for all Amazon 's muscle , Apple has so far proved a tough competitor .
Rival products from Dell , Hewlett Packard and Blackberry maker RIM have all bombed .
According to reports from technology website TechCrunch , the Kindle Fire looks like the BlackBerry PlayBook .
RIM said recently it had sold 200,000 of its PlayBooks in the last three months — about what Apple sells in three days .
TechCrunch says Kindle Fire will be a 7 in tablet with a $ 250 price tag .
The initial version will offer wireless functionality but no 3 G ; it will also have a USB port and speakers , but no camera .
A bigger , more expensive model will launch next year .
For Colin Gillis , analyst at of BGC Financial , the Kindle Fire sounds more iPod than iPad .
Its slimmed - down design sounds like it will be aimed a mass market of people who want a device to watch movies on , read books , listen to music and do n't need all the bells and whistles of a fully functioning iPad , he said .
The Kindle Fire is expected to receive a full release in the second week of November seeking to target the important Christmas market .
Apple , too , is said to be working on a new iPad for imminent release – and will be watching very carefully for any signs of new gaps in the market .
Gillis this to be a vicious fight . ""
The tablet is the new store front , "" he said .
Of all the tech giants to enter the tablet wars so far , Amazon is the one with the most to offer and the most to lose ."
2011-10-04,"Apple has broken into the list of the top 10 most valuable global brands for the first time , as the departure of founder Steve Jobs failed to dampen the meteoric rise of the iPhone and iPad maker .
Interbrand 's annual report , which assigns a dollar value to each brand based on factors such as financial performance and brand strength , marked Apple as the biggest riser in its 100-brand report with its value rising 58 % year on year to $ 33.5bn ( £ 21.8bn ) .
Apple , which displaced the troubled phone - maker Nokia which fell to 14th , is the only newcomer to Interbrand 's top 10 .
Overall technology brands dominated this year 's list with Google , which maintained fourth place , one of the biggest risers as its value soared 27 % to $ 55bn .
Google is now breathing down the neck of third - ranked Microsoft , which slipped 3 % to $ 59bn , as Bill Gates 's firm has all but given up what was once a value lead of tens of billions of dollars .
Overall seven of the top 10 brands – which include IBM and Intel – are technology companies , although Coca - Cola retained the title of world 's most valuable brand at $ 71.8bn .
For Apple , which is riding high on the success of products such as the iPad and with the iPhone 5 launching on Tuesday , this represents a jump from 17th last year to eighth in the current report .
It is the first time in the 12 years the report has been produced that Apple has made the top 10 . ""
Setting the bar high in its category and beyond , Apple is the icon for great branding meeting great technology , "" said Interbrand .
"" Consumers continue to follow its product launches with anticipation and are quick to integrate its sleek products into their lifestyles .
Steve Jobs 's recent resignation has the world curious about the impact on this innovative company as it is unclear how much of the brand 's success was due directly to Jobs 's own vision and control , and how much was due to his team . ""
"" Uncertainty is the new status quo , so today 's brands need to be quick and nimble , "" said Jez Frampton , global chief executive at Interbrand .
"" Consistency , relevance and commitment are imperative if a brand is to keep pace in our rapidly changing world . ""
Major risers for the year included Amazon.com , up 32 % in brand value to 26th at $ 12.7bn , thanks in large part to the success of the Kindle and sales of ebooks .
Interbrand said luxury brands showed resilience against the economic downturn with all companies in that category in the list – which includes Gucci , Louis Vuitton and Armani – reporting increases .
The biggest luxury brand winners were Cartier , up 18 % , and UK success story Burberry , which soared 20 % to $ 3.7bn .
The report praised Burberry 's "" impressive digital innovation "" and ability to "" stay ahead of trends and even set them "" and "" maintain a constant and positive presence in the media "" . ""
While luxury brands performed well across the board , Burberry bested them all by focusing on its core competencies in fashion , digital innovation and global expansion , "" the report said .
Major fallers include Nokia , down 15 % in value from eighth to 14th ; Sony , which fell 13 % from 34th to 35th in part because of the hacking of the PlayStation network ; Nintendo , which fell 14 % from 38th to 48th as it struggles to keep up with competitors ; and embattled Yahoo , which fell 11 % from 66th to 76th .

2011-10-05,
2011-10-05,"Apple 's latest iPhone launch is all about putting the product into as many hands as already hold iPods .
And to achieve this Tim Cook , officially handed the reins in August after Steve Jobs retired , has clearly decided he needs to let the iPhone become a little less premium .
The focus at Tuesday 's iPhone 4S launch was on price .
The oldest iPhone not to be discontinued , the 3GS , will now be free with a two - year contract .
The iPhone 4 range will be reduced to just one model , with a mere 8 GB of storage – the biggest 4S has 64 GB – but will cost just $ 99 on a two year tie - in .
The changes to Apple 's European smartphone market share for the first half of the year show why Cook needs a wider economic catchment .
Samsung is gaining ground and fast .
As Nokia committed hara - kiri by abandoning its Symbian operating system and letting its market share fall from over 40 % in the first quarter of 2010 to 11 % in the second quarter of 2011 , research by analyst IDC shows that Apple did not benefit .
Its share of sales fell from 25 % to 21 % .
Samsung 's rose from 2.5 % to overtake Apple , with 22 % .
HTC gained too , rising from 8 % to 14 % .
The east Asia contenders have allied their manufacturing expertise with Google 's programming power , using the Californian company 's Android operating system in an alliance that has dominated sales of mid range smart phones .
It 's hard to believe that Apple could be losing market share when so far this year it has sold 55 m iPhones , more than twice as many as it did in the first nine months of 2010 .
The speed at which smartphones are being adopted can , as BlackBerry maker Research in Motion 's sudden fall from grace has shown , make or break even the biggest of players in a handful of quarters .
Including new numbers from Tuesday , there have been about 325 m individual iPods sold around the world since 2002 .
According to Apple 's third - quarter results , 129 m iPhones have been put into consumers ' hands since 2007 .
So Apple will need to sell 200 m more phones if they are to reach as wide a public as the music players .
No rival ever really matched Apple on the iPod , and the market for MP3 players remained its own .
That has never quite been the case with smartphones , thanks mostly to Google 's intervention .
Differences in the quality of the products are beginning to melt away .
Microsoft has yet to launch its updated phone operating system , dubbed Mango , in a big way .
It is awaiting new handsets from Nokia on which to show it off .
But as an early user , on an HTC handset , I believe it will raise the bar .
Jobs used to rightly deride Microsoft products for poor aesthetics and clunky usability .
Mango 's graphic design , the deep integration of popular tools such as Facebook and Twitter , and its ease of navigation make the iPhone 4 look out of date .
Sales of the iPod have already begun a double - digit decline .
It is nearing the beginning of the end of its life cycle .
Apple sold 20 % fewer in its third quarter than in the same period last year .
Cannibalising iPod Touch sales with a cheaper smartphone is a risk that must now be taken .
While hardcore Apple addicts may be disappointed at the lack of a handset called iPhone 5 , Cook has picked the right time to address a wider audience ."
2011-10-06,"Steve Jobs , the Apple founder and former CEO who invented gadgets that transformed everyday technology from the personal computer to the iPod and iPhone , has died .
He was 56 .
Apple company statement
We are deeply saddened to announce that Steve Jobs passed away today .
Steve 's brilliance , passion and energy were the source of countless innovations that enrich and improve all of our lives .
The world is immeasurably better because of Steve .
Jobs family statement Steve died peacefully today surrounded by his family .
In his public life , Steve was known as a visionary ; in his private life , he cherished his family .
We are thankful to the many people who have shared their wishes and prayers during the last year of Steve 's illness ; a website will be provided for those who wish to offer tributes and memories .
Tim Cook , Apple CEO Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius , and the world has lost an amazing human being .
Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor .
Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built , and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple .
We are planning a celebration of Steve 's extraordinary life for Apple employees that will take place soon .
No words can adequately express our sadness at Steve 's death or our gratitude for the opportunity to work with him .
We will honor his memory by dedicating ourselves to continuing the work he loved so much .
Bill Gates , former chief executive of Microsoft
The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had , the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come .
For those of us lucky enough to get to work with him , it 's been an insanely great honor .
I will miss Steve immensely .
Mark Zuckerberg , CEO of Facebook Steve , thank you for being a mentor and a friend .
Thanks for showing that what you build can change the world .
I will miss you .
Larry Page , Google co - founder I am very , very sad to hear the news about Steve .
He was a great man with incredible achievements and amazing brilliance .
He always seemed to be able to say in very few words what you actually should have been thinking before you thought it .
His focus on the user experience above all else has always been an inspiration to me .
He was very kind to reach out to me as I became CEO of Google and spend time offering his advice and knowledge even though he was not at all well .
President Barack Obama Michelle and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Steve Jobs .
Steve was among the greatest of American innovators brave enough to think differently , bold enough to believe he could change the world and talented enough to do it .
By building one of the planet 's most successful companies from his garage , he exemplified the spirit of American ingenuity .
By making computers personal and putting the Internet in our pockets , he made the information revolution not only accessible , but intuitive and fun .
And by turning his talents to storytelling , he has brought joy to millions of children and grown - ups alike .
Steve was fond of saying that he lived every day like it was his last .
Because he did , he transformed our lives , redefined entire industries and achieved one of the rarest feats in human history :
He changed the way each of us sees the world .
The world has lost a visionary .
And there may be no greater tribute to Steve 's success than the fact that much of the world learned of his passing on a device he invented .
Michael Bloomberg , New York mayor
Tonight , America lost a genius who will be remembered with Edison and Einstein , and whose ideas will shape the world for generations to come .
Again and again over the last four decades , Steve Jobs saw the future and brought it to life long before most people could even see the horizon .
In New York City 's government , everyone from street construction inspectors to NYPD detectives have harnessed Apple 's products to do their jobs more efficiently and intuitively .
Bob Iger , chief executive , Walt Disney
His legacy will extend far beyond the products he created or the businesses he built .
It will be the millions of people he inspired , the lives he changed , and the culture he defined .
Steve was such an ' original , ' with a thoroughly creative , imaginative mind that defined an era .
Despite all he accomplished , it feels like he was just getting started .

Your vision will not be forgotten .
Norman Foster , architect With my colleagues
I would like to pay tribute to Steve Jobs .
Like so many millions our lives have been profoundly and positively influenced by the innovations pioneered by Steve and Apple , names which are inseparable .
We were greatly privileged to know Steve as a person , as a friend and in every way so much more than a client .
Steve was an inspiration and a role model .
He encouraged us to develop new ways of looking at design to reflect his unique ability to weave backwards and forwards between brand strategy and the minutiae of the tiniest of internal fittings .
For him no detail was small in its significance and he would be simultaneously questioning the headlines of our project together whilst he delved into its fine print .
He was the ultimate perfectionist and demanded of himself as he demanded of others .
We are better as individuals and certainly wiser as architects through the experience of the last two years and more of working for him .
His participation was so intense and creative that our memory will be that of working with one of the truly great designers and mentors ."
2011-10-06,"The precise nature of Steve Jobs 's influence on the early 21st century will be a fruitful vein of debate for years to come .
One of the more interesting questions is whether he really was a genius without whom the Macintosh , and then the iPod , the iPhone and the iPad , would never have existed â€ “ and Pixar would never have prospered â€ “ or whether ( as John Naughton discussed when Jobs retired in August ) he was a Napoleon , a man whose greatest invention was himself .
There is a persuasive case to be made for the second argument .
Jobs did reinvent the role of CEO as messiah , a man of such charismatic individuality that he could make the anonymity of his black turtleneck and black jeans into a brand as universally recognisable as his products .
The Napoleon argument rests on the Tolstoyan claim that Napoleon 's greatness was in fact a role imposed upon him by the faith of his generals , a part he had merely to act .
In the same way , it 's said , the Steve Jobs legend rests on the tireless creativity of the 50,000 Apple employees who laboured over the features that marked out each successive act of genius : his contribution was in the sales , not the substance .
It is unquestionably true that Jobs 's first skill was his capacity to persuade : the ability to create what was called at first unkindly and then admiringly a "" reality distortion field "" .
But no one would suppose the monumental self - belief that had him blagging microchips from HP as a teenager was all there was .
As one obituarist notes , he turned the reality distortion field into reality .
And that was about more than the fanatical attention to detail , the relentless pursuit of excellence and the obsessive passion for design by which he will also be remembered .
Other people had seen that the digital age was not , or not only , an incremental technological advance but in fact an opening to another reality .
Jobs ' contribution was to see that it could be a world to which everyone had access , and then to make it happen .
Apple products were not office tools , they were instruments of fun :
what you would expect an ex - hippy to want in his own coat pocket .
He reimagined the technology as a high street product , and then , as Alain de Botton observed , remoulded our sense of what we need in order to be happy .
Early admirers argued latterly that his very success had become a betrayal of both his own and the internet 's original genius .
The astonishing creative chaos of the first digital age was , like any other technology in history , falling prey to the controlling greed of its early innovators .
In Apple 's products Jobs had created not so much a unique combination of art and utility but rather the perfect vehicle for commercial ambition .
That , though , would not have been by accident ."
2011-10-06,"In the last 24 hours Steve Jobs has been credited with changing the way we live , the way we view technology , the way we listen to music , the way we communicate , the way we think about art , design and invention , and much , much more .
But I think the biggest change he has made is to the way both its critics and cheerleaders think about capitalism .
Take the old adage that the consumer is king .
In some ways , this is as true for Apple as it is for anyone else .
It stands or falls on the basis of whether people will buy its stuff .
But Jobs 's success was built firmly on the idea that in another sense , you should not give consumers what they want because they do n't know what they want .
No one thought they wanted the first desktop Mac , iPod , iPhone or iPad before they existed .
Jobs repeatedly created things that people came to want more than anything else only by not trying to give them what they already wanted .
This challenges the idea that consumer culture inevitably means pandering to the conventional , to the lowest common denominator .
Markets are not necessarily conservative : truly great innovations can become popular .
Jobs has also provided the clearest evidence yet that excellence comes at a cost .
Against both the optimistic open - source movement that thinks all good things can be made collaboratively for free , and the race - to - the - bottom chains that believe the answer is always to be the cheapest , Jobs showed that you could , and must , charge a premium price for a premium product .
Far from condemning his company to a niche , by following this principle , Apple actually became , briefly , the biggest company in the world .
The lesson has still to be taken on board elsewhere .
In news and broadcasting , for example , we are all learning that you ca n't sustain quality by giving things away .
It 's not just about cost , however .
Jobs was unpopular for the way in which he tightly controlled Apple 's copyrights , refused to license to third parties and tied his devices to his own suppliers of content .
This was seen as undemocratic , demagogic even .
But whether or not he was always right , his success shows that there is something to the idea that true excellence often requires tight control .
It 's the principle that guides the best restaurant kitchens , the best production lines and even many of the best films , plays or dance productions .
Jobs should have killed the idea that everything works better if it 's open , collaborative and non - judgmental .
Jobs also made multinational brands respectable .
Many people who moan about the "" designer label "" culture and think that all multinational companies are evil love their Macs and iStuff to the point of being evangelical bores about them .
They might claim this is n't brand loyalty , it 's just enthusiasm for great gadgets .
But this is really only to make clear that the genuinely good brands have products of substance behind them .
The brands we should despise are those that could be pasted to pretty much any product without anyone noticing .
The ones we admire are those whose name we have learned tell us something reliable about what they produce .
But perhaps the most important way in which Jobs has made us rethink capitalism is shown by the very fact that we 're talking about how he has changed anything at all .
Just as some have claimed that the "" big man "" idea of history is as old - fashioned as its gender - specific name suggests , so people in business have been demoted in importance beneath impersonal "" market forces "" .
On this view , the dynamic efficiency of the free market means that every last bit of potential for increased efficiency and profit will be squeezed , not by design , but by the invisible hand of every business doing what is best for itself .
So had Jobs not given us the iPad , someone else would have .
Maybe not exactly the same , maybe not at just that time , but pretty much the same kind of product , and sooner rather than later .
You might think that if business truly believed this , it would have no reason to pay its own men and women quite so much for their all - too - dispensable contributions .
In fact , all the more reason to pay them : given that it is inevitable that gaps in the market will be filled , you want to make sure it 's your business that fills them .
No , the real flaw with this way of thinking assumes that the market will both throw up all the variety of products and businesses imaginable and , by a kind of natural selection , the best and most profitable will survive and thrive .
But the evolutionary analogy does n't hold .
Nature needs aeons of time for random mutation to produce and test every possibility .
Thankfully , human innovation can work quicker , because it 's not random at all .
And it 's because the market does n't automatically generate all the good ideas that individuals really can change the game .
Some ideas are so crazy no one ever has them ; some so apparently crazy everyone ignores them and only the genius can see they 're made of gold .
Yes , without Steve Jobs we probably would still have got MP3 players , smartphones , laptops that look cool and little tablet computers .
But we ca n't say with confidence when we would have got them
, how good they would have been and how dominant they would have become .
We had cheap portable netbooks and tablet devices before the iPad came out , for example .
But they had limited appeal , limited functionality and were languishing as niche products .
What Jobs and his team did was to come up with a new type of device that really took off .
And when it did , it was a game - changer .
So Jobs is actually exhibit A in any case against the idea that the market is maximally efficient and can be left to take care of things by itself .
A slap in the face to free - market fundamentalists , but hardly comfort to anti - capitalists either .
Jobs does n't show that capitalism is a flawed system , only that it is not perfectly self - regulating .
For all these reasons , capitalism looks different because of what Jobs 's company achieved .
His company challenges both lazy market orthodoxies and idealistic anti - capitalist critiques .
In general terms it is true that all these challenges have found voice and expression in our culture elsewhere .
But with Jobs they were given a clearer , louder expression , backed up by the incontrovertible evidence his life and company produced .
The world may well have been different without Jobs : not so far forward as we are , less beautiful , more in tune with the lowest common denominator .
If we found ourselves in that world right now , of course , we would recognise it .
But we might not love it quite so much ."
2011-10-06,"The bunches of flowers began arriving outside Apple stores as morning broke around the world : a potent symbol of the extraordinary outpouring of emotion that greeted the death of Steve Jobs , the co - founder of Apple Inc.
His death was announced by his family late in the afternoon on the Californian west coast where he lived most of his life .
"" It 's a dark day in Silicon Valley , "" Matt Drance , a former Apple employee , remarked in an email .
Anyone who thought that technologists could n't be moved to tears would soon realise , from the tributes on Twitter and Facebook , that Jobs , who died at 56 from cancer which he had held at bay for eight years , had inspired the strongest feelings .
In Beijing a steady stream of mourners and admirers made their way to lay flowers and light candles at the Apple Store .
One corner of the ground floor had been turned into a shrine of sorts with photographs of Steve Jobs , bouquets and messages : "" You have enriched our lives .
Thank you for changing the world , "" said one in English . ""
Go in peace .
We love you , "" said another .
It seemed as though there was n't anyone who had n't somehow been touched by his work .
The tributes came from everywhere .
President Obama called him visionary and said "" he exemplified the spirit of American ingenuity "" and that "" he transformed our lives , redefined entire industries , and achieved one of the rarest feats in human history : he changed the way each of us sees the world . ""
Bill Gates , his longtime rival but also friend â€ “ born , like Jobs , in 1955 â€ “ said that "" the world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had , the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come â€ ¦ I will miss Steve immensely .
"" The fact is that for multiple businesses â€ “ computing , film , music , mobile telephony and most recently mobile computing â€ “ Jobs overturned the existing order .
Again and again he refused to go along with the conventional wisdom , and introduced his own instead .
He lived his life by the instruction he gave in a commencement address to Stanford graduates : "" Do n't let the noise of others ' opinions drown out your own inner voice , "" urging them to keep innocently seeking the new : "" Stay hungry .
Stay foolish . ""
Jobs , though , came across as anything but foolish .
He was often described as a tyrant able to throw a "" reality distortion field "" around his immediate area , to make people believe anything that he told them .
The reality was simpler , but harder for technologists used to comparing numbers to understand .
Jobs was a brilliant negotiator who had the rare ability to visualise exactly what other people â€ “ whether singly across a table or by the thousand in an auditorium or by the million in homes and businesses â€ “ wanted .
He could frame a price negotiation or a product launch to get the maximum benefit at the minimum risk .
The single occasion on which he did this best was in 1996 , when he had recently rejoined Apple ( the company he co - founded in 1976 )
â€ “ which was on its knees .
The management had lost a billion dollars in the previous 12 months .
Jobs knew that it was 90 days from bankruptcy .
So he flew north to Redmond to see Gates at Microsoft â€ “ which was infringing a number of Apple patents .
He needed investment , but being confrontational would just make Gates , then richest man in the world , obstinate â€ “ and Apple would have to turn the lights out .
Jobs instead turned the discussion into one where the two companies had a common purpose , in computing : "" Bill , "" he told his old friend and rival , "" between us , we own 100 % of the desktop ! ""
Gates was n't fooled â€ “
he knew that Microsoft had 95 % and Apple 5 % â€ “ but even so was won over .
Microsoft bought $ 150 m of non - voting stock ; Apple was saved .
Gates observed afterwards : "" That guy is so amazing .
He is a master at selling , "" recounts Alan Deutschman in his book
The Second Coming of Steve Jobs .
( Had Microsoft held on to the stock , it would today be worth 130 times more than Gates paid , or $ 19bn
â€ “ about a tenth of Microsoft 's present market value . )
Jobs could be ruthless .
He fired people who let information slip before an event and spoiled the surprise .
He was unforgiving of failure : when Apple 's first effort at a "" cloud "" service MobileMe suffered flaws in its early weeks he called the team together into a hall and excoriated them for half an hour .
Chuq von Rospach , who worked at the company until 2009 ( though not on that project ) , characterised it as : "" Imagine Steve walking up and down the corridors with a flamethrower , stopping people at random and saying ' Do you work on MobileMe ?
How about you ? '
"" Yet for all the claims of tyrannical behaviour , Jobs also kept staff fiercely loyal .
Former employees speak of their devotion to their company with something approaching amazement ; they sound almost surprised at how hard they worked and how demanding Jobs was .
Yet the staff at the top of the company have stayed almost unchanged since he returned there at the end of 1996 , taking over the reins in 1997 .
Tim Cook , now chief executive ; Phil Schiller , head of marketing ; Jonathan I ve , head of design .
The core of Apple 's functionality flows from them .
His beginnings were inauspicious .
Jobs was the adopted child of a university lecturer and a student ( he was a quarter Syrian ) raised by working parents who could barely scrape together the money to send him to college .
When he did go to Reed College he soon dropped out , but stayed behind and studied calligraphy and typography â€ “ which would later feed into the products whose design he would oversee in microscopic detail .
The first time he overturned the way the world worked was in 1984 .
In 1979 , three years after setting up Apple with Steve Wozniak , Jobs had visited Xerox 's Palo Alto Research Centre in California and saw its experimental system which used "" windows "" and a "" mouse "" â€ “ an insane idea at a time when all other computers ( including Apple 's ) communicated via blinking cursors into which you fed obscure commands such as CP :
A :
B : , rather than by manipulating virtual objects on a screen .
"" It was n't complete , "" he told Wired magazine later .
"" It was n't quite right .
But within 10 minutes , it was obvious that every computer in the world would work this way someday .
And you could argue about the number of years it would take , and you could argue about who would be the winners and the losers , but I do n't think you could argue that every computer in the world would n't eventually work this way .
"" Jobs licensed the system from Xerox ( which took payment in Apple stock ) and oversaw the development of computers using the new "" windowing "" system .
The first was called Lisa , after his daughter ; the next , the Macintosh , which went on sale in 1984 , aimed to make windows ubiquitous .
Jobs also wanted it to be as simple to use , and as closed - in , as a washing machine or other domestic appliance .
Computers , he felt , were just too complicated .
Using window systems was much easier .
Microsoft agreed , licensed and then extended the idea , and while Jobs wrangled with John Sculley â€ “ hired from his presidency of Pepsi with the immortal line "" do you want to sell sugared water for the rest of your life , or do you want a chance to change the world ? ""
â€ “ Bill Gates extended the idea of windows to Windows , which rapidly overtook Apple 's products and the most widely used desktop computer operating system in the world .
Jobs was kicked out of Apple in 1985 , and over the next 12 years Microsoft infiltrated and then took over personal computing .
All the computers used windows â€ “ in some form .
Jobs had been right .
His next target was the film business .
Pixar , the company that he bought from George Lucas ( who was selling it as part of a divorce settlement ) in 1986 , is a classic "" people business "" : the talent walks out of the door every day .
It was also cutting - edge , making films entirely with computers â€ “ actors , pictures , everything .
Jobs was able to keep John Lasseter and other key staff working there through thick and thin .
But it was his negotiation genius that pulled off the deal getting Disney , the most powerful force in film , to distribute Pixar 's first production , Toy Story â€ “ the first feature - length computer - animated film .
Pixar never had a flop as an independent company ; Disney bought it in January 2006 for $ 7.4bn
( it was stock in Pixar , rather than Apple , which made Jobs a billionaire ) .
At Pixar , Jobs discovered the importance of managing people .
He rehoused it at great expense
â€ “ personally designing the building with all the toilets in a central location so people would meet there , mix and keep the creative juices flowing .
On returning to Apple ( which bought his other post - Apple business NeXT in 1996 ) , Jobs quickly took over and installed himself as "" interim CEO "" in 1997 .
From NeXT and Pixar he had learnt the harsh lesson of inventory management â€ “ keeping projects under control â€ “ and the finesse of recruiting the right person .
Tim Cook â€ “ now chief executive â€ “ may have been the most important single hire he ever made .
Cook turned Apple from a bloated manufacturer into a slick one which had less stock tied up in warehouses than its bitter rival Dell .
But as he nursed Apple back to health , the music business â€ “ one of his oldest
loves â€
“ came into his sights .
With online file - sharing rampant and revenues crashing record labels needed a saviour .
It came in the unlikely form of a cigarette packet - sized white - and - silver object .
And so Jobs changed the world again .
The iPod was initially conceived by a team led by then chief of hardware Jon Rubinstein , as a way to get more people buying Apple 's Macintosh computers .
Jobs drove its designers to distraction , again , and even on the day before the product 's launch was complaining that the "" click "" when he put headphones into the prototypes on display was n't satisfying .
( An engineer had to polish the sockets by hand . )
But the iPod changed everything , first because of its tiny size â€ “ with 1,000 songs in svelte enclosure â€ “ and for its simple , quick synchronisation .
There were already music players , but they were bulky , had horrible software , and would take five hours to transfer 1,000 songs .
The iPod would take 10 minutes .
Then Jobs pulled off yet another audacious negotiation , and another revolution : persuading the record labels to let him sell music digitally .
He did this by playing on Apple 's tiny size : with the iPod still limited to Apple computers , making only 5 % of the market , he persuaded them that there was little risk if anything went wrong .
The labels reckoned they could license their music to someone else if it went right . ""
Apple 's target , believe it or not , was to sell 1 million songs in the first year ,
"" the journalist Robert X Cringely â€ “ aka
Mark Stephens â€
“ told me earlier this year .
When the iTunes Music Store opened in April 2003 it sold the first million songs in a week .
Within a few months it was unstoppable , and Jobs created a version of Apple 's iTunes software for Windows which accelerated it .
Within a year it had sold nearly 100 m songs , and the iPod had 70 % of the music player market .
But it was the design of the iPod â€ “ small , appliance - like , simple â€ “ that most struck people .
Jobs had insisted that it should be able to get to any song within three clicks .
Design , as he explained in 2000 , was n't about how it looked .
It was about how it worked . ""
In most people 's vocabularies , design means veneer .
It 's interior decorating .
It 's the fabric of the curtains and the sofa .
But to me , nothing could be further from the meaning of design .
Design is the fundamental soul of a man - made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service . ""
In 2006 Microsoft tried to imitate it with the Zune â€ “ coloured brown .
It was a flop .
Computers ?
Film ?
Music ?
Now Jobs had one of the biggest businesses , the booming mobile industry , in his sights .
The iPhone was the result of a two - and - a - half year project to use touchscreens to manipulate a computer .
"" We have been very lucky to have brought a few revolutionary user interfaces to the market â€ “ the mouse , the click wheel [ on the iPod ] , and now multi - touch , "" he said in January 2007 .
"" Each has made possible a revolutionary product â€ “ the Mac , the iPod , and now the iPhone .
Today we 're going to show you a software breakthrough .
Software that 's at least five years ahead of what 's on any other phone .
"" Not only was the phone different ; Jobs also beat the mobile operators , formerly the rulers of the business , and used Apple 's growing brand power to drive deals which offered iPhone owners unlimited data .
After the iPhone , everyone needed a touch screen : Google , and then Microsoft , and then market leaders Nokia and RIM followed suit as quickly as they could .
But not fast enough : in mid-2011 Apple became the world 's biggest mobile phone maker by revenue , an idea that would have been nonsensical four years earlier .
Jobs 's revolutions were coming faster and faster .
For Drance , then working at Apple trying to recruit outside developers to write Mac software , the unveiling of the iPhone was a stunning moment : an internal project that had run for two and a half years , yet he had n't heard about it ?
"" There 's a competitive thing to Apple 's secrecy , because you want to keep competitors guessing .
But also Apple has built so much around the event , around the reveal , the announcement , and you really lose the magic if people know what 's coming ; if people know what 's behind the curtain , it 's not as magical an event . ""
The final candidate for disruption ?
Computing , once again .
Though Bill Gates introduced tablet computers in 2001 , they went nowhere â€ “ but Apple took them up as a research project , and dusted them off for the January 2010 launch of the iPad .
A computer you could carry , operated by touch , with a 10-hour battery life , that ran on "" apps
"" â€ “ none of it was like the past .
And Apple sold them by the tens of millions , while would - be rivals struggled .
"" Our competitors are looking at this [ tablet market ] like it 's the next PC market .
That is not the right approach to this .
These are post - PC devices that need to be easier to use than a PC , more intuitive , "" he said , pacing the stage in one of his last public appearances in March . ""
The hardware and software need to intertwine more than they do on a PC .
We think we 're on the right path with this . ""
The iPad is changing how people work and play ; newspapers and magazines are desperate to find ways onto it and to make money .
The latest forecasts suggest Apple will dominate the market at least until 2014 â€ “ even with Microsoft , which as in the mobile market and music player market , is following its lead with a new iPad - like "" Metro "" interface for its next version of Windows , due next year .
All the devices had one crucial thing in common : people fell in love with them .
They felt passionately about them , in a way the world had never seen before .
"" Touch is a very important sense ; a lot of human emotion is built around touching objects , other people , touching things , "" Don Norman , co - founder of Neilsen / Norman Group , said .
"" I think that we 've lost something really big when we went to the abstraction of a computer with a mouse and a keyboard , it was n't real , and the telephone was the same , it was this bunch of menus and people got lost in the menus and buttons to push and it felt like a piece of technology .
Whereas the iPhone felt like a piece of delight .
It really is neat to go from one page to the other not by pushing a button but by swiping your hand across the page â€ ¦ it is more intimate .
Think of it not as a swipe , think of it as a caress . ""
The one challenge Jobs could n't beat was life 's finite span .
"" No one wants to die , "" Jobs told the Stanford graduates in 2005 .
"" Even people who want to go to heaven do n't want to die to get there .
And yet death is the destination we all share .
No one has ever escaped it .
And that is as it should be , because death is very likely the single best invention of life .
It is Life 's change agent . ""
The cancer that eventually killed him was initially diagnosed in October 2003 .
At first , the doctors thought it was pancreatic cancer â€ “ which typically kills in six to 12 months .
"" My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order , which is doctor 's code for prepare to die . ""
But it was neuroendocrine cancer , a more treatable form .
Yet â€ “ ironically for someone working in a company working on the most advanced engineering â€ “ Jobs , a lifelong pescatarian ( eating fish and vegetables ) did n't seek medical intervention until summer 2004 .
That seemed to have quelled the problem â€ “ but in 2009 he needed a liver transplant , and the immunosuppressant drugs required appear to have let the cancer back .
In January 2011 he took extended medical leave from the company he had co - founded , saying plaintively in his departure note "" I love Apple so much "" .
The questions now will turn to Apple , and its future â€ “ though they are exactly the same as those which were posed when Jobs stepped aside , finally acknowledging his illness , in August .
Can it be the same creative force without him ?
Can those in charge find new industries to revolutionise , in the way that Jobs did with personal computing , films , music , telephony and most recently newspaper and magazine reading through the iPad ?
Put like that , it is the tallest of tall orders ; in retrospect it seems amazing that it happened at all .
Much may depend on whether those inside the company can stay true to Jobs 's parting advice to the Stanford graduates .
"" Stay hungry , "" he said .
"" Stay foolish . ""

2011-10-06,"The sharp , bright screen of the iPad , the last marvel with which Steve Jobs dazzled the world , may be seductive , but few would argue that typing on its virtual screen is the most practical way to produce work .
Yet I have been writing articles with it for months now .
Why ?
I could give all kinds of practical reasons , but they would be lies .
The truth is that I am captivated by the beauty of this piece of technology .
My feelings about this particular Apple creation are , to be honest , quite bonkers .
I have never felt this way about a piece of machinery before . ""
Machinery "" ?
That seems inappropriate , like calling Michelangelo 's David a hunk of stone .
The exquisite luxury of the iPad grows out of a tradition of Apple design that has repeatedly reshaped modern culture .
This is one reason why Apple products are favoured by those who work in the arts and humanities â€ “
they look great .
The other reason , of course , is that they are damn easy to use .
But it is the aesthetic originality of Apple that has reshaped the way we live in the modern world .
The first Apple computer in our household was a Mac Classic , and at the time , its smooth whitish box with a big colourful Apple logo on the side seemed gloriously futuristic â€ “ and yet , not in the least bit techno .
This was what was revolutionary about Apple , this soft - machine aesthetic .
If you want to know how Apple remade the look of the future think of Gary Numan .
In the early 1980s Numan 's jerky robotic persona and image of an alienated future where everyone sits sealed in cars was state of the art .
This was how the techno age would look , once Alan Sugar took the Amstrad to the next level .
Nowadays Numan is retro , as are all such silvery glimpses of an icy future , for Apple changed the way history was headed when it created machines that , instead of chilling you out , glow like fireplaces and nuzzle like digital pets .
Soft lines , not sharp ones , define the Apple aesthetic .
Even its glossiest and sleekest metal - cased laptops or giant screens have rounded corners .
The Apple logo in itself , at once natural in its associations and reassuringly warm when it glows on the cover of your laptop , is round and curvy .
The way light is used â€ “ pale and silvery , it tells you the laptop is coming alive â€ “ communicates a living , continuous technological presence , friendly and nurturing .
When Apple launched the iMac in 1998 , the first personal computer to be hailed as a design classic , its style took a bold twist .
The blue or orange or purple translucent shells of these machines , tapering to a round rear casing , invented a new kind of futurism â€ “ organic , softly moulded , cheekily colourful .
This was a computer for a bubble house .
It proved ephemeral ( I had one for a while ) , but it showed how gorgeous a domestic design can be .
Since then , everything from kitchen tools with chunky plastic handles in crazy shapes to Doctor
Who 's
Tardis have imitated the pleasantly contoured future of Apple .
It has inspired pod - like structures in architecture and touch - sensitive , slim - screened home entertainment devices although , in truth , I have yet to see the TV or contemporary building that portrays the future as brightly as an iPad .
The real achievement of Apple goes to the very heart of aesthetics and the loftiest ideals of design .
In the 19th century , radical critics of industry such as John Ruskin and William Morris denounced the grim , turgid , pretentious objects that cluttered Victorian homes .
Good design , they argued , was a moral duty , and a world in which ugliness ruled must be profoundly wrong in its social order .
Apple conveys this message in a relaxed , west coast way .
In our age , the power of the internet might seem to lead away from the physical , real , human world , into a dystopia of lost souls staring into screens .
The real brilliance of Apple is to make digital culture human , and to keep it in the swim of life .
The rise of the Apple aesthetic went along with the rise of coffee shops , the idea that work and leisure can combine in new ways .
The iPod , the iPhone , the iPad : none of them are designed to keep you at home , addicted to the virtual .
They are made to be carried about , used in cafes and on the bus , wherever you happen to be .
Perhaps the greatest insight of Steve Jobs , when it came to design , was that the most beautiful , marvellous creation on earth is not the computer , but the person using it .
The Apple aesthetic is profoundly humanist â€ “ and in this sense it has truly made the world a better place .
Will there be an Apple robot one day , and will it be called an iRobot ?
Much as Isaac Asimov might have enjoyed that , the dark warnings of science fiction writers like him seem to melt away when you fall in love with Apple .
There seem many reasons right now to fear the future .
But when I survey the latest troubling news on the magic screen of the iPad , somehow I am not afraid .
Right here in my hand is the proof we can make it ."

2011-10-06,"When historians look back at the life of Steve Jobs , they will chronicle a man of contradiction and genius .
But for the legions of Apple fans , it 's personal .
Steve Jobs led a company that became one of the world 's most valuable enterprises , and easily the most beloved by its customers , with a series of innovative and always elegant products that brought value and pleasure to people 's lives .
This is why you are seeing an outpouring of genuine sentiment at his passing .
Jobs 's career was in every sense astonishing .
He helped create Apple , the first serious personal computer company .
He was banished by the managers he recruited .
But his years away were hardly a wilderness .
He led Pixar 's ascent to one of the world 's most creative film studios as it revolutionised animation , and he founded a "" failure "" , NeXT , that became the foundation for the modern Mac operating system .
Those years gave him the knowledge and skills he needed to lead Apple into its best years .
But what set him most apart from his peers was an exquisite sense of product design and the ability to intuit what people would want , and use .
Combined with his leadership ( and salesmanship ) skills , he was the most formidable CEO of recent times .
I 've been a fan and follower of the Apple way , especially when it was by far the best alternative to the Microsoft empire â€ “ and when it was the best in class , period .
I bought my first Apple product in the 1970s .
But in the past half - decade , as Apple became increasingly powerful , I have found myself less enchanted with a company I 'd supported with my words and , ultimately , tens of thousands of dollars of my own money .
Where Steve Jobs had been the freedom fighter , he was becoming the emperor , creating a regime of secrecy , manipulation and control - freakery to accompany the ongoing , even accelerating , innovation .
My respect â€ “ no , awe â€ “ for Jobs 's genius has only grown , but I could n't ultimately follow him into a walled garden , however comfortable , that contradicted what I believed in , and what he once stood for .
I was no longer his kind of customer , though ; he aimed now for the masses who preferred to live in Apple 's warm but controlling embrace , and he succeeded .
The competition has n't yet matched Apple 's marriage of hardware and software , so elegant , easy to use and playful .
But the sense of style that Apple made so popular increasingly permeates the electronic devices we use today , no matter who makes them , and that trend seems likely to continue .
That is one reason why Apple 's long - range transition looks murky .
The company 's technical and design people are phenomenal â€ “ Jobs built an unequalled team â€ “ and his successor as CEO , Tim Cook , has built one of the world 's sleekest operational juggernauts .
What is in the product pipeline will no doubt maintain the momentum for at least several years .
But for almost a decade and a half , this redoubtable team has deferred on the most essential decisions to the design sensibility of Steve Jobs .
Now he is gone .
Every such decision in years to come â€ “ the most crucial choices any consumer - products company makes â€ “ will be accompanied a frisson of doubt .
Everyone will ask , would Steve have made this particular choice ?
And no one will know for sure .
As I write this , Apple 's homepage is poignant and just right .
It is a photo of Jobs in his recent prime , after coming back to Apple but before the illness that consumed him .
In the photo , he is looking into the camera with utter assurance , and with a hint of mischief .
Today , I sent an email to my students .
In that email , and from my social networks , I linked to a video of a powerful commencement speech Jobs gave at Stanford University a few years ago .
The power went beyond his genius as a product wizard , pitchman and CEO , illuminating a man who 'd listened , learned and led .
What he told the graduating students may be Steve Jobs 's best legacy .
Here is one part we all should remember : Your time is limited , so do n't waste it living someone else 's life .
Do n't be trapped by dogma , which is living with the results of other people 's thinking .
Do n't let the noise of others ' opinions drown out your own inner voice .
And most important , have the courage to follow your heart and intuition .
They somehow already know what you truly want to become .
Everything else is secondary ."

2011-10-06,"I wrote this just a few weeks ago when Steve Jobs announced he was quitting Apple : "" The Macintosh turned out so well , "" Jobs , who resigned as the CEO of Apple last night , once told the New York Times , "" because the people working on it were musicians , artists , poets and historians who also happened to be excellent computer scientists . ""
And the people who bought the first Apple Mac computers were often architects , designers and journalists .
One way or another , Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak , the creators of the Apple Macintosh computers in the 1970s , came up with a line of products that â€ “ though clunky at first â€ “ had great appeal and continue to excite those engaged in design and the media â€ “ those who were best placed to sow the Apple seed .
Steve Jobs died on Wednesday .
I 'm writing this on an Apple desktop computer .
When I rush off to work on another story today , my personal Apple MacBook will come with me .
I also have an iPad , a Christmas present that has insinuated itself into my working and private life .
With all these Apples about , it can be like living in a digital orchard .
As someone who still loves his Olivetti Lettera and who has learned to come to terms with the digital world slowly and cautiously , Apple has eased the transition .
It 's not just that the technology is "" user friendly "" to writers and millions engaged in what are known as the "" creative industries "" , but that the physical design of Apple gizmos is seductive .
The iPad is like some magic tablet that comes alive and glows as if a genie has answered at least some of your wishes .
Invented by Jobs and his team and styled by Apple 's Jonathan Ives , it is one of those products that I like to imagine transporting back in time and showing our equally inventive ancestors as they built a pyramid or engineered a Gothic cathedral .
Look what we 've learned to do !
There would , of course , be one major snag .
With no electricity , cables or satellites , let alone service providers and all the rest of the digital panopoly , the iPad 's screen would remain resolutely dark , its crisp and gleaming plastic and metal case holding little interest for the architects of the Great Pyramid of Cheops or Salisbury Cathedral .
So Apples are very much objects of our time , so much so that each has been superseded by the next at a speed that might suggest a policy of built - in obsolescence .
It 's not that , although any company wants to sell us its next product or go out of business .
It 's more a case of design and technology moving on rapidly .
And , in Jobs 's case , of making Apple products indispensable in the way a wristwatch , handbag or wallet are to so very many millions of people .
Jobs , with incisive assistance from his design team , reshaped the personal computer from a wobbly , Professor Branestawm - like contraption lashed together at the back of a garage , or from an early Moog synthesiser lookalike , into a kind of digital jewellery .
Machines that , when he was growing up , were the stuff of men in white coats poring over punched paper tape and whirring , tape - recorder style reels in sealed , air - conditioned rooms are , thanks to Jobs , sleek hand - held devices that slip into handbags â€ “ wallets in the next couple of years , no doubt .
The very first Apple computer went on sale in 1976 , its digital gubbins protected by a wooden casing .
That was just a generation ago , and yet the latest Apples design make it look as though it might have been a tool used by medieval masons .
George Stephenson did not invent the steam railway locomotive , but when he and his son , Robert , shaped Rocket in 1829 â€ “ a pretty canary yellow and white design â€
“
they made this revolutionary machine aesthetically and emotionally acceptable to a largely suspicious and sceptical public .
Jobs has done much the same thing with Apple and the personal computer .
There is , of course , something almost touching about the fact that most of these gleaming , seductive 21st - century devices are charged , when plugged into walls , by electricity generated by the mighty stationary steam engines we know as power stations .
Not everything under the digital sun is new , but Jobs knew how to make it shine into our offices , our homes and our private lives ."
2011-10-06,"Steve Jobs , Apple co - founder and technological visionary , was well known for his words as well as his creations .
Here are some of his thoughts over the past 25 years .
On life "" Remembering that I 'll be dead soon is the most important tool I 've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life .
Because almost everything - all external expectations , all pride , all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death , leaving only what is truly important .
Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose .
You are already naked .
There is no reason not to follow your heart . ""
â€ “ Stanford commencement speech 2005
On Macintosh "" I do n't think I 've ever worked so hard on something , but working on Macintosh was the neatest experience of my life .
Almost everyone who worked on it will say that .
None of us wanted to release it at the end .
It was as though we knew that once it was out of our hands , it would n't be ours any more . ""
When we finally presented it at the shareholders ' meeting , everyone in the auditorium stood up and gave it a 5-minute ovation .
What was incredible to me was that I could see the Mac team in the first few rows .
It was as though none of us could believe that we 'd actually finished it .
Everyone started crying .
"" â€ “ Playboy magazine 1985 On customers ""
There 's nothing that makes my day more than getting an e - mail from some random person in the universe who just bought an iPad over in the UK and tells me the story about how it 's the coolest product they 've ever brought home in their lives .
That 's what keeps me going .
It 's what kept me five years ago [ when he was diagnosed with cancer ] , it 's what kept me going 10 years ago when the doors were almost closed .
And it 's what will keep me going five years from now whatever happens . ""
- AllThingsD Conference , 2010
On technology "" We think the Mac will sell zillions , but we did n't build the Mac for anybody else .
We built it for ourselves .
We were the group of people who were going to judge whether it was great or not .
We were n't going to go out and do market research .
We just wanted to build the best thing we could build .
When you 're a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers , you 're not going to use a piece of plywood on the back , even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it .
You 'll know it 's there , so you 're going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back .
For you to sleep well at night , the aesthetic , the quality , has to be carried all the way through .
"" â€ “ Playboy magazine 1985 On motivation ""
That 's been one of my mantras â€ ” focus and simplicity .
Simple can be harder than complex : You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple .
But it 's worth it in the end because once you get there , you can move mountains .

On internet start - ups
"" The problem with the internet start - up craze is n't that too many people are starting companies ; it 's that too many people are n't sticking with it .
That 's somewhat understandable , because there are many moments that are filled with despair and agony , when you have to fire people and cancel things and deal with very difficult situations .
That 's when you find out who you are and what your values are . ""
So when these people sell out , even though they get fabulously rich , they 're gypping themselves out of one of the potentially most rewarding experiences of their unfolding lives .
Without it , they may never know their values or how to keep their newfound wealth in perspective . ""

On design ( 1 ) "" Design is a funny word .
Some people think design means how it looks .
But of course , if you dig deeper , it 's really how it works .
The design of the Mac was n't what it looked like , although that was part of it .
Primarily , it was how it worked .
To design something really well , you have to get it .
You have to really grok what it 's all about .
It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something , chew it up , not just quickly swallow it .
Most people do n't take the time to do that . ""
- Wired magazine , 1994
On design ( 2 ) "" In most people 's vocabularies , design means veneer .
It 's interior decorating .
It 's the fabric of the curtains and the sofa .
But to me , nothing could be further from the meaning of design .
Design is the fundamental soul of a man - made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service . ""

On innovation "" Innovation comes from people meeting up in the hallways or calling each other at 10.30 at night with a new idea , or because they realised something that shoots holes in how we 've been thinking about a problem .
It 's ad hoc meetings of six people called by someone who thinks he has figured out the coolest new thing ever and who wants to know what other people think of his idea . ""
And it comes from saying no to 1,000 things to make sure we do n't get on the wrong track or try to do too much .
We 're always thinking about new markets we could enter , but it 's only by saying no that you can concentrate on the things that are really important . ""

On desktop computers "" The desktop computer industry is dead .
Innovation has virtually ceased .
Microsoft dominates with very little innovation .
That 's over .
Apple lost .
The desktop market has entered the dark ages , and it 's going to be in the dark ages for the next 10 years , or certainly for the rest of this decade .
"" It 's like when IBM drove a lot of innovation out of the computer industry before the microprocessor came along .
Eventually , Microsoft will crumble because of complacency , and maybe some new things will grow .
But until that happens , until there 's some fundamental technology shift , it 's just over . ""

2011-10-06,"Flat structure Apple 's really efficient and very impersonal when it comes to making decisions [ about killing a product ] .
There is never any illusion about what the company 's focus is and that comes from the top , that came from people like Steve and Scott [ Forstall , head of iPhone software ] , formerly [ software chief ] Bertrand [ Serlet ] , Tim Cook , everybody , they know what Apple is supposed to be doing and
the other side of that is they know what Apple is doing , they actually know what 's going on in their back yards .
Apple is a very flat organisation , there 's not that many layers , and they 're just all really involved .
There were either five or six layers between me and Steve â€ “ my boss was [ marketing chief ] Phil Schiller .
I mean , these executives , they 're sending emails very late at night , sometimes after midnight .
Apple is the biggest startup in the world , people work day in and day out because they believe in what they 're doing .
I was at the bottom of the [ organisational ] chart , I did n't have people under me , but I still â€ “ every time I worked on my slides or I worked on a demo or
whatever â€ “ I would ask myself , I 'd say if I had to show this to Steve , what would he say ?
And , as long as people keep asking themselves that question , and I believe that they will , then Apple 's going to be fine .

I only saw Steve in the hallways
, we never talked and I never presented to him .
Even so , he completely dominated my work .
I was building a fairly niche product for professional video editors , but despite our relative lack of significance the team still had to give him quarterly demos .
Looking back , it 's hard to imagine how many of those sort of meetings he must have done across the company .
He was hands - on in a way I 've never seen anywhere else , and it must have been exhausting and time - consuming for him .
These were nail - biting occasions for us .
We 'd wait in our office to hear the verdict while the designer presented behind closed doors .
Several times he never even got as far as showing off the features we 'd been slaving over because Steve would immediately focus on a bad visual element in the interface .
Whether it was an ugly button , a mis - aligned font , or a control panel with too many buttons , we 'd never recover .
All our work under the hood meant nothing , he had seen enough and we 'd failed .
At first I found this intensely frustrating .
It felt like nit - picking over unimportant details .
Could n't he see past the cosmetic issues to the impressive code we 'd been writing ?
We were solving hard problems , so what if there were a few rough edges ?
It took me time to realise how effective his method was .
Because we knew any surface sloppiness would negate everything else we did , the user experience became the true top priority .
We began to think about how Steve would see any changes we were considering , he would constantly come up in discussions .
Our lives would have been so much easier if we could have just cut some corners , in ways that would have been seen as perfectly reasonable at any other company .
Knowing he had an absolute veto and would use it if he saw the experience being threatened forced us to do better .
By being both unreasonable and right , he taught us to create products to delight people , not just satisfy them .

What if Steve had never existed ?
Try to imagine today 's society if Steve did n't exist .
Can you ?
The Apple II .
the Macintosh .
The mouse .
Making computers accessible to non - technical people in general .
Reinventing the music industry with iPod and iTunes , over the express wishes of the industry .
Beginning a similar reinvention of film and video .
Revitalising animation with Pixar .
Reinventing the personal communication industry with the iPhone .
And most recently the iPad .
He was a fundamental part of so many societal changes , any one of which would make most people 's careers .
I am who I am today because of Steve , through the companies and the products and the technologies he fostered ; more importantly , because of the people he brought in and mentored who turned into people that mentored me .
Because of the thinking and attitudes he promoted and inoculated that became key parts of what I 've become .
I 'm the person I am because of Steve and what he did , the opportunities he created , and the attitudes and expectations he baked into those around him .
I almost ran over Steve once outside of Infinite Loop 1 as I was coming in for a meeting and he popped into the street without really looking , [ iPod division chief ] Jon Rubinstein and [ iTunes chief ] Eddy Cue in tow .
He almost returned the favour once as he drove in to work as I was in the same crosswalk .
Steve could be a tough and very intimidating person , but as much as he demanded of others , he demanded more of himself .
He was involved in one of my projects at Apple , and I used to watch the team scramble as Steve reviewed ad copy hours before a launch and mark up changes .
He was that involved in the details , and he was always right .
Now Steve has left us , but his memory and his legacy live on , and they will continue to drive and shape the world we live in for years to come .
Nobody can replace Steve Jobs â€ “ he was unique .
Each of us can choose to do something to fill a small part of the void he 's left .
If we do , we will help fulfil the legacy he started in trying to make the world better for all of us .
I am a better person for having lived under his influence , and I can never pay that back , but I can try to carry that forward in his memory .
- Chuq von Rospach worked at Apple for 17 years , from 1989 to September 2009 ; he now works at Hewlett - Packard Relentless requirement to meet the highest of standards â€ “ and everyday magic "" It 's all true .
"" Those words compelled me to accept a job offer at Apple .
And , it was all true .
Steve 's Apple had the most talented people in the world , the subtle chaos necessary to develop new ideas , and the relentless requirement to always meet his highest of standards .
Steve Jobs has been described as "" brilliant "" and "" mean "" in the same breath .
Brilliant because of his insight and vision
, mean because he would let you know if your ideas were n't insightful or visionary .
Feature reviews were always stressful .
Would Steve like the idea ?
Would a stray pixel distract the course of the meeting ?
Would it be axed on the spot ?
If it were , you might go back to sulk at your desk , but you 'd always realise that his reasoning was right .
This stress is how Apple ticked ; the quest to make the world a better place does n't happen by coddling egos or releasing mediocre products .
The culture of excellence and attention to detail was rooted at the top .
In my time at Apple , I saw Steve 's true gift was he could bring complete focus to a product , seemingly off - the - cuff .
Lion started as many engineering - brainstormed ideas glommed together to form an incoherent product .
The pieces were great , the sum was unknown .
After months of development , it underwent first review by Steve .
Like a dog being yanked back on its leash , Steve stated that Lion ( Mac OSX 10.7 , released earlier this year ) needed to bring the iPad "" back to the Mac "" .
In a split second it all became clear .
Hundreds of engineers now had a common goal to work for , all due to Steve 's ability to distil down what would be millions of lines of code into four words .
This is not an isolated story but a common occurrence .
This was the everyday magic of Steve Jobs , which the world lost today .

2011-10-06,"I am honoured to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world .
I never graduated from college .
Truth be told , this is the closest I 've ever gotten to a college graduation .
Today I want to tell you three stories from my life .
That 's it .
No big deal .
Just three stories .
The first story is about connecting the dots .
I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months , but then stayed around as a drop - in for another 18 months or so before I really quit .
So why did I drop out ?
It started before I was born .
My biological mother was a young , unwed college graduate student , and she decided to put me up for adoption .
She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates , so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife .
Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl .
So my parents , who were on a waiting list , got a call in the middle of the night asking : "" We have an unexpected baby boy ; do you want him ? ""
They said : "" Of course .
"" My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school .
She refused to sign the final adoption papers .
She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college .
And 17 years later I did go to college .
But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford , and all of my working - class parents ' savings were being spent on my college tuition .
After six months , I could n't see the value in it .
I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out .
And here I was spending all of the money
my parents had saved their entire life .
So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK .
It was pretty scary at the time , but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made .
The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that did n't interest me , and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting .
It was n't all romantic .
I did n't have a dorm room ,
so I slept on the floor in friends ' rooms
, I returned coke bottles for the 5Â¢ deposits to buy food with , and I would walk the seven miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple .
I loved it .
And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on .
Let me give you one example : Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country .
Throughout the campus every poster , every label on every drawer , was beautifully hand calligraphed .
Because I had dropped out and did n't have to take the normal classes , I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this .
I learned about serif and san serif typefaces , about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations , about what makes great typography great .
It was beautiful , historical , artistically subtle in a way that science ca n't capture , and I found it fascinating .
None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life .
But ten years later , when we were designing the first Macintosh computer , it all came back to me .
And we designed it all into the Mac .
It was the first computer with beautiful typography .
If I had never dropped in on that single course in college , the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts .
And since Windows just copied the Mac , it 's likely that no personal computer would have them .
If I had never dropped out , I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class , and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do .
Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college .
But it was very , very clear looking backwards ten years later .
Again , you ca n't connect the dots looking forward ; you can only connect them looking backwards .
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future .
You have to trust in something
â€
” your gut , destiny , life , karma ,
whatever .
This approach has never let me down , and it has made all the difference in my life .
My second story is about love and loss .
I was lucky â€
”
I found what I loved to do early in life .
Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was 20 .
We worked hard , and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $ 2bn company with over 4,000 employees .
We had just released our finest creation â€
” the Macintosh â€
” a year earlier ,
and I had just turned 30 .
And then I got fired .
How can you get fired from a company you started ?
Well , as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me , and for the first year or so things went well .
But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out .
When we did , our board of directors sided with him .
So at 30 I was out .
And very publicly out .
What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone , and it was devastating .
I really did n't know what to do for a few months .
I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me .
I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologise for screwing up so badly .
I was a very public failure , and I even thought about running away from the valley .
But something slowly began to dawn on me
â€
”
I still loved what I did .
The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit .
I had been rejected , but I was still in love .
And so I decided to start over .
I did n't see it then , but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me .
The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again , less sure about everything .
It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life .
During the next five years , I started a company named NeXT , another company named Pixar , and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife .
Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film , Toy Story , and is now the most successful animation studio in the world .
In a remarkable turn of events , Apple bought NeXT , I returned to Apple , and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple 's current renaissance .
And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together .
I 'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I had n't been fired from Apple .
It was awful tasting medicine , but I guess the patient needed it .
Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick .
Do n't lose faith .
I 'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did .
You 've got to find what you love .
And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers .
Your work is going to fill a large part of your life , and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work .
And the only way to do great work is to love what you do .
If you have n't found it yet , keep looking .
Do n't settle .
As with all matters of the heart , you 'll know when you find it .
And , like any great relationship , it just gets better and better as the years roll on .
So keep looking until you find it .
Do n't settle .
My third story is about death .
When I was 17 , I read a quote that went something like : "" If you live each day as if it was your last , someday you 'll most certainly be right . ""
It made an impression on me , and since then , for the past 33 years , I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself : "" If today were the last day of my life , would I want to do what I am about to do today ? ""
And whenever the answer has been "" No "" for too many days in a row , I know I need to change something .
Remembering that I 'll be dead soon is the most important tool I 've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life .
Because almost everything â€ ” all external expectations , all pride , all fear of embarrassment or failure -
these things just fall away in the face of death , leaving only what is truly important .
Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose .
You are already naked .
There is no reason not to follow your heart .
About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer .
I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning , and it clearly showed a tumour on my pancreas .
I did n't even know what a pancreas was .
The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable , and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months .
My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order , which is doctor 's code for prepare to die .
It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you 'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months .
It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family .
It means to say your goodbyes .
I lived with that diagnosis all day .
Later that evening I had a biopsy , where they stuck an endoscope down my throat , through my stomach and into my intestines , put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumour .
I was sedated , but my wife , who was there , told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery .
I had the surgery
and I 'm fine now .
This was the closest I 've been to facing death , and I hope it 's the closest I get for a few more decades .
Having lived through it , I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept : No one wants to die .
Even people who want to go to heaven do n't want to die to get there .
And yet death is the destination we all share .
No one has ever escaped it .
And that is as it should be , because death is very likely the single best invention of life .
It is life 's change agent .
It clears out the old to make way for the new .
Right now the new is you , but someday not too long from now , you will gradually become the old and be cleared away .
Sorry to be so dramatic , but it is quite true .
Your time is limited , so do n't waste it living someone else 's life .
Do n't be trapped by dogma â€ ” which is living with the results of other people 's thinking .
Do n't let the noise of others ' opinions drown out your own inner voice .
And most important , have the courage to follow your heart and intuition .
They somehow already know what you truly want to become .
Everything else is secondary .
When I was young , there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog , which was one of the bibles of my generation .
It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park , and he brought it to life with his poetic touch .
This was in the late 1960 's , before personal computers and desktop publishing , so it was all made with typewriters , scissors , and Polaroid cameras .
It was sort of like Google in paperback form , 35 years before Google came along : it was idealistic , and overflowing with neat tools and great notions .
Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog , and then when it had run its course , they put out a final issue .
It was the mid-1970s , and I was your age .
On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road , the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous .
Beneath it were the words : "" Stay Hungry .
Stay Foolish .
"" It was their farewell message as they signed off .
Stay Hungry .
Stay Foolish .
And I have always wished that for myself .
And now , as you graduate to begin anew , I wish that for you .
Stay Hungry .
Stay Foolish .
Thank you all very much ."

2011-10-06,"News of Steve Jobs 's death drove the Apple share price down more than 5 % in Frankfurt on Thursday morning .
The visionary co - founder of Apple – regarded as the mastermind behind an empire of products that revolutionised computing , telephony and the music industry – died of a rare form of pancreatic cancer in California at the age of 56 .
He stepped down in August as chief executive of the company he set up in 1976 with his childhood friend Steve Wozniak .
Apple shares are now trading 3.5 % lower at € 273 , after hitting a low of € 270 in Frankfurt .
The shares are not traded in London .
They are expected to open lower when Wall Street opens at 2.30pm London time .
Apple was briefly the most valuable company in the world in the summer , knocking oil giant Exxon Mobil off the top spot .
Revenues have soared from $ 7.1bn ( £ 4.6bn ) in 1997 to $ 65.2bn a year now .
Jobs was ousted from the company in 1985 and went on to buy animation studio Pixar , before returning to Apple in 1997 .
It was near bankruptcy then and worth just $ 2bn .
But then it came up with the first iMacs , and in 2001 the first iPods appeared .
Apple 's stock price has risen more than 9,000 % since Jobs returned in 1997 .
The shares have more than doubled in the past two years , while Microsoft has gained just 5.1 % and Intel has risen 14 % .
Hewlett - Packard is down 48 % ."
2011-10-06,"Apple II Handbuilt by Steve Wozniak – the bearded sidekick to Steve Jobs –
the Apple II was released in 1977 , just 12 months after the very first Apple computer , the Apple I.
Unlike that Apple I , which was assembled in Jobs 's parents ' garage , the Apple II signalled the Apple co - founder 's early drive .
Some years later , he was reported as saying : "" My dream for the Apple II was to sell the first real packed computer . ""
The Apple II duly became the fastest - selling personal computer of its time , fetching $ 79 m in sales in 1979 .
The first Macintosh The Macintosh 128 K was released in January 1984 "" with all the showbiz of a car launch "" .
And what a launch it was .
No technology company would have dared dream about flaunting a personal computer in a multimillion - dollar Superbowl slot , but Apple did .
The Macintosh 128J was different thought –
it was n't especially for business or bespectacled engineers ; it was comparatively easy to use .
The iMac Three years after his return to Apple in 1998 , Jobs urged the world to "" think different "" .
But no one anticipated the iMac , the computer that kickstarted Apple 's fortunes and propelled the company to where it is today .
As the Guardian review from 14 May 1998 noted : "" nobody who attended last week 's product launch expected to find the most radical Macintosh since the original hit the streets 14 years ago
…
There is n't even a floppy drive . ""
The iPod Unveiled a decade ago this month , the iPod is the one device that transformed Apple from a computer company into a mass - market electronics giant – and would later spark a revolution in digital music .
Though many who bought it had to hack their computers to store music on it , the first - generation iPod was a stylish MP3 player boasting a 10-hour battery life and space for 1,000 songs .
"" Listening to music will never be the same again , "" said Jobs at its launch in October 2001 .
The iPod nano Steve Jobs discontinued the iPod mini at the height of its popularity in September 2005 .
His indefatigable drive for design and efficiency saw it replaced with the much smaller nano .
Apple reinvented the nano in September 2010 with its sixth iteration .
At 21.1 g the new nano was 15 g lighter than its predecessor and half the height .
The iPhone Less than half a decade after the iPod , Apple was already the biggest name in digital music .
After months of rumour and anticipation , Jobs , in January 2007 , unveiled what would quickly become Apple 's killer product .
The phone was a hit with techies and non - techies alike .
A typically fervent Stephen Fry reviewed the iPhone four months after its launch .
"" Beauty .
Charm .
Delight .
Excitement .
Ooh .
Aah .
Wow !
Let me at it , "" he wrote in the Guardian .
With the fifth incarnation unveiled earlier this week , the excitement has not yet dissipated .
iTunes Until Jobs unveiled iTunes in January 2001 , no one had been able to convince music label executives that people might pay for songs online .
Announced at the back end of a 90-minute keynote to launch the new Macintosh , iTunes was an unexciting "" all - in - one digital music program "" that brought together MP3 playback , internet radio and CD writing .
This week Apple began letting people access their digital music across any of their devices wirelessly .
It is the beginning of Apple 's cloud revolution .
The iPad Apple 's so - called "" Jesus tablet "" was everything that everyone did n't need on its launch in January 2010 .
Less than a year later , Apple had invented a new market and intentionally spawned hundreds of poor - man copycats .
Dubbed "" the oversized iPhone "" with a 9.7 in screen , Apple 's lean - back device would be the saviour of the media industry .
Research group Gartner last month forecast that tablet computers will see an explosion in sales over the next four years , selling 60 % as many units as PCs by 2015 – and Apple 's iPad will still have almost half the market by then . iOS
App Store Apple announced a new milestone for its App Store in July this year : 15bn downloads ( of more than 500,000 apps ) since it launched in July 2008 .
The App Store has become the cornerstone to the iPhone 's success , with the world 's media giants all scrambling for a prominent place on the smartphone of choice – and spawning a new market for software developers .
Pundits called it the future of mobile consumption , and Apple has since expanded its App Store to OS X computers , potentially ushering in a new age of software development .
One more thing :
Apple stores Apple opened its first retail store on 19 May 2001 , in Glendale , California .
As of July this year , Apple had opened more than 350 stores worldwide , with the largest in London 's Covent Garden .
Most thought Apple 's move into physical retail space was madness – but they did not foresee that the philosophy , design and layout of the stores would encapsulate what drives Jobs .
Customers have since flocked to the Genius Bar ."
2011-10-06,"Long past the time many had ceased caring , Sarah Palin announced on Wednesday night that she was not running for the presidency in 2012 .
Fox News alone of America 's cable networks thought her announcement was more significant than the death of Steve Jobs .
Everyone else reacted with a quick shrug and moved on .
It had become obvious that Palin was not going to be a candidate .
The reality is that Palin did n't stand a chance , so badly has she squandered her political capital within the Republican party over the past year with cheap stunts , such as an on - again , off - again grandiose national bus tour .
Her career in national politics as a candidate is over .
The most straight - forward implication of Palin 's decision – along with the announcement by New Jersey governor Chris Christie that he would not be running – is that the Republican field is set .
There is now no prince across the water .
That means Republican voters will either have to come to terms with Mitt Romney or the alternative , most likely Rick Perry .
But for Palin and her supporters , the announcement ends any serious opportunity Palin may have had .
The weakness of the 2012 Republican field was such that had Palin chosen to make a serious effort , she could have done well .
She could have won the nomination .
Now she almost certainly never will .
Even if Republicans do n't regain the White House in 2012 , the GOP has a rich crop of potential candidates in 2016 : Christie , Perry , Marco Rubio , Jeb Bush , Scott Walker .
By 2020 , Palin will be a distant memory , just as if Al Gore was running for the Democratic nomination in 2012 .
In reality Palin 's career was effectively killed off when she decided to quit midway through her term as governor of Alaska back in 2009 .
From that moment on her unfavourability ratings climbed to toxic levels .
When the Tea Party movement arose she quickly embraced it , backing herself further into a shrill corner of the Republican party , speaking in the code of talk radio and appealing to an ever - shrinking fan base .
What beckons instead is a career as a political quasi - celebrity on the conservative right , alongside the Oliver Norths , Ann Coulters and J Gordon Liddys .
But without the attraction of being a potential presidential candidate , Palin will find the spotlight and the crowds have moved on .
Over on her supporters ' websites , there is much gnashing of teeth and a good deal of denial .
No wonder , because only a week ago her supporters were being solicited for donations to help convince Sarah to run .
On Mark Levin 's radio show , where she made her announcement , Palin was full of perky plans for helping elect conservatives in 2012 .
Like a Broadway show that lost an audience , she plans a tour of the provinces .
Many Republicans will be glad to see her go since she drives away the moderates and independents that the GOP needs to win over to hold the White House .
In a memorable recent blog , RedState 's Erick Erickson described Palin 's cult - like supporters as "" unhinged "" and saying of Palin 's prevarication : "" Enough is enough "" .
Finally , it was ."
2011-10-06,"You do n't have to go far on the web or even everyday life to find people happy to say it :
they hate Steve Jobs and all he stood for , and those who buy things from Apple – the "" sheeple "" , in an oft - used phrase – are simply buying stuff for no reason than its marketing , or advertising .
Apple , they say , is a giant con trick .
Why do they care ?
Because , says Don Norman , an expert in how we react emotionally to design , buying or using products that engage our emotions strongly will inevitably alienate those who do n't share those emotions – and just as strongly .
Norman , formerly vice - president of the Advanced Technology Group at Apple , is co - founder of the Nielsen / Norman Group , which studies usability .
He 's also an author of books including Emotional Design and his latest , called Living With Complexity .
Apple , he says , excels at generating strong positive emotional reactions from those who use its products .
The iPhone was a classic example with its revolutionary touchscreen control – which was n't the first , but was the best : "" Touch is a very important sense ; a lot of human emotion is built around touching objects , other people , touching things , "" says Norman .
"" I think that we 've lost something really big when we went to the abstraction of a computer with a mouse and a keyboard , it was n't real , and the telephone was the same , it was this bunch of menus and people got lost in the menus and buttons to push and it felt like a piece of technology . ""
Whereas the iPhone felt like a piece of delight .
It really is neat to go from one page to the other not by pushing a button but by swiping your hand across the page . ""
He adds : "" The correct word is intimacy ; it is more intimate .
Think of it not as a swipe , think of it as a caress . ""
But just as physics sees an equal and opposite reaction to every action , so strong emotions engender adverse emotions in response .
Take this comment by Aaron Holesgrove of OzTechNews about the iPad : "" Actually , the iPad succeeds because it enables you to read websites whilst sitting on the toilet and play casual games in bed .
It 's a toy .
You ca n't eliminate complexity when there was never any complexity in the first place –
Apple went and threw a 10 in screen on the iPod Touch and iPhone and called them the iPad and iPad 3 G , respectively . ""
Critics say Apple 's products do n't have as many features ; their technical specifications are n't comparable to the leading - edge ones ; they 're more expensive .
In short , you 're being ripped off .
And what 's more , Apple is exploiting workers in China who build the products .
By contrast , ask someone about other comparable products out there – Amazon 's new Kindle Fire , RIM 's PlayBook , HP 's TouchPad – and you 'll get indifference , even if the prices are the same , or they 're made in the same Chinese factories as Apple uses .
Norman says that the reaction – both the love and the hate – comes from Apple 's designs .
"" This is important .
It 's something that I have trouble convincing companies of : great design will really convert people , but it will also put off other people .
So you have to be willing to offend people ; to make things that you know a lot of people are going to hate . ""
Apple 's focus on design , which is principally expressed through the objects it sells – the iPods , iMacs , MacBooks , iPhones , iPads – drives those extreme reactions , he says .
( And it 's notable that nobody ever complained about Pixar 's products – even though Jobs was chief executive there too . )
Part of why people like the devices so much is that they can personalise them : "" The iPhone , being your mobile phone , is part of you , like the iPod is but even more so , because you 're carrying everything around , not just your music but also your contacts and the ability to contact people – because people have observed that mobile phones are a very personal item . ""
By contrast , other companies that try to cater for and please everyone are guaranteed to fall short – and so wo n't excite emotion .
"" Many people try to make a product that everybody will love ; Microsoft is a good example , "" he explains .
"" If you make a product that everybody loves – you do all your market surveys , and when people do n't like something about it you change it –
you end up with a bland product that everybody will accept but nobody truly loves . ""
Apple is n't like that , he says .
"" Apple says ' We 're not going to even worry about it .
We 're going to make something that we ourselves love .
We just assume that anything that we really love , lots and lots of people will love .
And if other people really dislike it and hate it , so what .
Tough on them . '
""
But what about the criticism of the lack of specifications ?
When the iPod was still a hot seller , before the iPhone , I asked Phil Schiller , then as now Apple 's head of marketing , about the lack of extras such as FM tuners and voice recorders – which rivals did offer , even though their products made no headway in the market .
Schiller put it simply : extras like FM radio were "" a technology in search of a customer "" .
He explained : "" We 're very careful about the technologies we bring to our products .
Just because there 's a new technology does n't mean you should put it in your product .
Just because our competitors have put it in their product – because they need something to compete with us , because they 're losing on everything else –
does n't mean we should put it in the product .
"" We should put new features in a product because it makes sense for our customers to have that feature , and because a significant percentage of our customers will want that feature .
Otherwise , not .
Remember , all these features cost money , space and most importantly power , and power is a really big deal . ""
At Apple , the executives ' view is that "" a lot of product suffer from featureitis "" : that it 's easier to try to sell a checklist than selling a better product that does what customers really need to do .
As one explained it to me : "" We try to be very careful not to get caught up in a ' list of features war ' ; we try to focus just on what makes a great product for the customers , what do they really want to do , and focus on that like no one else .
If we think some features are n't that great , and do n't really work that well , and involve trade - offs that customers wo n't want , we just do n't do it .
We do n't just have a checklist on the side of a box .
"" It may be significant that the strongest criticism of Apple tends to come from those most engaged with the nuts and bolts of technology .
Apple 's staff have probably got used to having their products called toys by now .
As long as they keep selling , though , they 'll keep ignoring the critics in favour of the fans – which will , of course , inflame emotions on both sides even more ."

2011-10-07,"The biography of Steve Jobs , which the notoriously workaholic co - founder of Apple authorised saying "" I wanted my kids to know me "" , already tops the Amazon bestseller list on pre - orders , a fortnight before it is rushed into print .
As shrines mourning his death , aged 56 , sprang up outside Apple stores all over the world , publishers Simon and Schuster announced that the release date for Steve Jobs â€ “ discarded potential titles included The Book of Jobs and iSteve â€ “ in print and ebook formats will now be 24 October , instead of the planned late November .
Jobs last met his biographer Walter Isaacson , the former managing editor of Time magazine and author of books on Einstein and Benjamin Franklin , only a few weeks ago , when he knew his death was close .
In a piece to be published by Time on 17 October , Isaacson recalls finding Jobs curled up in pain in a downstairs bedroom at his home in Palo Alto , California .
Jobs told the writer he was too weak to climb the stairs to his old room .
But , Isaacson says , "" his mind was still sharp and his humour vibrant "" .
Jobs , the universally recognisable figurehead of Apple , stalking the stage in jeans and black polo - neck at product launches , was always careful to keep his private life out of the limelight , including his son and two daughters with his wife of 20 years , and daughter by an earlier relationship .
But he told Isaacson : "" "" I was n't always there for them
and I wanted them to know why and to understand what I did .
"" The book is based on more than 40 interviews with Jobs , and scores more with family members , friends , admirers , business opponents , and present and former colleagues .
Simon and Schuster describe Jobs as "" driven by demons "" , a man who could drive those around him to fury and despair . ""
Although Jobs cooperated with this book , he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published , "" the publishers say .
"" He put nothing off - limits .
He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly .
And Jobs speaks candidly , sometimes brutally so , about the people he worked with and competed against .
His friends , foes , and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions , perfectionism , obsessions , artistry , devilry , and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted .
"" On the Amazon website one of those who has pre - ordered the book posted : "" Great man , it will be some time before we see someone who has a mind like this again ! ""
Another customer , who would surely have pleased Jobs , boasted that he has paid less by ordering the title through his iPad2 ."
2011-10-07,"Steve Jobs 's genius was to offer us products we did n't know we wanted , and design them not just to function well but to be a joy to use .
Designing exceptional services means not just doing what your customers ask you to do , but developing deep insights into their lives so you can meet their needs in ways they would never have imagined .
The much - derided Building Schools for the Future programme showcased a number of inspiring designs , where the architects , school and council began by listening to what the children wanted â€ “ no dark corners for bullying , fittings their match their height and hands , good lighting â€ “ and delivered buildings that took these concepts to new levels .
At Highbury Grove School in Islington , a striking glass dome roof bathes the library in natural light and draws the children in for intellectual enlightenment , while glass walls between the classrooms and spacious corridors convey the message to students and staff alike that there is no hiding place for either poor behaviour or uninspiring teaching .
Former council chief executive and Design Council chair Michael Bichard has been championing design in the House of Lords .
He told me : "" What Steve Jobs did was design products around people .
He made them affordable , attractive and elegant to use .
Too often the public sector does not do that .
If many council services were sold by the private sector , no one would buy them . ""
Designing first - class public services , like designing Apple products , requires a huge amount of hard work and professional expertise in the back room to make them look simple and elegant at the front .
Apple products are not just nicely designed , they are technically brilliant .
Providing a customer service centre that really is a one - stop shop , for example , is hard to do â€ “ far harder than for any company .
Even more than excellent IT systems , it takes staff training .
They not only need to be able to cope with enquiries as diverse as parking and homelessness , they need to know how to deal with people who are angry , fearful and vulnerable .
When it comes to exploiting technology , public services have been slow to recognise the potential of the web and social networking .
Trying to use a council website is too often a deeply depressing experience , with a dreary list of services presented to reflect the bureaucratic systems of the authority rather than the lives of its citizens .
Council systems reach their nadir with the most basic service of all â€ “ voting .
It is still focused on the stubby pencil in the draughty church hall , effectively disenfranchising new generations of potential voters who would find democracy much more appealing and relevant if they could vote online .
Designing exceptional services is not about big investment , it is about liberating the minds of your staff to get closer to the people they serve , to have the confidence to suggest small improvements and big changes to the way the council works , and to have the freedom to do the right thing by the customer rather than slavishly follow rules .
Some years ago I was looking round Liverpool city council .
Signs of improvement were everywhere , but by far the most memorable change was a huge whiteboard in the call centre .
The staff had realised that between them they were getting dozens of calls from distraught residents who had lost their pets , so at a total cost of one whiteboard and a marker pen they had set up a pets lost - and - found service , which local people loved .
Simple , elegant and inspirational .

2011-10-07,"Steve Jobs 's death is sad , like any death .
But his effective deification in the pages of the press is quite extraordinary .
Front pages , reams of coverage in the news run , numerous editorials and even an advert in honour of Jobs from fashion house Diesel .
All this for a businessman we never met and most of us never heard speak .
It tells us something quite incredible about what 's happened to our world .
Jobs and his company were at best stylists .
They did n't invent the personal computer , the mobile phone or the MP3 player .
What they did was to style and restyle existing technology .
They did it incredibly successfully and
lots of people , me included , use their products .
But how did the head of a technology - styling company come to generate such adulation ?
The simply answer is that style is all there is .
We live in a consumer society where we buy symbols of what we want to communicate to others .
We are innately social beings , desperate to be part of one social group or another .
The grip of consumption on our psyche and our cultural world means that the prime way in which we communicate today is through brands .
Remember the word comes from the mark we placed on cattle to define ownership .
Today we brand and rebrand ourselves and there is no more valuable mark than the Apple logo .
I know many Guardian readers will be spluttering with indignation at this point .
But look at yourself and your house .
It 's fashion that marks you out as either safe and dull , or bohemian and hip .
We all do it
â€ “ all the time .
The fact that we love Apple products so much ( and yes , they are nicer to use and look better than their competitors ) simply points out the vacuum at the heart of our society â€ “ that this is all there is .
Two things separate us from other animals : our knowledge that we will die , and our thumbs .
Death in a secular society is a crucial factor in the consumerisation of society .
If we know we are going to die , then we have to fill the void with something â€ “ anything to avoid , deny or put off the inevitable horror of the end of our life .
The knowledge of death has been described as the creator of all human culture .
Thumbs are the means by which we physically build that world and â€ “ in the case of mobiles â€ “ use that culture .
Apple electronics have filled the gap as much as any brand .
But electrical equipment , no matter how well styled , can only be so much of a distraction .
In the end , life has to be about more .
Thus Jobs has to become more than a businessman and stylist : a quasi - Messiah .
His death follows in a long line of public outpourings of grief that started with Diana Spencer as we search for more than this â€ “ more than what we have .
More than just another gadget , no matter how functional and beautiful .
Saint Steve will be mourned most by the blue T - shirted kids who work in his stores â€ “ the cathedrals of Apple worship .
We die not wishing we owned more gadgets , Apple or otherwise .
We die wishing we had more time for the people we loved .
Jobs had admitted as much saying he did n't want to be the richest person in the graveyard .
And yet what Apple did was to encourage us to spend less time with the people we love and more time with gadgets to whom our affection and desire has been transferred .
Because Apple , like any other company , exists to make a profit .
It would sell you one thing and then create the desire for the next .
Permanent dissatisfaction and eternal longing are the motors of consumer society .
An iPhone 4 is not enough , you need and must have the upgrade ( announced the day before Jobs 's death ) .
It 's not the iPod Touch nor the Mac , it 's us who have become the machines of the consumer age , programmed to replicate a life of turbo consumption on a never ending treadmill that turned because companies like Apple make it turn .
The tragedy is this : we are much more beautiful , sensual and creative than any Apple product
â€ “
but can we reboot ?"
2011-10-07,"Growing up , I was a huge Apple fanboy ( fine , I still am ) .
The opening of the first New York Apple store in SoHo was probably the coolest thing that happened to me between the ages of six and 12 .
For a while I would spend almost every weekend there .
Every year for Halloween I dressed up as a Mac computer , and I made a habit of shaving the Apple logo into my head to celebrate each OS launch .
My neighbour mentioned that Steve Jobs , busy as he was , always read emails sent to his public address .
I think I was around 10 or 12 , and I sent a very enthusiastic and grammatically incorrect message , including a picture of my shaved head .
Apparently , he forwarded it to the head of public relations and I got invited to the opening of the Fifth Avenue Cube .
I can never thank them enough .
This was probably the high point of my childhood .
I believe the kid in the blue coat just said , "" I 'm Apple 's biggest fan "" , to which Steve replied : "" What about that guy ? ""
Apple was my childhood .
I know a lot of techies feel the same way .
Steve Jobs will be missed .
The tragic thing about his death is how little time he had with his family after he stepped down .
Steve put everything into his work and earned the loyalty of every one of his fans .
His example has had immeasurable influence on every single person in tech today and beyond .
The knowledge that there is important work that can only be done by you must be an incredible burden , and we all owe Steve and his loved ones our thanks .

2011-10-07,"Samsung , the biggest rival to Apple in the smartphone business and which is involved in a number of bitter courtroom battles with the US company , has abruptly postponed its scheduled launch of a new top - end phone next Tuesday .
The apparent motive was not to be seen to intrude on the reactions around the death of Apple 's co - founder and former chief executive Steve Jobs , whose death was announced late on Wednesday at his California home .
Update : sources close to the companies confirmed to The Guardian on Friday night that they did n't feel it was right to hold a product launch so close to Jobs 's death .
The South Korean company , which said on Friday morning that it expects smartphones to be the main profit engine of its business , had been expected to launch its new Nexus Prime phone , running the latest version of Google 's Android software â€ “ numbered 4.0 , and dubbed "" Ice Cream Sandwich "" â€ “ on Tuesday at the CTIA trade show .
But in a curt statement on Friday afternoon , it said : "" Samsung and Google decided to postpone the new product announcement at CTIA Fall .
We agree that it is just not the right time to announce a new product .
New date and venue will be shortly announced .
"" The company would not elucidate , though it is understood that the reason is not connected to any hardware or software problems around the phone .
That implies that the decision was taken because it would be seen as too close to the death of Jobs .
No new date has been given by Samsung for the announcement .
No date has been given either by Jobs 's family for his funeral .
Samsung and Apple are battling in a number of court cases around the world , with Apple claiming that Samsung 's products copy significant elements of the appearance of its iPhone and iPad devices , and that it infringes a number of patents .
Samsung has hit back by claiming that Apple is infringing a number of its patents , including some on mobile devices : it has threatened to prevent sales of Apple 's iPhone 4S , announced only on Tuesday , in France and Italy .
Last year Jobs tried unsuccessfully to intercede in the dispute before it escalated into a full - scale court battle .
The first shots in the legal battle were filed in April 201 .
Samsung , the largest electronics company in the world , announced on Friday morning that it expects to rack up record profits from handset sales .
Analysts think that it could have passed Apple in the July - September period for the total number of smartphone handsets shipped around the world .
However its other divisions are under pressure amidst squeezed consumer spending .
The South Korean firm estimated its quarterly operating profit at 4.2 trillion won ( Â£2.3bn ) versus a consensus forecast of 3.4 trillion ( Â£1.8bn ) won by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S. That would be down 14 % , from a year ago but up 12 % from the preceding quarter .
Samsung sold 19 m smartphones in the second quarter , and analysts expect shipments to have risen to more than 28 m units in the third quarter , helping it towards its target for the year of 60 m units .
Samsung sold only about 1 m fewer smartphones than Apple in the second quarter .
It plans to release its first smartphone based on the latest version of Microsoft 's mobile operating system this month , Windows Phone "" Mango "" , while a 5.3-inch screen Galaxy Note , a hybrid of a smartphone and a tablet , is set to go on sale later this year .
Samsung leads a pack of companies selling phones on Google 's Android operating system . ""
The Galaxy S II probably played a key role in boosting the company 's earnings and it will continue to do so pretty much unchallenged , until Apple unveils a better new version of iPhone , "" said Kyung Woo - hyun , a fund manager at Daishin Asset Management .
Samsung , which worked out how to make black and white TVs in the 1970s by tearing apart Japanese models , has become a top global brand over the past decade .
It boasts a market value of Â£76bn , much bigger than the combined value of rivals such as Sony , Nokia , Research
In Motion , Toshiba and Panasonic .
Samsung 's shares have fallen 5 % over the past three months versus a 12 % drop in Apple 's shares .
â€¢ Sony is said to be in talks to buy Ericsson out of its share in their joint venture in the mobile phone business , Sony Ericsson .
The companies must decide this month whether to renew their 10-year - old pact that created the company .
The deal could be worth up to $ 1.3bn , depending on what arrangement they come to over the use of Ericsson 's telecoms patents .
Yoshiharu Izumi , an analyst at J P Morgan in Tokyo , said the deal could be worth upwards of $ 1.3bn , depending on what agreement the two reach about the continuing use of Ericsson 's telecoms patents .
"" Up to now Sony 's products and network services have all been separate .
Unifying them would be positive , "" Izumi said .
"" If they can leverage their games and other network services I think they can lift their share , "" he added .
Should any buyout go ahead , Sony will need to take steps to protect itself from legal challenges to its patents .
Thus far the joint venture has been protected from the kind of court room challenges seen by rivals because Ericsson , the world 's largest mobile telecom gear maker , holds one of the largest patent portfolios in the industry .
"" Sony will definitely want to bolster its portfolio in such a deal so it can defend itself in the most litigious segment of the technology industry , "" said intellectual property expert Florian Mueller ."
2011-10-07,"As sure as night follows day , bizarre tributes follow the passing of the world 's 's leading lights .
And so it will prove with the death of one Steve Jobs .
( Although the above video was seemingly a tribute to his living days . )
There is more Steve Jobs where that came from .
This 2005 Stanford University address is perhaps his most famous on the web , and this from 2007 perhaps the most important .
For light relief , we swing to Chelsea FC , where millionaire footballers have taken to playing Space Invaders , and to London Bridge , where a 2012 Olympics hopeful effortlessly leaps over three Minis .
The feat is somewhat stymied by the cars being Minis , but we are hardly ones to complain .

The trouble with icons is that they 're an impossible act to follow ."
2011-10-08,"There was a point in the late 80s when I could pick out my fellow Apple Mac users in any gathering with about 70 % accuracy .
In the early days , we were a type – a bit unconventional , disorganised , non - technical and often self - employed with what we hoped was a creative bent – and we recognised each other with the miraculous certainty of members of the same species of moth in the wilderness .
No company or product has dominated my working life like Apple and , until last Wednesday , when Steve Jobs died of cancer at the age of 56 , no man in the world had a greater influence on the way I organised myself and earned a living .
There was never a business leader whose judgment I was more likely to trust ; no one that I would have liked to have grasped by the hand and shower with praise as much as Steve Jobs , whatever his reputation as a relentlessly demanding taskmaster .
I bought my first Mac in 1986 and in the succeeding 25 years have owned about 16 different Apple computers and laptops , as well as several Apple devices .
In 1988 , I set up the Sunday Correspondent magazine on a network of 20 Apple computers .
I believe it was the first in Britain without a mainframe , which was considered suicidal .
But it worked and we were amazed at the way we flipped articles and layouts to each other and managed to produce a magazine of 50-odd pages every week , a feat , incidentally , unthinkable with my first PC , the mulish prize of the Alan Michael Sugar Trading company – the Amstrad .
If I gush it is because I was a fan from the first .
The Mac brought order to my life and while , like all early members of the cult , I upgraded and replaced computers prematurely , my overwhelming emotion is of one of gratitude for Steve Jobs 's life .
On the podium of the digital revolution , he stands a few inches clear of Bill Gates of Microsoft , Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook , but probably on a level with Tim Berners Lee , the inventor of the worldwide web ( actually I prefer the word discoverer because it now seems almost impossible to believe that the web was not out there waiting to be found ) .
We can argue who is the most significant but no one can deny that Jobs contributed enormously to the sum of earthly pleasure and made life simpler and easier than anyone since Thomas Edison .
Compare the operation of a Japanese video camera or TV remote or its accompanying manual with those of practically any Apple product and you 'll know what I mean .
In fact , the iPhone does not even come with anything you could call a manual , because you feel your way ; or children find it for you .
Jobs strove to create exactly the computer or device that he wanted for himself and that desire informed almost everything he did .
It 's a good rule for life .
Film - makers , composers , editors , book writers , gardeners , fashion designers who aim to please themselves stand a better chance of pleasing others .
He possessed a very clear mind , a rare combination of technical and verbal clarity that made the way seem obvious to him and easy to communicate .
At the heart of great scientific and technical advances are exceptional acts of imagination that are as great as any artist 's .
Jobs knew what device he wanted and what it might do ; saw it and felt what it would be like to use before any prototype was produced .
Think Leonardo 's notebooks .
The solutions Jobs conceived were marked by physical and intellectual elegance too .
He had taste .
For example , Apple 's use of book fonts , or the graphic user interface – the familiar look of every Apple screen – was superior to any other computer interface and was promptly borrowed by Microsoft who made it universal .
Last week , tens of millions of Chinese signed the tribute page to Steve Jobs , a rare outpouring of sentiment , which perhaps contains a tribute to the Land of the Free .
One Chinese academic named Wu Jiaxiang said : "" The Apple is the fruit of a tree , on which branches are free thoughts and creations , rooted from constitutional government and democracy . ""
All but one of the six big names of the digital - web revolution are American , Berners - Lee being the exception , and it is certainly true that no other modern society could have produced what America has since Bill Gates 's Altair Basic programme appeared in 1975 .
There is a paradox in this .
We and perhaps the Chinese think of America as being a republic of unfettered exploration and experiment , where people such as Jobs and his partner , Steve Wozniak , can change the world from a garage .
But what the American journalist HL Mencken noted in the 20s is still somewhat true today .
He complained of "" our growing impatience with the free play of ideas , our increasing tendency to reduce all virtues to the single one of conformity , our relentless and pervading standardisation "" .
America is a place of yearning convention , where people are desperate to enrol and be enrolled into some large , amorphous group .
Americans generally do not want to stand out , follow a different course or express an opinion that is not held by millions .
Yet at the same time they mostly believe they are pioneering individuals who can strike out on their own whenever they choose .
And this beautiful delusion fosters those who must go their own way , like Jobs , an adopted , impoverished college dropout , who was possessed by a vision .
The first advantage that America still has over China is that dissidence and individualism are admired and seen as potentially creative .
The second is a belief in the evolutionary forces of competition – of the beneficial effects of wanting to acquire dominance over your rivals by bringing better products to the market .
The competition between Jobs and Microsoft and the giant hardware manufacturers from the 80s has produced incredible advances .
Such conditions do not exist in China and we can be sure that no dictatorship would tolerate the huge power accrued by Microsoft , Google , Facebook or Apple , which , incidentally , at the last count had reserves of $ 76.2bn , a shade over the US government 's operating cash balance over $ 73.8bn .
There was something rare and stylish about Jobs , even in the emaciation of his final illness .
He never missed a lesson that life had to offer him .
He said in a speech made to students at Stanford after he had been first treated for a rare form of pancreatic cancer : "" If you live each day as if it was your last some day you 'll most certainly be right ... remembering I 'll be dead soon is the most important tool I have encountered to help me make the big choices … it is the best way I know to avoid the trap that you have something to lose . ""
Steve Jobs was a clear thinker and a great man ."
2011-10-09,"Holding an iPad or iPhone is the closest most of us got to Steve Jobs ; devices that , in their way , sum up the creative and professional ethos of the extraordinary man from Silicon Valley .
Clasp either and the totality of Jobs 's vision is before you â€ “ from the single button on the front of the casing to the choice of fonts .
The objects ' tangibility , not to mention their cost , is what makes owners value them ; their design qualities are what make people obsess about them .
And in a era where music and film have become software , it is the portable player that makes them real .
The device is the closest to the media we can physically get .
Compare that to the BBC , in the news on the same day as Jobs 's death last week .
You ca n't hold the BBC , or a television programme .
It is an organisation whose products permeate through the airwaves of the national consciousness into our minds .
Its influence is almost certainly deeper than Apple 's â€ “ supplying us with news , laughter and national identity and more .
Yet , the very intangibility of the BBC and its products make us value it less .
Losing an iPhone can spoil a day or more ; missing a television programme is merely irritating .
More to the point , critics of the BBC seem to think that nothing of any substance will be lost if the BBC were to be cut back further , as the corporation has no weight at all .
As a product almost of a single will , meanwhile , the iPhonepadandpod betrays something different .
Its constituent parts , chips and display , are the work of many hands of course .
But their totality is reducible to a surprisingly small group of decision makers â€ “
yes , a few more people than Jobs himself â€ “ in a way that the output of a broadcasting corporation can not be .
Apple 's centralised mode of production is reminiscent of that adopted by Microsoft , described by Robert X
Cringely in Accidental Empires as the brainchild of its former executive Robert Simonyi , which stemmed from his unconsciously adopting the communist model from his native Hungary .
In its different way , the work of a television station is a product of outstanding complexity too , because of the number of human interactions needed to produce its content .
A dominating producer may be able to bend one show like X Factor to their thinking ; yet , it is hardly possible to command a night 's entertainment , let alone an entire schedule .
Broadcasting is too labour - intensive .
It is not even relevant , although it matters , that nobody owns the BBC .
It is simply far harder to exercise individual control over television â€ “ compare if you will the difference in the power relationship Murdochs and Desmonds have with their TV stations and newspapers .
Printed newspapers , like iPads , can be picked up and carried away , and dominated by powerful owners and editors .
Broadcasters are more elusive , if only because a politician speaking on live television can not be cut or selectively quoted .
Impossible to hold and control , this is the essential value of the BBC to the life of Britain .
Its openness is inherent in both its ownership and the medium ; that 25 m homes pay for it gives us all a stake .
Newspapers , too , are changing : the shift from a once - a - day edited overview to a world of rolling blogs , individual Twitter feeds and reader comments change the power relationship â€
“ even if it means at the same time the result is no longer a printed newspaper to carry home .
So it is interesting , then , that the Leveson inquiry begins now : empowered by technology , newspapers are becoming necessarily decentralised .
And , curiously , less like the display devices made by the company that Steve Jobs built ."
2011-10-10,"The studio behind Oscar - nominated Facebook film The Social Network is planning a biopic about Steve Jobs , based on a forthcoming authorised biography of the late co - founder of Apple .
Deadline reports that Sony Pictures is set to acquire rights to the book by former Time Magazine managing editor Walter Isaacson , titled simply Steve Jobs , for a seven - figure sum .
It will be the first film to tell the Apple founder 's story on the big screen , though a made - for - TV docudrama , Pirates of Silicon Valley , previously immortalised Jobs in 1999 with ER 's Noah Wyle playing the role .
The release of Isaacson 's biography is being rushed forward to 24 October following its subject 's death last week from a rare form of pancreatic cancer at the age of 56 .
It is based on more than 40 interviews with Jobs conducted over two years â€ “ as well as interviews with more than 100 family members , friends , adversaries , competitors and colleagues .
At one point last week the book hit No 1 on Amazon 's bestseller list , based on pre - orders alone .
Isaacson has previously written bestselling biographies of Albert Einstein , Henry Kissinger and Benjamin Franklin .
He was reportedly given complete access to Jobs , including a personal tour of his subject 's childhood home .
Mark Gordon , the man behind films such as Speed , Saving Private Ryan and Source Code , will produce the film version for Sony ."

2011-10-13,"Since Steve Jobs 's death , I 've had several discussions with musician colleagues and people on the business side of the industry about what he and Apple meant to them .
Opinion is divided on iTunes , but every musician I know owns at least one Mac and would n't dream of using any other computer for programming or recording .
It was n't only the fact that Macs are aesthetically pleasing that suggested Jobs understood us , it was the bundling of Garageband as part of the basic software package ( even if , in my opinion , it is n't good enough for professional recordings ) , and the way in which software such as ProTools and Logic work seamlessly with the operating system .
Jobs himself said ( in 1996 documentary Triumph of the Nerds ) : "" Picasso had a saying : ' Good artists copy , great artists steal . '
We have always been shameless about stealing great ideas and I think part of what made the Macintosh great was that the people working on it were musicians and poets and artists
â€ ¦ who also happened to be the best computer scientists in the world . ""
Then came the iPod .
Launched in 2001 , its shuffle mode was accused of destroying the artist 's ability to take the listener on a journey .
When the iTunes store opened two years later , Noel Gallagher asked who selected the section of the song to be featured in the 30-second preview on the site , saying that the listener had no idea what part they were listening to â€ “ the verse , the chorus or the middle - eight .
"" They should at least have the decency to put the chorus on there , "" he exclaimed .
With iTunes recently extending previews to 90 seconds , chances are that it is .
Some felt the way the iTunes store enabled fans to cherrypick songs has been detrimental to the music industry , and that the price per download was too low , but at least Jobs managed to make people willing to pay for music downloads , something the labels had failed to do . ""
What he [ Jobs ] did for digital music and encouraging people to pay for digital music was pioneering , "" David Joseph , chairman and CEO of Universal Music UK , told his staff last week . ""
He totally changed the landscape for us , and for our future . ""
Martin Mills , chairman of Beggars Group , agrees there is no denying the effect Jobs had on the music industry .
"" It 's hard to imagine today 's record industry without iTunes , "" he says .
"" How can one deny the impact of an idea that has turned into the largest seller of music in the world in just a few years ?
And has done so while also being the greatest style icon of its era .
"" XL , part of Beggars Group , boasts on its roster such artists as Adele , Radiohead and Vampire Weekend , and Mills praises Jobs for not pandering to major labels . ""
Steve Jobs 's legacy to music is immense , "" he explains .
"" Apple alone had the strength to manhandle music licences out of big companies intent on doing it themselves , and iTunes ' independent editorial policy , judging music just on its merits , has benefited thousands of new artists . ""
And while some thought iTunes ' prices devalued music , the fact is that Apple , unlike most other digital music services , are transparent when it comes to telling us where that money goes :
Apple takes 30 % , credit companies take their fee â€ “ and the rest goes to artists / labels and songwriters / publishers . ""
He seemed quite honest to the music industry and artists , "" said U2 's manager , Paul McGuiness .
"" Others took a little less interest in getting artists paid than Steve . ""
So what happens now ?
While Apple continued to develop and innovate , iTunes pretty much remains the same â€ “ apart from a few tweaks such as Ping and Genius .
With a 70%-plus share in the digital downloads market ( 16bn downloads to date ) , Apple may not feel it needs to change .
The last music - related Apple products Jobs developed , as far as we know , are iCloud , launched in the US this week , and iTunes Match , which gives you legal digital access to any song on your Apple devices for $ 25 a year .
It has met with some resistance from the industry , with questions raised about the price , as well as its inability to distinguish between downloads acquired legally and those not .
But though Jobs always drove a hard bargain , unlike Google and Amazon , he got licence agreements in place before launch ( which could work to Apple 's advantage when iCloud launches in countries that do n't have the "" fair use "" rules the US does ) .
The question is : what have musicians and the music industry meant for Steve Jobs and Apple ?
Though it 's clear Jobs loved music , the fact is music has mainly been used to sell Apple hardware .
That 's why iTunes could afford to have a relatively low profit margin â€ “ the profit from sales of more than 300 m iPods , so far , has easily made up for it .
Likewise , I 'm sure the reason Apple is launching iTunes Match is not because it thinks it will make a profit on the $ 25 annual subscription fee , but because it 's tied to Apple devices
â€ “
if you want your iTunes library to be available on your mobile phone , you 've got to have an iPhone .
And so , while the iTunes store is important to musicians , as they 're finding it increasingly difficult to make money from recorded music , their music 's capacity to sell Apple products remains priceless ."
2011-10-13,"Demand for Apple 's update to its iPhone and Mac software to enable its "" iCloud "" services caused a gigantic surge in internet traffic in Europe .
Throughput in the UK jumped by 200 gigabits per second – equivalent to more than a fifth of normal traffic – a spike that lasted for roughly four hours .
The colossal demand , which was mirrored around the world as the update became available from the company 's servers at 1800 BST on Wednesday , will have been the severest strain on the cloud systems that Steve Jobs showed off in his last major speech in June .
The demand led to slowdowns for many trying to download the software , and then to errors as their systems tried to connect back to Apple 's servers , which had to verify the update on each device .
Many feared that the update had "" bricked "" their phone and rendered it useless – but then found that it worked once Apple 's servers came back online .
Jay Freeman , an iPhone expert , tweeted an explanation : "" To anyone getting ' An internal error occurred ' ( 3200 ) while installing iOS 5.0 , Apple 's servers are swamped , and failing half the requests .
"" The download was the sternest test that Apple 's servers will have endured so far as millions of owners of iPhones and iPads able to run the new software tried to access it .
However , the shift to iOS5 and iCloud should mean that Apple will in future avoid such gigantic rushes in demand .
Future versions of the software can be downloaded "" over the air "" , so that it will be able to pace the rollout of new versions of the software to iPhones , iPads and iPod Touches on a country - by - country or other basis , in order to ease the load .
The iOS5 update brings a number of changes to the software , many of which make it more directly competitive with Google 's Android : it introduces a system - wide "" notifications "" system as well as the over - the - air updating , both of which already feature in Android .
However , iOS5 does not bring – as some upgraders seem to have expected – the "" Siri "" voice recognition assistant : though it was previously available as a free app for the iPhone 3GS upwards , it is now only available on the iPhone 4S , which goes on sale on Friday . ."

2011-10-15,"It 's funny how fickle fame can be .
One week Steve Jobs dies and his death tops the news agendas in dozens of countries .
Just over a week later , Dennis Ritchie dies and nobody – except for a few geeks – notices .
And yet his work touched the lives of far more people than anything Steve Jobs ever did .
In fact if you 're reading this online then the chances are that the router which connects you to the internet is running a descendant of the software that Ritchie and his colleague Ken Thompson created in 1969 .
The software in question is an operating system called Unix and the record of how it achieved its current unacknowledged dominance is one of the great untold stories of our time .
It emerged from Bell Labs – the R&amp;D facility of AT&amp;T , the lightly regulated monopoly that ran the US telehone network for generations .
Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson were two ferociously bright Bell programmers who had been assigned to work with MIT on the design of an impossibly complex multi - user operating system called Multics .
In the end , the plug was pulled on the project , with the result that Bell Labs found itself with two pissed - off hackers on its books .
Ritchie and Thompson badly needed a new operating system to provide an environment for their own programming , had hoped that Multics would provide it and had greatly enjoyed working on the project .
Back in the lab they decided that they would just have to build the operating system themselves .
So in a fantastic burst of creativity ( and without asking anyone 's permission ) they wrote Unics ( as a counterpart to Multics ) .
Inevitably the ' cs ' became '
x ' and Unix was born .
Thus did AT&amp;T find itself the astonished proprietor of a uniquely powerful and innovative operating system .
The problem was that it could n't sell it , because under the Consent Decree that gave it the telephone monopoly
AT&amp;T was not allowed to be in the computer business .
So the researchers in Bell Labs did what geeks do –
they gave it away to their peers in university research labs , under a licence that permitted the recipients to modify and improve it .
In doing this Ritchie and Thompson unwittingly launched the academic discipline of computer science , because university departments were suddenly able to give their students software that was not only powerful ( and malleable ) but also free .
The result was that virtually every computer science student in the world became a Unix geek in the course of his or her education .
Unix was to computer science what the Bible is to divinity students .
The difference was that geeks were free to modify and improve their bible – which is what Bill Joy and his fellow students at Berkeley did when they created their own version of Unix , codenamed BSD ( for Berkeley Software Distribution )
– of which more in a moment .
In due course , AT&amp;T escaped the shackles of the Consent Decree and started to assert proprietary rights over Unix .
This spurred an MIT programmer named Richard Stallman to embark on a project to change the world .
He founded the free software movement , invented a clever way of using copyright law to preserve the freedom of programmers to modify software , and embarked on the GNU project to create a functional clone of Unix that would be free of proprietary constraints .
( GNU stands for "" Gnu 's not Unix "" which is the kind of recursive joke only programmers enjoy . )
Stallman , who is one of the great figures of our time , built most of the software tools needed for his great project , but before he could write the kernel of the operating system a Finnish hacker named Linus
Torvalds did it – and released it in 1991 as Linux .
The rest , as they say , is history .
Linux became one of the greatest collaborative ventures the world has seen ( second only to Wikipedia ) , in which geographically dispersed programmers collaborate over the internet to debug , improve , extend and enhance a complex operating system that is not only remarkably stable and reliable but is also free .
Because it 's free and malleable , every manufacturer in the world who needs a stable and flexible operating system to run an electronic device tends to use Linux – which is how your TV 's set - top box and your broadband router and maybe also your smartphone comes to be a Linux box .
The same goes for the millions of PCs that make up Google 's server farms .
In that sense , we are all now Linux ( and , by inference , Unix ) users .
The neatest twist of all , however , involves Apple .
OS X – the operating system that now powers every Apple product – is actually built on the Berkeley distribution of Unix , so if you hack into your iPhone what you 'll find is BSD 4.2 .
You could say , therefore , that what Apple really did was to give Unix a pretty face .
I 've often wondered what Dennis Ritchie would have made of that .
Now that he 's gone , we 'll never know .
What we do know , though , is that we owe him more than we realised ."
2011-10-16,"Some of Silicon Valley 's top executives were set to gather at Stanford university on Sunday evening to celebrate the life and genius of the Apple founder Steve Jobs .

It is being billed as strictly private , with no public or media coverage welcome .
Last week Jobs had a small private funeral following his death on 5 October , aged 56 , from pancreatic cancer .
On Wednesday morning , another private event will be held at Apple 's Cupertino headquarters for the company 's employees to pay their respects to their deceased leader .
Despite the primarily private nature of the commemorations , Jobs 's many admirers and fans have been able to express their sentiments through an outpouring of messages and cards to Apple stores and the company 's website .
In California , the governor Jerry Brown declared Saturday "" Steve Jobs Day "" .
In a proclamation , he said : "" It is fitting that we mark this day to honour his life and achievements as a uniquely Californian visionary .
He epitomised the spirit of a state that an eager world watches to see what will come next . ""
Security around the Stanford commemoration has been so tight that scarcely any details have yet emerged .
Reuters reported that the president of one of Apple 's bitterest rivals , Samsung Electronics , Lee Jae - yong , would be among the attendants .
Samsung and Apple are fighting for supremacy in the smartphone and tablet markets ."
2011-10-16,"Sir Tim Berners - Lee , the inventor of the world wide web , has praised Steve Jobs for helping devise the machine that he used to write the software .
Berners - Lee wrote the code for the web while working at the physics research institute Cern in 1991 , using a NeXT Computer - the company set up by Jobs after he was ejected from Apple in 1985 .
In a post on his personal blog entitled "" Steve Jobs and the actually usable computer "" , Berners - Lee - whom nobody would be likely to call naive or inexperienced with computers - says that "" A big thing Steve Jobs did for the world was to insist that computers could be usable rather than totally infuriating "" .
He says of the NeXT , whose software became the basis for the desktop Mac OS X operating system , and then the iOS software powering the iPhone and iPad , that "" The NeXT was brilliant .
The NeXT had ( arguably too ) many things introduced at once -- removable optical storage , Objective C , DSP for sound and movies , Mach kernel , unix for a PC , display Postscript , InterfaceBuilder and so on .
Yes , they never got the price down and the optical disks proved unreliable .
But Steve and NeXTStep ended up saving Apple , and there must be a lesson that it is worth hanging on to cool things
: you never know when they will in fact become mainstream . ""
He recalls that when he unboxed the NeXT computer in Sept 1990 ) , "" it had automatically set up for me as a naive user a unix mail account , which staggered the local unix gurus who normally had to help users of new unix [ machines ] struggle with sendmail configuration files . ""
The default mailbox contained an audio file with a welcome from Jobs about his vision , including , says Berners - Lee , "" It 's not about Personal Computer
.. it 's about * Interpersonal * Computing "" .
Exactly . ""
He says that programming the world wide web "" was remarkably easy "" using the software modules already on board : he created a subclass of the existing software module , added the internet code , added the menus using the NeXT Interface Builder ( which still exists today on Mac OS X ) ; after that the code framework for the application was generated by the system .
"" That is a platform , "" comments Berners - Lee .
"" Something which allows you to build things which without it would have been possible , but a lot of work . ""
He also recalls the fact that the two almost met once , at a meeting of NeXT developers in France .
Jobs , however , was running late for his plane back to the US - and had to leave before Berners - Lee and Robert Cailliau , who worked on the WorldWideWeb.app on NeXT with him , could show it to him . ""
Steve was a champion of usable technology - even sexy technology , "" concludes Berners - Lee , who still uses Apple computers now .
"" Intuitive on the outside and extensible and cool engineering on the inside .
The geeks among us need to be at the same time deeply insistent technically on beautiful , clean , extensible design inside , and utterly impatient as naive end users about the outside . """
2011-10-16,"Mehdi Hasan 's contention –
"" Had Avram Kohen not arrived on these shores from Poland in the late 19th century , his son Jack would not have been able to start Tesco in 1919 "" – is facile (
Steve Jobs would never have made it in Cameron 's world , 13 October ) .
The same argument is used by anti - abortionist "" pro - life "" lobbyists : "" Had Mary Arden used contraceptives or had she had an abortion , her son William Shakespeare would not have been able to write Hamlet . ""
Does this mean that contraceptives should be banned ?
Hasan berates tales of "" the hard - working British builder or plumber who has been replaced , or undercut , by the cheaper Pole or Lithuanian "" , forgetting that many of them are the children of immigrants themselves .
And research showing how little evidence there is of the effect on wages of the high - level immigration from eastern Europe assume steady - state conditions .
Such research fails to take account that a failure to recruit pushes wages up , and low - paid jobs that British workers are not prepared to do suddenly become attractive .
Highlighting the effects of immigration on jobs , housing and amenities does not detract from the contribution immigrants make .
But it must not be exaggerated ; on average , the contribution of immigrants is no more and no less than that made by the indigenous population .
Fawzi Ibrahim London •
Amid all the rhetoric on illegal migration ( Cameron urges public to report suspected illegal immigrants , 11 October ) , we seem to have lost sight of the fact that the UK has for years relied on the contribution of highly skilled migrants to deliver our public services .
The immigration system needs to be flexible enough to allow experienced doctors from outside Europe to be appointed if suitable staff can not be found within the resident workforce .
The government does not consider many experienced overseas doctors and nurses to be "" highly skilled "" because they are only focused on the economic value of immigrants .
But it is essential that , when making decisions about immigration , we also consider the benefits healthcare workers bring to society .
Dr Terry John Chair , BMA International Committee •
Our prime minister recommends that people identify "" suspected "" illegal immigrants and report them .
How ?
When a child joins the local school , what features should arouse suspicion ?
Or should we err on the side of caution and patriotism and denounce the family to the authorities ?
Will it stop at denunciation , or will Cameron 's 1930s rhetoric unwittingly encourage racist attacks on some of the most vulnerable in our community ?

2011-10-18,"Samsung and Google are to launch the Galaxy Nexus phone to showcase the latest version of the Android mobile operating system , "" Ice Cream Sandwich "" , in Hong Kong late on Tuesday night .
The phone is expected to be released in the UK within the next four weeks , in time for Christmas .
The launch had been scheduled for Monday last week , but Google and Samsung postponed it following the death of Steve Jobs , Apple 's co - founder and former chief executive .
As a flagship device , the phone will run the standard version of the new Android update , rather than having Samsung 's Touch - Wiz system running on top of it .
Engadget suggests that it will have a high - definition display , dual - core 1.5GHz processor and a screen size of up to 4.6 in .
Like the Nexus S , the Samsung device which showcased Android 2.3 "" Gingerbread "" , the previous major phone version , there wo n't be physical buttons for key on - screen functions .
Samsung and Apple are neck and neck , having both supplanted Finland 's Nokia to ship more than 20 m smartphone handsets per quarter in the three months to June .
Analysts are still waiting for third - quarter figures from Samsung ; Apple will announce figures at its quarterly results on Tuesday night .
Samsung is expected to have supplanted Nokia as the largest mobile company in terms of handset shipments when it finalises its third - quarter results through its sales of "" feature phones "" which do n't have third - party app capabilities .
The Google chief executive , Larry Page , said at the company 's earnings call last week that 190 m Android devices have been activated since its inception .
He also said that the mobile business was on an equivalent run rate to being a $ 2.5bn business .
However , he did not specify how much of that comes through mobile advertising and app sales on Android ; testimony given by a Google executive to the US Congress that two - thirds of mobile search comes from devices running Apple 's iOS software .
Ice Cream Sandwich , which is version 4.0 of Android , is intended to be a cross - platform offering that unites the 2.0 branch , devised for mobile phones , and the 3.0 branch for tablets which was first released earlier this year on Motorola 's showcase Xoom tablet .
That should mean that app developers can target all sizes of screen in a single package .
Samsung 's UK press office did not have any information about the timing of the launch or any other details at the time of publication .
Android Central says it has the specifications .
Notable points include 1 GB of RAM , Bluetooth 3.0 , and the following : • Display : AMOLED HD : 4.65 inches Resolution 720 x1280 )
Maximum number of simultaneous colors • Main Display : 16,777,216 color touch screen : capacitive ( multi - touch ) , • Main camera : 5 megapixel CMOS camera with LED flash • Video recording 1080pHD

Front camera : 1.3 million pixels CMOS •

2011-10-18,"Steve Jobs famously criticised Microsoft for having no taste and no culture .
Windows Phone 7.5 , the latest version of Microsoft 's operating system for mobile phones , is a revolutionary product for its parent company because it has both in spades .
The worry is that Microsoft has delivered this lovely creation a little too late .
As a piece of visual design , the operating system also known as Mango makes the iPhone 's bubble - inspired home screen graphics look tired and out of date .
The style is pared back , letting the content , drawn in from the myriad of online sources that now figure in our daily lives , do the talking .
Applications each inhabit a simple red square , or "" live tile "" on a black screen .
When customised they earn their name and truly come to life , which is where the culture comes in .
The level to which a select group of the best social media platforms – Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn – have been woven into the functions on Mango goes well beyond what was available on its predecessor ( Windows Phone 7 ) , and arguably well beyond what Apple 's iPhone and Google 's Android can offer .
Punch in your Facebook and Twitter coordinates , and the software merges them with your address book to create a profile for each contact , with their latest photos , status updates and tweets .
Pin that person 's tile to your home screen , and each update feeds into the little square .
The most recent photos taken on your phone are also displayed in their own double sized tile .
And the home screen can , unlike many other operating systems , display multiple tiles from a single application – one for each item you are bidding for on Ebay , or the weather in a handful of cities .
The messaging has caught up with iPhone .
A conversation that might begin on Facebook chat but then moves to text messaging or Windows Live Messenger – the Microsoft instant messaging service – now appears on screen in a single thread .
Where the operating system does fail to impress is with voice recognition .
Mango incorporates it , for example to compose an email .
But "" Want you meet camera "" is not a very usable approximation of "" Want to meet tomorrow "" .
Voice commands are not just a diverting new trick .
They are the future for smartphones .
Using virtual keypads on a tiny touch screen is life sapping , and impossible to do while walking .
But the trusty buttons of a qwerty keyboard are just not sexy enough to be added to the iPhone .
So Apple is doing its level best to get us using Siri , its own voice service , which has surprised users with its accuracy .
Microsoft has some catching up to do here .
And it will make every effort to catch up .
The software behemoth is not just fighting for a nice sideline , it is fighting for control of the mass market computer .
As mobile connected devices become cleverer and are touched by millions more fingers than have ever typed on a PC keyboard , the importance of the laptop or desktop computer will fade and with it Microsoft 's influence .
There is a long battle ahead .
Research firm IDC says Windows operating systems were on just 2 % of phones sold worldwide in the first half of this year , down from 13 % in 2008 .
Back then , Android 's share was 0 % .
In three years it has become the best seller , with 42 % .
BlackBerry is still significant , and Apple 's iOS is at 19 % .
The first Nokia handsets to use Windows will be unveiled in London next week .
Nokia still sells more "" feature "" phones than anyone else , but it sold just 15 % of smartphones in the summer , down from 33 % in 2010 .
Its decision to abandon Symbian left it unable to compete for most of this year .
The alliance with Microsoft is clearly make or break , and their target as they attempt to rise up the ranks will be Android .
Research
In Motion , maker of BlackBerry , will continue to chase its corporate market .
Apple will remain the premium brand for now .
Which will leave Microsoft and Google slugging it out for dominance of the cheaper , mass market handsets .
Where Google may have the edge is control over handset design .
It is buying Motorola , possibly just for the patents needed to protect Android against litigation , or possibly to create better phones .
Nokia and Microsoft are merely in an alliance , but they have size , marketing firepower , relationships with networks and experience on their side .
Nokia won its battle for dominance of the mass market against Motorola at the end of the 1990s , and still sells more basic feature phones than anyone else .
Microsoft knows a lot more about selling operating systems than Google , albeit on PCs .
Its creator may be a fading force , but Mango shows Microsoft still has the taste for success ."

2011-10-20,"The day Steve Jobs died , Mike Daisey stayed up all night , in a darkened room , lit only by the glow of his MacBook Pro , reading a cache of personal emails from Apple 's founder .
He was searching for fresh insights into the genius behind the iPod , the iPhone and the iPad , but no matter how long he stared at the screen , they remained elusive .
The man was gone .
Daisey has been an Apple fan since childhood , but in the course of writing his latest monologue , The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs â€ “
it 's been in the works for years , but with uncanny timing has just opened at the Public Theatre here in New York â€
“
the relationship deepened to the point of obsession .
The show is a love song to Apple 's gorgeous , transformative devices , but also a vehement attack on the way they are produced , at a vast , dehumanising factory complex in southern China , where workers assemble laptops and smart phones for next to nothing , under constant surveillance .
Jobs is portrayed as a "" visionary asshole "" who trampled on friends in his quest for perfection .
He changed the way we understand and engage with the world three times , Daisey argues , but he was also a manipulative egotist , an unbearably demanding , capricious boss and a ruthless businessman who would do anything to achieve market dominance .
Seeing his flaws ripped open and hearing about his seeming indifference to the miserable conditions at Apple 's outsourced factories is a bracing antidote to the hagiography that has dominated since Jobs 's untimely death the week before last .
But is it too soon ?
The show opened a day after Jobs was laid to rest .
The love affair with technology that began when Daisey 's grandfather bought him an Apple IIc in 1984 eventually took him to the Special Economic Zone of Shenzhen , in southern China , where roughly 50 % of the world 's consumer electronics are made .
Daisey stood outside the gates of the Foxconn Technology plant , which employs 430,000 people , and asked workers to tell him stories about the conditions inside .
He heard stories of a hand crippled by a decade on the assembly line , workers threatened with life in prison for joining a union and 13-year - old girls doing 13-hour shifts .
The factory was briefly in the news last year , when it installed nets under the top floor windows , following a rash of suicides , but otherwise it may as well operate in a black hole .
Chances are your phone was made there , but most people know nothing about the place .
It came as a revelation to me that most electronic devices are assembled by hand , rather than by robots .
Daisey weaves his trip to Shenzhen into a history of Apple , from the company 's guerrilla origins , flying a pirate flag over Silicon Valley , via its near - death experience in the 1990s , to modern - day ubiquity , in a performance that is often hilarious and always intense .
Jobs is both hero and villain of the piece , as it charts his rise , fall and rise again .
But Daisey denies he 's unfair to Jobs . ""
If the goal was to slander the man , there 's ample ammunition , "" he says , "" the show would be six hours long .
"" It ends with Daisey telling the audience "" tonight is a virus , "" and asking them to email Apple 's new CEO , Tim Cook , to call for independent supervision in Shenzhen .
His messages from Jobs were replies to such requests .
Reading through them , Daisey concluded that Apple 's founder "" turned his back on these things a long time ago "" .
In this , Jobs had the rest of the industry for company ( many major technology companies are clients of Foxconn ) , not to mention anyone who has ever owned a laptop or MP3 player , but it still came as a shock to discover that he did not "" think different "" when it came to exploitation in China .
Its subject might still seem raw , but The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs is a welcome rebuke to the sanctification of a technological pioneer â€ “ and something that points out that reputations are often more complex than they seem ."
2011-10-21,"Steve Jobs regretted his decision to delay having potentially life - saving surgery for his pancreatic cancer , his biographer has revealed .
After being diagnosed with the cancer in 2004 , Jobs embarked on a series of alternative therapies including spiritual healing , said Walter Isaacson , author of the upcoming biography Steve Jobs .
Despite pleas from his family to have surgery , Jobs initially refused , Isaacson said , in an interview for CBS News 60 Minutes to be broadcast on Sunday .
The co - founder of Apple , who died this month after a long battle with the disease , had been told he had a very slow growing type of pancreatic cancer , and that his was one of the 5 % "" that can actually be cured "" .
Isaacson said that Jobs , after his diagnosis , "" tries to treat it with diet , he goes to spiritualists , he goes through various ways of doing it macrobiotically
â€ “
and he does n't get an operation .
"" Asked why not , Isaacson told CBS : "" I 've asked him that and he said : ' I did n't want my body to be opened , I did n't want to be violated in that way . '
He 's regretful about it . ""
Interviewer Steve Kroft asked why "" such a smart man could do such as stupid thing "" .
Isaacson said : "" I think he kind of felt : if you ignore something you do n't want to exist , you can have magical thinking .
It had worked for him in the past .
He 'd regret it . ""
His wife , Laurene , and others around Jobs convinced him to "" quit trying to treat it with all these roots and vegetables and things "" and have the surgery nine months later .
But when he finally had the operation it may have been too late , said Isaacson , as the cancer had already spread to the tissues surrounding the pancreas .
After the surgery , Jobs told his employers but played down the seriousness of his condition .
A piece on CBS News website said the interview covers "" several of the best stories from the biography , including the fact that Jobs had actually met the man who turned out to be his biological father before he knew who he was .
"" They also talk about Jobs ' disdain for excess consumerism .
In a taped conversation , he tells Isaacson how he saw Apple staffers turn into "" bizarro people "" by the riches the Apple stock offering created , it said ."
2011-10-24,"Rupert Murdoch is not known as a pushover .
But when the fearsome News Corp chairman and chief executive discussed the terms of the Daily launch with Steve Jobs late last year , there was only to be one winner .
According to the authorised biography of the Apple co - founder , published on Monday , Murdoch pressed Jobs to allow his company access to data collected about Daily subscribers , but caved in after Jobs refused .
"" We would prefer to own the subscribers , and we pushed for that , "" Murdoch told Jobs 's biographer Walter Isaacson . ""
But Steve would n't do a deal on those terms , so I said , ' Okay , let 's get on with it . '
We did n't see any reason to mess around .
He was n't going to bend â€ “
and I would n't have bent if I were in his position
â€ “
so I just said yes .
"" Is the media mogul softening in his old age ?"
2011-10-24,"Steve Jobs believed the "" Antennagate "" controversy around the launch of the iPhone 4 last year was part of a smear campaign by smartphone rivals Google and Motorola , according to an authorised biography of the Apple co - founder .
Jobs first reaction to the issue , which saw a small number of iPhone 4 users lose signal if they held the phone in a certain way , was that Google and Motorola were trying to "" shoot Apple down "" , according to the book , published on Monday .
He was apparently only moved to tackle the problem after Tim Cook , who replaced Jobs as Apple chief executive five weeks before his death , quoted someone who warned that Apple was in danger of "" becoming the new Microsoft , complacent and arrogant "" .
Apple called an emergency press conference to deal with the iPhone 4 antenna media frenzy after its launch in July last year .
Jobs offered a free rubber "" bumper "" to iPhone 4 owners affected by the issue , which saw signal drop dramatically when the metal antenna on the bottom and left sides of the phone was gripped by users .
According to the new biography by Walter Isaacson , Jobs was on holiday with his family in Hawaii when the media storm broke .
Jobs 's first reaction was "" defensive "" , according to Isaacson , who said that the Apple co - founder became "" emotionally anguished "" at suggestions that the company he co - founded was arrogant in refusing to immediately address the problem .
The book says that Jobs told Art Levinson , the chairman of Genentech and Apple board member , "" Fuck this , it 's not worth it , "" when he was told not to take the criticism personally . ""
Finally , Tim Cook was able to shake him out of his lethargy , "" the biography adds .
"" He quoted someone as saying that Apple was becoming the new Microsoft , complacent and arrogant .
The next day Jobs changed his attitude . '
Let 's get to the bottom of this , ' he [ Jobs ] said .
"" Jobs then flew to the Apple 's headquarters in Cupertino , California , to get internal data about the dropped calls and scrambled to organise an emergency press conference .
After the press conference , Jobs told Isaacson that he sounded "" too annoyed "" when on - stage , but that the media frenzy was overblown . ""
This is blown so out of proportion that it 's incredible , "" he told his official biographer .
The return rate for the iPhone 4 turned out to be just 1.7 % of customers , according to the book , which is less than a third of the return rate for the iPhone 3GS ."

2011-10-25,"Has Android copied elements from Apple 's iOS ?
It 's not a matter that Google 's senior managers for the Android operating system want to get involved in .
Hugo Barra , product management director for Android at Google , insisted in London on Tuesday that he had n't heard the revelations that emerged last Friday from the Steve Jobs biography : that the late Apple chief executive "" swore to destroy Android "" , and was so furious at what he saw as copying implemented in Android 2.1 on HTC phones released in January 2010 that he summoned Eric Schmidt to a meeting in March and said he wanted it stopped . ""
He said that ? "" said Barra , sounding astonished .
He said that he had been travelling and had not heard the stories .
When given detail about them – and asked whether he would say that any elements in the latest version of Android , such as the two - line preview of emails in the Gmail app ( found in Apple 's iPhone email program since 2007 ) , or the "" quick response "" buttons at the bottom of the email app ( almost identical in order and purpose to those in Apple 's iPhone email program ) , or the provision of a shortcut to the camera from the phone 's lock screen ( first seen in Windows Phone 7 in October 2010 iOS 5 previews in June ) , or the extra features added to the Notifications bar in Android – were copying iOS , he responded : "" I 'm not going to get into this . ""
Barra declined to answer when asked Google had implemented a "" feature freeze "" on Ice Cream Sandwich , the new version of Android which will be implemented in phones due for delivery from next month .
A "" feature freeze "" is the point at which no new features are added to code , so that it can be tested and refined : "" That 's an internal matter , "" he said .
Barra joined Google 's Android effort in December 2010 , and was key in the development of Ice Cream Sandwich , which is version 4.0 of Android .
He said that a key aim was to improve the user experience of Android , and that work on figuring out what to do and how , if at all , to change it had included wide - scale testing with both existing users of Android and non - users to find out what they found difficult or wanted to see .
"" A lot of the coding [ of Ice Cream Sandwich ] was concurrent with that of Honeycomb [ which was released to manufacturers in February 2011 ] "" , Barra said .
The "" gold master "" version of Ice Cream Sandwich was produced in time for the launch of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus last week in Hong Kong .
Update : corrected first appearance of camera from lock screen .
Thanks , James Tutt ."
2011-10-26,"From time to time , biography is declared dead .
Certainly the writer Hilary Spurling said so five years ago when she won the Whitbread book of the year prize for her two - volume life of Matisse .
But perhaps she meant the fat literary kind .
For in daily life , biography is everything .
It is not only the stuff of reality television and gossip magazines and the global appeal of the Daily Mail 's gluttonous website : it is also the colour in politicians ' speeches and the come - on in popular science and it underlies the invention of the artist as art .
Even between hard covers , it still sells .
Even a biography of a chief executive .
But then we are talking Steve Jobs .
Once upon a time the personal really was personal .
Actors were supposed to have rackety private lives but no one needed to know about them .
Clement Attlee 's irreproachably conservative youth was of no significance to his government 's radical agenda , and only a small coterie knew at the time that for 20 years Harold Macmillan 's wife Lady Dorothy was in love with and the lover of a Tory colleague .
Now it seems everyone lives with their curtains open â€ “ and yet the more people reveal , the more people want to know .
Jobs sought out his biographer , Walter Isaacson , on the strength of his earlier life of Benjamin Franklin .
He co - operated with him , opening up for the first time about his family , addressing his shocking behaviour in the office , sharing his moments of catastrophe and even selecting photographs in the weeks before he died .
So in a world without secrets , there plainly has to be some other reason to part with the price of a good bottle of wine for the story of a life , and that is all the truer when it is the story the subject has collaborated in telling .
A biography that is authorised risks the deathly hand of sanctity , the sense of an authorial hand stayed by the compact between subject and writer .
The only interesting thing Roy Jenkins told me when I interviewed him about his former cabinet colleague Barbara Castle , of whom I was writing an authorised biography and of whom he thought little , was that I must not publish it until she was dead . ""
It 's impossible to write a good biography when your subject is still alive , "" he admonished .
He himself , he declared magisterially , had made his death a precondition of the publication of his biography .
The death of Jobs was the perfect launch - pad for his biography .
But it overshadows it , too .
In the New York Times , Joe Nocera says the intimacy of the authorised storyteller diminishes the Jobs biography .
How , he asks , can you watch a man die and maintain a sense of distance ?
Sam Leith in the Guardian suggests that it 's not the truth - telling so much as the capacity to be selective that 's missing .
But it would take more than a little criticism to hold down the sales of a book about the "" i "" in the 21st century .
So Jobs , even though he was just an amazingly gifted CEO , was a sure - fire winner .
It is harder to explain why the authorised - but - unauthorised biography of Julian Assange , hero of the world 's subversives , has been such a flop , apparently outsold by a collection of Mills and Boon short stories .
Maybe the publishers , Canongate , misjudged their market .
People who were interested in what made Assange tick would not also buy a book that arguably was a betrayal in itself , published only halfway through its preparation .
But there was more to it than that .
For a start , Assange is not a recently dead hero , but an all - too - alive fugitive from rape allegations whose lack of interpersonal skills has yet to be modified by blistering commercial success .
His stock - in - trade was not to be difficult but irresistible .
It was just to be difficult ..
In fact , if you look at biographies that sell , especially those that sell for months and months , it is hard to detect an obvious pattern .
Royalty is a winner , especially in US sales , and within that broad category Elizabeth I is a top pick .
Hitler or Churchill in the title is always a good wheeze in the Anglophone market .
But no one , probably including its author , would have predicted the extraordinary success of Edmund de Waal 's family saga , The Hare with Amber Eyes , now heading for a year in the Amazon top 20 .
And let 's face it , the huge success of Tony Blair 's memoir A Journey is a sharp lesson of celebrity as commodity .
If in doubt , read Jonathan Margolis on his biography of Lenny Henry for a painful discovery of the importance of biographical sales as an expression of personal success .
Pitching the bestseller ratings of Jobs v Assange says a lot about public attitudes to success and subversion , to the cult of personality and the importance of desirability ( yes , Jobs definitely understood about that ) .
But the results say much more about the glorious bagginess of biography as a form ."
2011-10-29,"The rock'n'roll generation 's era lasted from Heartbreak Hotel to the death of Steve Jobs ( an ex - counterculture dropout whose whole ethos was informed by rock'n'roll , and a love of Dylan and the Beatles , among others ) .
Music was important to us , it was how we defined ourselves and it was what made us different to our parents , who felt alienated by its loudness , nihilism , hedonism and anti - authoritarian stance .
But now all that has come to an end .
My kids ca n't annoy me by playing loud music –
I 'm more likely to annoy them by saying that it 's all been done before , and is n't really any different to the stuff I was listening to when I was their age .
Modern music is one huge buffet from which modern kids can pick and choose any bits they like from the past 50 years .
Everything is accessible and nothing is fresh .
Music just is n't that important any more – or so it seems .
Instead my kids are part of the digital generation , born to the bip - bip - bip of Space Invaders and 80s electro - pop .
Their world revolves around the microchip .
If you buy a new computer , you can take it out of its box , plug it in and instantly you are sitting there , like Captain Kirk , at the helm of an enormously powerful machine that can take you anywhere in the universe .
A modern computer can be your office , your communications device , your reference library , you can listen to music on it , you can make music on it … and , of course , you can play games .
To my kids , computer games are the most important thing in the world .
In the same way that we might have waited for the new Rolling Stones album or the latest Clash single , my kids now wait expectantly for the new Fifa simulation , or the latest Gears Of War , and the amount of time they put into playing these games is terrifying to someone of my generation .
That 's the important part , though .
That is how they 've rebelled .
It is the thing they do that I did not do when I was their age .
I do play a lot of games , but gaming has not completely taken over my life .
For my boys , games are more important than TV , films , music and books .
Because , of course , games incorporate all of those elements so comprehensively and so seductively .
OK , I must stop now and confess that I have no daughters .
Maybe girls are different ?
I know games are n't such a big part of their world ( although the biggest selling and most popular games of all time , such as The Sims and FarmVille , are those that appeal to girls more than boys ) .
And speaking purely subjectively , my wife is obsessed by Angry Birds and Tiny Wings .
Games are not going to go away , they are simply going to become more immersive , more beguiling and more time - devouring .
They are taking over .
So I was delighted when they asked me to be a judge for the new GameCity prize .
GameCity is a computer games festival held annually in Nottingham , and the prize is the first major one of its type .
The idea is to lift games out of the hands of the nerds and industry insiders and award them the cultural status of music , films or books .
The aim is partly to find a way of talking about games , to find a language to stand alongside the languages of film or literary criticism , but it is also to make games respectable and accessible to the wider non - games - playing public .
The range of judges , including musician Nitin Sawhney , actress Frances Barber and Labour MP Tom Watson , reflected this ideal , coming as we did from the fields of music , literature , theatre , academia , politics and journalism .
What we were asked to do was find a game that you could show to someone who had never played anything before and say : "" Look at this : this is what you 've been missing out on , this is what games are capable of .
"" It was an interesting selection as the shortlist had been compiled from suggestions by the industry itself , and was perhaps aimed too much at games nerds .
It was interesting that none of the mega - blockbuster franchises were on the list .
There was no Grand Theft Auto , or Halo , or Red Dead Redemption , no Assassin 's Creed or Call Of Duty ( in some cases because they did n't fit into the prize timeframe ) .
It was a shame that there were no RPGs ( role - playing games ) with stories to tell and huge intricate worlds to explore – nothing like LA Noire to really show the novice gamers just what modern games are capable of .
There was a feeling that the industry insiders who had made the list were perhaps trying too hard to be clever .
In the end we gave the prize to Minecraft , a world - building game that is as simple or as complex as you want to make it .
It seemed to fulfil the criteria of a game that you would want to keep coming back to .
It 's creative , immersive , neatly designed ( everything is a cube ) and will be fondly remembered for a very long time .
It 's a game you get obsessed by and end up playing in your sleep , chopping down trees , mining resources , creating blocks , moving blocks , building blocky castles , avoiding Creepers .
In truth it 's perhaps not so much a game as a creative resource and as it 's played in your web browser the graphics are not hugely complex .
But , for me , that was part of its appeal .
I hate games that use beautiful and elaborate visuals to try to distract from the fact that the gameplay is actually pretty rubbish .
I would much rather a game plays well but does n't necessarily look amazing ( though the best games do both ) .
As an author who also plays games , and the father of three boys who read books and play games , I often get asked whether I think games will kill off the novel , and the answer is no , of course they wo n't .
Books have survived the coming of films and TV , rock'n'roll and sudoku , and they will survive the coming of computer games .
But they will be influenced by them , just as all those other media had their own impact and influence on books and , let 's not forget , were hugely influenced by them .
The best games have taken stuff from books ( where would computer games be without Tolkien , for instance ? ) and any novelist worth their salt should be taking stuff from games .
What you do n't want are books that slavishly replicate the experience of playing a game because , well , why not just go and play a game instead ?
In the same way , you do n't want a game that gets bogged down with interminable cut - scenes and has only one , very rigid , way of being played .
There are cleverer and more elegant ways of designing them , as demonstrated by the brilliant GTA series .
I am fully aware that if I write a book for kids , however , I am competing for their time and attention with computer games .
I know that my books have to give young readers the same kick they get out of playing Call Of Duty :
Black Ops in zombie mode .
So they are as full of action and adventure , bloodshed and zombies as any Xbox game , but they also do the one thing that games can not do –
they put you inside the minds of characters so that you can understand how they think and feel .
That 's the essential difference between books and games .
Games create worlds for you to play about in .
The best of them are about you , the player .
You are either God , in control of everything , or you are a grunt on the battlefields of the second world war , desperately fighting to stay alive .
The best books are the ones that are about other people .
Novels get inside people in a way that no other medium can .
Reading , whether it 's from the pages of a book or the screen of a Kindle , is a very intimate , private and immersive experience , utterly different to any other medium .
And that is why we will always read .
And when we are not reading , we will play games .

2011-10-31,"The last words of the late , much - lauded and much - quoted Steve Jobs have been revealed almost a month after the Apple co - founder died at the age of 56 .
Jobs , who once memorably described death as "" very likely the single best invention of life "" , departed this world with a lingering look at his family and the simple , if mysterious , observation : ""
Oh wow .
Oh wow .
Oh wow . ""
Details of his final moments came from his sister Mona Simpson , who has allowed the New York Times to publish the eulogy she delivered at his memorial service on 16 October .
In it , she explains how she rushed to Jobs 's bedside after he asked her to come to see him as soon as possible . ""
His tone was affectionate , dear , loving , but like someone whose luggage was already strapped onto the vehicle , who was already on the beginning of his journey , even as he was sorry , truly deeply sorry , to be leaving us , "" she writes .
When she arrived , she found Jobs surrounded by his family â€ “
"" he looked into his children 's eyes as if he could n't unlock his gaze , "" â€ “ and managing to hang on to consciousness she said .
However , he began to deteriorate . ""
His breathing changed .
It became severe , deliberate , purposeful .
I could feel him counting his steps again , pushing farther than before .
This is what I learned : he was working at this , too .
Death did n't happen to Steve , he achieved it . ""
After making it through one final night , wrote Simpson , her brother began to slip away . ""
His breath indicated an arduous journey , some steep path , altitude .
He seemed to be climbing . ""
But with that will , that work ethic , that strength , there was also sweet Steve 's capacity for wonderment , the artist 's belief in the ideal , the still more beautiful later . ""
Steve 's final words , hours earlier , were monosyllables , repeated three times . ""
Before embarking , he 'd looked at his sister Patty , then for a long time at his children , then at his life 's partner , Laurene , and then over their shoulders past them . ""
Steve 's final words were : '
Oh wow .
Oh wow .
Oh wow . ' ""
Simpson , a novelist and English professor , also used the eulogy to pay tribute to some of her late brother 's beliefs â€ “ and idiosyncrasies .
"" Novelty was not Steve 's highest value , "" she writes .
"" Beauty was .
For an innovator , Steve was remarkably loyal .
If he loved a shirt , he 'd order 10 or 100 of them .
In the Palo Alto house , there are probably enough black cotton turtlenecks for everyone in this church . ""
Although the precise meaning of Jobs 's ultimate utterance is hard to pin down , it will further fuel interest in a man who continues to captivate the business and creative worlds even after death .
His biography , written by Walter Isaacson , is topping many book charts and is even tipped to become the bestselling book on Amazon this year .
The company 's latest offering , the iPhone 4S , is faring less well , however , with many users complaining of rapid battery drain on their new smartphones ."
2011-11-01,"There may not have been overnight queues of fans like those for the release of a new iPhone or iPad , but Steve Jobs produced another hit with the final work to bear his name : the only authorised biography of the Apple co - founder soared to the top of the UK bestseller charts in the week of its release , according to sales figures released on Tuesday .
Walter Isaacson 's critically acclaimed biography , published 19 days after Jobs 's death , sold more than 37,000 copies â€ “ more than any other fiction or nonfiction paperback or hardback in its first five days on sale , according to Nielsen Bookscan , the official industry measurement system for retail sales .
The BookScan figures include sales of physical books from the online retailer Amazon , where the hardcover version , on sale at half the suggested Â£25 price , has topped Amazon 's bestseller charts since it was released on 24 October .
They do not however include electronic versions of the book , which was 15th in Amazon 's Kindle downloads chart , behind the Chris Evans autobiography , Memoirs of a Fruitcake , which was released on 14 October .
The book is already the 27th bestselling biographies of the year , a category led by Kate McCann 's story about the abduction of her daughter Madeleine .
Released in May , that sold more than 72,000 copies in the three days after it was released , and has so far sold 242,000 .
Steve Jobs :
The Exclusive Biography , published in the UK by the Little Brown book group , outsold the second most popular book in the Nielsen charts
â€
“ Kathryn Stockett 's novel
The Help â€ “ by more than 15,000 copies .
Jon Howells , spokesman for Waterstone 's , said the Jobs biography was shaping up to be easily one of the biggest selling books for Christmas .
"" This sounds like a phenomenal first week sale for a biography , "" Howells said .
"" Usually when you see huge sales for a book about a life story it 's an autobiography which the subject is usually promoting .
When it 's a biography you do n't usually see such massive sales .
"" It shows just how incredibly interesting Steve Jobs is and how the fandom of Apple is translating from iPods and iPhones and into a book about the cult of Steve Jobs .
There is no doubt that it will be easily the biggest biography sale of the week and one of the big books for Christmas . """
2011-11-04,""" This is an authorised biography , commissioned by Jobs shortly after he was diagnosed with cancer in 2003 .
Given Jobs 's controlling nature and his often vicious defence of his privacy , there were grounds for fear that the official life might be an in - house whitewash …
Nothing could be further from the truth . ""
Tim Martin in the Daily Telegraph found Walter Isaacson 's unsparing Steve Jobs "" riveting "" , written "" with a pacy , demotic style "" .
According to Richard Waters in the FT , the "" Jobs seen here is unmistakably the product of two forces that were sweeping through the San Francisco Bay area in the 1960s and 1970s .
One was the counterculture , the other the wave of technological innovation that spread through Silicon Valley
…
Isaacson 's exhaustive account deserves the wide readership it will undoubtedly get . ""
The Sunday Times 's Bryan Appleyard noted that "" unlike previous Isaacson biographies , notably of Einstein , the book has a rushed feel .
Towards the end he is simply ticking off a list of product launches and medical problems . ""
In spite of this , Isaacson has "" justly honoured "" Jobs , "" if not with the last word , then certainly with a good word "" .
Don DeLillo writes "" a highly stylised prose that marries a clean , chilly style to a kind of mysticism "" , so Chris Power suggested in the Times that short stories – as showcased in the new collection , The Angel Esmeralda – should be "" hospitable to the heightened reality he likes to occupy "" .
Indeed the work has "" the irresistible , unsolvable riddle of being alive in the world "" .
In the Daily Telegraph Edmund Gordon praised a "" robustly brilliant "" set of stories , which exhibits a "" continuity of accomplishment and tone …
It is the strange , obsessive quality of DeLillo 's prose that provides the common thread … this collection will provide manna to his admirers , and serve as the perfect introduction for those who have yet to discover his obsessive world . ""
John Banville in the FT noted too that although the stories range across three decades , the "" style and quality are remarkably consistent throughout , as if DeLillo the writer had sprung fully formed into the world and had no need of or inclination towards progress , or modification , or stylistic innovation "" .
Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith have made headlines with their theory , outlined in Van Gogh :
The Life , that the painter did n't commit suicide .
As Michael Prodger explained in the Sunday Times , it "" was n't Van Gogh who pulled the trigger but a 16-year - old boy holidaying in the town of Auvers near Paris where the painter was living "" .
Doubters should know that "" the American authors have done their homework .
Their belt - and - braces book is in every sense monumental : it was 10 years in the making , and even devised special software to cross - search their database of 100,000 digital notecards .
Oh , and they had a team of eight researchers and 18 translators .
"" The result is a "" fascinating and fastidious "" book .
Martin Herbert in the Daily Telegraph was also positive : in "" what amounts to a massive study in psychological profiling , Naifeh and White Smith set up a tragically flawed figure
…
At once a model of scholarship and an emotive , pacy chunk of hagiography , Van Gogh
: The Life swallows archives whole to argue that the tempestuous , tragic , romantic figure of the artist we always had was the correct one , the main difference being that his exit was probably in keeping with the majority of his terrible , yet impossibly fruitful , three - and - a - half decades on earth : beyond his control .

2011-11-09,"Mobile Flash is being killed off .
The plugin that launched a thousand online forum arguments and a technology standoff between Apple and the format 's creator , Adobe , will no longer be developed for mobile browsers , the company said in a note that will accompany a financial briefing to analysts .
Instead the company will focus on development around HTML5 technologies , which enable modern browsers to do essentially the same functions as Flash did but without relying on Adobe 's proprietary technologies , and which can be implemented across platforms .
The existing plugins for the Android and BlackBerry platforms will be given bug fixes and security updates , the company said in a statement first revealed by ZDNet .
But further development will end .
The decision also raises a question mark over the future of Flash on desktop PCs .
Security vulnerabilities in Flash on the desktop have been repeatedly exploited to infect PCs in the past 18 months , while Microsoft has also said that the default browser in its forthcoming Windows 8 system , expected at the end of 2012 , will not include the Flash plugin by default .
Apple , which in the third quarter captured 5 % of the world market , does not include Flash in its computers by default .
John Nack , a principal product manager at Adobe , commented on his personal blog ( which does not necessarily reflect Adobe views ) that : "" Adobe saying that Flash on mobile is n't the best path forward [ is n't the same as ] Adobe conceding that Flash on mobile ( or elsewhere ) is bad technology .
Its quality is irrelevant if it 's not allowed to run , and if it 's not allowed to run , then Adobe will have to find different ways to meet customers ' needs . ""
Around 250 m iOS ( iPhone , iPod Touches and iPad ) devices have been sold since 2007 .
There are no clear figures for how many are now in use .
More recently Larry Page , chief executive of Google , said that a total of 190 m Android devices have been activated .
It is not clear how many of those include a Flash plugin in the browser .
At the start of 2011 , around 20 m devices had Flash in the browser , Adobe said , and it expected that by the end of this year the total would be 200 m .
"" Our future work with Flash on mobile devices will be focused on enabling Flash developers to package native apps with Adobe Air for all the major app stores , "" Adobe said in the statement .
"" We will no longer adapt Flash Player for mobile devices to new browser , OS version or device configurations .
"" Some of our source code licensees may opt to continue working on and releasing their own implementations .
We will continue to support the current Android and PlayBook configurations with critical bug fixes and security updates .
"" The decision comes as Adobe plans to cut 750 staff , principally in North America and Europe .
An Adobe spokesperson declined to give any figures for the extent of layoffs in the UK .
The company reiterated its expectation that it will meet revenue targets for the fourth quarter .
The reversal by Adobe â€ “ and its decision to focus on the open HTML5 platform for mobile â€ “ brings to an end a long and tumultuous row between Apple and Adobe over the usefulness of Flash on the mobile platform .
The iPhone launched in 2007 without Flash capability , as did the iPad in 2010 .
Steve Jobs , then Apple 's chief executive , and Apple 's engineers insisted that Flash was a "" battery hog "" and introduced security and stability flaws ; Adobe countered that it was broadly implemented in desktop PCs and used widely on the web .
Jobs 's antagonism was partly driven , his biography reveals , by Adobe 's reluctance after he rejoined Apple in 1996 to port its movie - editing programs to the Mac and to keep its Photoshop suite comparable on the Mac platform with the Windows one .
But Jobs also insisted that mobile Flash failed in the role of providing a good user experience , and also would restrict Apple 's ability to push forward on the iOS platform .
Studies of browser crash reports by Apple 's teams showed that Flash was responsible for a signficant proportion of user problems ; Apple was also not satisfied that a Flash plugin would be available for the first iPhone in 2007 which would not consume more battery power than would be acceptable .
Jobs managed to persuade Eric Schmidt , then Google 's chief executive and a member of the Apple board , to get YouTube to make videos available in the H.264 format without a Flash "" wrapper "" , as was then used for the desktop implementation .
But the disagreements between Apple and Adobe intensified , especially when Android devices began appearing which did use the Flash plugin .
Apple refused to use it , and banned apps from its App Store which tried to use or include Flash .
In "" Thoughts on Flash "" , an open letter published by Jobs in April 2010 , he asserted that "" Flash was created during the PC era â€ “ for PCs and mice .
Flash is a successful business for Adobe , and we can understand why they want to push it beyond PCs .
But the mobile era is about low power devices , touch interfaces and open web standards
â€ “ all areas where Flash falls short . ""
New open standards created in the mobile era , such as HTML5 , will win on mobile devices ( and PCs too ) .
Perhaps Adobe should focus more on creating great HTML5 tools for the future , and less on criticizing Apple for leaving the past behind . ""
Adobe 's chief executive Shantanu Narayen hit back at Jobs , saying that "" Thoughts on Flash "" contained statements about the plugin that were false ( relating to battery drain ) ."

The volume is based on more than 40 interviews with Jobs conducted over two years , as well as interviews with more than 100 family members , friends , adversaries , competitors and colleagues .
Sorkin was personally acquainted with Jobs â€ “ the pair spoke regularly by phone and Sorkin was even asked to write a Pixar movie at one point .
Jobs was a founder of the animation studio and one of its chief financial backers in the early days of the company .
Sorkin turned down the offer , saying he did n't "" know how to tell those stories "" .

2011-12-18,"Has there ever been a better time to be a geek ?
Even before physicists arranged for the God particle to reveal itself at Christmas , the late Steve Jobs had proved that brainiacs can become universally loved and Brian Cox had been named in People magazine 's list of "" sexiest men in the world "" .
In The Social Network , much homelier geeks become insanely rich and thus , although they remain homely , desired by beautiful women .
Dr Alex Hoffman , the reclusive Cern alumnus at the centre of Robert Harris 's terrific new thriller , The Fear Index , finds himself , accompanied by great wealth and a captivating wife , the master of the global financial markets and of their horrible clients .
He is not at all normal , but as one character says , quoting Clinton : "" Normalcy is overrated : most normal people are assholes . ""
For a person like Ed Miliband , circumstances could hardly have been more propitious .
Or they might have been , had he stuck to honest geekdom .
Instead , his supporters have boasted that he "" speaks human "" , a comment that , if sincere , surely tells you more about them than him .
What next for Westminster primacy : a signing chimp ?
Moreover , if it was true , why the incessant making - over ?
Miliband has been dressed up in normal - looking clothes , made to have a normal marriage and to drink a normal pint in a pub , operated on to give him a normal voice , and given a normal book to read : One Day .
He would have done better to study another landmark in the history of geek acceptance , Channel 4 's The Big Bang Theory .
The star of this popular replacement for Friends is a character called Sheldon , an emotionally illiterate particle physicist with an IQ of 187 .
Along with his physics genius buddies , the fictional Sheldon , famous for going to a fancy dress party as the Doppler effect , is credited with a surge in the number of actual British physics students .
He is also a walking masterclass in crushing put - downs to bigger , handsomer , stupider people .
If his cult status indicates potential public tolerance for clever people who combine abnormality and zero social skills with a dismaying lack of humility there seems to be no reason why Mr Milband should not have made his mark .
Nobody has asked him to dress , like Sheldon , as the change in frequency of a wave for an observer moving relative to the wave .
Just making David Cameron look insupportably smug and arrogant would be a success , at this stage .
But last week 's polls , showing growing dissatisfaction with Miliband 's leadership , accompanied by another disastrous Commons performance , establish that this tragic experiment has failed .
Not only does speaking human still elude the younger Miliband , he struggles , as photographs of his strange expressions cruelly illustrate , to master standard non - verbal communication .
With unemployment figures at hideous levels after the chancellor 's dire autumn statement , the Tories find themselves overtaking a party led by a man whom the public consider inferior , in almost all departments , to its Etonian .
Failing , as per , to make any impression on a PMQs at which he should at least have embarrassed Cameron for notching up both enemies and neets , Miliband showed that the public have got him right .
Even after 15 months of practice , with some decent gags prepared , he still lacks the charm and poise to prevail on Cameron 's terms and , what is more devastating , the ideas and intellectual equipment to triumph on his own .
Every week , thanks to this asymmetrical double act , shallowness wins the day .
Reviewing this excruciating encounter , which featured one of Cameron 's favourite taunts , "" it 's not like we 're brothers or anything "" , some concluded that Miliband 's fratricide made him eternally vulnerable .
The truth , surely , is that any evidence of superior ability and vision on Miliband 's part could have vindicated his ruthlessness to a brother we never much liked anyway .
Instead , the polls – and any appearance by D Miliband – repeatedly suggest that he destroyed the senior geek for nothing .
Fourteen months since Ed 's victory , courtesy of unions he recently counselled not to strike , have not been long enough for him to identify beliefs to which he alluded in his victory speech , as running "" through everything I do "" .
Whatever these mysterious convictions may be , they could not be better applied at this stage than to organising his replacement by Yvette Cooper , the Labour party 's only conceivable solution to David Cameron .
For her part , the timing might be no better now than it was in 2010 , when she said her children were too young to make such a commitment .
But for now , there is no other contender .
Electoral humiliation already looms and if she waits too long , the much - hyped Chuka Umunna will come along and Labour still wo n't have its first woman leader .
Is it impertinent to suggest that Mr Balls , considering his recent contributions to the economic debate , might be more useful at home , where he could also find more time to weep in front of Antiques Roadshow and One Man and His Dog , to name just some of his appointment TV ?
If she is any kind of patriot , Cooper hardly has a choice .
You do not have to be a Labour supporter to cringe at debates , at a time of economic extremis , in which Cameron 's wee jest , about Labour wanting a new leader for Christmas passes for some Churchillian gem .
As demonstrated in her conference speech , Today interviews and demolition of Theresa May during their great borders stand - off , Cooper is more fluent than Miliband and more plausible than her husband , but even without opening her mouth , her presence alone would be a huge , possibly insurmountable obstacle to Cameron 's ad hominem attacks .
True , the Ballses extracted some tremendous expenses , by way of house - flipping – but is that a failing on which the wisteria - clearing Cameron , employer of fellow - flippers , would want to focus ?
Unable to taunt and scoff at her in Flashman style , or to patronise her , using his "" calm down dear""/""lady 's frustration "" mode , what would be Cameron 's tactics for crushing an equally intelligent , unimpressed woman whose weakest personal spot is her husband 's contribution to the debt crisis ?
Given that any hint of sexism would , instantaneously aggravate his own most glaring problem that of systematically alienating women ?
Certainly , a degree of humourlessness , noted even by Cooper 's sympathisers , could if unchecked be turned to Cameron 's and hostile sketchwriters ' advantage .
Wo n't she ever lighten up ?
Reassuringly , for those fearing another "" speaks human "" calamity , she appears to repress warmth , rather than actually require a transplant .
A look at Cooper 's pre-1997 Independent columns , before she was suddenly selected for Castleford , confirms that she did indeed write in approachable human , even about economics .
Among other themes to exercise her were educational unfairness , callous misconceptions about ME ( from which she temporarily suffered ) , relations between the sexes and idiotic statements about youthful political disenchantment .
"" Why vote when you could be snogging ?
"" she asked .
"" Politics is n't cool and it is n't sexy . ""
Nonetheless , one might argue , it urgently deserves something better than Ed Miliband ."
2011-12-20,"In our end of year review we look at the biggest stories in tech from 2011 , and also look into our crystal balls to see what treats 2012 might have in store .
Aleks Krotoski , Charles Arthur and TechCrunch Europe 's Mike Butcher begin by looking at the effect social networks such as Twitter and Facebook had on the revolutions and protests in the Middle East this year , as well as the effect of BlackBerry 's BBM on the UK riots in August .
The team look back to the death of Steve Jobs and elsewhere review another amazing year for Apple – despite that sad news , the company has been very productive in the last year , Siri and iCloud are analysed .
This is in contrast to the terrible year for RIM and HP , and more mixed fortunes for Nokia in 2011 –
Aleks recalls Stephen Elop 's burning platform memo to the mobile phone manufacturer 's employees , while Charles highlight 's RIM 's blunders with network outages and the launch of the Playbook blighting their year .
And Mike offers some thoughts on the flip - flopping at HP who this year decided to ditch PC manufacturing ... and then reversed that decision , ditching their mobile and tablet lines in the process .
There 's also a look at the year for Google – changes at the top of the company , Android being dogged by patent battles as well as the launch of Google+ , and there 's a report card on the government 's Tech City initiative .
Keith Stuart brings us a report on the year in games – the launch of the Nintendo 3DS and Modern Warfare 3 are highlights – as well as social gaming and the hacking of Sony 's PlayStation network .
The panel also pick out a few themes that may or may not be big in 2012 - 3D and Smart ( internet connected ) TV , the launch of Ultrabooks , the effect of the London Olympics and new games hardware .

What will 2011 be remembered for ?
The death of Steve Jobs .
Love Apple or loathe it , he did manage to revolutionise a number of industries through an uncanny knack of perfect timing and design , as well as a knack of locking customers into closed , propitiatory systems .
The challenge for Apple now is to continue his product roadmap , properly into televisions and beyond that create new products that in that makes us pay a little bit more for things we did n't know we needed , but then suddenly ca n't imagine living without .
I think 2011 was also the year that Google proved it understands people , not just engineering with the launch of Google+ .
It remains to be seen whether it will prove to be a long term rival to Facebook .
That 's a hard feat to achieve but it tapped into a growing public unease about how much is being shared online and to whom .
The innovations it pioneered have in a lot of ways already been taken up by Facebook .
I 'll leave it to others to talk about phone hacking .
â€¢
What was your best and worst moment On a personal basis , it was the fascinating trip to Microsoft 's HQ in Redmond to see behind the scenes at their research labs , touching , waving and talking to the future .
It provided a glimpse of how a company too easily written off by some in the tech press continues to be gazing at the future , working on the sort of innovations that will shape our digital lives in the years to come .
My worst tech moment was discovering that my converted new iPhone 4S and its key feature is n't up to much , in the UK at least .
ITN gave me mine a few weeks after I 'd been playing with my American friends ' phones in the US .
Location - based services do n't work here and in a sense , it takes away from the clever stuff that phone could do for you .
â€¢
What 's your hot tip for 2012 ?
Facebook going public .
It will probably be the biggest flotation ever in US corporate history and the success of that stock will determine the future market for internet investments around the world .
When it does float , it will complete its transformation into a proper , grown - up company .
Mark Zuckerberg , already responsible for 850 million peoples ' private information , will also in a funny way have to shoulder the future property of millions of Americans ' pension funds .
If Facebook ca n't continue its revenue growth , as such a large player , it will bring into question the future performance of all of the most recent generation of internet - based listed companies ."
2012-01-01,"Phil Fearnley , general manager of news and knowledge at BBC Future Media , predicts an explosive year for takeup of new technology as the Olympic games come to London .
What will 2011 be remembered for ?
No doubt when technical historians look back on 2011 the year will be overshadowed by the birth of the tablet and the premature death of its inventor Steve Jobs .
The tablet , apps world and the whole ecosystem generated by it made Apple the largest company in the world at one point .
Rightly so .
I am not a Mac user or an Apple acolyte per se , but I am an admirer of creative genius .
Steve Jobs was a creative genius who time and time again , turned the world on its head .
Enough said .
What was your best and worst moment ?
The launch of the BBC News product on multiple connected TV 's including Samsung and Panasonic as well as launching Android versions , was a major highlight of the year .
The News product is now on all 4 screens - mobile , IPTV , tablet and desktop and is more accessible now than ever before .
I am also hugely proud and excited by the recent re - launch of the BBC homepage and the BBC Weather sites .
Both show significant design changes and feature enhancements .
More fundamentally they are built on robust platforms and in a way which , in the future will allow us to move away from the big bang launches of old , and move to a more frequent iterative release cycle .
We will be able to deliver more innovation more consistently more quickly .
My worst moment was seeing a 3D movie in the cinema with my kids and watching them taking their glasses off to see better !
One day I am sure 3D will truly arrive - but it 's not quite there yet .
What 's your hot tip for 2012 ?
The Olympic Games in London will provide the perfect backdrop for an explosion in take up of digital services and in the process see digital consumption go mainstream .
As the digital rights holder for the games , the BBC has a responsibility to exploit the games and our rights across all screens .
We intend to make the digital experience of the Olympics the best it can possibly be – delivering more hours of the games than ever before , on more devices .
We will bring a seamless and simple user experience across all screens .
Viewers will see innovations in the way IP and broadcast streams and the way data and video will interact .
Our audiences will love the way the action from the Olympic Games will unfold in front of them .
The Olympic Games in London in 2012 will be remembered as the first truly digital Olympics ."
2012-01-04,"A Canadian man who realised that he had left his passport at home as he approached the US border managed to cross over by using his Apple iPad .
In a novel deployment of the tablet that may have come as a surprise even to the late Steve Jobs , Martin Reisch said that a mildly annoyed US border officer made an exception after he was handed the iPad displaying a scanned copy of the forgotten passport .
Reisch was a half hour from the border between the US and the Canadian province of Quebec when he decided to try to gain entry rather than turn back and make a two - hour trek back home to Montreal to fetch his passport .
He told the officer he was heading to the US to drop off Christmas gifts for his friend 's kids .
He said that the true story , the scanned passport and his driver 's license helped him get through last week .
"" I thought I 'd at least give it a try , "" said Reisch , according to reports by the Associated Press .
"" He took the iPad into the little border hut .
He was in there a good five , six minutes .
It seemed like an eternity .
When he came back he took a good long pause before wishing me a Merry Christmas . ""
US Customs and Border Protection says it only accepts a passport , an enhanced driver 's license or a Nexus pass from Canadian citizens entering at land crossings .
The list does n't mention facsimiles , like scans and photocopies .
Reisch , 33 , said he took a scanned photo of his passport years ago in case it was ever lost or stolen while travelling .
He said he also successfully used the passport on his iPad to get through Canadian Customs on the way home later that day .
However , the 33-year - old said he doubted that he would get away with it again and would take his passport next time , although he hopes border officials will eventually make digital identification an official form of travel document .
"" I see the future as 100 % being able to cross with your identity on a digital device
it 's just a matter of time , "" he said ."
2012-01-08,"Among the many criticisms lobbed at Microsoft by Apple 's late founder Steve Jobs , one of the best remembered was about design : "" They have absolutely no taste .
And I do n't mean that in a small way , I mean that in a big way , in the sense that they do n't think of original ideas , and they do n't bring much culture into their products .
"" The latest version of Microsoft 's operating system for smartphones is a revolutionary product for its parent company because it is considered to have both taste and culture .
Windows Phone uses the company 's Metro interface , whose graphics are so cutting - edge they can make the iPhone seem out of date .
Its creators , Microsoft 's in - house design team , claim it is changing not only how their products appear , but the company 's philosophy .
Windows 8 , the latest version of Microsoft 's world - dominating PC software , will be released later this year and has been given a Metro makeover .
The worry is that Microsoft has discovered the power of good taste a little too late .
Windows software is installed on 95 % of the world 's estimated 1.5bn home and business PCs , but in the western world sales of laptop and particularly desktop computers have reached a plateau .
When Windows 8 is released later this year , millions of Microsoft customers will ask themselves whether they should spend money upgrading an old computer , or treat themselves to new one .
For many , that new machine is likely to be not a PC but a tablet , and until now Apple has been the only company capable of selling tablets in large numbers .
"" The ground is shifting under Microsoft , "" says Jean - Louis Gassée , former head of Apple Macintosh development and contender for the chief executive role in the late 1980s .
"" The world will no longer be PC - centric .
We will see growing numbers of smartphones and tablets and we as users will spend more time on these devices .
PCs will be reserved for the tasks of content creation .
"" This could also be the year when investors form a view on whether long - serving Steve Ballmer – the 30th employee Microsoft hired and its chief executive for the last decade – should continue in the top job .
Ballmer 's efforts to catch up with Google on web search , and play a meaningful part in the mobile world , have so far proved fruitless .
Windows Phone took just 1.5 % of the mobile operating system market in the third quarter of 2011 , according to research firm Gartner , compared to over 50 % for Android and 15 % for Apple .
These setbacks have not mattered while Microsoft remains dominant in PCs – but all that could change if PCs no longer dominate .
Research firm IDC forecasts that in affluent western economies , desktop computer sales will slip from 57.8 m a year in 2010 to 49.8 m by 2015 .
Laptop sales dipped by some 7 m in 2011 ; they are expected to recover this year , but go on to grow at a far slower pace than previously .
Sales of tablets are heading the other way , rising from 17.6 m in 2010 to 77.4 m last year and a projected 326 m in 2015 .
"" This is going to be one of the most important years in Microsoft 's history , "" says Gartner analyst David Cearley .
"" The desktop era has been supplanted by a new mobile computing era and it makes Windows 8 the most critical version of Microsoft 's operating system we 've seen in a long time . ""
Cearley says the transition is "" as big , if not bigger "" than that made when Microsoft moved from its command - line operating system DOS – where words without graphics appeared teletext - style on a black screen – to the Windows format .
If Windows 8 fails to become a credible alternative to Apple and Android , will Ballmer be replaced ?
"" It 's too early to say , "" he says .
"" If it fails badly , the market in general is going to be taking a very close look at Microsoft and that could include changes in management . ""
The noises surrounding Windows 8 , which is in limited trial circulation with opinion formers , are far from negative .
Its interface should help : the Industrial Designers Society of America named Metro in its mobile phone form "" best in show "" last year .
As few will have used it , here is a brief description .
With white text on a simple background , it uses large type as the main visual element and for the controls .
Windows , boxes and frames are banished .
Elsewhere , the usual motionless app icons are replaced with animated tiles which draw in content from whatever they represent – a Twitter feed , the weather , photo albums .
The name "" Metro "" refers to the uncluttered signs seen on the public transport system in Seattle , where Microsoft is based .
Last month , design director Steve Kaneko , who has been with the company 20 years , suggested Metro had started to change the Microsoft philosophy .
"" We have a smarter idea of who we are and who we are n't , and this goes back to Metro .
It turned out to be something very authentic and unique to Microsoft and that confidence is attracting better designers , better developers and better programme managers , because they sense that we are no longer looking over our shoulders at other companies . ""
Metro is being applied to the Xbox games console dashboard as well as phones and PCs , to imitate Apple 's strategy of devices that are compatible and members of the same family .
"" We are reducing the noise , "" Kaneko said .
"" Content and information is getting denser and denser and the only way to prepare ourselves for the future is to strip ourselves out of the equation , so that what you are seeing is all about you and not about us . ""
But early versions of Windows 8 suggest that Microsoft will , for now at least , steer clear of changing those elements that are must - haves for its business user base .
Microsoft Office seems to have been relegated to an app , but when it is fired up brings a more traditional Windows look back to the screen .
Crucially , Windows 8 will be compatible both with the Intel chips predominantly found in PCs , and with chips designed by the British group ARM , whose products are now found in almost every smartphone and tablet .
Microsoft has taken what Gassée calls a "" Swiss army knife approach "" ; not necessarily a good thing , he believes .
"" If Microsoft tries too hard to have their PC and their tablet rolled into one , it 's going to be a failure . ""
In fact , analysts say Windows 8 has been primarily designed for tablets , and that most PC users , be they at home or at work , will remain with earlier versions for now and update in a few years with Windows 9 .
When Windows 7 was released in 2009 , it boosted full - year revenues in the consumer software division by $ 3.5bn to $ 18.5bn .
That is unlikely to be repeated this time : Gartner predicts Microsoft will have no more than a 20 % share of the mobile market in three to five years .
But analyst Mark Moerdler at Bernstein Research says the gloom surrounding Microsoft 's share price , which , at $ 28 , is down by nearly a quarter on its five - year high of $ 38 , is based on a doomsday scenario that will not come to pass .
"" We believe threats from tablet growth , alternate operating systems and cloud computing are manageable . ""
Microsoft revenues rose 12 % to nearly $ 70bn last year .
Lower uptake of tablets in favour of PCs in emerging markets , and sales of its own tablets , will maintain momentum , with Moerdler predicting that Windows will see average revenue growth of 6 % until 2015 .
Entertainment devices , driven by the enduring popularity of the Xbox , will grow 8 % .
Having seen off the threat from Jobs 's Macintosh in the 1980s , and developed an internet browser still holding its own against rival offerings from Google and others , Microsoft has proved that , when faced with competition , it can fight hard and win .
If Metro does not save Microsoft , it should at least ensure a graceful decline ."
2012-01-10,"Apple 's late founder Steve Jobs created the world 's most valuable company and was paid just $ 5 in the last years of his life
â€ “ but his successor Tim Cook , unknown outside Silicon Valley until his elevation to the top job last summer , has been awarded a $ 378 m ( Â£244 m ) pay jackpot .
In the clearest sign yet that the wage bills for America 's leading executives are ramping back to eye - watering pre - credit crunch levels , Cook 's 2011 rewards , disclosed yesterday , put him in pole position to become the year 's highest boardroom earner .
Cook took home $ 900,017 in salary during 2011 and a further $ 900,000 in cash from an incentive scheme .
But the bulk of his earnings will come from a windfall award of 1 m Apple shares that tie him to the company for the next decade .
On 24 August last year , to mark his promotion when Jobs retired , Cook was given stock then worth $ 376 m , half of which will be handed over in 2016 and half in 2021 .
But by the time Cook takes delivery of the shares they might be worth substantially more .
Every time Apple 's share price gains a dollar , its chief executive 's paper fortune will increase by more than $ 1 m .
Previous awards of shares mean a total of 1.376 m shares are now owned by Cook or held in his name .
Because Apple 's price has risen steadily since last August Cook 's shares are already worth $ 550 m .
The shares have no performance criteria attached .
To claim his winnings Cook , who joined Apple in 1998 from Compaq Computer Corporation , must simply remain with the company until 2021 .
The details of Cook 's vast pay package come as the UK government has pledged to bring in new legislation to tackle excessive executive pay .
David Cameron said : "" The market for top people is not working .
It needs to be sorted out . ""
Average pay for the chief executive of a FTSE-100 company climbed 33 % last year and now stands at Â£5.1 m â€ “
but it remains a fraction of boardroom rewards in the US .
"" It 's another planet , "" said Sarah Wilson , chief executive of Manifest , which advises shareholders on corporate governance .
"" The awards are eye - watering in the US and you really do have this cult of the chief executive as superstar .
There is a lot of fear and uncertainty among board members that if they do n't pay these large sums they will not get the people they want .
"" Jobs was granted 5.5 m shares during his lifetime , worth $ 2.3bn to his heirs , but between 2007 and his death last year he received no further awards .
Instead , he collected a nominal annual salary of just $ 1 during the period that produced the first iPhone , the first iPad , and during which Apple 's stock market value doubled .
Cook 's payout is still dwarfed by the $ 646.6 m Jobs received in 2006 , when his last swath of stock options vested , taking his total compensation for the preceding five years to $ 650.17 m .
Apple overtook oil giant Exxon Mobil as the world 's biggest company last summer , and is now valued at $ 394bn on the stock market .
But Cook 's earnings are well ahead of those of Exxon 's chairman and chief executive , Rex Tillerson .
In 2010 , the most recent year for which figures have been disclosed , Tillerson earned $ 29 m in cash and shares , of which $ 5.6 m comprised his salary and bonus for the year ."
2012-01-24,"Apple reported record revenue in its first quarter since the death of Steve Jobs , as iPhone sales continued to soar .

"" Apple 's momentum is incredibly strong , and we have some amazing new products in the pipeline . ""

2012-01-25,"Record sales of iPhones and iPads resulted in record profits at Apple in the final quarter of 2011 , the first since the death of its co - founder , Steve Jobs .
Apple more than doubled its profits : to $ 13.06bn ( £ 8.35bn ) , compared with $ 6bn for the same quarter in 2010 .
The result easily beat analysts ' forecasts , taking pressure off the chief executive , Tim Cook , handpicked by Jobs as his successor .
Last October Apple shares recorded their biggest single - day dollar drop after iPhone sales missed their forecast .
Cook said he was thrilled the company sold a record 37.04 m iPhones in the final quarter of 2011 , a 128 % rise on a year ago .
"" We could have sold more if we 'd had more supply , "" he said .
The recently launched iPhone 4S proved to be the company 's best seller in the quarter .
"" We could not be happier , "" said Cook .
In record sales across nearly all product categories , Apple sold a record 15.43 m iPads over the quarter , more than double a year ago .
It sold 5.2 m Macs during the quarter , a 26 % unit increase .
Only sales of iPods fell , down 21 % year on year to 15.4 m ; however , Apple has enjoyed higher average selling prices as consumers buy more of the iPod Touch .
Cook told analysts that tablets would prove to be a huge market ; they had already surpassed sales of desktop PCs in the US .
He was dismissive of competition in the tablet market , including Amazon 's far cheaper , if less powerful , Kindle Fire .
"" I do n't think limited function tablets are in the same category , "" he said .
"" Last year was supposed to the year of the tablet ; and I think that most people will agree it was the year of the iPad , for the second year in a row .
"" I think it 's remarkable that we 've shifted 55 m iPads , and we 've only been in the market since April 2010 . "" Competition is intensifying however .
Apple this week lost a court battle to have Samsung tablets banned in the Netherlands .
The two firms have been locked in legal battles in almost a dozen countries over smartphones and tablets .

The chief financial officer , Peter Oppenheimer , said the stores made an average $ 17.1 m in the last quarter , up from $ 12 m a year ago , More than 110 m people visited an Apple store over the quarter , and the average store attracted 22,000 visitors per week .
Cook said : "" Apple 's momentum is incredibly strong , and we have some amazing new products in the pipeline . ""
Revenue jumped 73 % to $ 46.3bn , exceeding analysts ' forecasts .

Analysts had forecast revenue of $ 32bn with earnings per share of $ 8.02 , according to consensus forecasts .
Last week Apple launched iBooks 2 for the iPad , a software and online store aimed at shaking up the textbook market by offering interactive books for students .
According to Jobs ' biographer , Walter Isaacson , the Apple founder spent the final years of his life looking at the textbook market .
Oppenheimer said that more than 600,000 copies of its textbook authoring app has been downloaded .
Analysts pushed Apple 's executives on the $ 90bn cash pile that the company has amassed .
Oppenheimer declined to comment on any specific plan but said the company was discussing what to do .

"" What we focus on is making the best product , "" said Cook .
"" We just want to stay ahead . ""

2012-02-01,"Neil Young has claimed he was working with the late Apple boss Steve Jobs on a follow - up to the iPod .
Young said he and Jobs were developing a new device for listening to "" high - resolution audio "" , which would download content "" while you 're sleeping "" . ""
Steve Jobs was a pioneer of digital music , but when he went home he listened to vinyl , "" Young said during an interview at the D : Dive Into Media technology conference .
He and Jobs were apparently both concerned with the dearth of high - quality listening formats for audiophiles , and the two men met to work on new hardware that could store the large music files Young prefers .
Since Jobs 's death in October , Young complained , there is "" not much going on "" .
Young is a notorious opponent of MP3s and other compressed music formats .
He even criticises CDs , which he claims offer only 15 % of the audio information contained on master recordings .
"" What everybody gets [ on an MP3 ] is 5 % of what we originally make in the studio , "" he said .

The 66-year - old singer called on his audience to improve standards for high - fidelity audio and new consumer - friendly playback devices .
The main obstacle to better quality recordings is file size : audiophile - quality songs can take as long as 30 minutes to download , Young said , and current players can store no more than about 30 albums .
"" I have to believe if [ Jobs ] lived long enough he would have tried to do what I 'm trying to do . ""
While Young attacked the internet 's effect on audio standards , he acknowledged its utility as a promotional tool .
"" I look at [ the ] internet as the new radio , "" he explained .
"" Radio [ is ] gone .
Piracy is the new radio ; it 's how music gets around . ""
Young is currently working on two new albums with his long - time on - off backing band Crazy Horse .
He recently updated his website with an epic , 37-minute jam , thought to be taken from these sessions ."
2012-02-07,"An off - Broadway hit about the life of the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs is to appear at this year 's HighTide festival in May , alongside a debut play by the daughter of writer Stephen Poliakoff .
Mike Daisey 's monologue , The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs , which played two extended runs at New York 's Public Theatre in 2011 , segues between Jobs 's life and career and Daisey 's own visit to the Chinese factory where , he claims , around half of the world 's electronic consumer goods are made .
Last October , The New York Times 's theatre critic Charles Isherwood called it , "" a mind - clouding , eye - opening exploration of the moral choices we unknowingly or unthinkingly make when we purchase nifty little gadgets like the iPhone . ""
The 10-day festival in Suffolk also includes the European premiere of 26-year - old Laura Poliakoff 's Clockwork , described as "" a powerful call to arms for a generation of 20-year - olds not considering their own age . ""
HighTide 's artistic director Steven Atkinson will direct the play , Poliakoff 's first since graduating from the National Film and Television School .
Her animated short film Bertie Crisp , co - written with Francesca Adams , has been touring film festivals during the past year .
Now in its sixth year , HighTide festival produces work by emerging playwrights .
Previous productions have subsequently transferred to the Edinburgh Fringe , the National Theatre and the West End .
Founded by Atkinson in 2007 , the organisation joined the Arts Council 's national portfolio in last March 's reshuffle and , from April , will receive an annual grant of Â£200,000 .
Writers to have shown work at HighTide include former poet laureate Andrew Motion , comedian Tom Basden and playwright Joel Horwood .
The Sunday Times named Adam Brace 's Stovepipe , which played at the 2008 festival , as one of the top 10 plays of the last decade .
Other highlights at this year 's festival include the world premiere of Ella Hickson 's latest play Boys , a co - production with Headlong and Southampton 's Nuffield Theatre about five students about to leave university , and Mudlarks , by first - time playwright Vickie Donoghue .
The emerging company Curious Directive , a success at last year 's Edinburgh Fringe with Your Last Breath , will present two short plays written by young playwrights in collaboration with scientists under the title Binary .

2012-02-08,"Even by the seldom conventional standards of the professional football world , the saga of bonuses , offshore bank accounts and a beloved bulldog that has unfolded in the sober confines of Southwark crown court over the last three weeks has been a remarkable one .
As well as lessons in the minutiae of international banking and glimpses of Premier League power play , the jury of eight men and four women has been treated to tales of a lanky but "" still growing "" striker named Peter Crouch ; a young tech entrepreneur called Steve Jobs ; and a News of the World reporter who was threatened with the unusual penalty of having his bollocks sued off .
Scarcely less eclectic were the places mentioned during the proceedings in court , from the mountains of Croatia to a booming Silicon Valley , from the impoverished East End of London to expensive property developments in Portugal , and from the beach at Monaco to a Little Chef outside Portsmouth .
Although the two men sat side by side as defendants , the gaze of both public and press fell not on the self - made Serbian - American tycoon Milan Mandaric , but on Henry James Redknapp , better known as Harry – or ' Arry , depending on your paper of choice .
The fascination with Redknapp is not difficult to fathom .
The 64-year - old Tottenham Hotspur boss , who has been a compelling and controversial figure in English football management for more than three decades , appeared to be exactly the same man in the dock as he is in the dugout and on the TV screen .
Whether smiling and gesticulating at Mandaric or sidling over to the press bench to chat and joke with reporters before the proceedings began , Redknapp remained jovial and relaxed for the majority of his time in court .
Stepping into the witness box appeared only to magnify his personality : the Harry Redknapp who gave hours of evidence was by turns funny and menacing , sarcastic and defensive , modest and arrogant , petulant and charismatic .
At the beginning of the trial , the court was told that Redknapp felt he was all too often made a convenient cockney scapegoat for the sins of others .
His plaintive assertion – "" if there 's any mud to be thrown , I seem to be on the end of it for some reason "" – was supported by a friend who had once apparently told him :
"" Harry , I ca n't believe it 's always you .
The problem with you is you 're named Harry
and you have a cockney accent .
""
Redknapp referred to his humble beginnings in Poplar on several occasions , telling the prosecution he had a very real appreciation of just how large the sums mentioned in court were .
"" I was brought up in the East End of London
… in a very poor family , "" he said .
"" I know it 's a lot of money . ""
He was also happy to share his educational , technological and financial shortcomings – the last of which formed the basis of much of his defence .
"" I write like a two - year - old , "" he told officers in a tape played to the court .
"" I ca n't spell . ""
Nor , he continued , could he work a computer or send a fax , email or text message .
In fact , his life had to be run by his accountant as he was "" completely and utterly disorganised "" – far too disorganised , he added , to be in a position to "" fiddle taxes "" .
He was equally scathing about his investment history , describing himself as "" a bit of a gambler "" who had once nearly wiped out his son Jamie , and even going so far as to urge detectives to ask his solicitor if he had "" ever come across anyone as bad , business - wise "" .
He offered up a further example of his lack of economic nous : his failure to notice that the Sun had not paid him for his column for 18 months .
His personal banker also conceded that Redknapp was perhaps not the most financially savvy individual he had dealt with .
Although Alan Hills did not go quite as far as Redknapp 's barrister in characterising the football boss 's business sense as "" disastrous "" , he admitted Redknapp 's decision to invest £ 250,000 in a failed bid to take over Oxford United – money that was never to be seen again – had been "" very unsuccessful "" .
Redknapp 's testimony , however , was not all self - deprecation .
"" I 'm a fantastic football manager , "" he said at one point , "" [ but ] I 'm not a hard - headed businessman . ""
He also found time to boast , joke and to lash out at the prosecution and the police .
Repeated mention of Crouch – whose profitable sale to Aston Villa in 2002 was central to the case
– permitted Redknapp to indulge in good - natured digs at Mandaric , who had dismissed the striker as "" a basketball player "" because of his height . ""
Crouchy at 6 ft 7 was not exactly his cup of tea , "" Redknapp deadpanned .
"" I said ' I like him , he 's a good player ' .
I said to [ Mandaric ] , he 's a good investment , he 's young ,
he 's developing , he 's getting taller . ""
Laughter also broke out in court when Redknapp mischievously suggested that Mandaric 's QC , Lord ( Ken ) Macdonald , was no fan of his – "" well , he 's an Arsenal supporter , is n't he ?
"" – and when he confessed to being more interested in watching David Beckham than keeping an eye on his finances .
Odder still was the exchange that followed Redknapp 's explanation that he had chosen the password of his Monaco bank account – Rosie47 – to honour his late bulldog Rosie , whom he "" loved to bits "" .
The numbers , he went on , referred to the year of his birth – 1947 – and had been added after he was informed that another customer at the bank had a similar password .
When the prosecutor , John Black QC , jokingly wondered whether that customer also had a dog by the same name , Redknapp expressed indignation . ""
Please , Mr Black , it could be someone 's wife , "" he said , before pausing for a moment 's reflection and adding : "" If she was as nice as Rosie they have got a good wife . ""
At times , though , Redknapp was visibly antagonised by Black 's cross - examination , accusing the barrister of wandering into a labyrinth of bonus conspiracies .
"" You 've got three different bonuses , "" he said .
"" You do n't seem to know where you 're going with it . ""
Twice during his evidence , Redknapp lost his temper .
The first time came when he broke off from what he was saying to accuse DI Dave Manley – the detective who led the City of London police 's investigation into alleged football corruption – of trying to distract him from the well of the court . ""
Mr Manley , will you please stop staring at me , "" he barked at the seated officer .
"" I know you are trying to cause me a problem , OK ?
"" The second occasion came when Black accused him of telling "" a pack of lies "" while under oath by insisting Mandaric had paid the money into his Monaco account as a gesture of friendship and not as a means of avoiding tax . ""
That 's an insult , Mr Black , that 's an insult , "" Redknapp retorted .
All the evidence he had given had been "" the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth , so help me God "" .
Mandaric , in contrast , refused to yield to the pressure of Black 's questioning .
Pushed again and again to admit that the money he paid to Redknapp 's Monaco account was a reward for the Crouch transfer and an attempt to dodge tax , the current Sheffield Wednesday owner merely shook his head .
"" We can go over and over , Mr Black , "" he said .
"" I respect your job and everything
but I can not deviate from the truth .
Simple as that . ""
Mandaric also told the jury of the sadness and damage the allegations had caused him , his family – and his affection for the sport . ""
Unfortunately my enthusiastic tank is going down to empty , "" he said .
"" It 's really sad that I have to defend that for the simple reason that I came here 12 years ago with a lot of enthusiasm for football . ""
Aside from the pair of young women who crept into court one afternoon hoping for a glimpse of the dashing Jamie Redknapp , neither love for Redknapp senior nor devotion to Tottenham Hotspur was in short supply during the trial .
The public gallery was thronged with fans , at least one of whom had wrapped himself in a scarf whose ends were embroidered with the Spurs motto :
Audere est facere .
But even so , the appearance in the dock of two titans such as Harry Redknapp and Milan Mandaric seemed to have given at least one middle - aged man sitting in the gallery reason to ponder the increasingly transient beauty of the game .
"" It 's a business these days , not a sport , "" he sighed to his companion , who answered with a weary nod ."
2012-02-09,"The FBI has released its files on Steve Jobs , Apple co - founder and icon of the business world , painting a picture of a complex man who is described both as "" a deceptive individual "" and one of "" high moral character and integrity "" .
The documents , released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request , were compiled by the FBI when Jobs was being considered for political office in the president 's export council under George Bush Sr 's administration .
Some of the titbits revealed in the 191 pages of documents include that that he was a negligent father who would "" twist the truth and distort reality in order to achieve his goals , "" according to documents released by the FBI .
The FBI interviewed Jobs and at least 29 people who knew him as part of a background check .
Their investigations took place in the 1990s , after Jobs had been fired from Apple and before his triumphant return to the company . ""
Several individuals questioned Mr Jobs ' honesty stating that Mr Jobs will twist the truth and distort reality in order to achieve his goals .
They also commented that , in the past , Mr Jobs was not supportive of [ redacted ] and their daughter ; however , recently has become supportive , "" according to the documents .
Another source characterised Jobs as "" a deceptive individual who is not completely forthright and honest "" .
The files paint a picture of a complicated man , full of contradictions .
One man interviewed by the FBI , who identifies himself as a former "" good friend "" of Jobs , said that while the Apple boss was "" basically an honest and trustworthy person , he is a very complex individual and his moral character is suspect . ""
He said that Jobs "" alienated a large number of people at Apple as a result of his ambition "" .
But none of the witnesses seem to have questioned Jobs ' business abilities .
Two other witnesses said he was "" strong - willed , stubborn , hard - working and driven , which is why they believe he is so successful . ""
He was a man of "" indefatigable energy "" and "" vision "" according to others and would make "" a positive contribution on the national scene . ""
Another said he "" believed the appointee has what it takes to assume a high level political position within the government , which in his opinion , honesty and integrity are not prerequisites to assume such a position "" .
Jobs travelled to India in the mid-1970s and became fascinated by Zen Buddhism , he practised mediation for the rest of his life .
One FBI source said Jobs "" had undergone a change in philosophy by participating in eastern and/or Indian mysticism and religion .
This change apparently influenced the appointee 's personal life for the better . ""
The portrait tallies with that given in Steve Jobs , Water Isaacson 's recent biography of the Apple founder .
Jobs had a "" reality distortion field "" , according to Isaacson , that allowed him to believe , and convince others , that whatever he said was true . ""
Zen awareness was not accompanied by an excess of calm , peace of mind or interpersonal mellowness , "" Isaacson wrote .
At the time of the interview Jobs said he had not used any illegal drugs for five years .
He said he had used marijuana , hashhish and LSD between 1970 - 1974 .
Jobs told the FBI that he was not a member of the communist party or any organisation looking to overthrow the government .
He said he belonged to no organisations other than the New York Athletic Club , an exclusive Manhattan gym , but that he knew nothing about their membership policies as he had never been there .
The documents also contain memos about a $ 1 m bomb threat that was made against Apple on February 7 , 1985 , several months before Apple fired Jobs . ""
An unidentified male caller made a series of telephone calls to [ redacted ] of Apple computer Inc [ â€ ¦ ] and advised that ' devices ' had been placed in homes of captioned individuals [ redacted ] and one million dollars must be paid , "" the FBI wrote .
The caller said he had left instructions about how to defuse the bomns under a table "" next to a candy machine "" in the Hilton Hotel in San Francisco .
No bombs or notes were found .
According to the source , Jobs ' religious leanings led him to live "" more of a spartanlike and at times even monastic existence "" that had "" apparently influenced the appointee 's personal life for the better "" .
The FBI can make its records public after a person 's death .
Jobs died in October after a long battle with a rare form of cancer .
Apple , the maker of the iPhone , iPad , iPod and Mac , is now the world 's most valuable company .
After Jobs 's death , fans flocked to Apple stores around the world , leaving "" iShrines "" to their hero ."
2012-02-14,"A playwright has jeopardised the European premiere of his work by announcing plans to make the script available for performance by any other performer , at any time , anywhere in the world without paying royalties .
Mike Daisey , who wrote The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs , is due to perform the monologue at the HighTide festival in May.
It combines details about the life and career of Steve Jobs with an account of Daisey 's own visit to a factory in Shenzhen , China where Apple products are produced .
Reviewing the original production , the New York Times 's critic Charles Isherwood wrote : "" Anyone who sees Mr Daisey 's show â€ “ and anyone with a cellphone and a moral centre should â€ “ will find it hard to forget the repercussions that our casual purchases can have in the lives of men and women ( and children ) half a world away . ""
Daisey 's announcement yesterday that he will post a full script online , and allow anyone to perform it royalty - free , raises the possibility of the performance being gazumped .
"" The monologue will be released as a PDF , and it comes with very open licences and you can perform it forever , without paying royalties , wherever you want , "" he told the New York Times .
Nonetheless , HighTide 's artistic director Steven Atkinson welcomed the news . ""
Mike believes theatre has a social role , and like any good artist , they want their work to impact upon audiences .
So this action , whilst unusual , is typical of Mike â€ “ agenda - setting , ahead of the curve , "" he told the Guardian .
Daisey had planned to post the script on his blog yesterday , but he delayed the process in order to respond to a major â€ “ unrelated â€ “ announcement by Apple .
Instead , he posted an apology , promising that the script "" is coming soon "" .
The post continues : "" The massive response , from nine different countries , and hundreds of emails clamouring for the piece , is deeply encouraging . ""
He continued : "" I have not managed to get this show to Broadway , "" he said , "" but if someone else wants to try , more power to them . ""
He has also granted permission for those hoping to produce the play to deviate from the script in any way they choose .
However , he outlined a few requests , including : "" It would be nice if you let me know where it is happening . ""
Atkinson maintains any such productions will not lessen the impact of Daisey 's own performance .
"" The text itself is only part of what makes The Agony ... an extraordinary piece of theatre .
It 's Mike himself that is unmissable . """
2012-02-15,"A very warm welcome to the Guardian Media Network , the latest addition to the Guardian 's stable of professional community sites and a one - stop shop for media and tech professionals looking for content and connections that will give them a creative and commercial edge .
In his now canonised 2005 Stanford Commencement speech Steve Jobs warned that you ca n't connect the dots in life by going forwards , it 's only in retrospect that you begin to make sense of the bigger picture .
While that 's certainly true in life , in business Jobs demonstrated better than anyone that understanding and reacting to what 's around the next corner is critical for success .
And while few would dispute that Jobs commanded a unique brand of genius that gave him the creative and commercial clairvoyance to establish the world 's richest and arguably most successful company , for us mere mortals , connecting the dots in business is about learning , sharing and interrogating new ideas and new concepts .

2012-02-15,"Tablets such as the iPad will outsell desktop and laptop PCs within a few years and eat into their sales , says Apple chief executive Tim Cook .
He also hinted that the company could be preparing to launch into the smart TV market with a revamped version of the Apple TV set - top box , and that Apple still sees enormous potential for growth in the smartphone market , especially in China .
Speaking at a Goldman Sachs technology conference , the transcript of which has been put online by Macrumors , the head of the world 's most valuable company – who took over from Steve Jobs last August when Jobs , then seriously ill , stepped aside – insisted that he would not let the "" unique culture and unique company "" unravel after its co - founder 's death last October : "" I 'm not going to witness or permit the slow undoing of it .
I believe in it so deeply . ""
He also dealt with the topic of supply conditions for workers in the company 's supply chain , insisting that Apple cares about every worker and that the audit being conducted by the Fair Labor Association was probably the biggest in manufacturing in history .
He revealed too that Apple now has 100 m users of its iCloud data synchronisation service , which was launched in October .
"" I view iCloud not as something with a year or two product life – it 's a strategy for the next decade or more .
It 's truly profound , "" Cook said .
Cook suggested that the growth of tablets "" will be good for the PC industry , because there will be this strong competitor and tablets will innovate like crazy and customers will decide which to buy .
There will be a strong PC industry but tablets will be stronger in units . ""
He said he had begun using the original iPad before its launch in January 2010 : "" We had our [ window ] shades pulled so no one [ else in the company ] could see us , but it quickly became that 80 - 90 % of my consumption and work was done on the iPad . ""
From the first day it shipped , we thought that the tablet market would become larger than the PC market and it was just a matter of time . ""
Apple 's iPad sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 hit 15.4 m , more than double the number of the same period in 2010 , while total worldwide PC sales fell by about 1 % to 92.5 m , based on figures from the research companies IDC and Gartner .
With rumours swirling that Apple is about to launch the next generation of its iPad device , including a higher - resolution screen , Cook said : "" I do n't predict the demise of the PC , I do n't subscribe to that .
Given what we 've seen , I believe the iPad is cannibalising some Macs but more PCs .
There are more of them to cannibalise than Macs
so that s a plus to us .
Tablets in general will cannibalise the PC . ""
He paid tribute to Amazon over rival tablets using Google 's Android operating system : "" Everybody that was in the PC industry and everybody in the phone industry decided they had to do a tablet .
There was 100 tablets put on the market last year !
They aimed at iPad 1 and by the time they came out with something we were on iPad 2 .
"" We wound up with 170,000 apps and I 'm not sure there is 100 yet on the other platform .
At the end of the day , people want the great product .
Amazon is a different competitor .
They have different strengths .
They 'll sell a lot of units .
They have and they will . ""
Television hints On the TV front
, Cook described the existing Apple TV set - top box – which essentially connects to the iTunes Store to show bought or rented films and TV
shows – as a hobby , the same description that Jobs used about it .
Apple sold 2.8 m of the devices in 2011 , almost half of those in its enormous Christmas quarter .
But Cook said : "" We do n't want to send a message to our shareholders that we think the market for it is the size of our other businesses .
The Mac , the iPad , the iPod , the iPhone .
We do n't want to send a signal that we think the length of that stool is equal to the others .
That 's why we call it a hobby . ""
Apple does n't do hobbies as a general rule .
We believe in focus and only working on a few things .
So , with Apple TV however , despite the barriers in that market , for those of us who use it , we 've always thought there was something there .
"" If we kept following our intuition and kept pulling the string , we might find something that was larger .
For those people that have it right now , the customer satisfaction is off the chart .
We need something that could go more main - market for it to be a serious category . ""
Premium pricing Challenged on the high price of Apple 's iPhone , and the price of its other products , Cook insisted that he thought people would always prefer a more expensive but higher - quality product . ""
Price is rarely the most important thing , "" he said .
"" A cheap product might sell some units .
Somebody gets it home and they feel great when they pay the money , but then they get it home and use it and the joy is gone . ""
The joy is gone every day that they use it until they are n't using it anymore .
You do n't keep remembering , ' I got a good deal ! '
because you hate it . ""
Smartphones Cook said that there is huge opportunity in the smartphone market – despite Apple 's record fourth quarter in which it topped the smartphone league , selling 37 m iPhones and edging ahead of Samsung .
He said : "" 37 m is a big number .
It was a decent quarter .
It was 17 m more than we 'd ever done before .
We were pretty happy with that , but let me give you the way I look at the numbers . ""
As I see it , that 37 m for last quarter represented 24 % of the smartphone market .
There 's three out of four people buying something else .
Nine out of 10 phone buyers are buying something else . ""
Handset market is projected to go from 1.5bn to 2bn units .
Take it in the context of these numbers , the truth is that this is a jaw - dropping industry with enormous opportunity .
Up against those numbers , the numbers do n't seem so large anymore .
What seems so large to me is the opportunity . ""
China opportunities Selling to China could be hugely valuable in the longer term , Cook said .
"" In 2007 , the revenue combined from Greater China , several other parts of Asia , India , Latin America , Eastern Europe , Middle East , Africa , was $ 1.4bn , "" he said .
"" Revenue last year for that same group of countries was $ 22bn .
We 're only on the surface .
That 's how I feel .
We focused mainly in China .
Last year we began to focus increasingly more in Brazil and Russia . ""
Cash and Siri Cook also tackled the issue of Apple 's $ 98bn cash pile , the Siri language interface on the iPhone 4S.
He said that the Siri voice interface introduced on the iPhone 4S was another profound change in input [ methods ] which , despite being still a beta [ unfinished ] product , had become essential to his own life .
But despite his reputation as the leader of a tight focus on costs in Apple 's supply chain - the role for which he was originally hired by Jobs in 1998
- Cook said that iCloud and Siri were not something Apple runs profit and loss analyses on .
Instead , he said : "" We run the company from the top and do n't worry about the iCloud team or Siri team making money .
Measuring things at that level would n't achieve anything .
Both of these things go in the profound category .
They 're things that you 'll talk to your grandkids about that are profound changes . ""
Of Apple 's cash pile – a large amount of which is outside the US , and would attract high taxes if it were repatriated –
Cook said : "" We 've spent billions in the supply chain .
We 've spent billions in acquisition including on IP .
We 've spent billions on retail , the infrastructure of the company , the data centers et cetera . ""
Yes , we still have a lot .
I would say we 're judicious and deliberate .
We spend our money like it 's our last pennies .
I think shareholders want us to do that .
They do n't want us to act like we 're rich .
"" We 've never felt that way .
It may sound bizarre but that 's the truth .
In terms of our approach to cash , I 've said since becoming CEO that I 'm not religious about this .
I 'm not religious about holding it or not holding it .
We 're in very active discussions at the board level on what we should do . """
2012-02-23,"To his fans Xavier Niel is the French Steve Jobs .
Anti - establishment to the ends of his collar - length hair , he made his name and his fortune from upsetting the Gallic business elite but is fast becoming its most prominent member , controlling France 's second biggest broadband business and with a new mobile phone network that has signed up 1.5 million customers from rivals in its first month .
A teenage porn baron turned internet tycoon , briefly behind bars in 2004 and prosecuted for undeclared earnings from peepshows , Niel is also one of a trio President Nicolas Sarkozy tried unsuccessfully to block from buying the country 's newspaper of record , Le Monde .
To his rival Martin Bouygues , owner of France 's third largest mobile network and heir to a construction empire , this rabble - rousing adversary and his troops are "" gypsies camped on the lawns "" of the chateau he built .
Last month Niel launched Free Mobile to a room full of cheering self - styled "" Freenauts "" , the customers who signed up for his discounted broadband and TV deals a decade ago and are now queuing for pay - by - instalment iPhones .
On the same day , a lorry bearing the words "" we are not gypsies "" parked outside Bouygues ' head office .
Niel sees himself as a revolutionary storming the Bastille . ""
He has the chateau , he has everything , we are nothing , we come from nowhere , "" says Niel , wearing jeans and an open - necked shirt .
"" We do n't like the camping analogy , it makes us sound like squatters .
We are there with pickaxes hacking his castle apart and giving the stones to the French people . ""
Stirring words , delivered in the most privileged of surroundings : the top floor of his head office , a few streets away from the Elysée Palace .
Formerly occupied by Suez , one of France 's oldest multinationals , tThe building is a miniature stone Parthenon encased in a larger , modern glass structure and houses 1,500 call centre staff as well as the top brass .
Niel can afford the rent – Forbes magazine ranks him as France 's 8th richest man with an estimated £ 2.4bn fortune , thanks to a 60 % share in Iliad , the publicly quoted company that operates his businesses .
These days he is often seen out with Delphine Arnault , the couture - clad daughter of the country 's richest person , fashion and spirits billionaire Bernard Arnault .
But Niel 's odyssey to the heart of the Paris beau monde began in the high - rise suburb of Créteil .
While his father studied for 18 years , both law and medicine , his mother worked as an accountant to support the family .
Niel was given a Sinclair ZX81 computer for his 14th birthday and quickly worked out how to make money from it .
He made a small fortune while in his teens from adult services on Minitel , France 's popular internet precursor .
While his sister Véronique studied to become a speech therapist , Niel , gave university a miss .
By his mid-20s , he was lending office space and equipment to France 's first consumer internet service , Worldnet .
A year after launch he invested in the business and made millions when Worldnet was sold for € 40 m in May 2000 , just before the dotcom crash .
"" People say , ' What a stroke of genius ! '
It was n't a stroke of genius , it was a stroke of luck , "" he says .
In 1999 , Niel launched the Free brand , offering a gratis dial - up internet service .
With miles of fibre - optic cable lying unused following the late 1990s building boom that bankrupted a number of telecoms companies , he rented lines cheaply and realised the internet would be a handy way to broadcast television .
In 2000 , unable to find an appropriate set - top box , he asked his own engineers to design one and Free 's DIY approach was born .
It allowed it to become France 's first "" triple - play "" provider – offering broadband , phone and TV .
Free is now France 's second largest broadband firm with a 23 % market share .
Less than France Télécom 's 45 % , but ahead of more established operator SFR .
Given his disruptive success in broadband , French mobile operators – France Telecom 's Orange , SFR and Bouygues – fought long and hard to prevent Niel obtaining a mobile phone licence .
He says of the heads of rival operators : "" They were brought up in the same schools , they go to the same dinner parties , they are friends with each other .
Competition in these circumstances can not exist . ""
Their cause was helped by his chequered past .
In 1997 , Niel sold most of his pornography interests but , for a reason he now finds hard to explain , held on to a peepshow in Strasbourg and one in Paris .
From time to time , an envelope stuffed with cash was delivered to his office .
One summer 's day in 2004 , Niel woke at dawn to find 30 armed police officers raiding his apartment .
He was in custody for a month pending trial , accused after an anonymous tipoff of pimping and tax evasion .
He was found not guilty of profiting from prostitution , but was fined € 250,000 ( £ 210,000 ) and given a suspended two - year sentence for non - declared earnings .
A technology multimillionaire , why did he remain in the sex industry ?
"" I did n't care .
If you are worried about the risk to your reputation you do n't launch a telecoms firm in an aggressive way .
"" It does now .
Free Mobile opened for business on 10 January by offering two tariffs for the first three million customers : one at € 19.99 a month with a mobile internet connection , one at € 2 without .
The latter undercuts the government - imposed € 10 package all operators offer , and Free claims it will still make a profit .
"" It just goes to show to what extent the poorest and the most deprived have been hit over the head , "" Niel bellowed as he strode the stage at the launch event , in a style inspired by Microsoft boss Steve Ballmer 's manic performances .
"" You have been milked like dairy cows and you will have to teach your operator a lesson . ""
When he "" saved the world "" , as he likes to say of his purchase of Le Monde , the paper was reportedly weeks away from not being able to pay its journalists .
His chief - of - staff at Iliad , Michaël Boukobza , was sent in and the cost cutting quickly earned him the nickname Bazooka .
A senior journalist says Niel does not interfere in the paper 's agenda , but that his methods to return it to profitability were a culture shock .
"" When the new owners presented themselves following the acquisition , it was Niel who seduced us .
He was warm , imaginative .
But there is another side to him that is violent , capable of anything . ""
Staff resistance to cuts was neutralised by leaks to rival papers about chauffeur driven cars and other profligacies .
Niel cherishes his two young sons , spending most school holidays away from the office and mornings at home when they were small .
He dismisses the trappings of wealth – saying private islands and yachts are "" English "" affectations .
He claims to take taxis everywhere , though there is a black Mercedes in his garage .
Friends say he has lost weight , washes his hair and has his shirts ironed more often .
One thing that has not changed is his belief in working one 's way up from the bottom .
There will be no silver spoon for his family - because Neil also wants to change the French law that entitles children to inherit the majority of a parent 's estate ."
2012-03-23,"Last weekend , US radio programme This American Life revealed that Mike Daisey 's monologue The Agony and The Ecstasy of Steve Jobs , which will have its UK premiere at the HighTide festival in May , contained some elements of fabrication .
The short version of a complex story is that the show , which was adapted for the radio show , details poor working conditions in the manufacture of Apple products at the Foxconn factory in China .
Daisey recalls meeting workers as young as 12 , and others poisoned by chemicals used to make the iPhone screen .
He mentions meeting one man with a withered hand , who , on seeing an iPad for the first time , declares it "" a kind of magic "" .
However , none of this actually happened – or at least not to Daisey – and This American Life issued a retraction after another reporter , Rob Schmitz , exposed the inaccuracies .
Unsurprisingly , given the ethical and aesthetical conundrums it raises , the story has kept theatre bloggers very busy indeed .
Let 's start the Daisey chain – it seems inevitable to call it that – with the man himself , who issued an apology of sorts on his own blog . ""
What I do is not journalism .
The tools of the theatre are not the same as the tools of journalism . ""
Essentially , he 's saying the two have different standards of truth ; he "" stand[s ] by "" the theatre piece , but regrets its broadcast on a journalistic platform such as This American Life .
For some , like the Chicago Theatre Addict , that 's enough .
Alison Croggon draws an apt parallel with Johann Hari 's recent fictionalisation in interviews , because , as the Defective Yeti blog notes , Daisey has inserted himself into the story .
No one is disputing that working conditions at Foxconn are poor , just that Daisey has embellished his personal experiences of them .
Interestingly , Stroller Derby points out that "" anyone can be the I "" , as the script is available for performance royalty - free .
Daisey writes : "" If you think this story is bigger than that story , something is wrong with your priorities . ""
At the New Inquiry , Aaron Brady draws a witty comparison with The Wire 's Jimmy McNulty .
Certainly , to manipulate the truth is inexcusable as journalism , but what about as theatre ?
The problem seems to be that Daisey labelled the piece non - fiction .
That 's why Alli Houseworth calls for a boycott .
She takes an absolute position : non - fiction means no fiction ; just as verbatim means every word spoken on stage is a direct quotation .
However , truth can be a sliding scale .
Several bloggers have mentioned the late Spalding Gray , whose non - fiction work segued into fantasy .
As Chris Gray says , part of the enjoyment comes from differentiating fact from fiction .
Might the audience have a responsibility to judge the truth of a show ?
That 's what Croggon argues , harking back to Brecht 's ideal audience : "" What 's mainly disturbing is the complacent acceptance of the ' authentic ' in the audience . ""
George Hunka disagrees : "" A drama or theatre that claims to be a verbatim or documentary presentation of verifiable facts also must trust in the confidence of its audience to accept that these facts are true , because the audience does not have the ability to assess this truth itself . ""
Personally , I 'm with Hunka on this one .
To bend the truth , an artist needs to give an audience some signal that they might be doing so .
Daisey 's failure to do that has damaged his cause as well as documentary theatre as a form .
Howard Sherman goes even further , questioning its effect on fictional plays grounded loosely in reality , such as Lynn Nottage 's Ruined .
However , Daisey 's handling of the fallout has been broadly commendable .
He 's added a new prologue , edited the script and spoken candidly about the issue in public .
For British audiences , HighTide looks more enticing by the minute ."
2012-04-02,"Ashton Kutcher has been cast as Steve Jobs in one of two competing biopics about the late founder of Apple , reports Variety .
Kutcher , who bears some resemblance to the young Jobs , has been cast in a version by Swing Vote 's Joshua Michael Stern , which will chronicle the entrepreneur 's journey from "" wayward hippie "" to co - founder of the iconic technology firm , "" where he became one of the most revered creative entrepreneurs of our time "" .
"" I had the idea the day Jobs retired and I notice several IT and art directors at my company all in a buzz , "" producer Mark Hulme of Five Star Insitute told TheWrap .
"" I was observing that day how distractive his retirement was to the marketplace and I knew in my heart that his story was the film I wanted to do "" .
Little else is known about the project , other than that it is based on a screenplay by Matt Whiteley and is likely to shoot as early as May.
Producers are hoping to steal a march on a second Jobs biopic from studio Sony which was announced in the autumn .
The other Jobs film is based on Walter Isaacson 's bestselling authorised biography of the Apple founder , and Sony was at one point tapping Aaron Sorkin of The West Wing and The Social Network fame to take on screenwriting duties . ""
Right now I 'm just in the thinking - about - it stages , "" said Sorkin in November .
"" It 's a really big movie and it 's going to be a great movie no matter who writes it .
He was a great entrepreneur , he was a great artist , a great thinker .
"" Isaacson 's book Steve Jobs
: The Exclusive Biography is the only authorised book about Jobs 's life .
Published in the UK just 19 days after Jobs died from pancreatic cancer , it sold 37,000 copies in its first five days here and more than 379,000 copies in its first week in the US .
The volume is based on more than 40 interviews with Jobs conducted over two years , as well as interviews with more than 100 family members , friends , adversaries , competitors and colleagues .
Kutcher , who replaced Charlie Sheen in TV sitcom Two and a Half Men last year , has been in the news recently following his high - profile split from Demi Moore .
His film credits include romantic comedy fare such as New Year 's Eve and No Strings Attached as well as more serious material such as Emilio Estevez 's historical drama Bobby and the science - fiction themed The Butterfly Effect .
Stern is best known for the 2008 Kevin Costner election comedy Swing Vote and little known 2005 literary drama Neverwas , starring Aaron Eckhart .
The only previous film to tell Jobs 's story was 1999 's made - for - TV docudrama Pirates of Silicon Valley , which starred ER 's Noah Wyle as the Apple founder ."
2012-04-05,"Go to efi.com , click on PrintMe and download one of the apps for the iPhone , iPad and Android devices – and there in the palm of your hand you will have what analyst Gary Peterson is describing as not merely the future of printing , but the saviour of printing .
For Peterson – until recently a self - confessed print optimist – developers of these third - party apps will in the future do , he believes , what the printer manufacturers have so far failed to do and come up with a way to prevent the humble computer printing business from becoming another scalp on the late Steve Jobs 's belt .
"" No one in the printing industry , or outside it , had any idea that the iPad would come along and destroy three- to four - thousand - year - old human traditions concerning paper , as they did n't realise that there was now a new generation out there who are far more prepared to read from a screen than the printed page , "" says Peterson , the chief executive of San Diego - based independent research analysts Gap Intelligence .
So Peterson believes that the future of printing , if there is one , comes down to open - source third - party app developers , hoping as he does that "" some kid in the garage will come up with the Angry Birds of printing that will encourage people to print again "" .
Despite the new apps , Peterson has now joined with many other analysts in predicting that the printer is dead or dying in a conversion that began after the "" Valentine 's Day present "" that Morgan Stanley gave the printer manufacturers last year in its report , Imaging and Printing : Tablets to Reduce Printing Demand , which warned that tablet ownership would accelerate the reduction in demand for printing that began in 2006 by between 8 % and 15 % .
His conversion was completed when this year , in an early "" Easter Egg "" note to investors , Morgan Stanley further warned that printing in some areas had declined by as a much as 16 % , and offered other juicy stats such as the fact that 41 % of tablet owners cited reduced printing as one of the benefits of tablet adoption .
These predictions gained extra traction and blog inches because they increasingly seemed to be reflecting the gut instinct of many analysts – including Peterson – that the iPad , other tablets and even smartphones must be decreasing the amount of printing that people do .
Simply by watching how people use these devices on the train or even talk about them in the pub , analysts felt they could tell that something was up , not to mention that the number of tablets and smartphones is soon set to overtake the 1.3bn printers installed worldwide .
Or even that there are new patterns emerging , such as a blurring of the home / office divide as individuals take their own
iPads to previously tablet - free workplaces .
While sceptics were quick to point out that some of the Morgan Stanley conclusions were themselves based on anecdotal evidence and that the end of printing may prove to be about as accurate as the paperless office and other Tomorrow 's World predictions , for print pessimists – even newly minted ones like Peterson – the news that last week the formerly successful HP printer business was being merged with its PC division – owing , in part , to slowing growth , flat revenue and lower profits , seemed to validate these fears , especially as he felt there was a lack of any idea from the manufacturer as to when this might be reversed .
While Peterson claims that he would feel anxious if he was about to go into the printer - making business , Louella Fernandes has a different take on the issue , since she is not quite sure that the end of print is happening as fast as Peterson thinks , or even that tablets are the real culprit .
"" We are not seeing it at the moment , "" she says .
Fernandes is a principal analyst at independent analysts Quocirca and co - author , along with fellow principal analyst Rob Bamforth , of a more optimistic report , dating from January 2012 :
The mobile print enterprise : How IT consumerisation is driving anytime , anywhere printing .
In the report she argues that while there has been a lot of talk about tablets , there is still an appetite for printing .
Moreover , that appetite is fueling an emerging market for what can be called mobile printing or cloud printing , as can be seen from the fact that 60 % of the 125 businesses that responded want to print from mobiles and 25 % are already looking for mobile print solutions .
Such solutions will generally involve the ability to submit print jobs directly from a smartphone or a tablet to an enabled or registered printer , often by emailing documents by Wi - Fi , and increasingly via the cloud .
Hewlett - Packard , which pioneered this with ePrint , shifted 15 m web - enabled ePrinters last year alone .
However , this new market is being hampered by a lack of standards and different levels of compatibility that make it especially difficult for those companies that operate a so - called mixed fleet of printers ; and there remain security issues around Wi - Fi printing .
Although Fernandes believes that the emergence of third - party apps by companies such as Efi is important in overcoming these barriers as they are agonistic and able to work with printers from any manufacturer , such apps are nonetheless still embryonic .
Google Cloud Print - enabled and Apple AirPrint - enabled apps in contrast let you print only to a limited range of printers from selected manufacturers .
The trend by businesses to minimise printing because of its expense was already well embedded before the arrival of the iPad , and in the end , Fernandes admits , mobile printing is not something that could revolutionise the printer industry ; rather , it is just a new opportunity to displace part of it .
However , Quocirca principal analyst Rob Bamforth believes that it is different with smartphones .
"" They are much harder to use to read complex documents on and more about instant access .
So you are not going to using a smartphone to read a complex document , and are more likely to want to access the cloud and print it . ""
Rescaling info even on the iPhone 's Retina display is never easy .
And with Bluetooth and Wi - Fi capability built in to most smartphones printing should in theory be easy . ""
Yet in the long run he believes that even this urge to print from smartphones will disappear , as over time interfaces will look more like social media timelines than the Word documents of today .
"" So it is going to be more about accessing chunks or clusters of data than large complex documents and as a result the need to print will decrease , especially when there is a new generation that is used to the ebook format , "" Bamforth says .
By contrast , Angèle Boyd believes that printing is not about to die any time soon .
And the group vice - president for print , imaging and document solutions at International Data Corporation ( IDC ) has her own figures to back this up .
In a survey of small to large companies carried out this year for the IDC 's Hardcopy Usage program and Cloud Print study that has not yet been published , most respondents say that tablets and mobiles will not decrease the amount they print and , although small to lower - medium - sized companies are more likely than others to expect a decrease , upper - medium - sized companies are actually more likely to expect an increase in printing .
"" Our research shows that business users are still a bit more likely to say they need print than not to need print , "" says Boyd .
""
Larger or complex documents are still often easier to review on paper , and many still see the printed document as the safer form of back - up , and some even feel it is more binding – though legally that is not necessarily the case . ""
Indeed , US Healthcare has been moving to electronic medical and health records , yet this industry is showing the highest increase in print . ""
Boyd even questions the very existence of a new generation of ebook fanatics waiting to get their hands on a tablet and forget paper . ""
Frankly it is hard to say if the explosive growth in digital content shown by IDC research will be offset by growth in youth in workforce and greater use of tablets , "" she says .
"" After all , cloud printing remains hard to use and fears remain about wireless security , so not everything is going to be moving to the cloud – so the need to support a hybrid print world will continue for some time .
Moreover , there is such an explosion in digital content creation that even if we do n't print it all , some printing of such hugely growing content could actually drive print . ""
The continuing challenge for any kind of print vendor – if they are to survive – is , she believes , to find growth opportunities large enough and growing fast enough to outrun any softness or decline in mainstream printing , and that may revolve around the potential to scan documents direct to the cloud .
Peterson believes that although all this talk of cloud printing is great , it is not something to get too excited about , as it is simply what the printer manufacturers have to do just to stay in the game , and that emailing documents to a printer will soon be like trying to light a fire with stones .
While he concedes that the number of smart devices sold may by sheer force of numbers increase the amount of printing , any real game changers will likely come from the third - party – and in the future – open - source apps .
One day , he believes , we will look back at Google cloud printing and see it as a rudimentary vision of the future , almost as the baby blocks of what is to come .

For Less"
2012-04-23,"An old rule states that you are a mere six degrees of separation away from anyone else on the planet .
For some people , however , the world is even smaller .
So let me propose an amendment : you are only one relative , friend or acquaintance away from one of the late Steve Jobs 's creations .
You may be browsing this on a new iPad , one of the 30 m Apple sold last year .
Or perhaps you 're viewing it on an iPhone screen – which would be unsurprising , since the market analysts at Mintel say that the iPhone 4 is the most popular handset in Britain today .
Maybe your children are reluctantly putting away their iPods , of which Apple sells 5 m worldwide every three months ( a remarkable figure , but half the 10 m Jobs and his colleagues were shifting each quarter in 2008 and 2009 ) .
And if you 've really never done any of those things , rest assured your prime minister has .
"" The cool thing is that I now control my iMac from the iPad , to play out through the speaker , "" David Cameron boasted to the Telegraph a few months after moving into No 10 .
It was one of those canny - to - the - point - of - irritating references the Old Etonian used to specialise in ; a flash of his real - world accreditation .
As Cameron knows , Apple is a byword of everyday sleekness .
Yet there is another way of viewing the company .
Focus instead on the way it does business , and all those iPhones , iPods and iPads are n't just exemplars of design and user - friendliness : they are devices that destroy western jobs .
And they do so needlessly , because if the California - based giant manufactured its goods in America rather than China , it could still make profits that would be the envy of every other US business .
This is , I know , an unorthodox position .
When journalists or politicians discuss the way that western companies make goods in China , or anywhere else in Asia , they almost always start from the premise that this is how business is done nowadays .
This is the commonly accepted logic of globalisation , which enables companies to keep their costs down , which allows the ordinary American or Briton to spend less money shopping , and which also offers poorer nations in the east to develop their economies .
Expensive shirts might still be made in Italy ; high - end kitchens might be assembled in Germany – but the future of mass production inevitably lies in China .
Apple has both made and benefitted from that argument .
In January , the New York Times ran a lengthy investigation of the technology firm 's manufacturing processes , which began by disclosing a conversation in 2011 between Jobs and Barack Obama .
The president asked why Apple products could not be made in the US .
The most admired man in Silicon Valley was reportedly blunt : "" Those jobs are n't coming back .
""
Very few people argued with that assessment .
In other ways excellent , the New York Times ' piece had an elegiac tone , conveyed by the headline How the US Lost Out on iPhone Work .
And the following commentary went on in this it's - not - you - it's - me vein .
It was n't Apple 's fault it did n't hire Americans to make its goods : it was America 's .
US workers were n't skilled enough ; not enough of them were trained in engineering .
All this should be familiar to anyone who 's followed the Westminster debate on globalisation , where prime ministers from Thatcher to Blair to Cameron have agreed that if Britain is to attract employers , its workers need to shape up .
Students need to brain up and get degrees , adults need to retrain or sharpen up their attitudes .
Even then , the British have to prepare for a post - industrial future , where they do the design and marketing and the Chinese ( or the Indians , or the Vietnamese ) make the goods .
Such national self - abasement has the merit of at least feeling like a policy ; but it 's debatable whether on its own it really will pull in big employers .
Apple , after all , used to base its manufacturing in the US .
Jobs used to boast about how the Mac was "" a machine that is made in America "" .
And according to new research given exclusively to the Guardian by the Centre for Research on Socio - Cultural Change ( Cresc ) , it 's clear that it would not only be affordable for Apple still to make its goods in America , it would remain hugely profitable .
Using a mix of Apple 's own filings and industry data , the academics broke down the cost of making one product in particular : the wildly popular 4 G iPhone .
Assembled in China , the total cost of putting together just one phone was $ 178.45 .
Compare that with a sale price ( including downloads ) of $ 630 and Apple makes $ 452 on each phone : a whacking gross margin of 72 % .
Chinese labour accounts for a tiny proportion of the company 's costs : $ 7.10 for each phone , which accounts for about eight hours of assembly .
So what would it cost to make the same iPhone in America ?
The Cresc team took the average wage in the US electronics industry of $ 21 per hour and calculated that the total production cost would increase to $ 337.01 .
That is a big jump –
but it still leaves Apple with a gross margin of 46.5 % on each iPhone –
a level that Cresc 's Sukhdev Johal estimates would probably still make it the most profitable phone in the world .
So : two models of making one of Apple 's most popular products , and two models for distributing the profits .
The made - in - America model still leaves the California giant with a profit margin that most companies can only dream of , but would create hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs in the US to boot .
That may strike you as laughably naive , but it 's more akin to enlightened self - interest : just think of the way Henry Ford raised wages so Ford workers could buy his cars .
The made - in - China model , on the other hand , has carried no such social benefits , either in Apple 's home country or in the People 's Republic .
Last year , Apple built up cash reserves of $ 100bn – more than the US government .
Indeed , it was so much money that the company was stumped how to dispose of it .
Tim Cook , who is now CEO of Apple , announced a few weeks ago that he would begin buying back shares and paying dividends to investors .
Among other people who benefited from this arrangement was Cook himself , who was awarded $ 376.3 m in Apple stock when he took over last year .
That pile of shares is now valued at around $ 634 m .
The people who win from the made - in - China model are big investors and top executives .
In the case of Apple , outsourcing manufacturing is not about keeping costs to customers down –
they are still paying huge prices for the latest handset or tablet computer .
Nor is it about the company 's survival
: it would still do tremendously well
were it to bring those factories back home .
No , in the case of Apple , moving jobs offshore has become a way of directing ever more money to those at the top of American society .
This is not just my conclusion , or that of the Cresc team ; it is backed up by the Asian Development Bank .
In a 2010 study of an earlier model of the iPhone , ADB researchers concluded : "" It is the profit maximisation behaviour of Apple rather than competition that pushes Apple to have all iPhones assembled in the PRC . ""
This division of labour has certainly not helped China very much .
Foxconn , which makes those iPhones , has to work to an incredibly tough contract with Apple that forces it to keep all costs to a minimum .
This surely helps account for why Foxconn , whose client list is almost a
Who 's
Who of the smartphone sector , has had repeated troubles with its workforce , including at least 18 suicide attempts by workers in 2010 alone .
After that , and the terrible publicity that followed , Apple put pressure on its subcontractor to raise workers ' pay and improve conditions .
But it did n't take the most obvious route of doing so , which would be : pay more to Foxconn , and direct it to use that surplus to increase wages .
The reason for concentrating on Apple in this fashion is not because it 's a terrible company , but because it 's an exemplary one .
It has become the business success story of our age : the firm others want to emulate , and prime ministers want to name check .
And yet there is a paradox here .
For all the stylishness and sleekness of its products , the Apple business model is an unattractive and , over the long term , possibly an unsustainable one .
It subcontracts work that offers the Chinese little prospect of economic development , while at the same time selling to Americans and others products they want but increasingly do n't have the jobs or incomes to buy so readily .
Apple 's rise to primus inter pares in the business world has coincided with a wider social trend : a general anxiety about the decline of the west .
Some of the reasons for why America , Britain and others are on the slide are large and abstract .
But some of the factors are smaller and closer to hand , like the iPhone in your pocket or the Mac waiting for you at home .

Cresc is holding a workshop on the "" Apple Business Model "" at Senate House , University of London on Wednesday"
2012-04-29,"The reason that Apple does not produce its expensive toys in the US ( Bad Apple ? , G2 , 24 April ) is not because the late Steve Jobs and the current CEO were necessarily extremely greedy but because corporate shareholders demand that they maximise profits for investors .
Indeed , company law both here and in the US places an implied demand on directors to do so .
Add to that the global deregulation and free - trade agenda driven by the corporate giants over the last 30 years and we have a situation where hundreds of millions of people work in factories and on plantations in conditions little better than those endured by slaves in centuries gone by .
The enormous profits generated by the transnational companies from their exploitative activities – such as the $ 11.6bn made by Apple over the last 12 months – and the consequent glut of capital inevitably lead to speculation in commodities , complex financial transactions and private - equity asset - stripping in the search for still more profits until the bubble bursts and the whole edifice collapses , with disastrous results for the vast majority of the world 's population .
Until such time as the economy is put at the service of the people , and not the other way round , the cycle of boom and bust will continue .
For this to happen the profit motive would have to cease to be the sole driver of economic activity and the means of production be democratised to benefit the majority rather than just the obscenely remunerated bosses .
However , with governments in thrall to big business and wedded to an unsustainable economic model of infinite growth , the rotten Apple syndrome will be with us for the foreseeable future .

2012-05-03,"An hour - long "" lost "" interview with the late Steve Jobs will be released in cinemas next week , after it was acquired for US distribution .
Magnolia Pictures is hoping that Steve Jobs : The Lost Interview will spark the interest of legions of admirers of the former CEO of Apple Inc and Pixar , who died in 2011 .
Technology writer Robert X
Cringely ( aka Mark Stephens ) spoke to Jobs in 1995 as part of a series , The Triumph of the Nerds , a history of the personal computer originally filmed for Channel 4 .
At the time , Jobs was running NeXT , the computer company he founded after quitting Apple â€ “ and shortly before Apple acquired NeXT , enabling Jobs to return to the company he co - founded .
Small portions of the interview have been used in TV broadcasts , but the complete footage was thought lost until the discovery of a VHS in director Paul Sen 's garage .
Magnolia president Eamonn Bowles said : "" It 's a valuable piece of history that has thankfully been rescued from obscurity . """
2012-05-06,""" How often do we wish that more things were handmade ? "" asks American monologist Mike Daisey .
He stares us in the eye . ""
Now there are more handmade things than there have ever been in the history of the world . ""
Most of those things come from China , where there are millions of hands â€ “ far cheaper than any machinery â€ “ to make them .
Daisey tells a fantastically good story and one that if you have an iPhone in your pocket you wo n't want to hear in this passionate and powerful exposÃ © of the appalling working conditions in Apple 's Foxconn factory in China . ""
Tonight , "" says Daisey , "" is a virus .
"" The show has already spread all over the US , raising awareness about the inhumane working conditions of thousands of Chinese workers .
Unfortunately , all recent focus has been on whether Daisey tells an entirely true story , although its essence remains undisputed .
An excerpt from the show broadcast on the US radio journalistic programme This American Life was retracted after it was revealed that not everything that Daisey claimed to have witnessed and heard on his 2010 trip to China was verifiable .
He had fabricated incidents for greater dramatic impact .
It 's an accusation that could , of course , be hurled at any number of playwrights who create fictions out of real experience and events .
The imagination is not , and never should be , bound by the rules of journalism .
The difference is that , unlike Daisey , those writers do not claim â€ “ either on or off stage â€ “ that they are telling a true story .
As Daisey says towards the end of the show about Apple products : "" The way a thing is made is part of the design itself . ""
That could be applied to Daisey 's own monologue as much as it can to an Apple laptop , which may be beautiful but which Daisey suggests has "" blood welling up between the keys "" .
This European premiere of Daisey 's show , rewritten and reframed following the This American Life rumpus , inevitably feels as much about Daisey as it does about Apple and its founder , the late Steve Jobs , a man whose management style led co - workers to suggest "" he would have made an excellent King of France "" .
At times it feels as if it is Daisey himself who is on trial .
When Daisey says wryly "" I really have an absurd amount of power over the narrative , "" refers to himself as a "" fabulist "" and declares "" we do n't like this story and we would do anything not to believe it , "" it sounds increasingly as if he is defending himself rather than trusting that his audience will know we are seeing a theatre show , not reading a fact - checked newspaper .
The agony of Mike Daisey is that as the focus , he gets in the way of a very real and important story that does n't just point the finger at Apple but at all of us who unthinkingly consume without ever considering how something is made ."
2012-05-16,"His legacy already surrounds us in the shape of iPods , iPhones , iPads and myriad other iconic , sleek and indispensable examples of 21st - century living .
Now Apple founder Steve Jobs is to be immortalised on the big screen in not one but two competing Hollywood biopics , the latest of which yesterday confirmed The Social Network 's Oscar - winning Aaron Sorkin as its screenwriter .
Studio Sony 's announcement that it has appointed the creator of The West Wing to adapt Walter Isaacson 's bestselling official biography of Jobs immediately catapulted the film into pole position in the race to bring the late technology guru 's story to the big screen , as well as marking it as potential awards season fodder .
Sorkin surprised many by adapting what had looked on paper to be a rather dry tale about the Harvard - based founders of Facebook into a film which won three Oscars last year and took more than $ 200 m at the global box office .
He later admitted that his retelling was heavily fictionalised , an approach which is less likely to be acceptable when developing a story about a revered figure such as Jobs .
Sorkin had evidently been considering the biopic for some time . ""
Steve Jobs 's story is unique : he was one of the most revolutionary and influential men not just of our time but of all time , "" said Sony Pictures co - chairman Amy Pascal in a statement .
"" There is no writer working in Hollywood today who is more capable of capturing such an extraordinary life for the screen than Aaron Sorkin ; in his hands , we 're confident that the film will be everything that Jobs himself was : captivating , entertaining and polarising . ""
Sony 's biopic will be titled simply Steve Jobs , and does not yet have a director or cast .
It is likely to be beaten into cinemas by a film by Swing Vote 's Joshua Michael Stern , which has cast Ashton Kutcher as the Apple founder and will chronicle the entrepreneur 's journey from "" wayward hippie "" to co - founder of the iconic technology firm , "" where he became one of the most revered creative entrepreneurs of our time "" .
The project , as yet untitled , could shoot as early as May in an effort to steal a march on its rival .
Sony will not be panicking overly , however , having secured a big - name screenwriter and optioned the only official biography of Jobs .
Isaacson 's book Steve Jobs :
The Exclusive Biography is based on more than 40 interviews with its subject conducted over two years , as well as interviews with more than 100 family members , friends , adversaries , competitors and colleagues .
It was published in the UK in October , just 19 days after Jobs died from pancreatic cancer , and sold 37,000 copies in its first five days here and more than 379,000 copies in its first week in the US .
It was Amazon 's bestselling book of 2011 , with more than 2.2 m copies sold last year .
Sony optioned the book in October for a reported $ 1 m .
The only previous film to tell Jobs 's story was 1999 's made - for - TV docudrama Pirates of Silicon Valley , which starred ER 's Noah Wyle as the Apple founder ."
2012-05-25,"Apple chief executive Tim Cook has opted to forgo the $ 75 m ( Â£48 m ) dividend payments that he was set to earn on the 1 m shares he has received from the company .
Cook , who took over from Apple 's late co - founder Steve Jobs in August last year , was awarded 1 m restricted stock units ( RSUs ) for running the company during Jobs ' medical leaves .
Apple said in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday night that Cook had asked the company to be excluded from a programme through which employees could accumulate dividends on their RSUs that were still vesting .
With Apple 's share price at more than $ 565 a share , Cook 's shares are worth more than $ 500 m .
Half of these shares will vest in 2016 and the rest in 2021 .
In March , Apple announced its intention to use some of its estimated $ 100bn cash pile , generated by strong sales of the iPhone and iPad , to pay shareholders a dividend of $ 2.65 a share .
It is the first time since the technology giant turned its fortunes around after Jobs ' return in 1997 that Apple has issued a dividend .
Apple is one of few companies on the Nasdaq that pay a dividend .
Shareholders of American technology companies traditionally tolerate firms not paying dividends , which allows them to invest heavily in research and development and fund big acquisitions .
Despite the payment of the dividend , Apple looks set to maintain its cash mountain at $ 100bn as new products such as the iPad continue to sell so well , which explains why the board has decided to pay a shareholder dividend now ."
2012-05-31,"The Oscar - winning writer of The Social Network , Aaron Sorkin , has revealed he hopes to paint a "" heroic "" picture of the late Apple co - founder Steve Jobs in a forthcoming biopic .
Sorkin , whose critically acclaimed film about the creators of Facebook took a warts and all view of its subject Mark Zuckerberg , said he planned a different approach this time around .
Pointing out that Zuckerberg had been the first "" antihero "" of a long writing career , he said he much preferred developing heroic characters and did not intend to "" judge "" Jobs . ""
He 's a complicated guy , "" Sorkin said yesterday during an on - stage interview at the AllThingsD conference in Rancho Palos Verdes , California . ""
Zuckerberg was , as well .
But when I 'm writing this movie , I ca n't judge this character .
He has to be , for me , a hero .
It 's a little like writing about the Beatles , "" Sorkin mused .
"" There are so many people out there that know him and revere him . ""
The creator of The West Wing , who last month revealed studio Sony has recruited Apple co - founder Steve Wozniak as an adviser , said he hoped to dispense with the traditional "" cradle - to - grave "" structure of a biopic , and was intending to produce "" a painting , not a photograph "" of Jobs 's life .
"" I 'm going to identify the point of friction and focus on that , "" he said .
Sorkin 's take is effectively the "" official "" Jobs biopic , since it adapts the bestselling official biography of the technology icon , Walter Isaacson 's Steve Jobs : The Exclusive Biography .
Isaacson 's book is based on more than 40 interviews with its subject conducted over two years , as well as interviews with more than 100 family members , friends , adversaries , competitors and colleagues .
A rival indie film is being put together with Ashton Kutcher cast in the lead , however , and producers hope to steal a march on Sony by shooting as early as this month .
Joshua Michael Stern 's film will reportedly chronicle the entrepreneur 's journey from "" wayward hippie "" to co - founder of Apple . ""
Steve Jobs is a big enough person , and led a big enough life , that there is more than enough room for more than one movie , "" said Sorkin yesterday .
No cast or director has yet been announced for the Sony biopic , with Sorkin admitting yesterday that he is still considering how to approach his subject .
"" I 'm at the earliest possible stage with Steve Jobs .
What I 'll do is go through a long period that , to the casual observer , might very well look like watching ESPN , "" he said .
The only previous film to tell Jobs 's story was 1999 's made - for - TV docudrama Pirates of Silicon Valley , which starred ER 's Noah Wyle as the Apple founder ."
2012-06-01,"When Steve Jobs appeared at the Wall Street Journal 's annual All Things Digital conference , he 'd always be himself : brilliant , insightful , and arrogant .
Even when he was dissembling , which he frequently did in his interviews with the conference hosts Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher , his performances were captivating .
It was less so on Wednesday evening when Tim Cook , who became Apple 's CEO just before Jobs ' death last fall , took the stage in southern California .
Cook is brilliant , and was plainly at ease in front of an array of tech industry luminaries and financiers .
And I did n't hear any outright lies .
But with a few exceptions , during the 90-minute interview , his performance was a master class of evasion and clichÃ © .
In its own way , though , the Cook interview was the most illuminating public appearance to date of one of the world 's most influential and powerful corporate heads .
To those who have been watching , this may have been no surprise .
But to a wider audience that will watch the video in months to come , Cook will come into clearer focus .
Cook has ample justification for his evident self - confidence .
Under Jobs , his work as Apple 's chief operating officer â€ “ chiefly , in turning the supply chain into one of Apple 's most important competitive advantages â€ “ set a modern standard .
Apple has gone from strength to strength , with stunning results generated primarily from the sale of its mobile devices , the iPad and iPhone .
It 's possible that Apple could become the first company to be worth $ 1tn ( though I think it 's unlikely ) .
The Apple CEO made it clear that he is not attempting to be a new Steve Jobs .
Echoing material from Walter Isaacson 's authorized Jobs biography , published shortly after his death , Cook reminded the audience that his predecessor had insisted that he not run Apple in a "" What would Steve do ? "" manner .
Where Jobs largely succeeded in extending his famous "" reality distortion field "" to cover this high - octane crowd , Cook plainly knew he could never accomplish the same effect .
Still , Cook certainly emulated several of Jobs ' signal qualities at the conference .
Asked about Apple 's penchant for secrecy , Cook said the company was "" going to double - down on secrecy on ( upcoming ) products "" , though he said the company will be more open about its supplier and environmental processes .
While it 's common for CEOs to recite talking points and little else in such circumstances , Cook went beyond that .
He exuded disdain for the give - and - take of the interview format â€ “ again and again , ducking questions he considered inconvenient or heading into territory Apple considers a deep secret .
And when Fortune magazine 's Adam Lashinsky , who wrote a smart book on Apple 's methods without any cooperation from the company , asked Cook to describe his own best and worst qualities as a CEO , the response was a casual rebuff .
There were moments , though , when the audience got more substance .
Apple recruited Cook back in 1998 .
Cook was deeply skeptical .
But in his first meeting with Jobs , it took just five minutes before he was convinced to jettison a comfortable executive post at Compaq ( later bought by Hewlett Packard ) in order to join a then - struggling Apple .
Jobs described a strategy â€ “ moving squarely into consumer electronics when other computer companies were racing toward the enterprise ( large customers )
â€ “ that was compelling .
When you 're following the herd , Cook said , "" you 're destined to be average , at best . ""
Seduced by Jobs ' ideas and uncompromising demand for excellence , "" I decided to throw caution to the wind and do this . ""
Apple 's small shifts under Cook have included a program whereby the company matches employees ' charitable contributions , a big change from Jobs ' adamant ( and , I believe , misguided ) belief that corporations and philanthropy should not mix .
He persuasively made the case that Apple 's new approach spreads the wealth more efficiently than the traditional corporate - giving model .
He 'd make an even better case if he let shareholders â€ “ the actual owners â€ “ do the same with some of the company 's billions in cash , though the new dividend program is useful in itself .
What emerged , ultimately , from Cook 's appearance was what he undoubtedly intended to display : a man of supreme self - control , plus equally supreme confidence in the company 's future .
Given the nature of such events , expecting anything deeper was probably wishful thinking .
But when it was Jobs on the stage , however one felt about him , we did get more â€ “ much , much more ."
2012-06-15,"Apple 's package - design team had just returned from its presentation to Steve Jobs , and the faces told the story â€ “ they had that "" things did n't go exactly as we planned "" look . ""
The suspense is killing me , "" I said to the project leader .
"" How 'd it go this morning ? ""
"" Well , "" he said , "" Steve hit us with the Simple Stick . ""
Translation :
Jobs had rejected their work â€ “ not because it was bad but because , in some way , it failed to distil the idea to its essence .
The person leading the project had directed the team to create packaging for two versions of the same product .
Jobs had decided this was brain - dead . ""
Just combine them , "" he said .
"" One product , one box .
"" There was no need to explore the idea of a second package .
He was right .
It was simpler , quicker , better .
The conversation was over in minutes , and it left one very smart and talented group of people wondering why they had n't thought of that before .
The Simple Stick symbolises a core value within Apple .
Sometimes it 's held up as inspiration ; other times it 's wielded like a caveman 's club : a deep , almost religious belief in the power of simplicity .
If you 're prepared to do battle with complexity , you 'll have no trouble finding a fight .
Chances are you 're surrounded by it .
Unless you work in the rarest of environments , complexity lives inside your organisation 's hierarchy , its goals , and probably most of your colleagues as well .
If your company ever fails , you can be sure it wo n't be the fault of simplicity â€ “ it will be the result of its absence .
Think brutal Clarity propels an organisation .
Not occasional clarity but pervasive , 24-hour , in - your - face , take - no - prisoners clarity .
Most people never perceive that this is lacking in their organisation , but 90 % of the time it is .
Just open a few random emails , activate your "" brutal - vision "" , and read .
The muddying messages are rampant .
If people were brutally honest in their emails , the time we spend sorting through our in - boxes would surely decrease by half .
Steve Jobs demanded straightforward communication from others as much as he dished it out himself .
He 'd cut you off if you rambled .
He ran his business as if there were precious little time to waste , which well reflected the reality for Apple â€ “ as surely it does for any company serious about competing .
This is probably the one element of Simplicity that 's easiest to institute .
Just be honest and never hold back .
Demand the same from those you work with .
You 'll make some people squirm , but everyone will know where they stand ; 100 % of your group 's time will be focused on forward progress â€ “ no need to decode what people are really saying .
There is a general perception that Jobs was the nasty tyrant who demanded allegiance , barked commands , and instilled the fear of God in those around him .
While Jobs certainly did exhibit these behaviours , this portrait is incomplete .
The man could also be funny , warm , and even charming .
There is a huge difference between being brutally honest and simply being brutal .
You ca n't let yourself be talked into going along with something when you know it can be better .
Ever .
To settle for second best is a violation of the rules of simplicity , and it plants the seeds for disappointment , extra work , and more meetings .
Most disturbing , it puts you in the worst possible business position : having to defend an idea you never believed in .
Your challenge is to become unbending when it comes to enforcing your standards .
Mercilessly so .
If you submit only the work you believe in 100 % and approve only the work you believe in 100 % , you own something that no one can take away from you : integrity .
As often happens in life , one must often suffer the consequences of doubting before becoming a believer .
I 'm not proud of it , but that 's the way I learned my lesson about standards .
There was a certain amount of theatre that went on inside Apple .
The rules were well known , and a number of dramas played out with predictability .
That Jobs was intolerant of stupidity is a matter of record .
He was n't at all polite when stupidity reared its ugly head .
He especially was n't fond of employing stupidity , so if you were on Apple 's staff and wanted to retain that status , it was wise not to display your lack of smarts in a meeting with him .
You 'd just set him off and get it right between the eyes .
A former Apple senior staffer remembers a routine that he saw played out often during his time as a direct report to Jobs .
He calls it "" the rotating turret "" .
There was no predicting when it would happen , as it depended on how conversations evolved .
But in some meeting , at some random time , some poor soul in the room would say something that everyone in the room could tell was going to light Jobs 's fuse .
First came the uncomfortable pause .
The offending comment would reverberate in the air , and it would seem as if the entire world went into slow motion as Jobs 's internal sensors fixed on the origin of the sound wave .
You could almost hear the meshing of gears as his "" turret "" slowly turned toward the guilty party .
Everyone knew what was comingâ€”but was powerless to stop it .
Finally , the turret would lock on to its target .
In a split second Jobs would activate his firing mechanism , and without a second thought he 'd unload all his ammunition .
It was uncomfortable to watch and even more uncomfortable to experience , but at Apple it was just a fact of life .
Think small How many overpopulated meetings do you sit through in a year ?
How many of those meetings get sidetracked or lose focus in a way that would never occur if the group were half the size ?
The small group rule requires enforcement , but it 's worth the cost .
Out in the real world , when I talk about small groups of smart people , I rarely get any pushback .
That 's because common sense tells us it 's the right way to go .
Most people know from experience that the fastest way to lose focus , squander valuable time , and water down great ideas is to entrust them to a larger group .
Just as we know that there is equal danger in putting ideas at the mercy of a large group of approvers .
One reason why large , unwieldy groups tend to be created in many companies is that the culture of a company is bigger than any one person .
It 's hard to change "" the way we do things here "" .
This is where the zealots of simplicity need to step in and overcome the inertia .
One must be judicious and realistic about applying the small - group principle .
Simply making groups smaller will obviously not solve all problems , and "" small "" is a relative term .
Only you know your business and the nature of your projects , so only you can draw the line between too few people and too many .
You need to be the enforcer and be prepared to hit the process with the Simple Stick when the group is threatened with unnecessary expansion .
In one iconic technology company with which I worked I found a framed sign in every conference room designed to nudge the employees toward greater productivity .
The headline on the sign was how to have a successful meeting .
The content read like it came right out of a corporate manual , which it likely did .
It featured a bullet - pointed list of things like : "" State the agenda at the start of your meeting , "" "" Encourage participation by all attendees , "" and "" Conclude your meeting with agreement on next steps "" .
What these signs really said , though , was : "" Welcome to a very big company !
Just follow these signs and you 'll fit in well .
"" It 's not hard to imagine Jobs , who actively fought big - company behaviour , gleefully ripping these signs off the wall and replacing them with Ansel Adams prints that might provide a moment of reflection or inspiration .
If you ever work at Apple there will be no signs on the wall telling you how to run a meeting .
Likewise , there will be no signs telling you how to tie your shoes or fill a glass of water .
The assumption is that you are well equipped with brains and common sense and that you 're a fully functioning adult .
If you 're not already a disciple of simplicity , you 'll become one soon .
Either that , or you 'll decide you 'd rather not be part of such a thing , which is okay too .
Simplicity prefers not having to train a bucking bronco .
If big companies really feel compelled to put something on their walls , a better sign might read : How to Have a Great Meeting 1 .
Throw out the least necessary person at the table .
2 .
Walk out of this meeting if it lasts more than 30 minutes .
3 .
Do something productive today to make up for the time you spent here .
Think clarity
This is an area where just about every business needs more work .
Words are powerful , but more words are not more powerful â€ “ they 're often just confusing .
Understand that in your company 's internal business and in communications with your customers , dissertations tend to drive people away .
Though many writers never seem to grasp the point , using intelligent words does not necessarily make you appear smarter .
The best way to make yourself or your company look smart is to express an idea simply and with perfect clarity .
No matter who your audience is , it 's more effective to communicate as people do naturally .
In simple sentences .
Using simple words .
Simplicity is its own form of cleverness â€ “ saying a great deal by saying little .
Think human
Unless you 're in the business of sterilising things , business is no place to be sterile .
Have the boldness to look beyond numbers and spreadsheets and allow your heart to have a say in the matter .
Bear in mind that the intangibles are every bit as real as the metrics â€ “ are often even more important .
The simplest and most effective way to connect with human beings is to speak with a human voice .
It may be necessary in your business to market to specific target groups , but bear in mind that every target is a human being , and human beings respond to simplicity .
Best advice : Just be true to your species .
This is an edited extract from Insanely Simple : The Obsession
That Drives Apple 's Success by Ken Segall ( Portfolio Penguin , Â£14.99 ) or at Guardian Bookshop for Â£11.99 Doing business the Steve Jobs way"
2012-06-28,"It is known as the "" Little French Box "" , a 1980s design classic now seen as the ultimate in beige plastic kitsch .
But once it was an audacious precursor to the world wide web , introduced the first cybersex into people 's living rooms and had a user - friendly design that may have inspired Steve Jobs 's first Macintosh computer .
Yet , on Saturday , the plug will finally be pulled on the Minitel machine , France 's one - time pride and joy , 30 years after its launch .
And while the nation marvels at the fact that 800,000 of the clunky terminals with massive buttons are still in circulation , the Minitel is shedding its square image and enjoying a moment of mass nostalgia .
Farewell parties and newspaper memorials are reminiscing about the time when , thanks to the Minitel , the French public could electronically check the weather , book a holiday , monitor their bank accounts and view share prices or horoscopes more than a decade before any other country .
And yet the Minitel failed to sell abroad and existed in almost glorious isolation in France .
The Minitel was dreamed up in the 1970s when France was lagging behind on telecommunications , with the nation 's homes underserved by telephones – particularly in rural areas .
Amid a technological dawn in France , it was , with the TGV railway , a matter of political and national pride .
The state communications company came up with a system combining the telephone and information technology and , in 1982 , rolled out the Minitel , delivering the sets free to homes – the first widely available screen - keyboard combination in any country .
First it was used as an electronic yellow pages .
Other services quickly followed , paid very easily through charges per - minute on the family phone bill , with service providers receiving a cut .
Soon the French were using it to check exam results , apply to university , book trains and chat online , years before the internet 's blogs or social networking .
At the height of its glory in the mid-1990s , the French owned about 9 m Minitel devices , with 25 m users connecting to more than 23,000 services .
Former president Jacques Chirac boasted that a baker in Aubervilliers outside Paris could check their bank account on the Minitel , asking pointedly : "" Can the same be said of a baker in New York ? ""
One of the biggest hits on Minitel was the so - called "" Minitel Rose "" , the world 's first electronic adult chatrooms , where people using pseudonyms patiently exchanged steamy messages that took what would now seem an eternity to appear on screen .
Several of today 's most influential media bosses made huge fortunes on the "" pink messaging "" services with their chatroom startup companies .
Services with names such as Ulla gained mythical status in France , billboards advertised the services and even a pop ballad , Goodbye Marylou by Michel Polnareff immortalised these late - night erotic chat exchanges , musing on typing on his keyboard "" all the voiceless words we say with our fingertips "" .
The longer users stayed online messaging , the more the service providers made .
The musician Gerome Nox recently told the newspaper Libération how he had worked on one of the services posing as a hostess called Julie to attract men and keep them online as long as possible .
He compared the men replying to his messages to "" starving piranhas , no bonjour , no pleasantries , it was direct and crude "" .
He said he decided to stop as "" my Julie had become more and more disagreeable and hateful "" .
He unmasked himself , typing : "" I 'm not called Julie .
I 'm a man , just here to rack up your phone bill .
You 've been screwed , which was just what you wanted all along . ""
He was fired .
France tried to market Minitel abroad but failed to get big international takers , and it was eventually overtaken in the late 1990s by the world wide web .
Minitel 's official closure comes as many people in France still use it , ranging from farmers and elderly people without computers to professionals such as florists and tobacconists who still place supplier orders through it and people who kept old Minitel sets as an insurance policy in case their computers picked up a virus .
As late as 2007 , it was generating high revenues .
Janine Galey , 85 , a mother of seven in Paris , said she used it for almost 20 years until around 2000 , long after the advent of the internet .
She did not have a computer at home and recently went straight from Minitel to an iPad tablet computer . ""
As an object , it was pleasing to the eye , intelligently designed , it was n't heavy
and it did n't take up too much space , "" she said .
"" At first it sat in the study of my flat and then on a little table in my bedroom .
It was easy to operate and I 'd use it to find names and addresses , to check train times and reserve tickets . ""
Valérie Schafer , co - author of the book Minitel : France 's Digital Childhood , said : "" At the start in the 80s , there was a real sense of pride in Minitel as a success story of our national industry – with the one problem that we never exported it ; it remained very French .
Then at the end of the 1990s and in 2000s the discourse changed and Minitel was talked about as quite square , outdated , behind . ""
But now it 's the end of Minitel , we 're discovering that the French have an attachment to it , as part of our industrial history .
Despite all the negative talk of the past , it 's now being seen as a success in terms of the national economy . ""
Despite everything , there 's a nostalgia for an era when French developed new ideas , took risks on ideas that did n't just look to the US or outside models : a time when we wanted to invent our own voice . """
2012-06-30,"Eulogised as the greatest chief executive ever , Steve Jobs made Apple the world 's most valuable company before he died last October .
It was all down to his obsession with simplicity , writes Ken Segall , the ad man who devised the famous "" i "" prefix in Apple 's product names .
Segall 's book has the trappings of a management guide , with each chapter explaining a part of Apple 's philosophy .
But he avoids being didactic , providing an entertaining perspective on how Apple typically gets it right , citing Jobs 's insistence on straight talking , foolproof designs and memorable slogans , and his aversion to overstaffed meetings and big - company culture .
An obvious admirer , the author does not flinch from pointing out Jobs 's mistakes , showing that simplicity does not come easily .
His diagnoses of problems at other technology companies are candid and insightful , for example the benefits of Apple 's slim product range compared with the expanding catalogues of its rivals .
Insanely Simple should be required reading for any boss with a Byzantine organisation and a shrinking business ."
2012-07-02,"RIM , as pretty much everyone - including RIM 's management - knows , is in serious trouble .
Analysts have cut their targets for its stock price to just $ 5 , which given that it presently has total cash and equivalents of $ 4 per share , means that they see little prospect of improvement ; Nomura even said that it could run out of cash .
It has made losses for the past two quarters , and there 's no sign of that changing suddenly .
This all sounds like a business headed for hell in a handbasket , or a breakup , or simple sale .
But RIM could survive on its own terms , and even become a challenger again .
It wo n't be easy , but all it needs to do is to take a lesson from the company that blindsided it in the smartphone market - Apple .
In September 1996 , Apple had just lost $ 1.2bn for its financial year ( which with inflation is equivalent to $ 1.76bn today ) .
It was , as Steve Jobs said , about 90 days from bankruptcy .
It had been promising a next - generation operating system , but had repeatedly canned it and/or put it back .
( It had just acquired NeXT Computer , with Jobs at its head , in order to acquire that next - generation operating system ; NeXT had won a face - off with Jean - Louis GassÃ © e 's BeOS . )
It had too many staff .
It had too many products .
People were n't interested .
They were so convinced it was going to die that they were abandoning it for the only real rival .
So really RIM today is not too different from Apple then ; except that RIM is n't anything like as near to death as Apple was .
So how can RIM thrive ?
The following will be uncomfortable reading to some in RIM - because it will cost them their jobs - but Apple 's example shows that there 's a way forward .
Slim down the number of products into a comprehensible set Four will do .
I 've long since given up trying to figure out the difference between a BlackBerry Bold .
Curve , 9800 , 9700 and the rest .
Seriously , is there any ?
This US smartphone listing for RIM shows 22 products .
That 's absurd .
How can anyone choose between them ?
That 's worse than Apple 's 1996 menagerie of 15 different computers - Quadra , Power Macintosh , and so on , each demanding its own products .
When you 're in trouble , reduce the complexity , because that cuts out production and stock costs too .
Jobs cut a swathe through the bloated product range , reducing it to four .
Do n't think about selling Trying to think of selling the business , and maximising the individual value of each bit , distracts from actually running the business for the future .
You 'll have more of a going concern ( if things come to that ) by building a strong business .
Apple was nearly sold to Sun , and to IBM , in its darkest days ; if that had happened , it would now be a footnote in history .
Thinking about sales is what bankers do , and there 's a team of them crawling over RIM at the moment .
Ignore them and get on with the work .
Partition your market to give yourself clarity Steve Jobs created a quadrant : consumers and professionals on one side , laptops and desktops on the other .
( This was long before iPods , iPads or iPhones . )
Consumer looking for a laptop ?
Here you go - iBook .
Professional after a desktop ?
Power Mac for you .
Simpler to make , simpler to choose .
RIM needs that same clarity .
It could almost split its market into two - consumer and enterprise .
High - end and low - end .
Four phones .
Sorted .
Dump products that are n't working Simple , really .
Jobs killed the Newton .
Time for RIM to kill the PlayBook , which has shipped a grand total of 1.1 m in a full year while costing it billions in production , writeoffs and distraction .
And of course kill at least 18 of those damn phones .
Hire a visionary , inspiring chief executive
This is bad news for Heins , but the brutal truth is that you do n't lead a company out of the valley of death by doing the meat - and - potatoes work ( to mix metaphors ) .
Jobs was exactly the right person for Apple : he was committed to its survival and he 'd learnt his errors and weaknesses through his failures at NeXT Computer and successes at Pixar .
( His hiring of Tim Cook , an exemplary supply chain controller , in 1997 was indicative of that recognition . )
So who 's the right person for RIM ?
Often , founders can revive a company ; besides Jobs , there was Michael Dell returning to Dell in 2008 , when he saw the business he created in trouble .
( That has n't been enthralling , but Dell was in less trouble . )
However in this case the two founders are Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis , who were only ejected in January .
Neither is the right one to run the company out of the pit , because they got it there in the first place , although Lazaridis is a brilliant inventor .
I 'd suggest there 's an obvious candidate : Jon Rubinstein , ex - Apple hardware chief , ex - Palm chief , ex - head of HP 's tablet effort .
He was drafted into Palm in June 2009 after things began going seriously wrong , and got it organised enough to release the WebOS software and Palm Pre products .
That was n't enough to dig Palm out of its troubles ( and "" Ruby "" seems to have hated life inside the byzantine bureaucracy of HP ) but there 's no doubt that he has the management skills to turn RIM around .
Unfortunately for Heins , in this situation he gets to be the Gil Amelio - the incumbent CEO who gets pushed out by the cuckoo , and can take none of the credit for any subsequent success .
Cut jobs
Sorry , but this has to happen to get costs down .
Start with the people who are doing all the marketing stuff for those 22 different phones and work outwards .
Give up the idea of BlackBerry 10 as a smartphone platform Also : drop the idea of trying to sell pricey BB10 handsets in 2013 .
This sounds bizarre , does n't it ?
Are n't we constantly hearing that BB10 is RIM 's last great hope ?
But nobody can see the point in trying to sell BB10 on handsets .
Heins has showed off touchscreen versions .
Be honest .
Those wo n't persuade people to ignore iPhones or Android phones ( or Nokia phones ) .
They 'll vanish into the abyss .
Mobile carriers like selling RIM 's phones because they make better profits on them than they do on iPhones or top - end Android handsets .
There 's a burgeoning and eager group of buyers in the developing world who like the BlackBerry keyboard .
There are also lots of corporate users who like the keyboard .
Keep them happy ; play for time .
( You could improve your browser , but stick with the basics in the meantime . )
Stop developing the great - thing - before - the - last - one , and develop the next great thing You 're never going to beat Chinese handset makers at churning out cheap handsets ; you 're never going to beat Apple or Samsung at the top end .
Do n't pick fights you ca n't win .
Instead , do what Apple did to you : develop something that leapfrogs the competition .
Go past smartphones to the next thing that we 're going to do in connectivity .
RIM did it before , leapfrogging featurephones to offer phones with data and email ( and web browsing of sorts ) built in .
Now it needs to do it again .
And what is next ?
Wearable computing - the sort of thing being demonstrated by Google with its Glass project .
You should n't need to take your smartphone out of your pocket to see what messages and
so on you have , nor should you need to press buttons to make things happen .
A really "" smart "" smartphone will do all this and connect to things on your body - less an object , more a network of objects you use .
Does that sound bizarre and futuristic ?
No more so than the idea of people carrying around little pocket computers and using them to find their way around unfamiliar places would have 15 or so years ago .
Wearables are much closer than that - and so perhaps close enough for RIM to develop something before the next wave sweeps over it .
In fact , QNX is rather a good choice for a wearable computing system , as Jean - Louis GassÃ

e points out : QNX software is the preferred choice for life - critical systems such as air traffic control systems , surgical equipment , and nuclear power plants .
And its cool multimedia features have QNX software turning up in everything from in - dash radios and infotainment systems to the latest casino gaming terminals .
That sounds rather cool for wristwatches that tell you emails and calls , or glasses that show you maps .
QNX could be the great secret asset - rather as NeXTStep , the NexT OS , eventually was for Apple ; it forms the core of iOS , which is earning all those billions .
Conclusion
It 's pretty simple : RIM has to simplify its product line , cut its workforce , hire a visionary and build the next great thing .
How long should that take ?
Well , for Apple the gap between Jobs reappearing on the scene and the launch of the iPod , its first breakaway product , was five years .
Rubinstein ( let 's assume he comes out of retirement to take the job ) might not have that long - but if RIM can stop burning cash on lost causes like the PlayBook , focus its spending on a few products , keep a core audience ( teenagers and businesses and carriers ) then it can come through this .
Well , here 's hoping ."
2012-07-19,"Apple 's court battle against Korea 's Samsung in the US has yielded pictures of a prototype iPad , and testimony from chief designer Jonathan I ve which indicates that the American company was working on a tablet design called "" 035 "" as far back as 2002 - even though Steve Jobs denied exactly that a year later .
Jobs told an audience at the AllThingsD conference in April 2003 that tablets were a "" niche market "" : "" a bunch of rich guys who can afford their third computers . ""
He told Walt Mossberg : "" If you do email of any volume you 've got ta have a keyboard .
We looked at the [ Microsoft ] tablet and we think it 's gon na fail . ""
The audience would be too small , limited to the very wealthy : "" You know , they 've got their desktop , they got a portable , and now they got one of these to read with
, that 's your market . ""
But testimony from I ve , given in one of the many court battles between Samsung and Apple in the US , says that he had seen the prototype - in effect a mockup of a working product - as early as 2002 .
"" My recollection of first seeing it is very hazy , but it was , I 'm guessing , some time between 2002 and 2004â€ ¦
I remember seeing this and perhaps models similar to this when we were first exploring tablet designs that ultimately became the iPad . ""
The prototype - pictures of which are shown here ( some from the original court documents , and some courtesy of Buzzfeed ) show that I ve 's original designs for the iPad were a bulky device almost as large as the Macbook laptop that the company then made .
It has no home button , although it does have an Apple logo on the back .
Compared to the iPad launched in 2010 , the "" 035 "" looks enormously thick .
It has the same rounded corners used on the existing iPad .
Samsung is using the evidence of the prototype - which was referenced in a patent filed by Apple - to say that there should be no restriction on sales of its Galaxy Tab in the US .
In line with the way that the cases between Samsung and Apple have thrown both companies into contorted legal positions - with Apple now facing the prospect of advertising its rival 's product , while Samsung saw a complaint from Apple dismissed on the basis that the Korean 's product was "" not cool "" - in a docket filed on 6 July , Samsung insists that Apple should not be able to injunct its sales in the US because they are so small : ""
Even when the entire family of Galaxy Tab tablets is considered collectively , Samsung only has a 15.4 % share of Android tablets , "" it says in its deposition .
"" This new evidence demonstrates that Samsung is not only not ' flooding the market ; ' it is actually losing market share to Apple and other manufacturers . "" Samsung also says that Apple invalidated one of its own patents on the iPad - style design with an earlier product , the "" Brain Box "" display which it showed off in 1997 , which had a flat surface from edge to edge .
The difference in size is emphasised by the photos from the court case , where Samsung is comparing the 035 prototype with its own Samsung Galaxy Tab , and with the existing Apple iPad , to show that the device on which the patent is based is too different from its own for the latter to be considered an infringement .
That Apple had been working on the iPad and a tablet - after Jobs saw Bill Gates launch the idea at Comdex 2000 - before the iPhone had been known ; I ve and his team shelved the idea because of cost issues , because touchscreens were still very expensive early in the decade .
Instead they focussed on the iPhone because of the far larger potential in the phone market and the fact that the smaller screens would bring down costs .
But the existence of the "" 035 "" prototype had remained secret beyond Apple and the courtroom until this week .
The fact that Jobs in effect lied about Apple 's work on a tablet only indicates how such large organisations are very good at keeping secrets .
John - Henry Barac , a former designer with The Guardian , recalls visiting Apple in October 2004 as part of a personal visit .
His first day was spent meeting people at the Graphic design studio - where , he says , "" where many things were covered with white paper
so I could n't see them , but due to someone 's carelessness or some kind of bizarre test - I 'll never know - there was a poster for a device which did n't yet exist ; it turned out to be the iPod shuffle which was announced a short time later . ""
The next day he met I ve , and the conversation veered towards personal organisers : "" I talked to him about my Palm Pilot , and how I liked it , but it felt a little clunky ( I have a note to myself which says ' PDA - other directions ? ' )
- I said - ' you have this Inkwell ( handwriting ) technology , and this notion of the digital hub .
Why not build a device that is not a PDA , but relies on the computer for doing much of the work but you have some limited input abilities , and perhaps video viewing ability , and easy sync email and addresses via Wi - Fi ? '
Jony gave me a look which was , I though slightly playful and just said ' iiiinteresting ' in a way that you just know there is something going on , but you know not to ask anything more . ""
So this week images emerge of prototype iPads dating back to 2002 - 4 .
And we all know now that by then [ Apple 's designers ] were definitely beginning to look at touch screen , iPhone ideas etc .
It puts my conversation with Jony I ve in a different perspective .
There WAS stuff going on , and my desires as a consumer and designer connected with their secret works ... but the story was all yet to unfold . ""
While I was sitting there chatting to Jony there was also a brief interruption as a smiling Phil Schiller came to within a few feet of us and said ' Hey Jony , you know that thing that was black ?
I just made it green - OK ? '
He was beaming .
Jony just said ' Uh - OK , Phil ... i liked the sense of play and knowledge that they were playing with stuff that could change the world in some small ways . ""

2012-08-08,"When Steve Jobs launched the first iPhone he invited Google 's former chief executive Eric Schmidt on stage , but one of the most successful collaborations in Silicon Valley is gradually being unpicked .
Apple has taken another step to creating a Google - free iPhone by confirming that the latest version of its mobile software will not come with YouTube pre - loaded .
The search giant has had a major presence on the iPhone since the first model appeared in 2007 , with Apple 's bestselling product dependent on Google for three of its most popular applications : search , maps and YouTube .
Apple has already announced that Google maps will be dropped from the iOS6 software when it is released this autumn .
It has now emerged that the YouTube icon will no longer automatically appear on the home screen .
In a brief statement , Apple said : "" Our licence to include the YouTube app in iOS has ended , customers can use YouTube in the Safari browser and Google is working on a new YouTube app to be on the App Store . ""
The days when Schmidt had a seat on the Apple board are long gone .
Since the arrival of Google 's Android phone operating software as a powerful contender to the iPhone , the two companies now compete directly .
While the changes to maps and YouTube may not seem earth moving , speculation is now mounting that Apple will oust its rival from its most lucrative iPhone stronghold .
Google is the default search button when using the Safari browser on iPhones .
It is a privilege that is said to cost Larry Page and Sergey Brin 's company $ 1bn a year in shared advertising revenues .
The iPhone accounts for two thirds of mobile web browsing , making the position of default search option a major revenue earner for whoever holds it .
Apple has already dumped Google in China in preference for the country 's native firm Baidu , and in the west may decide to give its prime spot to Yahoo or Microsoft 's Bing engine .
News of any change could come as early as 12 September , the date on which Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 5 ."
2012-08-25,"For Tim Cook , Apple 's chief executive , who took over from Steve Jobs a year ago , the court victory over Samsung will have been sweet .
Normally , patent disputes rarely produce clean victories .
But the decision by the nine - member jury in San Jose , just a few miles from Apple 's headquarters , is dramatic .
Apple had been suing Samsung for $ 2.5bn in damages , claiming Samsung 's phones and tablets copied its devices ' behaviour and appearance ; Samsung counter - claimed about $ 200 m , saying the iPhone and iPad used its wireless 3 G standard technologies , and methods for tasks such as sending a photo by email from a phone .
Apple won on almost every count it claimed ; Samsung , on absolutely none .
It was a dramatic demonstration of the home court advantage .
Samsung Electronics can bear the $ 1.05bn in damages – in the second quarter of this year alone its operating profit was $ 5.86bn – but the hit to its reputation is substantial .
Apple can portray it as a looter of intellectual property , a copyist , an unimaginative follower .
Apple can also now go after HTC and Motorola , its two principal smartphone rivals in the US , with renewed vigour .
They may have to consider whether to sue for peace , for Samsung lost despite being the biggest of the mobile makers , the biggest smartphone maker , the biggest implementer of Google 's Android mobile software , and
extremely rich —
it spent $ 9.5bn on market in the past 12 months , and is a major sponsor of the Olympics .
More than that , though , Apple will hope that this decision will put second thoughts and self - doubt into the minds of every industrial designer and software engineer competing in the smartphone and tablet business around the world .
Apple 's key rival here is Google , whose Android software Samsung used to build its phones .
But Apple can only go after the handset makers that implement Android , not the creators themselves ; even so , by winning on Friday , it will have nervous engineers at the handset makers , who are using Android in ever - growing numbers , pausing as they compare their latest products with the next iPhone .
Is it too similar ?
Will this trigger a lawsuit ?
Should I change it ?
The patent wars have dismayed many , who find the legal fighting tedious , and wish the companies would just work on innovation .
Apple , for its part , insists that it is happy with competition — but that rivals should do their own innovation .
The rivals shoot back that Apple is trying to patent ideas that have been obvious and implemented before .
Despite this result , Android is likely to keep winning the battle to run the world 's smartphones ; it ran on 64 % of the smartphones shipped worldwide in spring , and 80 % of the smartphone shipped in China in that period ; the iPhone had 12 % .
Android is running on phones that are getting cheaper and cheaper all the time .
It would n't be worth Apple 's time to sue every company using it .
But in the US , where its most valuable customers are , Apple definitely sees the effort as worth going to .
The decision in San Jose may be the first of many .
The question now is whether Google , whose Motorola subsidiary a week ago filed a fresh series of patent infringement claims against Apple — claims which could halt sales of the iPhone and iPad , if upheld — can manage to drive the war to a settlement .
So far , there 's no sign of that happening .
And Apple is yet another billion dollars richer ."
2012-09-13,"Apple has unveiled the iPhone 5 , describing it as the thinnest , lightest and fastest handset yet as the brand behind today 's personal computing revolution sets out to prove that it still has the creative edge to dazzle consumers without Steve Jobs at its helm .
Promising a camera that makes "" the ocean look bluer "" and "" kids look happier "" , Apple showed off a gadget with a taller 4-inch screen and thinner body , capable of running on 4 G mobile networks , including in the UK .
In what has now become an international event , the online audience following this year 's showcase was the largest since the first groundbreaking Apple handset arrived in 2007 , but commentators have already described it as the last great iPhone launch .
British shoppers will be able to buy the new handset from 21 September , with the unsubsidised price starting from £ 529 and depending on memory size .
Apple unveiled a new version of its iTunes music , film and TV series store .
The updated software , available from October , uses cloud computing so that viewing paused on one device can be resumed at the same point on another .
The UK 's largest mobile network , EE , will have an effective monopoly on sales , given that it will be the only network with 4 G service before Christmas and rivals could take up to a year before they are ready to launch one .
With a feature set widely leaked before the launch – and described by one tech blogger as "" evolutionary rather than revolutionary "" – sales of the latest version of Apple 's "" Jesus Phone "" will be watched closely by those who wonder whether the world 's largest company has what it takes under new chief executive Tim Cook to retain its creative momentum .
From the launch event in San Francisco , Cook said : "" Only Apple could create such amazing hardware , software and services and bring them together .
Apple has never been stronger . ""
Apple is expected to shift significantly more phones in the runup to Christmas than the 37 m it sold last year , with research firm IDC predicting sales of 51 m units .
Nonetheless , it now has a fierce competitor in Samsung , which has already shipped 20 m of its best selling Galaxy SIII handsets and is expected to slash its price over the coming weeks .
"" The company has changed , "" said IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo .
"" It is a lot more focused on profits and management rather than product .
Hopefully that wo n't bring Apple back to where it was in the past . ""
In 1996 , when Jobs rejoined the company after a period in the wilderness , it was on the verge of bankruptcy .
All that changed with successive hits including the brightly coloured iMac computers , the iPod , which changed the music industry , and the world 's most popular phones and tablets .
With the release of the first iPhone in 2007 , Apple triggered a personal computing revolution which has shifted our online lives away from PCs and laptops and on to smartphones and tablets .
It is a revolution that has turned Apple into the world 's most valuable company , with $ 620bn market capitalisation and a near $ 100bn pile of unspent cash , largely held in foreign bank accounts to avoid the tax bill repatriation would incur .
A successful iPhone 5 could boost GDP in the US , with ripples around the world for the more than 150 companies in Apple 's supply chain , and the mobile networks hoping to fatten their revenues from an increasingly smartphone dependent subscriber base .
But a new edition that lacks the wow factor needed to persuade shoppers to part with hundreds of pounds to replace their existing smartphones could have wider implications .
"" There is an economic impact if they do n't come up with something more exciting than they did last time , "" says telecoms strategist Bengt Nordström .
"" The impact will be slower growth in the industry , and this is one of the few industries that have been growing . ""
Cook was never the ideas man , but is credited with making the Jobs vision a commercial success by reorganising Apple into a slick money - making outfit , closing its factories and outsourcing manufacturing to an array of largely Asian suppliers .
The challenge now is whether Apple can hold on to its creative edge without Jobs .
To make this happen , Cook is relying on those who report to him such as British - born Sir Jonathan I ve whose minimalist designs and attention to detail can be seen in Apple 's hardware , and head of software Scott Forstall .
The fact that so many of the iPhone 5 's features , from photographs of its inner workings to its screen size and 4 G capability , were leaked before the launch added to the feeling that Apple 's marketing events have lost some of their magic .
Jobs was a master showman , obsessively keeping details under wraps until the last moment , and often saving the most interesting news until the end of his presentations , pretending to walk off the stage before announcing , finger in the air , that he did have "" one more thing "" .
But as Ricky Gervais pointed out , there are legions of diehard Apple fans prepared to buy its latest hardware no matter how incremental the changes .
The comedian tweeted : "" Ca n't wait for the new iPhone 5 .
I 've had this mint condition , perfectly good , antique iPhone 4 for over a year now .
Embarrassing . """
2012-10-04,"On 4 October last year , Tim Cook took the stage for the first time at Apple 's HQ in Cupertino , California , as its full - time chief executive , to start unveiling what turned out to be the iPhone 4S.
It was also the first time Cook had been in the driving seat for an Apple presentation – which for years had been led by Steve Jobs , whose skill at making new products look desirable had become famed as a "" reality distortion field "" .
But Jobs was at his home nearby in Silicon Valley , gravely ill with neuroendocrine cancer , which had first been diagnosed in 2003 , and surgically treated in 2004 .
Jobs died the day after Cook stood on the stage ; his death led to a huge – and , to many , puzzling – outpouring of grief , and to a more explicable flurry of analyses suggesting that without its co - founder , Apple would wither on the vine .
A year on , Apple does n't look like a company in serious trouble .
It has risen in value by more than 75 % , from $ 346.2bn ( £ 215.2bn ) on 4 October last year to $ 619.9bn at the time of writing , becoming the most valuable listed company in the world and bringing it close to an all - time inflation - adjusted record ( beaten only by Microsoft in 1999 ) .
It has sold more iPhones in that period than ever before ( and then bettered that with pre - orders for the iPhone 5 , which was released last month ) .
Its profits have kept growing , in apparent defiance of any law of economic gravity .
"" I never viewed my role as to replace him , "" Cook told the AllThingsDigital conference in May. ""
Steve was an original .
I do n't think another one of those is being made .
I never felt the weight of being Steve . ""
But is Apple really the same company without Jobs and with Cook as its helmsman ?
Inside the company , the word is that nothing seems different ; business goes on as usual , work gets done , the relentless pressure on the staff continues .
One thing that has gone : Jobs 's sometimes infuriating ( to staff ) ability to argue one position on one day , and the exact opposite the next .
"" I saw it daily , "" Cook said .
But without Jobs , can Apple still innovate ?
George Colony of Forrester Research suggested in April that Apple will , like Sony after the death of its leader , Akio Morita , in 1999 , decline : "" When Steve Jobs departed , he took three things with him : 1 ) singular charismatic leadership that bound the company together and elicited extraordinary performance from its people ; 2 ) the ability to take big risks ; and 3 ) an unparalleled ability to envision and design products . ""
He suggested that Apple had between two and four years before revenue growth and product innovation would stall .
Cook , though , denied that Jobs had had such a key importance , especially in the product field . ""
The [ product ] curator role moves around as it always had [ when Jobs was there ] , "" Cook told the ATD conference . ""
No one person does it all . ""
Cook , like Jobs , still runs a tight ship in every sense : Apple is secretive about its plans and workings , with high - profile one - off presentations run by the top executives – Cook ; the marketing chief , Phil Schiller ; the iPhone software chief , Scott Forstall – over off - the - record meet - the - press brunches .
For journalists and analysts , predicting Apple 's next move is like being a Kremlinologist in the Soviet era : the slightest shift in public posture or hint of an approach to another company is minutely examined , and can stir rumours and make stock prices yo - yo .
Cook himself remains largely an enigma – though famed in the industry for his ability to control the supply chains that are essential to any hardware maker 's success .
Single , and just weeks from his 52nd birthday , he is known as a fitness nut who goes hiking and cycling , and whose day often starts at 4.30am with a barrage of emails .
His real skill , analysts agree , lies in the hidden iceberg of getting products built : the "" supply chain "" of manufacturers and parts makers who contribute everything that goes into the phones , tablets and computers it sells .
Yet to external observers , quite a few subtle differences are evident in the year since Jobs 's death .
The first was Cook 's decision in February to make donations to charity with Apple 's money – $ 50 m to Stanford hospitals , and a further $ 50 m to other causes since then .
Jobs , it was commonly agreed , would never have done that ; one book , Inside Apple , quotes him as saying that giving money away was "" a waste of time "" .
( And , presumably , money . )
The same month came another surprise : a statement about working conditions at the Foxconn plants in China where iPhones and iPads are made and assembled , in which Cook said : "" We believe that workers everywhere have the right to a safe and fair work environment "" and instituted wide - ranging checks by the Fair Labor Organisation , after a growing chorus of criticism over worker suicides and reports of exploitation .
Next was another move involving money : in March , Cook announced that Apple would begin paying a dividend on its shares , for the first time since March 1995 .
That was when it first began to run into financial problems – from which it was only saved by Jobs 's return in 1997 , and then his hiring of Cook to take over the supply chain in 1998 .
Also in March this year , Cook did yet another thing Jobs never did : a public visit to the Foxconn factories , where he was photographed on the assembly lines – something that none of the senior executives at other companies who also use Foxconn , such as Dell , HP or Microsoft , has done .
Charities , fair labour , dividends
– all put a much more empathic face on a company that under Jobs had seemed hard and uncaring , particularly over Chinese workers ' conditions .
That suggests that Cook is trying to mould the company to see itself not as a scrappy underdog – as it was under Jobs until recently –
but as what it actually is , a business giant , even though ( as Cook once put it ) all the individual products it sells could fit on a tabletop .
"" I think the overarching theme for Cook v Jobs is that Cook is trying to show a softer side of Apple , "" says Horace Dediu , who runs the Asymco consultancy .
"" He seems to be willing to put a gentle and less recalcitrant face on the company .
All these things , even dividends , are signals that Apple is kinder , gentler .
However , it 's early days .
Every new manager wants to place his mark on the company and distance himself from the predecessor .
In many ways they [ Apple ] have not changed . ""
Ian Fogg , head of mobile at IHS Screen Digest , says : "" If there is a change in Apple under Cook – and that 's far from certain –
it has been one of communication tone , and not product substance .
Apple now appears slightly softer , more human , more socially aware in its communications and is more willing to respond to consumer feedback . ""
The clearest example of that came just last month , when Cook penned an abject apology for the quality of the maps service on the new iPhone operating system .
With 100 million people using it within just a week , the criticisms about errors – in locations , naming , or omissions – were overwhelming .
Cook said he was "" extremely sorry "" and suggested a number of rival mapping services – including Nokia 's and Microsoft 's – available to iPhone users instead .
A number of commentators said that Jobs would never have written such an apology – and would never have allowed maps of that quality to be released as a fully fledged product .
But Carolina Milanesi , smartphone and tablets analyst at the Gartner research group , disagrees : "" People think that Steve [ Jobs ] would have never brought maps to market .
But there are indeed examples of products or services that came to market under Steve that were not perfect : ' antennagate ' with the iPhone 4 [ where call quality fell when the phone was held in the left hand ] and Mobile Me [ Apple 's first attempt at a cloud service in July 2008 , which saw people lose emails and synchronisations fail ] .
""
She thinks that when it came to the maps apology , "" doing a mea culpa was less damaging than letting people think that Apple 's core values have changed "" .
Ironically , given Cook 's expertise at wringing the best out of Apple 's suppliers
, it 's also the supply chain that most threatens the company 's treasured secrecy about what it will do next .
Ahead of the iPhone 5 launch , almost every detail about its physical appearance was known : the screen size , new charging interface , camera .
That 's because parts and photos had leaked out from various plants – and because iPhones are made by the million , and there 's huge value to rivals and accessory makers in knowing what the next model will look like , such details have become precious knowledge indeed .
The latest supply chain leaks – reported by the Wall Street Journal , which demands at least two separate sources for any "" anonymous "" story – suggest that Apple is building an "" iPad mini "" , a smaller version of its iPad , to be unveiled later this month .
It will be the first entirely new product Cook has overseen ; analysts are already totting up how many millions it might sell in the months until Christmas , even before its existence is confirmed .
It 's been a long haul for Cook , who said he wanted to work with Jobs within five minutes of his job interview in 1998 .
But he still has some way to go .
Milanesi , says : "" The status of demigod that Steve had meant he got away with more than your average CEO gets away with .
Tim is not Steve .
Which is not good or bad .
Just different . """
2012-10-05,"It 's been a year since Steve Jobs died and the fascination with the Apple founder â€ “ from his resistance to undergo radiation and chemotherapy to his tyrannical management techniques â€ “ continues .
Jobs kept his private life very private , but on question - and - answer site

After it touched bottom , bubbles floated to the top .

A week later I receive a package in the mail .
In this thick envelope was a letter from Steve Jobs speaking of his cancer fight and how he wished Rebecca a quick recovery .
So we witnessed the moment that Steve became a billionaire .
Quite the payoff for $ 50 m and almost a decade of hanging in there .
Steve was enthusiastic and engaging and we ended up conducting the interview while wandering the residential neighborhoods of Grinnell â€ “ tree - lined streets , big porches , lilacs blooming all around .

2012-10-23,"So if Apple is really launching a 7.85 in "" iPad mini "" , how does that square with what Steve Jobs said two years ago ?
You might recall that on 18 October 2010 , Jobs popped up on the discussion of Apple 's earnings results to put in his two billion - worth .
Apple at that time had had yet another good quarter : sales of the new iPhone 4 were going well ( a record , with phone sales up 94 % year - on - year to 14.1 m , and iPad sales too had begun gaining momentum â€ “ up from zero when the iPad went on sale in April 2010 , just six months earlier , to 4.2 m for the three months to September .
But at the IFA exhibition , Samsung had shown off a 7 in tablet â€ “ and others were starting to move into the tablet market , focussing on 7 in devices partly because it made the screens cheaper .
So what did Jobs say ?
After taking a potshot at RIM ( "" We 've now passed RIM , and I do n't seem them catching up with us in the foreseeable future "" ) and the lack of figures for Android phone sales â€ “ estimated by analysts at 20 m for the quarter , though Nokia 's Symbian was still the largest at 29 m ( "" Unfortunately , there is no solid data on how many Android phones are shipped each quarter .
We hope that manufacturers will soon start reporting the number of Android handsets they ship each quarter "" â€ “ a hope that still has n't been met ) .
Microsoft had only just launched Windows Phone , so there was no point in discussing that as a competitor .
And now we come to tablets .
Transcript courtesy of Seeking Alpha :
I 'd like to comment on the avalanche of tablets poised to enter the market in the coming months .
First , it appears to be just a handful of credible entrants , not exactly an avalanche .
Second , almost all of them use seven - inch screens as compared to iPad 's near 10-inch screen .
Let 's start there .
One naturally thinks that a seven - inch screen would offer 70 % of the benefits of a 10-inch screen .
Unfortunately , this is far from the truth .
The screen measurements are diagonal , so that a seven - inch screen is only 45 % as large as iPad 's 10-inch screen .
You heard me right ; just 45 % as large .
If you take an iPad and hold it upright in portrait view and draw an imaginary horizontal line halfway down the screen , the screens on the seven - inch tablets are a bit smaller than the bottom half of the iPad display .
This size is n't sufficient to create great tablet apps in our opinion .
So , how would you deal with that , Mr Jobs ?
Well , one could increase the resolution of the display to make up for some of the difference .
It is meaningless , unless your tablet also includes sandpaper , so that the user can sand down their fingers to around one quarter of the present size .
Apple 's done extensive user - testing on touch interfaces over many years , and we really understand this stuff .
There are clear limits of how close you can physically place elements on a touch screen before users can not reliably tap , flick or pinch them .
This is one of the key reasons we think the 10-inch screen size is the minimum size required to create great tablet apps .
Third , every tablet user is also a smartphone user .
No tablet can compete with the mobility of a smartphone , its ease of fitting into your pocket or purse , its unobtrusiveness when used in a crowd .
Given that all tablet users will already have a smartphone in their pockets , giving up precious display area to fit a tablet in our pockets is clearly the wrong tradeoff .
The seven - inch tablets are tweeners , too big to compete with a smartphone and too small to compete with an iPad .
Let 's note that : 7 in tablets as "" tweeners "" .
You 've got to think that if the "" iPad mini "" is that sort of size , then Apple 's executives have already been practising their responses to "" but Steve Jobs said tablets this size were tweeners ! "" for the event on Tuesday .
Oh , and back to Steve Jobs in October 2010 : Fourth , almost all of these new tablets use Android software , but even Google is telling the tablet manufacturers not to use their current release , Froyo , for tablets , and to wait for a special tablet release next year .
What does it mean when your software suppliers does not ( inaudible ) to use their software in your tablet ?
And what does it mean when you ignore them and use it anyway ?
Fifth , iPad now has over 35,000 apps on the App Store .
This new crop of tablets will have near zero .
The apps point remains true , of course , but the question now has to be : if 7 in tablets ( or even 7.85 in ones , as Apple 's expected to unveil â€ “ though do n't be too certain ) are "" tweeners "" , how will apps written for the 9.7 in iPad look on them ?
A little maths : if the smaller iPad does have a 7.85 in screen , and the same 4:3 proportions as the existing iPad , then it will have a screen area of 29.6sq in , compared to the 45.2sq in of the existing iPad â€ “ so the new one would be two - thirds the area ( alternatively , the old one is 50 % bigger ; it depends what you use as the denominator ) .
By contrast , the Google Nexus 7 has a 7 in screen ; its proportions â€ “ 16:10 â€ “ mean that the actual area of the screen is 22sq in .
The Amazon Kindle Fire , which also has a 7 in diagonal , has even stranger proportions â€ “
17:10 â€ “ which means its area is 21.4sq in .
That means that the "" iPad mini "" would , if those measurements are the same , have a screen area about a third bigger than either of those two devices ( or their screens would be 25 % smaller ; again , pick your denominator ) .
This raises a couple of questions : will that screen size make the device seem bulky in comparison ?
Its measurements will be 6.3 in by 4.7 in , compared to the Nexus 7 's 5.9 in by 3.7 in .
So barely any longer , but noticeably wider ( a whole inch ) .
Of course , there 's always the possibility that this will be a differently proportioned device .
Which would trash all those calculations .
Back to Mr Jobs : And sixth and last , our potential competitors are having a tough time coming close to iPad 's pricing , even with their far smaller , far less expensive screens .
The iPad incorporates everything we have learnt about building high value products from iPhones , iPods and Macs .
We create our own A4 chip , our own software , our own battery chemistry , our own enclosure , our own everything .
And this results in an incredible product at a great price .
The proof of this will be in the pricing of our competitor 's products which will likely offer less for more .
Price , of course , is going to be the other testing ground .
Amazon is pricing the Kindle Fire pretty much below cost , starting at Â£159 , as is Google with the Nexus 7 .
( See what we know so far here . )
Jobs 's parting shot
: These are among the reasons we think the current crop of seven - inch tablets are going to be DOA , dead on arrival .
Their manufacturers will learn the painful lesson that their tablets are too small and increase the size next year , thereby abandoning both customers and developers who jumped on the seven - inch bandwagon with an orphan product .
Sounds like lots of fun ahead .
Indeed , the other 7 in tablets pretty much foundered .
And although Amazon and Google have proven that there is a market there , it does n't look like the biggest â€ “ with Amazon reckoned to have sold 5 m in the past year , and Google about 1 m in the past quarter ( based on data in its financial results ) .
There 's a market there , but it is n't that big â€ “ so far .
Can Apple make any difference , with or without sandpaper ?"
2012-10-29,"Apple is losing two of its most high profile executives in the firm 's biggest management shakeup since co - founder Steve Jobs stepped down as chief executive .
Scott Forstall , senior vice - president of iPhone software and one of the original architects of Apple 's OS X software , will leave next year .
John Browett , poached just five months ago from Dixons to become head of retail , is also set to leave .
Apple said that four key executives — including top designer
Jony
I ve —
would "" add responsibilities to their roles .
"" The rare shakeup comes shortly after the introduction of iPhone 's latest software was marred by a mapping disaster .
Tim Cook , the chief executive , was forced to apologise for Apple Maps , meant as a rival to Google Maps , after it proved inaccurate and incomplete .
Last week the company delivered disappointing financial results as iPad sales fell short of Wall Street 's targets .
Eddy Cue , senior vice - president of internet software and services , will take charge of Maps and Apple 's Siri voice recognition responsibilities .
The retail team will report directly to Cook until a replacement for Browett can be found .
The company said I ve will provide "" leadership and direction for Human Interface across the company "" in addition to his role as the leader of industrial design .
"" We are in one of the most prolific periods of innovation and new products in Apple 's history , "" said Cook .
""
The amazing products that we 've introduced in September and October , iPhone 5 , iOS 6 , iPad mini , iPad , iMac , MacBook Pro , iPod touch , iPod nano and many of our applications , could only have been created at Apple and are the direct result of our relentless focus on tightly integrating world - class hardware , software and services .
"" Browett was appointed just five months ago and was set to receive a $ 56 m pay package over five years .
It 's not yet clear how much of that will be triggered by his early departure .
There have been reports that he clashed with other Apple executives .
Forstall has been a major influence at Apple for over a decade .
He joined the firm in 1997 and was responsible for several releases of the Mac OS X operating system , most notably Mac OS X Leopard .
The company said the management shift would "" encourage even more collaboration "" .
Trading in Apple 's shares is suspended at present with the closing of News York 's stock exchange as the city braces itself for the arrival of hurricane Sandy ."
2012-10-30,"He was a man of modest means , who lived in a normal house and only ever wore jeans and a black turtle - neck sweater .
So it comes as something of a surprise to learn that Steve Jobs spent the last six years of his life designing a bespoke superyacht , which was unveiled this week in the Dutch port of Aalsmeer .
A series of slender aluminium planes , stretching up to 80 m long and held between crisp bands of frameless glazing , it looks like a stack of the latest Apple products : an iPhone resting on an iPad , hovering above a Macbook Pro .
It has the same perfect , seamless detailing as the glass temples in which Macs are sold â€ “ and in fact the structural 3m - high windows were especially developed by the chief Applestore engineer .
Jobs ' biographer Walter Isaacson recalls seeing the designs being developed : "" As expected , the planned yacht was sleek and minimalist .
The teak decks were perfectly flat and unblemished by any accoutrements â€ ¦ the cabin windows were large panes , almost floor to ceiling , and the main living area was designed to have walls of glass that were 40 ft long and 10 ft high .
"" Reading on mobile ?
Watch here
Even when it was under construction , Jobs could n't stop fiddling with the design .
"" I know that it 's possible
I will die and leave Laurene [ his wife ] with a half - built boat , "" he said .
"" But I have to keep going on it .
If I do n't , it 's an admission that I 'm about to die .
"" The boat is the product of a collaboration with French designer Philippe Starck , primarily known for designing impractical lemon squeezers and buildings in the shape of golden turds .
He seems an unlikely ally for Jobs , whose products are designed by sub - zero minimalist Jonathan I ve , and whose headquarters are currently being developed by king of corporate , Norman Foster . ""
Steve and I shared the same idea about the elegance of the minimal , the elegance of work well done , "" Starck told the BBC .
"" It is not like a lot of mega yachts showing the vulgarity of money , "" he said .
"" It 's a boat showing the elegance of intelligence . """
2012-10-30,"John Browett , who was until Sunday night the Brit in charge of Apple 's giant retail chain , can at least afford a good seat on his flight back across the Atlantic :
the £ 36 m golden hello that he received on joining six months ago should see to that .
But for him and for Scott Forstall , who had been there – and at NeXT , the company Apple bought in 1996 to bring not just new software but also Steve Jobs – their departure looks like nothing less than a humiliation .
Tim Cook , Apple 's chief executive , is taking over the retail stores ; Jonathan I ve , the quiet Englishman who has been at the company longer than any of the other senior executives , is now in charge of hardware design and the "" human interface "" of the software .
If you like I ve 's phone , tablet and computer designs – and a lot of people seem to –
you might like what he will do to the software too .
It ca n't be worse than having Forstall 's pretend "" shredder "" or "" bookstand "" cluttering up your screen .
Forstall 's corporate death warrant was issued in September when he refused to give his signature to the abject apology over Apple 's Maps just days after the launch of its new iPhone software , according to multiple news sources .
Instead , the apology bore Cook 's name – showing that he is at least certain where the buck stops .
Forstall , it is said , had long been a source of friction within a company that tries to avoid internal politics by operating in small teams ; some reports even say that I ve would not sit in meetings with him .
Browett , meanwhile , failed to expand the stores as quickly as desired ( 30 stores in two quarters – bringing the total to 393 in 14 countries – is not enough , apparently ) .
He also tried , according to reports , to make staff drive profits , something that is anathema to the stores ' aim .
They are n't designed as a profit centre ( though they generated $ 1.1bn profit on $ 4.2bn sales in the most recent quarter ) .
They are intended to spread the Apple brand .
Apple 's financial results suggest it is falling victim to the law of large numbers : it ca n't keep growing at the same speed .
Yet the onslaught of Google 's Android mobile software and Microsoft 's PC means it ca n't afford to slow down either .
Cook seems to have brought Monday 's announcement forward to catch the markets ' close due to Superstorm Sandy .
Stock pickers have been quick to mark Apple down , though market commentator Jim Cramer remarked on Twitter that "" the negativity on [ Apple ] is so great now
that if Cook had promoted those two guys the stock would be hit , too "" .
Cook has been such a cipher that some are surprised he could act so brutally .
But he is a razor - sharp operator .
Soon after joining Apple in 1998 he was in a meeting trying to get its dreadful supply chain in shape .
""
This is really bad .
Someone should be in China driving this , "" he said .
Thirty minutes later Cook looked up at the executive in charge of that area and said : "" Why are you still here ? ""
Cook 's unrivalled skill in building a supply chain capable of shipping millions of phones and tablets worldwide within weeks of an announcement has made Apple what it is .
But it is his people skills that show what the company will become .
The firings will shock his employees but one thing Cook will not stand for is complacency .
Everyone is certain of that now ."
2012-11-06,"Five years ago , when Apple came out with the first iPhone , the device experience was far ahead of the competition , and Apple ended up completely disrupting the Telecom industry .
Back then , Steve Jobs made the famous remark that with the iPhone , Apple was five years ahead of the competition .
And now , five years later , the iPhone 5 is battling it out with increasingly strong competition .
And that smartphone battle is now about services more than it is about hardware .
Hardware as Trojan horses for better services
When you read the reviews for the recently launched devices , much of the hardware commentary focuses on the aspects that make the service experiences on the devices better .
Fast 4 G network connectivity speed is all about faster data to power service experiences .
A bigger and brighter screen allows you to see more content and do more things with the services that you use on your device .
Better batteries of course allow you to use services for longer without recharging , and faster device processors allow service designers to push the boundaries of their user experience on the device .
Almost none of the things that people care deeply about are purely about hardware any more .
The "" lightning port "" on the new iPhone is a notable exception – many people reacted negatively , and part of the reason is that it 's merely a hardware change that did n't bring new service value .
Apple 's strategic service focus
It 's well known that Apple makes virtually all its money selling devices with high margins , and clearly Apple is very good at hardware design .
But the biggest and most sustainable competitive advantage that Apple has over others is the iOS services ecosystem .
When you analyse the iPhone 5 , it 's also clear that Apple knows the crucial role of services .
There are no big breakthroughs on the hardware or user interface front .
Arguably , this is not because Apple thinks its UI and hardware is perfect , but because Apple has deemed it more important to double down on other areas of the iPhone – namely services .
Last year 's big iOS innovation was Siri .
It 's telling that Siri is the only software that the perfectionists at Apple have released in beta mode –
it speaks volumes about the strategic role and importance of the voice - activated virtual assistant service .
The iOS 6 version of Siri is faster , more responsive , and more flexible .
This is a service that Apple considers vital for its future .
With the iPhone 5 , Apple went one step further still .
They booted the wildly popular Google Maps off iOS and replaced it with their own mapping service .
With Siri , Apple had brought a slightly flaky but genuinely innovative new service to market .
But with maps , they replaced a loved and popular Google service with their own inferior solution .
The reactions have been very harsh .
How come Apple downgraded maps on their devices ?
Surely they knew it was n't better than Google Maps ?
They did it simply because control over a maps service is a necessity for them long - term .
They risk alienating loyal users in order to build their own service platform – instead of relying on others .
This shows how important services are to the future of Apple and to iOS .
The service assets of Nokia and Microsoft Microsoft has numerous powerful service assets – from cloud services and Skype to Xbox and Outlook .
But arguably , the most powerful asset they have going forward is the range of service developers that will create solutions for Windows 8 .
This will offer a massive boost to the Windows ecosystem , and will benefit Windows Phone 8 manufacturers .
After an ill - fated push into music with Ovi Music some years ago , Nokia are now re - entering the music service business with the streaming Nokia Music service .
Nokia 's acquisition of mapping platform Navteq five years ago was widely criticised for the high price tag .
However , today Nokia 's mapping platform powers four out of five in - car navigation systems globally , Nokia will power the maps in Amazon 's latest Kindle Fire devices , and Nokia Maps are regularly receiving excellent reviews when compared with other mapping solutions , including Google Maps .
Nokia Maps is clearly one of the company 's crown jewels .
The combined service assets of Microsoft and Nokia are impressive and mutually beneficial .
In comparison to both Apple and Nokia , the recent smartphone launches from Motorola and HTC feel unsatisfying .
While their hardware is certainly good enough to compete , the lack of smart service solutions leaves the devices flat when compared with the might of Apple 's ecosystem and the magic of their virtual assistant Siri , and also when compared with the photography innovation or the mapping excellence showcased by Nokia .
Services are Samsung 's Achilles heel Samsung has long been a fast follower .
But they currently sell more smartphones than anyone else , including Apple .
Their Android - based smartphones have sold in the millions , and they are currently the only smartphone manufacturer other than Apple that makes significant profits .
One of the reasons that they 're so successful is that they spend vastly more money than anybody else on marketing its smartphones .
But Android is Google 's baby , and Samsung have not traditionally been an innovator with services .
Samsung has not brought many own service experiences to their smartphones .
This lack of service expertise is likely to become a significant challenge for Samsung over the next phase of the smartphone battle .
While Samsung sells lots of devices , their customers are unlikely to be very loyal to them .
When the next shiny experience from someone else appears – and there 's a growing range – they might well try out another manufacturer 's device .
The US vs China All of the most important smartphone operating systems are now creations that originate from the west coast of the US – iOS , Android , and Windows Phone .
This is because the US tends to be better at software than other countries , and also because the creators of these operating systems – Apple , Google , and Microsoft – are all focusing on either developing or integrating with useful and desirable digital services .
If hardware would be the most important factor in the race for gadget supremacy , China would be the king of gadgets .
However , the gadgets that are capturing people 's imagination and are changing the world tend to be brilliant service and software solutions , wrapped in desirable hardware .
China has n't yet produced any brands
that in the West stand for service and software excellence .
The focus on software and services gives the U.S. a head start over China .
Services to the rescue
As PayPal 's Carey Kolaja observed , the technology "" NFC "" is often mistakenly confused with mobile wallets .
Carey 's point is that while digital wallets will become an indispensable part of consumers ' everyday lives , and one that will save them time and money , consumers do n't care which underlying technology is used to enable the wallet .
As she put it , "" the iPhone 5 does n't have NFC
– so what ? ""
It will become increasingly hard for device manufacturers to compete and differentiate on the basis of technical or hardware features alone .
Instead of being unique selling points , the technical features and hardware specs – Megapixels , Gigahertz , RAM , screen size , and network connectivity – are relegated to hygiene factors .
If you have too little , it 's too bad .
But having the most is not necessarily helping you sell more devices any more .
What people truly care about is fast and reliable access to useful , engaging and innovative services that deliver real value .
As the world 's leading companies are increasingly going mobile first , and as mobile device sales rapidly shift from feature phones to smartphones , it also impacts society .
The digital divide will start to shrink , as digital services and information is increasingly reaching everyone – not through computers , but through affordable smartphones .
It 's what 's on the inside that counts
Of course hardware still matters – especially when the device purchase decision is made .
People naturally respond to physical objects and experiences .
The weight , size , and colour of devices are clear considerations when people decide which gadget to buy .
Smartphone screens are like magnets for people 's eyes – the bigger and brighter , the stronger the magnetism .
Smartphone technology can still amaze , as evidenced by the fact that Nokia 's 808 – equipped with a monster 41Mp camera – won the "" Best of Show "" award at Mobile World Congress this year .
In the fast - emerging wearables space , taste is meeting technology .
Hardware like Nike 's FuelBand and Jawbone 's UP are smart fashion objects , and looks clearly matter .
But smartphones have become so much more than simple utilities for us .
They connect us to our loved ones , they allow us to access important information at any time , and increasingly they help guide us through all aspects of life .
They have graduated from tools to life companions .
And just like in human relationships , while appearances matter , it 's what 's on the inside that counts .
The devices that offer the best access to well - designed living services that evolve with us will win the mobile race that 's only just begun .

2012-11-16,"Aaron Sorkin , the Oscar - winning writer of Facebook movie The Social Network , has revealed that he is planning a highly unorthodox structure for the much - anticipated new film about the life of Apple founder Steve Jobs .
Sorkin told the Daily Beast he envisaged a biopic comprised of just three scenes , shot in real time .
Each snapshot of Jobs 's life would be picked from just before a vital product launch , forming a vision of the technology guru seen through the prism of his major successes .
"" This entire movie is going to be three scenes and three scenes only .
That all take place in real time , "" Sorkin said .
"" There will be no time cuts and each will take place before a product launch .
Backstage before a product launch .
The first one being the Mac , the second one being NeXT , after he had left Apple .
And the third one being the iPod . ""

It was the ' Think Different ' campaign . '
Here 's to the crazy ones . '
That 's how it began .
If I can end the movie with that text and that voiceover ... If I can earn that ending , then I will have written the movie that I wanted to write . ""
Sorkin had already revealed , after signing on to write the Jobs film in May , that he planned to dispense with the traditional cradle - to - grave structure for a biopic in favour of painting a "" heroic "" picture of the late Apple co - founder . ""
It 's a little like writing about the Beatles , "" he added .
"" There are so many people out there that know him and revere him . ""
Sorkin 's take is effectively the official Jobs biopic , since it adapts the bestselling official biography of the technology icon , Walter Isaacson 's Steve Jobs : The Exclusive Biography .
Isaacson 's book is based on more than 40 interviews with its subject conducted over two years , as well as interviews with more than 100 family members , friends , adversaries , competitors and colleagues .
Jobs died on 5 October 2011 , of cancer .
A rival indie biopic titled simply Jobs , with Ashton Kutcher cast in the lead is , however , likely to hit cinemas first .
Joshua Michael Stern 's film will reportedly chronicle the entrepreneur 's journey from "" wayward hippie "" to Apple CEO .
Production began in June and the film is set for release in 2013 ."
2012-12-03,"When I was growing up in South Africa , I often had the opportunity to see my dad , a community leader , give speeches , chair meetings and hold fundraising drives .
In more than a dozen or so elections that he ran for I only recall him losing once
and I often wondered how he did it –
what made him connect with the audience and how did he get people to buy in to his ideas ?
For the last 10 years I have been studying charisma – or ' divine gift ' as the word translates into Greek – and when asked to think of a charismatic leader , people often list Winston Churchill , Nelson Mandela , Anita Roddick , Steve Jobs , Aung San Suu Kyi , Mahatma Ghandi , Barack Obama and Margaret Thatcher .
But when asked to define what charisma is , they often shrug : "" A charismatic leader is , well , charismatic . ""
They know charisma when they see it , but working out what conditions create it is more difficult .
In some ways charisma is like a Higgs boson : it is close to undetectable in terms of measuring it precisely , but it has a powerful effect on surrounding ' social particles ' , federating them around a mission and vision .
Charisma is to a movement what the Higgs boson is to particles – they both give mass – binding individuals to a common destiny and giving them collective power .
Rooted in values For our studies , we define charisma as a symbolic leader influence ; the leader stands for something that resonates with followers .
This influence is rooted in the leader 's values , passion and arguments – what Aristotle called the ethos , pathos and logos .
We have discovered that leaders can harness charisma 's powerful effects by using verbal and non - verbal charismatic leadership tactics ( CLTs ) .
What the CLTs do is trigger a vivid vision that followers can almost see , smell and touch .
Leaders do this via storytelling or transmitting the message metaphorically .
They focus the message by contrasting their position ( the right way ) with an unsatisfactory position ( the wrong way ) ; they pose rhetorical questions to focus followers on the issues , to create interest and get them to think differently ; they provide "" proofs "" by giving examples , usually using lists of three ; they talk about their values explicitly –
what 's right ,
what wrong , what 's good and what 's bad ; and they capture , reflect and harness the sentiments of the collective , and then link these hopes , fears , and expectations to their own vision .
Charismatic leaders set high goals and communicate with confidence that they can be achieved .
And , they do all this by showing passion : in their voice , in their face and with their body .
It is not difficult to objectively measure these CLTs , nor is it hard to train individuals to use them .
In experiments , we found that those who use the CLTs a great deal are seen as more charismatic .
Managers using the CLTs are also seen as more competent , trustworthy , and are more likeable .
More than just language And charisma is not only about words , ideals and getting elected .
It can get things done and it is good for business , particularly in the long term .
In a current study , we are looking at more than 100 firms over seven years to see how a change in the chief executive affects company performance .
We are finding that chief executives who have the capacity to be charismatic and who have the capacity for self - control when it comes to using their power have the highest return on assets and are also more socially and environmentally responsible .
Many studies have shown that the ethical orientation of the leader is strongly related to follower job satisfaction and organisational commitment .
Charismatic leaders who are high on ethical orientation have better workplace environments with reduced interpersonal and workplace deviance .
This all makes sense because leaders are role models ; how they act cascades through the organisation .
Charisma can be harnessed not only for economic ends ; it can also be used to do good and make organisations places where individuals can flourish .
The more turbulent the economic situation , the more individuals want to be led by a leader who can reassure them , give them hope and point the bow in the right direction .

2012-12-04,"A Steve Jobs biopic starring Ashton Kutcher , jOBS , will be the closing night film at the 2013 Sundance film festival .
Joshua Michael Stern 's drama will span three decades of the entrepreneur 's life and is described as "" a candid , inspiring and personal portrait of the one who saw things differently "" on the Sundance website .
The festival has also released the first still from the film , which shows Kutcher in character as the Apple co - founder at work .
A 1977 Apple II computer sits in the background , near a poster that reads "" Think "" â€ “ presumably a nod to Apple 's "" Think different "" advertising campaign of the late 1990s .
jOBS is one of a clutch of high - profile releases added to the lineup announced last week .
Among the films joining it in Park City , Utah , will be Joseph Gordon - Levitt 's directorial debut , Don Jon 's Addiction â€ “ about a selfish scoundrel 's attempt to reinvent himself ;
The Look of Love , Michael Winterbottom 's take on the life of adult magazine publisher Paul Raymond ; and Before Midnight , Richard Linklater 's third date with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpry as city - hopping will - they - won't - they romancers Jesse and CÃ © line .

2012-12-05,"Ashton Kutcher as Steve Jobs
As well as the ( admittedly quite freaky ) physical resemblance , Ashton Kutcher is perhaps the most qualified actor around to play Steve Jobs .
After all , they 're both technological visionaries : Jobs being the brains behind Pixar , the Mac , the iPod , iPad and iPhone , and Kutcher being an early investor in startups such as Skype , Airbnb and Foursquare .
What 's more , Jobs was known for his obsessive perfectionism and ability to convince the public of a product 's desirability .
Having been the host of Punk'd and the star of Dude , Where 's My Car , Kutcher also ... no , I do n't know where I 'm going with this one .
Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg only shares a handful of obvious traits with Mark Zuckerberg â€ “ like age , hair colour and the last syllable of his surname â€
“
but that did n't stop him from doing a bang - up job of playing the Facebook founder in The Social Network .
Eisenberg perfectly captured Zuckerberg 's short - fuse nervous energy and jumpy intellectualism .
Perhaps it 's because they both share humble beginnings ; Zuckerberg was raised in a small upstate New York village and Eisenberg starring in Lightning :
Fire From the Sky , a terrible TV movie about lightning , which came in the form of fire from the sky .
Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker Napster 's Sean Parker was often described as a "" rock star "" , so who better to play him in The Social Network than frizzy - haired pop crooner Justin Timberlake ?
Timberlake absolutely nailed Parker in the movie , provided that the real - life Parker is a swaggering tool who lives his life like it 's the world 's worst Puff Daddy video .
He may not actually be like that , but let 's assume he is .
After all , Justin Timberlake is the star of In Time , so we ca n't really doubt his acting credentials .
Alexander Armstrong as Clive Sinclair
In 2009 , Alexander Armstrong starred in BBC4 's Micro Men , a biopic of Clive Sinclair , the inventor of the pocket calculator .
Painfully conspicuous slaphead wig aside , the casting was inspired .
Armstrong managed to channel Sinclair 's blind devotion , volcanic temper and awkwardness around women magnificently .
Perhaps he was able to access the mindset of a compulsive attention - seeker such as Sinclair so easily because of his own determination to present every single television programme that has ever been made .
Martin Freeman as Chris Curry
Meanwhile , the more mild - mannered Martin Freeman played Acorn co - founder Chris Curry in Micro Men .
Curry , in a sense , was an amalgamation of every character that Freeman has ever played .
Like John Watson , he 's a quiet pragmatist sidelined by a more charismatic partner .
Like Tim from The Office , he enjoys a flirtation with a secretary and aspires to a better future that exists just out of his reach .
And like Bilbo Baggins , his prosthetic eyebrows are incredibly off - putting .
Perfect casting , really .
Bill Gates in The Simpsons
Although Bill Gates made a fleeting appearance in The Social Network ( played by a professional lookalike ) , his greatest onscreen moment came in The Simpsons episode Das Bus .
Voiced by Hank Azaria â€ “ who plays Moe , Apu and Comic Book Guy , among others â€ “ Gates 's appearance is brief and incendiary .
He marches into the Simpson household and acquires Homer 's startup by ordering some hired goons to smash up his office .
Is this realistic ?
Would Bill Gates ever make a business decision as bad as acquiring Homer 's Compu - Global - Hyper - Mega - Net in real life ?
You only have to look at the infamous Zune to know that the answer is probably yes .
Richard Ayoade as Moss He may not be based on anyone from real life , but Moss from The IT Crowd is just about a perfect blend of any number of famous nerds .
He 's got the glasses of Steve Jobs , the uniform of Bill Gates , the slightly inept never - say - die attitude of Clive Sinclair and the vast haircut of Steve Wozniak in the 1970s , although back then Wozniak wore it as a beard ."

In his first media interviews since taking up the CEO post on the death of founder Steve Jobs , Cook said Apple was already sourcing more of its parts in the US , and would spend $ 100 m next year to move production of the unspecified computer line from China .
He also said the company was working extremely hard to improve the functionality of its maps feature .
The interviews , with Bloomberg Businessweek and NBC 's Rock Center with Brian Williams , come as Apple has seen sharp falls in its stock as investors fret about intensifying competition from rivals such as Samsung in the smartphone and tablet markets .
There are also concerns about the effects of the fiscal cliff crisis on capital gains tax , which could make shareholders liable for high payments on shares .
Cook 's comments are published on the day that a judge in California began hearing post - trial arguments from Samsung and Apple over the case in which a jury awarded Apple $ 1bn for patent and design infringements by its South Korean rival .
In his NBC interview , Cook noted that the main cost of making a PC or smartphone comes in buying chips , many of which are made in the US .
But the issue of where Apple assembles its products has been touchy for Apple : its Chinese manufacturing partner Foxconn has faced significant criticism over working conditions at its factories , and some politicians in the United States have criticised Apple for not doing more to support the US economy .
Cook told Bloomberg that Apple 's plans for Mac production in the US would include more than just final assembly of the chosen product line . ""
This does n't mean that Apple will do it ourselves , but we 'll be working with people and we 'll be investing our money , "" Cook told Bloomberg Businessweek .
He did not say where in the country the Macs would be made .
The new US - made line is likely to represent only a tiny piece of Apple 's overall production – iPhones and iPads form the largest part of Apple 's business and will continue to be made overseas .
On the maps issue , Cook defended the decision to drop Google maps in principle , suggesting Google blocked the provision of turn - by - turn navigation and voice direction .
"" We had a list of things that we thought would be a great customer experience [ on maps ] , and we could n't do it any other way than to do it ourselves , "" Cook told Bloomberg .
But he added : "" We could n't do it any other way than to do it ourselves "" – suggesting that Google blocked those services to the iPhone .
The work began some years before , not in order to cut Google out , but to provide customers with the services , Cook said .
"" And the truth is that it did n't live up to our expectations .
We screwed up . ""
But he added : "" We 're putting all our energy into putting it right
…
we 've got a huge plan to make it even better . ""
Apple was heavily criticised over some problems in the maps it provided , such as the misidentification of locations , and missing details about public transport compared to Google 's .
Cook wrote a public letter of apology and in October fired the head of iPhone software , Scott Forstall .
It also ousted John Browett , the Briton who formerly ran Dixons and had been Apple 's head of retail .
Forstall 's failure , Cook implied in the Bloomberg interview , was that he could n't bring enough collaboration to the company .
The firings were intended to "" get us to a whole new level of collaboration "" , Cook said .
That hints that Forstall , who had particularly been identified as insufficiently collegiate , had become too divisive within the company for Cook 's liking .
"" I despise politics , "" Cook said .
"" There is no room for it in a company .
My life is going to be way too short to deal with that .
No bureaucracy … no politics , no agendas .
When you do that , things become pretty simple .
"" The converse "" sucks the life out of you "" .
Instead , the task of running the stores presently falls to Cook himself , while the software line is the responsibility of Sir Jonathan I ve , who Cook said "" has the best taste of anyone in the world and the best design skills "" .
He hinted that Apple has "" some really cool ideas "" in the field of wireless – perhaps something involving phones .
Steve Jobs explicitly told him not to try to second - guess his decisions after his death .
Cook said he was told by Jobs : "" I saw what happened when Walt Disney passed away .
People kept looking around , and they asked what Walt would have done …
I never want you to ask what I would have done .
Just do what 's right . ""
Cook declined to discuss what products might be forthcoming from Apple 's stable .
But he did say that a growing amount of the parts used in Apple products are made in the US , including the processor for the iPhone and iPad – by Samsung in Texas .
He said that he wants to keep Apple in its unusual format to maximise innovation : "" Creativity and innovation are something you ca n't flowchart out .
A lot of companies have innovation departments , and this is always a sign that something is wrong when you have a BP of innovation or something .
Everybody in our company is responsible to be innovative . ""
He pointed out that 80 % of Apple 's revenues are from products – the iPhone 5 , iPad mini , and revised iPad – that "" did n't exist [ in shops ] 60 days ago .
Is there any other company that would do that ? ""
But Apple still sticks to a number of traditions – such as the "" Monday morning meeting "" which began under Jobs , which begins at 9 am and discusses "" everything in the company that 's important , every new product "" .
Asked how he feels about suing a company that is also Apple 's biggest supplier , he replied : "" I hate litigation .
I absolutely hate it .
For us , this is about values .
We tried every other avenue [ to settle ] and so we 'll see what happens in the future . ""
Cook said that being the full - time chief executive , rather than the part - time basis on which he did it when Steve Jobs was ill in 2004 , 2010 and then 2011 , is "" different "" and has been "" a bit of a surprise "" – but equally , he said he loves it .
He said that he is a private person , and that "" I do n't feel famous "" .
Cook also revealed that he gets hundreds of informal emails every day from customers with praise and criticism .
Apple , he believes , has always engendered strong emotion in its customers – whether positive or negative .
"" Customers got angry with Apple and would yell and scream – but they would keep buying , "" he said .
By contrast , they would simply switch suppliers between PC manufacturers such as Dell and Compaq ."

2012-12-27,"Tim Cook has finally made it to the top at Apple , but in his first full year as CEO his pay package shrank about 99 % .
Cook , the successor to the late Steve Jobs , was awarded total compensation of $ 4.17 m in 2012 â€ “ down from $ 378 m in 2011 , Apple said in a federal filing on Thursday .
The 2012 package for Cook , who took over as chief executive in August 2011 , is also well down on his 2010 pay , which was 14 times his 2012 deal .
In 2010 he was serving as Apple 's chief operating officer .
Jobs , the CEO and co - founder , died in October 2011 of pancreatic cancer .
The huge pay reduction is a result of Cook not receiving any stock awards for 2012 because he was handed more than $ 375 m in stock awards the year before .
Those awards will pay out over many years .
The 2012 package instead includes a salary of $ 1.4 m and a bonus of $ 2.8 m , according to the filing .
Cook 's base salary actually increased compared with the $ 900,000 he earned in 2011 .
While Apple 's shares are 35 % higher than when Cook assumed the CEO role , they have fallen more than 27 % since October , when they climbed through $ 700 .
The California - based business , which became the world 's most valuable company in the summer â€ “ when the stock market value of the business was equal to more than $ 10 m for every one of its 63,000 employees â€ “ has lost its shine as concerns have mounted that it is losing its momentum .
While Apple 's iPhone sales still outdo any other manufacturer , some 75 % of smartphones sold use Google 's Android operating system .
Analysts at Jeffries and UBS have both said in the past two weeks that Apple has substantially scaled back its orders for iPhone components , by up to 25 % , suggesting it may manufacture fewer devices than previously expected .
The company has been dogged by patent disputes and court appearances this year as it tried to ban the sale of Samsung Galaxy phones in the US â€ “ and succeeded .
However , it failed to get the Samsungs banned in the UK and was instead ordered to make an apology to the Korean company .
Apple has also taken legal action against HTC and Motorola , which , like Samsung , use Android .
The launch of its iPhone5 was dogged by a rare mis - step when Apple ditched Google Maps , replacing it with its own mapping technology , complete with numerous mistakes .
Cook was forced to issue a public apology and Scott Forstall , Apple 's iPhone software boss â€ “ and an executive viewed as a potential successor to Cook â€
“ left the company .
The Apple Maps boss also departed ."
2013-01-23,"Steve Jobs threatened to sue the rival smartphone maker Palm over poaching of Apple staff , in a bid to enforce a clandestine pact between tech companies in Silicon Valley , new documents reveal .
The late Apple co - founder menaced Palm with a patent lawsuit to try to compel adherence to a possibly illegal agreement between rival firms to not recruit each other 's employees .
The email from Jobs , along with other documents tech industry chiefs tried to keep secret , surfaced on Tuesday in a civil lawsuit brought by five tech workers against Apple and other companies including Google , Intel , Adobe , Walt Disney 's Pixar animation unit , Intuit and Lucasfilm Ltd.
The suit claims there was an illegal conspiracy to eliminate competition for each other 's employees and to reduce wages , an alleged dark side to Silicon Valley 's freewheeling , sunny public image .
Judge Lucy Koh , of the US district court in San Jose , is considering a plaintiffs ' request to turn the civil lawsuit into a class action , increasing their chances of winning damages which could run into hundreds of millions of dollars .
The August 2007 exchanges between Jobs and then - Palm chief executive Edward Colligan were the latest embarrassing revelations to enter the public record because of the case .
In a sworn statement Colligan said Jobs called him to complain that several Apple employees had moved to Palm and to propose an "" arrangement "" whereby neither would hire the other 's employees .
Jobs threatened a patent lawsuit to encourage compliance , said Colligan .
At the time Palm , which has since been bought by Hewlett - Packard Co , was developing its Palm Pre to compete with Apple 's iPhone .
Jobs was especially concerned that senior staff such as Jon Rubinstein , senior vice president of hardware development , had moved to the rival company .
Colligan rebuffed Jobs in an 24 August 2007 email : "" Your proposal that we agree that neither company will hire the other 's employees , regardless of the individual 's desires , is not only wrong , it is likely illegal . ""
He said the lawsuit threat was "" just out of line "" , would not intimidate him and would serve only to enrich lawyers .
Jobs replied two days later , a Sunday , curtly noting "" this is not satisfactory to Apple "" and reminding his rival of the "" asymmetry "" in their financial resources should the lawsuit proceed .
Last week Judge Koh ordered Apple 's chief executive officer , Tim Cook , to give a deposition , saying it was "" hard to believe "" he was not consulted about no - poaching agreements which may have violated antitrust laws .
Apple did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Wednesday .
Court filings on Tuesday revealed that such pacts were common in Silicon Valley .
In February 2006 , a year before his clash with Palm , Jobs emailed the then Google CEO Eric Schmidt : "" Eric , I am told that Google 's new cell phone software group is relentlessly recruiting in our iPod group .
If this is indeed the truth , can you put a stop to it ?
Thanks , Steve . ""
Schmidt proved receptive : "" I 'm sorry to hear this ; we have a policy of no recruiting of Apple employees .
I will investigate immediately !
Eric . ""
In a separate exchange the Google chief urged his human resources director to be discreet when seeking such agreements with rivals . ""
Schmidt responded that he preferred it be shared ' verbally , since I do n't want to create a paper trail over which we can be sued later ' . ""
Schmidt was briefed that a recruiter who tried to poach an Apple employee "" will be terminated within the hour "" .
The plaintiff 's lawyers are due to question Schmidt next month .
Google declined an interview request on Wednesday but in a statement said it has "" always actively and aggressively recruited top talent "" .
Rumours of a no - poaching agreements between top tech companies prompted a US justice department probe in 2010 , leading to a promise by Google , Apple , Adobe and others to refrain from such pacts .
Authorities believe the practice continues in parts of the industry .
The justice department and antitrust regulators sued eBay last year over an alleged no - poaching deal with the software firm Intuit ."
2013-01-25,""" How can someone know what they want if they 've never even seen it ? "" booms Ashton Kutcher , channelling the spirit of Steve Jobs in the new biopic of the late Apple founder and chief executive .
This may be the cri de coeur of the frustrated inventor , but history tells us that Jobs did things somewhat differently : Apple , after all , were geniuses at coming up with things people did n't know they wanted in the first place .
Be that as it may , Jobs â€ “ or jOBS as its marketing people would have it
â€ “ is due to receive its world premiere tonight at the Sundance film festival , and to draw attention to it they 've released this short clip .
It features Kutcher , as Jobs , and Josh Gad as Steve Wozniak , Jobs ' hairy co - founder of Apple Computer , arguing about the possibililties of Wozniak 's recently developed operating system in what is presumably supposed to be the car - park of Hewlett Packard , where they both worked in the summer of 1970 .
As to whether or not Jobs will turn out to be a good movie , we 'll have to wait till the reviews come in ; but this clip already has at least one famous detractor : Wozniak himself , who posted a cutting response on the Gizmodo website .
Saying the scene was "" not close â€ ¦ we never had such interaction "" , Wozniak went on to say : "" Personalities are very wrong although mine is closer . ""
He also suggested that , at that time , Jobs was the one learning from Wozniak about the likely future impact of computing .
Jobs is due to be released in the US on 19 April ."
2013-01-25,"A little sympathy for Tim Cook , chief executive of Apple , is in order .
Following Steve Jobs was never going to be easy , but he has hardly been helped by the hype and expectation piled on the company .
Yes , Apple exploits the mood merrily when it has a new gizmo to flog .
But Wall Street as showbiz on steroids can be an absurd spectacle .
At Apple , the machine has been in ridiculous overdrive for the past year .
The first sign was analysts ' competition to be the first to predict a $ 1,000 share price .
Brian White of Topeka Capital Markets in the US was the winner , garnering publicity by declaring "" Apple fever is spreading like a wildfire around the world "" .
Others piled in .
Given the size of the company and its weight in various indices , not owning the shares suddenly became a career risk for the average US fund manager .
Who would want to be the fool who stood alone against the iPhone 5 ?
At $ 700 the stock was clearly priced for perfection .
After a small slip – a wonky mapping app – the machine went into reverse .
With whizzy technology stocks there is no neutral gear
–they are either on their way to the moon , or they are ex - growth companies that have run out of ideas .
So this week 's numbers were greeted as evidence of the latter – a confirmation Apple has peaked .
And it is true that quarterly profits were flat year on year at $ 13.1bn ( £ 8bn ) and that the annual outcome could be the first decline for a decade .
Higher manufacturing costs are a fact of life and Samsung , which has put in a dent in Apple 's profit margins , is a formidable competitor .
The shares fell another 12 % to $ 450 .
But take a step back .
After the ride on Wall Street 's rollercoaster , Apple 's shares stand almost exactly where they did a year ago .
For a company in transition , that is hardly humiliation .
The ex - growth label may sting but it is the rate of decline that matters .
Middle age comes to everybody and handing out the winnings ( Apple has $ 137bn in cash ) in the form of dividends or buy - backs would be no disgrace .
But can anybody really be confident Apple is ex - growth and the 48 m iPhones sold in the past quarter represent a last hurrah ?
It is far too early to judge .
The big event is the next product – it always is .
Is it television ?
That has been the buzz for the past year but nothing has appeared .
But is that because the in - house tech geniuses have come up short , or because the chief executive knows better than to talk casually ?
Nobody knows .
But give the guy a break .
It is fair to beat up Cook for failing to spot , until now , potential child - labour abuses in the supply chain .
But it is too soon to conclude that Apple 's innovation pipeline is broken , or that the firm has lost its appetite for taking development risks .
That verdict will have to wait a year or two .
In Wall Street terms , that 's an eternity .
But Cook would be foolish to try to run Apple to Wall Street 's timetable .
EU conundrum Does a possible referendum on membership of the EU represent a terrible threat to inward investment in the UK ?
Does half a decade in limbo await ?
No and no .
OK , an attempted assassination of Ukip is not an uplifting way to launch the EU debate .
But the notion that the "" uncertainty "" over membership is a game - changer for inward investment in the UK is n't persuasive .
First , there is uncertainty wherever you look on the European battleground .
Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank has dampened the flames of the eurozone crisis but only an extreme optimist would say he has extinguished them .
The eurozone is travelling from monetary union to fiscal union .
"" Ever - closer union "" means what it says .
Any non - European investor will look at that journey and wonder if , when , at what cost , it will be completed .
Will Germany really choose to lock itself into a federalised budget union with Italy , Spain , Portugal and Greece ?
If it does n't , the economics of a shiny new German car factory , say , are very different .
Second , what if the UK did leave the EU ?
It remains a remote possibility but the terms of the divorce would be critical .
Punitive two - way tariffs seem far - fetched since Germany has a trade surplus with Britain .
Free - ish trade with Europe seems the way to bet , whatever happens .
Third , David Cameron 's gamble might succeed .
From the point of view of business , a reformed EU and a better - functioning single market , with the UK and Germany as closer allies , would be a useful gain .
Yes , the prime minister 's political calculation could backfire .
But Angela Merkel 's polite reception to the speech was the important development .
In any risk / reward assessment , the chance of helpful reforms to the single market have to be included .
The real threat to inward investment in the UK is simple .
Foreign investors are attracted by growth .
At the moment , they will see a flat - on - its - back economy and a government short of ideas .
A possible referendum , to be held after several more chapters of the unpredictable eurozone crisis , will seem like a sideshow .
Tax transparency Well done , Justin King at Sainsbury 's and Dalton Philips at Morrisons .
They seem to be the FTSE 100 chief executives most keen to embrace the idea of companies giving a country - by - country account of where they pay tax .
The rest of the bunch , to judge by the letters made public by Conservative MP Stephen McPartland , hate this definition of tax transparency .
Ian Livingston at BT does not like the administrative cost , and Rupert Soames at Aggreko thinks giving country - by - country detail is "" unworkable "" for his company .
At least the prime minister , campaigning against corporate tax avoidance , now knows what he is up against when he raises his plan at the G8 .
But surely he could start at home .
There 's nothing to the stop the UK from obliging companies operating here – say , those with a turnover of £ 500m - plus – to publish their UK tax details .
The purpose ?
It 's the pragmatic argument made by King : ""
Rather than developing a new international accountancy standard , which will take a long time , I strongly believe that consumers are best placed to encourage companies to pay a fair amount of tax in the UK . ""
That modest idea hardly seems likely to cause a dangerous outbreak of anti - business sentiment .
There would be winners and losers – but that is the point .
All change at WH Smith
If "" resilient dynamism "" , the bizarre motto of this year 's Davos gathering , means anything its quality is probably best demonstrated by Kate Swann , a chief executive unlikely to be found clinking glasses at the Swiss jamboree .
At WH Smith , which she will leave in June , Swann has played a bad hand brilliantly .
The high street shops , as opposed to the ones on railway stations and in airports , have reported like - for - like sales declines every year during her nine - year tenure .
A relentless focus on costs has saved the day and kept profits rolling .
Good luck to her successor , Steve Clarke , he will need it .
Squeezing more juice out of WH Smith looks a very tall order .
Swann , one suspects , may have timed her exit perfectly .
She would n't be the first in retail - land ."
2013-01-26,"The Apple co - founder Steve Wozniak has issued a stinging criticism of the new biopic of his fellow computing pioneer , the late Steve Jobs , after a clip from the film was released on the internet before its premiere at the Sundance film festival .
The clip shows actors Ashton Kutcher ( as Jobs ) and Josh Gad ( as Wozniak ) discussing the merits of the computer operating system Wozniak has just developed .
Jobs is seen trying to inspire a sceptical Wozniak as to the potential future impact of home computers , before the Wozniak character shouts : "" Nobody wants to buy a computer .
Nobody ! ""
However , Wozniak , 62 , in a series of messages posted on the Gizmodo website where the clip first played , said the portrayal was "" not close "" .
"" We never had such interaction , "" he wrote .
Denying the accuracy of the scene he also stated : "" I 'm not even sure what it 's getting at ...
personalities are very wrong . ""
Wozniak , who is known in the tech community as "" Woz "" , also implied that far from Jobs being the inspirational leader , at that time it was far more probable that Jobs was learning from Wozniak about the possibilities of personal computing .
His idea was to make a $ 20 PC board and sell it for $ 40 to help people at the club build the computer I 'd given away .
He always saw a way to make a quick buck off my designs . ""
Wozniak continued : "" I never looked like a professional .
We were both kids .
Our relationship was so different than what was portrayed .
I 'm embarrassed but if the movie is fun and entertaining , all the better .
Anyone who reads my book iWoz can get a clearer picture . ""

2013-01-28,"Christian Bale is rumoured to have lived on coffee and one apple a day to achieve his emaciated physique in The Machinist .
But not everyone is suited to unorthodox diets , as Ashton Kutcher discovered after adopting the late Steve Jobs 's fruitarian regimen in preparation for a new biopic of the technology magnate .
Speaking at the premiere of Jobs at the Sundance film festival on Friday night , Kutcher revealed that he went to hospital with pancreas problems after following a strict diet of fruit , nuts and seeds .
Jobs , who was often reported to be a fruitarian , died of pancreatic cancer in October last year . ""
First of all , the fruitarian diet can lead to , like , severe issues , "" Kutcher told USA Today .
"" I went to the hospital like two days before we started shooting the movie .
I was like doubled over in pain .
My pancreas levels were completely out of whack .
It was really terrifying â€ ¦ considering everything . ""
Kutcher also revealed that he spent hundreds of hours studying tapes of Jobs in an effort to accurately replicate his hunched walk and mannerisms .
The actor said that he felt close to the Apple founder as they shared a fascination for "" tech space "" .
He also revealed an admiration for his subject 's ability to bounce back after periods of struggle . ""
He 's a guy that failed and got back on the horse , "" said Kutcher .
"" I think we can all sort of relate to that in some place in our life where we are moving forward with something
and we fall down .
You have to have the guts to get back up and go again .
I think I share that as well . ""
Jobs , which covers the period from Apple 's founding in a garage in Palo Alto , California to the launch of the iPod in 2001 , has so far received a lukewarm response from critics .
Variety 's Justin Chang said Joshua Michael Stern 's film "" more or less embodies the sort of bland , go - with - the - flow creative thinking Jobs himself would have scorned "" , while CNET 's Casey Newton was unimpressed by a movie in which "" the viewer spends two hours watching cardboard cutouts lose arguments to Ashton Kutcher "" .
Indiewire 's Eric Kohn , however , praised "" Kutcher 's committed performance , certainly his most impressive turn in years , which conveys the character 's focused , manipulative intentions in each calculated look "" .
Aaron Sorkin , the Oscar - winning writer of The Social Network , is planning a separate biopic based on Walter Isaacson 's bestselling official biography of Jobs .
Sorkin 's version will reportedly comprise just three extended scenes , each capturing a point just before a vital product launch in order to portray Jobs and his biggest successes ."
2013-01-28,"Barely a year has passed since Steve Jobs died , aged 56 , yet here we have the first of two biopics , completed in the nick of time , to close this year 's Sundance film festival .
Director Joshua Michael Stern , working with first - time feature screenwriter Matt Whiteley , has his work cut out for him , given that it 's an Aaron Sorkin - scripted flick that 's to follow .
No doubt wary of the fact , Stern opts to focus on arguably the most pivotal period in Jobs 's life , from the time he dropped out of college and created Apple computers in his parents ' garage , to the moment where the iPhone is poised to be unleashed on an unsuspecting world .
Casting a figure of such immense social and cultural import was never going to be easy .
Kudos , then , to Ashton Kutcher who , while hardly topping film - makers 's wish lists , delivers a surprisingly effective turn as the man , down to his awkwardly hunched posture .
Bearing more than a passing resemblance to Jobs , Kutcher even emulates his voice , to some degree .
The problem with Stern 's film is n't his leading man , then , as many would have expected , but rather everything around him .
For a man whose singular vision alienated many – a point illustrated by Kutcher 's straight - talking , temper - riddled reading of Jobs – those closest to him are barely given time to voice their concerns , let along develop as characters .
Jobs 's Apple co - founder , self - taught software whizz Steve "" Woz "" Wozniak ( Josh Gad ) , already a vocal critic of the film , is presented as a mere backdrop .
We learn little about Woz : where he came from , how he met Jobs , or what happened after he quit Apple , dissatisfied with the direction in which the company was heading .
Equally , the supporting players , including ex - Intel engineer Mike Markkula ( Dermot Mulroney ) and one - time Apple CEO John Sculley ( Matthew Modine ) , are there to be sounding boards for Jobs 's tirades , nothing more .
Jobs 's personal life is also frustratingly limited to a handful of bite - size sequences , without exploring , for instance , his shifting perspective on parenthood .
We see his early , cruel dismissal of pregnant girlfriend Chris - Ann Brennan ( Ahna O'Reilly ) and their unborn daughter , Lisa , only to be later presented with Jobs the settled father and gardener , while in exile from Apple , following his ousting by the board in 1985 .
Still , the essence of Jobs the creator , the insanely driven cultural game - changer , is intact , in line with his public and professional persona .
A gushing score ( from John Debney ) accompanies various rounds of corporate applause that greet his successes ( punctuated with a knowing , told - you - so smile from Kutcher ) .
Stern 's direction is solid , occasionally dynamic , while rarely straying from the Apple brief .
Narratively speaking , there 's a generally informative and engaging professional arc , from Jobs 's early days at Hewlett - Packard , via Atari and Apple , then Next , then back to Apple again ( although substantial chunks , including his pioneering of Pixar , are glaring in their omissions ) .
The early years , from Reed College and barefoot LSD trips to India , preface this , shot with a golden hue to stir nostalgia .
The results , then , are mixed .
This is far from the bomb some would have envisaged , but neither is it the character illumination one would wish for .
Jobs appears so consumed by his work here that little else mattered in his life .
That may be true , but we 're left none the wiser as to what made the man tick , beyond what we already know .
Apple will no doubt feel satisfied , even relieved .
Those wanting a sharper , more incisive view will have to wait for Sorkin ."
2013-02-12,"Anyone disappointed by the authenticity of the Steve Jobs biopic really ought to take a look at this rather brilliantly conceived study of a ( fictional ) computer v computer chess tournament in the early 80s .
( We know it 's before 1984 , as the tournament host claims he 's put a bet on that it will take until then for a computer to beat a human at the game . )
Written and directed by mumblecore maestro Andrew Bujalski ( Funny Ha Ha , Mutual Appreciation ) , this is about as perfect a rendering of the era as you could ask for – to the extent you would genuinely not be surprised should this turn out to have been footage dug up from some time capsule buried in 1981 .
Shot on a very old - school Sony video camera , the fuzzy , distorted black - and - white visuals lend an entirely apposite air of grainy authenticity to the ragged assembly of tech nerds and programming obsessives that are the film 's main focus .
And I have to say the acting is uniformly superb : every twitch , every stumble , every stutter is deployed with absolute plausibility .
Where Bujalski 's earlier films concentrated on capturing the rhythms and cadences of everyday awkwardness in contemporary settings , here , he 's gone one better and pulled it off for a time well in the past .
There is also a story , of sorts , happening .
This gathering is a long way from the glamour and showbiz of the modern product launch : here we have a score or so of sweaty geeks in horrible 80s shirts corralled into a budget hotel : a single weekend will see them joust their chess programmes against each other .
Checkers takes on Tsar 3.0 , etc .
Personalities emerge from the mass : bitter , frustrated Beuscher ( Wiley Wiggins from Dazed and Confused ) , brash , besuited Papageorge ( Myles Paige ) , shy - but - smart Bishton ( Patrick Riester ) .
Though there 's certainly satiric intent here , there 's also a wide - eyed appreciation for just what humble , shabby beginnings the digital revolution sprang from .
Computer Chess certainly has its longueurs : there are a few too many scenes in which the programmers discuss the future potential of artificial intelligence , and Bujalski 's meandering , apparently - structureless narrative method – where scenes rarely lead into each other – does n't exactly help the forward momentum .
But some great running gags – continual double - booking with a let - it - all - hang - out encounter group ; constant acknowledgement of the only "" lady "" at the convention ; Papageorge 's failure to find a bed for the night – mean that a giggle is never far away .
Bujalski really has pulled off something extraordinary here : it wo n't be to everyone 's taste , for sure – this is no War Games - style pop comedy .
But as an act of cultural archaeology I can think of few better ."

Can it really survive without Steve Jobs ?
Where 's the vision now ?
You can see fear starting to peep through in all sorts of ways .
Strategically , Apple now seems to be focused on small changes to big products , and that has its followers rightly worried .
After all , a smaller iPad might be popular , but it is not world - changing .
Rumours abound of a cut - price plastic iPhone aimed at the Chinese market : a canny business , if it works , but not in keeping with the company 's traditionally high - end approach .
Some of the faithful are shaken .
The result ?
The stock price is down nearly 40 % from last summer , and some shareholders are revolting .
Reading too much into the wisdom of flighty investors is foolish , of course .
But the rumblings reflect some real concerns about Apple 's long - term prospects .
Staying on top for ever is hard , and there 's a definite feeling that its time in the sun might just be coming to an end .

Surely you have not lost faith that Apple 's secret weapon â€
“
Sir "" Jony ""
I ve ,
our very own James Bond of design â€ “ ca n't come up with a few more gadgets that even Q would be proud of ?
Keep the faith , Bobbie !
But I digress .
To answer some of your points : whispering campaign ?
Ah yes , this would be the usual trotted - out argument that because we have n't yet seen an Apple - branded hoverboard appear the company must be out of ideas .
That would be to misunderstand Apple 's entire product strategy .
Apple does n't really need to invent anything , merely to take an idea and make the very best product associated with it .
Apple did n't invent the PC , yet made the Macintosh , the computer that even many PC users grudgingly preferred .
It did n't invent the smartphone , yet it took the idea and created a revolutionary touch device that eventually cowed the once mighty Nokia .
If all the reports are correct it will do the same to television , and , it 's rumoured , to the next wave of wearable devices such as the Fitbit and Nike+ Fuelband , with its own iWatch .
Whenever Apple launches a product , it goes for broke , then rolls out subsequent iterations until that product is almost perfect , and usually the best in that market category , almost to the point where we are fooled into thinking Apple invented the thing .
Granted it 's going to be hard to improve on the lightweight iPhone 5 other than with a better camera and flash , but you can be sure that deep in Apple 's labs they will be thinking about the eco - system of products â€ “ perhaps even home automation and devices for cars
â€ “ to build around it .
As for China â€ “ Google is , by its own choice , locked out , and the Chinese are so hot for the iPhone they are even making clones of them .
A cheaper iPhone wo n't damage the brand in these emerging markets , but simply provide a revenue home run for Apple 's bank balance .
It could n't care less about its stock price .
BJ :
It 's all a question of context .
Apple 's problem is more about its failure to live up to the insane expectations of the public than its bottom line .
But that image is its trump card , and if it 's lost , can it be regained ?
I 'm not saying the company will collapse and disappear .
But will it manage to drive the next wave , and the next wave , and the next wave ?
The warning signs are already there .
Take a product such as Glass , the head - mounted computer that Google says will change our lives .
You can see Apple already seems a step behind .
Yes , Glass and all its cyborgian , privacy - invading connotations is terrifying â€ ” but in many ways , it 's precisely the sort of product ( and chutzpah ) that you might expect from Apple .
Instead , what secret project is the sainted Jony I ve said to be working on ?
A watch .
It 's not cynicism to wonder where the leadership at the top will take it .
It 's realism .
Tim Cook , the man who took over when Steve Jobs died , is an excellent manager , but he lacks the force and , frankly , the arrogance that made his predecessor so successful .
Cook has spent his time in charge dealing with internal politics
â€ “ firing his rivals or making bad hiring decisions â€ “ and facing up to external threats such as Samsung and Google , which are desperate to kill it off .
Jobs was prepared to do anything to win , and he ran the place with the hand of a dictator
: it 's hard to imagine Cook shutting down an entire profitable product line because he wants to step on his rivals with that Next Big Thing .
PS â€ “
did you not see Skyfall ?
Q 's gadgets ai n't what they used to be .
MB Thinking that Apple must follow Google , and Google must follow Apple ( as it clearly did with the Android smartphone operating system ) is perhaps a misreading of where the companies see themselves in the future .
Google 's business model is to organise the world 's information so that it can sell ads against all that content .
Perhaps even to ultimately predict what we want before we know we want it .
Android is merely a Trojan horse for this business model , to harvest gargantuan amounts of information about the world and maintain its lead as the world 's biggest ad platform .
Apple 's , by contrast , is to marry software services ( such as iTunes music and apps ) and hardware in such perfect synchronicity that we simply must buy the devices themselves .
Yes , Steve Jobs is not there , but do we not think that in the months prior to his death he did not pass on his vision for the company and the future of technology ?
There 's no doubt that , like the frozen head in Dennis Potter 's Cold Lazarus play , Steve Jobs 's vision lives on .
His DNA runs through Apple perhaps more than any other company in the world before or since .
PS â€ “ pah !
In Skyfall Q has clearly been taking tips from Jony â€
“ keep the user interface of the gun as simple as possible !
BB :
All great companies have their time .
General Motors was the pride of 1920s America , but by 2009 faced the ignominy of bankruptcy .
IBM , the biggest company in the world in the 1950s , is a very different beast today .
Further back , even giants such as the Dutch East India company , which changed the world profoundly , burnt out in the end .
We do n't know what the next rabbit Apple could pull out of the hat might be , and clearly it 's using its corporate dominance to reinforce itself and lock out its rivals .
But the questions it faces today â€ “ and the world it finds itself in â€ “ are new to it .
It 's enjoyed a great ride , and it may continue for a long time yet .
However , if there 's one thing it should have learned from Steve Jobs , it 's that nobody can last forever .
MB :
I think we have a better sense of where technology is going , compared to the days when IBM still made calculators .
We know now , for instance , that a world populated by an "" internet of things "" will be a reality in the next five to 10 years .
We know that computing power may one day reside on the bands of a string of DNA .
Apple will know this , and its raison d'Ãªtre is to bring products to market that realise that future in a tangible way .
Sure , not all companies survive .
But few companies are as rich as Apple , or have so much market dominance or such an enduringly enthused fan base .
Tim Cook may not be Steve Jobs but the ousting of the head of its Maps after that particular debacle shows Cook has the will to keep Apple on course .
Combined with I ve , Apple has the talent it needs ."
2013-03-27,"A "" doe - eyed "" young Steve Jobs makes his debut as a manga hero in a new biography out in Japan in this week .
The first instalment of award - winning author Mari Yamazaki 's manga biography of Jobs â€ “ based on Walter Isaacson 's bestselling life of the late Apple chief executive â€ “ hit newsstands in Japan this week in the April issue of the young women 's comic anthology Kiss .
It starts with Jobs as an adult , asking Isaacson to tell his story .
Here , Jobs is drawn fairly realistically , sporting his habitual black poloneck , in what Tokyo - based reviewer Sam Byford , in a positive write - up in The Verge , called "" a semi - realistic monochrome style that is never off - putting , but stays true to the Japanese manga tradition "" . "" '
So Walter ' . '
Yes ? '
While we were walking , he made me an unexpected offer . '
Would you write my biography ? ' '
Your biography ? ? ' '
That 's right ' , "" writes Yamazaki , in an extract shown online . "" '
So this is the reason why I came to Colorado to meet your wife and kids ' . '
Yep ' .
' I think I would make an interesting subject ' . ""
Later , though , Jobs becomes a more classic manga hero , "" rendered as a cute , doe - eyed kid who worries about whether his adoptive parents love him "" , writes Byford , and "" once Jobs is of college age , Yamazaki swiftly transforms him into the type of character any teenage reader could fall in love with "" .
Byford points out that the instalment is appearing in Kiss magazine , alongside "" regular tales of high - school love and drama , and that 's the lens through which readers will view it "" .
It ends as Jobs meets Steve Wozniak , the man with whom he would go on to found Apple , with further chapters to follow .
Yamazaki is best known for the bestselling manga Thermae Romae .
Isaacson 's authorised biography of Jobs was published in 2011 , less than three weeks after Jobs 's death , and became an instant bestseller , shifting more than 37,000 copies in its first five days on sale and garnering positive reviews .
It 's "" studded with moments that make you go ' wow ' , "" wrote Sam Leith in the Guardian ."
2013-04-02,"Apple 's next two iPhones had already been designed before Steve Jobs died in October 2011 , according to comments apparently made by a liaison officer for the company last week .
At a meeting with the San Francisco district attorney , George GascÃ³n , who is keen to cut phone thefts in the region , Apple 's liaison officer Michael Foulkes is reported by the San Francisco Examiner to have said the designs for the next two phones "" preceded Tim Cook [ being chief executive ] "" .
That would mean that both one phone due to be launched this year , as well as the iPhone 5 , were already planned before Steve Jobs , Apple 's co - founder , died in October 2011 , just a day after the iPhone 4S was unveiled .
A passage in Jobs 's biography includes him testing out the Siri voice - control function that was introduced in the iPhone that October .
But while some â€ “ including GascÃ³n â€ “ might be surprised by the idea of a company having a two - year pipeline for the design of a phone , others who have worked in the mobile phone industry
emphasised that it is not unusual .
Horace Dediu , who runs the Asymco consultancy and previously worked at Finnish phone maker Nokia , said it was not surprising . ""
Having worked in a phone company , I think it 's a given [ that the phones were designed that far back ] .
Work under way now is for products shipping in 2016 . ""
Other evidence of the long design pipeline for phones comes from BlackBerry , where the new Z10 and Q10 touchscreen phones have been in progress for more than two years , with delays to the BB10 software having held up their introduction by at least a year .
Dediu added : "" Software alone does not a phone make .
Hardware specifications are [ determined ] on a different time scale . ""
The news disappointed GascÃ³n , who had hoped that at his urging Apple and other phone makers would be able to co - operate on devising a common system for disabling stolen phones and tablets .
By publicising it , all companies would be able to cut thefts , he hoped .
But Foulkes apparently told him that researching and incorporating such systems would be "" long and laborious "" .
In the UK , carriers already co - operate in using a common system to prevent stolen phones from rejoining the network , by identifying the IMEI ( International Mobile Equipment Identity ) number , which is unique to each phone .
But it is not implemented internationally , so that phones stolen in one country can be re - activated in another .
Apple 's work on the first iPhone apparently began in 2005 , after it diverted work begun in 2003 from attempts to build a tablet device , which later became the iPad .
Pictures of the early prototypes from 2005 show a large device , more like a tablet than a phone . ""
Apple does not comment on rumours and speculation , "" a spokesperson said ."
2013-04-23,"The breathtaking expansion of the world 's most successful technology company has skidded to a halt .
Tonight Apple is expected to post its worst financial results for a decade , with profits falling for the first time since 2003 , and revenues flat on last year .
It 's less than two years since Tim Cook took over from Steve Jobs , but Apple 's creative juices appear to have dried up .
For two decades the soft - spoken Alabaman has been very much part of the firm 's success , but Wall Street is now rife with ( albeit not very credible ) rumours that the search for his replacement has begun .
Cook 's tenure has had its positives : appalling working conditions at Apple 's Chinese factories have been tackled and a readiness to apologise for mistakes has helped the company appear less arrogant .
But the things that made Apple great â€ “ the innovation , the ability to make software and hardware that "" just work "" , and the faultless industrial design that created some of the best - looking consumer electronics ever made â€ “ appear to be slipping away .
Here are five key ways Apple 's lost its bite : 1 .
Never making a television or getting Apple TV right
Having turned the music and telecoms industries on their heads , Apple was understood to have trained its sights on cable TV companies .
But the move has been talked about since 2011 and yet there is still no sign of an Apple television set â€ “ or iPanel as some predict it will be called .
Television is crying out for change .
Cable and satellite companies still force their customers to buy lots of channels they do n't want before giving them access to the best content .
But Apple must work harder than it did shaking up a bloated and complacent music industry .
Its phones are sold with a subscription and made affordable by a hefty subsidy from the network .
An expensive TV set would need similar support from cable companies , which control the internet pipes , but giving Apple a leg up would potentially destroy their business models
â€ “ they do n't want their customers shopping at iTunes .
And Cook 's not found a way to crack this .
2 .
iCloud being beset by syncing issues and instability Apple would like us to stash our box sets and photo albums in the attic and transform our music , video and even book collections into digital files stored on its solar - powered server farms , so they are accessible from any location on any device â€ “ so long as it 's one made by Apple .
But there are problems with the iCloud storage vault .
It is more expensive than those run by rivals such as Google , and it does n't work as well as it should .
Audiobooks bought from iTunes , for example , can not be re - downloaded from the store if accidentally erased from a phone or tablet .
Now application developers are queuing up to complain that they can not integrate iCloud into their own software .
3 .
Apple Maps being pretty rubbish , and not optional Mapplegate , as Apple 's badly designed mapping application fiasco is sometimes called , is arguably Cook 's most damaging mistake to date .
The app was not a minor software release , it was a key part of the chief executive 's strategy of making Apple less dependent on Google .
And it was given a very high - profile plug at the launch of the iPhone 5 , with executives claiming crack design and superior "" cartography "" .
The faults were so glaring â€ “ a Dublin park listed as an airport , a Norwegian city relocated to the sea â€ “ that one wonders how well the chief executive studied his own product before approving its release .
4 .
Hiring a retail chief who did n't realise Apple stores are showrooms
The Dixons boss was Cook 's one major recruit since taking office .
John Browett was brought in to oversee the Apple stores , and soon set about reducing the staffing costs by cutting hours and freezing recruitment .
The move was quickly reversed after causing outrage .
Apple 's minimalist steel - and - glass retail temples are essentially advertisements for its products , with customer service playing a crucial role in recruiting new disciples .
Presumably Browett ran his plans past Cook before implementing them , if not during his job interview .
No matter .
Seven months after joining , Browett was shown the door .
5 .
The iPhone 5 only really having a slightly bigger screen It may be one of the fastest phones in the world , loading video and spinning through web pages at record speeds , but reviewers complain that the screen is too small and the black aluminium cases scratch too easily .
The iPhone 5 outsold all other smartphones before Christmas , but there are signs that demand is tailing off more rapidly than for its predecessor , the 4S. Others have caught up too , with Nokia and Samsung making cheaper machines that work just as well ."
2013-04-25,"In a week when Apple reported a rare profits drop , we meet two former Apple high - flyers to get a glimpse into this most enigmatic of tech companies .

2013-04-29,"No one at the Government Digital Service wears a suit .
You wo n't find any briefcases either â€ “ in fact , you will struggle to find anyone wearing a tie .
This tech - savvy group of men and women may be an integral part of the Cabinet Office , but they could n't be further from the outdated stereotype of the pinstriped civil servant .
This is the place where you will find a 17-year - old code developer who left full - time education to work on the government 's new website providing a clear , simpler way of accessing public services â€ “ and saving the taxpayer money .
The Government Digital Service is at the vanguard of a transformation that is changing the civil service into a fast , agile and digital organisation .
What you see in their small office in Holborn is what we want to be the norm for government across the country : vibrant , modern workplaces full of highly skilled people , focused on getting things done .
We know many of the best innovators and risk - takers did n't go to university .
Microsoft and Apple would not be the organisations they are today if it were n't for Bill Gates and Steve Jobs , neither of whom completed their degree .
That 's why our new civil service apprenticeship scheme , which is now open for applications , seeks to recruit precisely these kinds of people .
It 's part of our civil service reform plan , which puts civil servants , their skills and abilities , and their career development at the heart of our efforts to create an exceptional organisation .
Like all employers , we 've had to make difficult choices .
Pay restraint has helped to protect jobs in the public sector and support high - quality public services ; meanwhile , changes to pensions will ensure they can be sustained for future generations .
We are also reviewing terms and conditions to adopt best practices from the private and public sectors , creating an employment package that a good , modern employer would offer and tackling those terms that could leave the civil service open to criticism .
That means some of the perks will go â€ “ but a career in the civil service will remain among the most rewarding available .
We can take enormous pride in the quality of our civil servants , but nothing stands still .
The civil servant of the future will face challenges equal to or greater than those of their forebears as they help Britain compete and win in the global race .
Our reform plan will equip them for this job .
Practical tools , such as flexible and cost - effective IT systems and modern workplaces , are by themselves not enough without the right skills .
Last week we published the capabilities plan which identifies what skills are in deficit and considers how the gaps will be filled .
It will work in tandem with our new competency framework that recognises that commercial , digital and project management skills are no longer the preserve of a few specialists , but a priority for everyone .
It is the first to apply to all 420,000 civil servants , so whether they inspect livestock for Defra in the Pennines , support our service personnel in Afghanistan , or help people into work in Bristol , every civil servant will be measured against common standards .
The civil servant of the future will be accountable for his or her performance .
We want to strip out the bureaucracy , slim down the hierarchies and free civil servants to get on and do their job .
For the first time in 20 years there will be a common approach to performance management .
Where civil servants excel , they must be recognised for their achievements .
If they under - perform , then they should receive targeted training and support and will be expected to improve .
Continuous improvement is a thread that will run from recruitment to retirement .
The civil servant of the future will never stop learning and will be afforded the best training and support available from both the public and private sectors .
An inter - change programme will break down barriers with the private and wider public sector as well as civil society .
When the civil servant of the future looks for promotion , we must ensure he or she has the broadest experience possible .
Those moving into the senior roles will be expected to have worked in more than one department and in more than one type of role .
All permanent secretaries in the delivery departments will need at least two years ' experience in a commercial or operational role .
The world will be a different place when the civil servant of tomorrow reaches his or her prime , but our reform plan is laying the groundwork now to help Britain flourish .
If we are successful , then the 17-year - old code developer of today , as much as the new graduate fast - streamer , will embody the civil servant of the future : highly skilled , fluent in both public sector and private sector practices , and trained and supported to deliver an exceptional service for Britain .

2013-05-03,"There 's a new kind of civil servant in town , according to the head of the civil service , Sir Bob Kerslake , and the Cabinet Office minister , Francis Maude .
Kerslake and Maude want to rebuild the civil service - and where better to start than with a whole new set of young civil servants ?
The civil service apprenticeship scheme is now open for applications until noon on Friday 10 May 2013 and seeks to recruit innovative , risk - taking and tech - savvy new talent in the mould of US entrepreneurs Steve Jobs and Bill Gates , neither of whom had a degree to their name .
Recruiting the leaders of the future is an exciting prospect .
Jobs showed that an individual could change the direction of the market , says Jill Rutter , Whitehall fellow at the Insitute for Government . ""
This ability to change the game is what marks out great political leaders from the political managers , "" she says .
Action must be taken immediately .
The recently - launched civil service capabilities plan , which sets out where future skills are needed , is part of a new framework that recognises that commercial , digital and project management skills are no longer the preserve of a few specialists , but a priority for everyone across the civil service .
Where will those skills be found ?
There is a "" real danger that the choices set out in the plan between building , buying or borrowing capability will default to the most straightforward option of buying it in â€ “ further denuding the civil service of the specialist knowledge and "" intelligent customer "" expertise it so urgently needs , "" says Sue Ferns , head of research at Prospect trade union .
Building up expertise will start with the new apprenticeships .

2013-06-11,"So much for "" those jobs are n't coming back "" .
That was Steve Jobs ' response when asked by Barack Obama in 2011 what it would take to make iPhones in the US .
Scroll down two years to this week , when the late Mr Jobs ' beloved Apple announced that the new Mac Pro would be designed in California and made in a purpose - built plant in Texas .
Back in the 80s , Apple used to boast about producing its goods in the US .
Then came globalisation , the theology of outsourcing and "" made in China "" .
But quality products can be made closer to home without damaging business profits : the iPhone could have been made in America and still be the most profitable smartphone in the world .
A serious industrial policy , either in the UK or the US , would reward companies for producing ( and employing ) closer to home through tax reliefs for domestic value added .
Oh , and the Mac Pro looks great , by the way â€ “ wallet - damagingly swish ."
2013-06-13,"Kanye West has shown he has no problems with self - esteem in the runup the release of sixth solo album , Yeezus .
In an interview with New York Times he said he was the successor to Steve Jobs , asserting : "" I think what Kanye West is going to mean is something similar to what Steve Jobs means .
I am undoubtedly , you know , Steve of internet , downtown , fashion , culture .
Period .
By a long jump .
I honestly feel that because Steve has passed , you know , it 's like when Biggie passed and Jay - Z was allowed to become Jay - Z.
"" When asked if his instinct had ever led him astray , as when he stormed the stage to interrupt Taylor Swift at the MTV Video awards , West said : "" It 's only led me to complete awesomeness at all times .
It 's only led me to awesome truth and awesomeness .
Beauty , truth , awesomeness .
That 's all it is . ""
On the subject of awards , West also hinted at racism within the Grammy organisation , saying : "" I 'm assuming I have the most Grammys of anyone my age , but I have n't won one against a white person . ""
He also spoke about the making of Yeezus , saying a lamp designed by Le Corbusier was "" my greatest inspiration "" after a spell based in France .
"" I lived in Paris in this loft space and recorded in my living room , and it just had the worst acoustics possible , but also the songs had to be super simple , because if you turned up some complicated sound and a track with too much bass , it 's not going to work in that space , "" he said .
"" I would go to museums and just like , the Louvre would have a furniture exhibit , and I visited it like , five times , even privately .
And I would go see actual Corbusier homes in real life and just talk about , you know , why did they design it ?
They did like , the biggest glass panes that had ever been done .
Like I say , I 'm a minimalist in a rapper 's body . ""

2013-06-24,"Academy Award - winning screenwriter Aaron Sorkin is writing his debut Broadway musical â€ “ six months after dropping out of his first attempt .
In January , the West Wing creator withdrew as the librettist for Houdini , which was due to open next year with Hugh Jackman playing the famous magician .
Sorkin cited other writing commitments â€ “ a second season of HBO 's The Newsroom and a Steve Jobs biopic â€ “ that would leave him unable to finish the musical on time .
However , now he 's revealed that he still covets a stab at Broadway .
Asked whether he 'd ever write dance sequences into a film , Sorkin volunteered the information .
"" I 'm going to be doing a Broadway musical , and there will be plenty of extended dance sequences , "" he told Vanity Fair .
He was , however , too coy to reveal further details .
"" I 'm going to tell you , "" he continued , "" just when we 're allowed to announce it .
You 'll be the first to know .
I ca n't tell you anything else about it , though .
"" It leaves open the possibility that Sorkin will return to Houdini , which was never officially abandoned .
At the time of his departure , producers Scott Sanders and David Rockwell issued a statement that declared Sorkin "" an asset to any project "" before adding : "" What Hugh and the creative team continue to create is one of the most exciting projects we 've ever been a part of . ""
The musical , which has a score by Wicked composer Stephen Schwartz , charts the rivalry between the magician and a trio of women known as Spiritualists , who claim to be able to communicate with the dead ."
2013-06-27,"Here 's a thought : how would Steve Jobs have responded if you 'd walked up to the late Apple chief executive in 2008 , when the App Store launched , and told him that in five years ' time a mobile / social puzzle game about sweets would be so popular , it would spawn its own range of licensed socks ?
He 'd have called security , obviously .
Yet here we are in 2013 , and games developer King has just announced its first licensing deal : Candy Crush Saga socks .
The company is working with "" premium sock designer "" Happy Socks to release two pairs of socks based on its game , which has reached bona - fide craze status on Facebook , iOS and Android .
The socks'll cost Â£8 , and are pre - orderable now . ""
The socks will be exclusively designed , not simply branded , and will reflect the quality both King and Happy Socks are known for delivering , "" says Happy Socks boss Mikael SÃ¶derlindh .
And no , they wo n't get so difficult to put on after 70 days that you 'll have to pay for a power - up to help .
This is King 's first licensing and merchandising deal .
With 15 m daily active players on Facebook , and more than 600 daily game - plays on iOS and Android , there 's a big audience of fans to market all manner of merchandise to .
Candy Crush Saga was the most lucrative iOS game in the world in May , and the second most lucrative on Android , according to analytics firm App Annie .
It has helped King reach more than 70 m daily active players on Facebook and mobile devices across all its games .
King is following an already well - trodden path with its move into merchandising .
45 % of Angry Birds - maker Rovio 's revenues in 2012 came from its consumer products division , for example .
That 's Â£58.5 m of plush toys and other merchandise .
Earlier this month , Rovio said it now had partnerships with more than 500 companies to make "" consumer products "" , including new deals for Angry Birds - branded sweet dispensers , multivitamins , inflatables , Halloween costumes and "" hydration and storage containers "" ( flasks and lunchboxes , right ? ) .
Cut the Rope , Talking Friends and Fruit Ninja are other popular mobile games that have spawned physical products in recent times .
King may be starting with socks , but it 's safe to assume Candy Crush Saga will be walking onto shelves in many more forms in the coming months ."
2013-07-01,"It is the first official hint that Apple has a new gadget in the pipeline : the notoriously secretive company has applied to register the iWatch name as a trademark .
The anticipated wrist - computer â€ “ which may be akin to a television
, so little firm information about it is available
â€ “ will be Apple 's first new product of the post Steve Jobs era .
Apple has filed for ownership of the "" iWatch "" trademark in Japan and , assuming it is a watch , it would be a further demonstration of Silicon Valley 's growing interest in wearable computing .
The field is a hot new frontier for technology firms , as shown by the considerable interest in the Google Glass project , where futuristic spectacles can trawl the internet or take pictures on the move .
Speculation over the iWatch has gathered pace this year after Jobs 's successor as chief executive , Tim Cook , described wearable products as "" profoundly interesting . ""
His rivals clearly feel the same way , with Google and Microsoft already developing watch - like products , setting the stage for a battle royal already described as "" the new platform war "" .
Nitin Bhas , senior analyst at Juniper Research , said : "" Apple has been hinting for some time that it has a big product in the works , this could be it . ""
The speculation filling the void of Apple 's studious silence is that the iWatch will link to other Apple devices , offering another way to access text messages or check email .
Bhas added : "" But that wo n't be enough .
Apple wo n't offer something that just connects to your smartphone . ""
Bhas predicts any wearable iWatch will offer a new way to pay for shopping , carry airline or concert tickets and will function like a wrist - worn digital wallet .
It may also take on health - related wearables from companies including Nike , Fitbit and Jawbone .
Apple reportedly has a team of 100 specialists looking at ways to take advantage of recent developments in hi - tech curved glass , cheaper sensors and better voice recognition software .
Wearable technology is a small market , but research firm Juniper estimates that it will generate $ 800 m ( Â£500 m ) in revenue this year and $ 1.5bn in 2014 with interest form the big three tech firms likely to ramp up the commercial windfall .
Apple has never felt the need to be first to market , relying on its ability to offer better designed , and pricier , takes on the latest technology .
But that lead has been eroded in recent years and Apple needs a new hit to prove it is still a maker of must - have , innovative products .
The company 's share price hit an all time high of $ 700 last September but is now around $ 400 , driven down in part by fears that its days as the world 's most inventive technology business are over .
Elsewhere , the iPhone 's lead is being chipped away by Samsung , which uses Google 's Android mobile operating system , while Amazon and Google are attacking iTunes .
Apple is also a victim of rising expectations , coming under increased presure having launched no new device since last October .
The application for the iWatch trademark was made in Japan on 3 June , according to the Wall Street Journal , and made public on 27 June .
Russia 's Izvestia reported that Apple applied for the same trademark there in June .
It does not appear to have registered the name in Europe , where an Italian company owns the trademark , but registering a trademark is usually an essential step made ahead of the launch of a product .
The name of Apple 's iPod was first discovered from trademark filings ahead of its launch in October 2001 .
The name iWatch has been trademarked several times in the US although Apple trampled over Cisco 's "" iPhone "" trademark in 2007 when it launched its phone that January .
The two companies later came to an agreement ."
2013-07-12,"Apple is a company that prides itself on knowing what its consumers want even before they know it themselves .
As Steve Jobs said to Business Week in 1998 : "" It 's really hard to design products by focus groups .
A lot of times , people do n't know what they want until you show it to them . ""
This philosophy has fostered groundbreaking products such as the iPod , iPhone and iPad .
Each of these has defined and created a new product category .
They each represent not just great product design , but also an integrated , seamless product experience designed and delivered end - to - end by Apple .
The decision to let third party apps into the App Store at its July 2008 launch was therefore a major departure for Apple and caused Steve Jobs much angst .
Could Apple exert enough control on outside developers to ensure Apple 's seamless end - to - end product experience was maintained ?
By and large they could .
Apple has created a development environment for its mobile operating system , iOS , that ensures a great product experience for users , while still remaining attractive to developers .
This environment has three key features : the narrow range of highly standardised Apple devices , which makes development and testing straightforward , an iOS software development kit provides resources to create apps rapidly with consistent quality and encourages best use of iOS 's features , and the rigorous App Store approval process , which ensures apps are reliable and fit into Apple 's overall user experience vision .
This strategy has been an enormous success .
Breakthrough apps such as Shazam , Instagram and Vine routinely appear on the App Store months or years before they are widely available on rival platforms such as Android .
But will this controlling , "" we know best "" attitude eventually backfire ?
The next revolutionary app , if it really is revolutionary , will be unexpected and disruptive .
It may not fit into Apple 's structured ideas about how apps should behave .
These ideas have ensured quality but can discourage innovation .
In a contest between true innovation and compliance with App Store rules , the rules win every time .
This attitude is potentially storing up problems for Apple as developers struggle to differentiate themselves from their competitors whilst complying with the App Store 's tight guidelines .
Innovative companies will always want to produce highly original products .
As the number of apps increase , this will become increasingly difficult to do within Apple 's prescribed boundaries .
In contrast , Google 's Android app environment is more like the wild west , where nearly anything goes .
Buyers must beware , but the lighter touch also encourages creativity .
Android app store operators avoid the restrictive rules that Apple has around app functionality and developers are free to innovate .
Although the enormous range of Android devices can make design complicated , developers can also design apps that exploit the features and capabilities of each device for optimal user experience .
Moreover , Google is taking steps to make things considerably less wild .
More than 60,000 apps were recently dropped from Google Play for terms - of - service and copyright violations .
Making Android a more secure place for consumers and developers , but without the stringent restrictions Apple imposes , could pay enormous dividends for Google and its partners .
Android - only apps exist , but so far none of these has been a breakthrough , category - defining app that changes consumer behaviour .
It is just a matter of time , however , before the next game - changing app does appear .
Unless Apple makes some serious changes it could well appear first on Android .

2013-07-17,"Industry reports continue speculating about upcoming Apple launches in TV and wearables .
But product launches are only to be expected - I think one of the more intriguing things about the world 's most talked - about technology company in 2013 is the projection of its own self - image .
Since last month 's Worldwide Developer Conference , during which it launched its stark new mobile operating system , Apple has been running a cross - media ad campaign , "" Designed By Apple
In California "" , to state its core values .
Comprising a TV commercial ( "" Our Signature "" , @radical.media ) , an animated short ( "" Intention "" , TBWA / Media Arts Lab ) and matching double - page newspaper spreads , the messaging is an homage to minimalism that poetically communicates the company 's product design ethos : "" Every idea we touch enhances each life it touches .
"" The campaign is self - indulgent , even by Apple 's standards .
But the layers of meaning beneath its hubris are fascinating ...
For designers everywhere , not just in Cupertino Apple 's monologue lauds its expertise in reductive innovation strategy , asking : "" Does this ( product ) deserve to exist ? ""
In doing so , it is extolling a philosophy of functional design minimalism that is not unique to Apple but is shared at heart by all product designers .
The diatribe could be an ad for a Dyson vacuum , an interview quote in Creative Review , an art school essay or a manifesto penned by a community of designers ...
Dancing to I
ve 's tune That this campaign has at all been conceived
, then , speaks volumes about Apple 's newly - anointed design SVP and guru Jonathan
I ve 's powerful new place in the post - Jobs pecking order .
Tim Cook may be CEO now , but he has apparently compelled his marketers to communicate I ve 's ideology .
It is easy to look here and see I ve , not Cook , writing Apple 's story .
Re - amplifying Jobs
That Apple feels the need to do this , however , is interesting .
Everyone already knows I ve 's products for their famous simplicity - Apple has finely delivered that message over many years without being overly self - conscious , and this recognition is fresh in the mind from last year 's eulogies to Steve Jobs .
Shouting the minimalist mantra further is off - putting , making these ads the worst - received in 26 consecutive Apple commercials , according to one ad measuring firm - suggesting this campaign is more about introspection than communication .
The irony of missed minimalism The 60-second "" Our Signature "" commercial is an evocative ad for TV , a medium with the brevity to excuse its indulgence .
In print , however , the campaign contradicts the very goal of the reductionism it advocates .
Setting an unusual 104-word missive against a typical product photograph slows up comprehension .
As one friend said to me whilst flicking through the ad in a Sunday paper this week : "" Who wants to read all that ? ""
Creative Review , whose very designer audience is the cloth from which I ve is cut , is more corruscating .
"" Is this a return to the heyday of long copy ? , "" it asks , replying : "" Sadly , but definitely , not .
The copy is dire .
Vacuous , boring , self - regarding and counter - productive . ""
Answering identified critics
Those 104 words may seem excessive , but this ad covers many bases - many of them being answers to recent challengers and criticisms that are nevertheless unspoken .
The ad asks , "" When you 're busy making everything , how can you perfect anything ? "" - a covert attack on Samsung 's iPhone - threatening Galaxy devices range that is replete with a mindboggling number of variants .
Similarly , by proudly flaunting its "" Designed in California "" credentials , Apple is playing to the growing US call to repatriate labour from Asia - Samsung 's home continent .
But Apple declines to name its ad 's victim .
Explaining iOS The campaign also resonates silently with the latest version of Apple 's mobile operating system , iOS 7 .
After some observers grumbled about the continued use of real - world metaphors in the system interface , Apple duly complied with a pared - down minimalised design refresh .
But aspects of that refresh seem so minimal that they convey almost nothing , and risk confusing new users .
Such faux pas are not in the design school playbook .
I ve has excelled at burying ugly and unnecessary parts of computer hardware from view , creating simple , beautiful and usable products , just like the new campaign says .
But iOS 7 represents virtually
I ve 's first foray in to software design .
What today feel like the operating system 's stark and overly simplified quirks may become familiar to users after its full public launch this autumn - and Apple 's latest ad campaign may be judged as indulgent yet ultimately justified .
But , if iOS 7 confuses rather than empowers , many will highlight the disconnect between Apple 's message and its medium .

2013-08-07,"When unveiling the first iPad in January 2010 , Steve Jobs suggested that it would fill a gap between the smartphone and the PC - one that at the time was being taken on by netbooks . ""
The problem is netbooks are n't better at anything , "" Jobs said at the time .
"" They 're just cheap laptops .
And we do n't think they 're a third category of device . ""
Now , netbooks are dead , and Forrester Research says that Jobs was right - and that the tablet format has become the "" third form "" of computing , along with the other two .
The tablet , it suggests , has become like a microwave in a kitchen : a mainstay device that people expect access to both at home and work .
Forrester 's new report , which the Guardian has seen , suggests tablets will become a mainstay of households in developed markets by 2017 , with 60 % of online consumers in North America and 42 % in European owning one by 2017 .
By then 905 million people worldwide , equivalent to one in eight of the global population , will have one , predicts Forrester Research .
The figures compare with PCs , which took over 20 years to pass the 1bn installed base mark in 2008 .
Another research group , Gartner , reckons the installed base will reach 1.5bn by the end of this year , but sales are dwindling amid lengthening replacement cycles and growing consumer interest in tablets and smartphones .
Taking off with the tablets By contrast the tablet market is enjoying rocketing growth .
New figures from a separate research business IDC show that in the second quarter of 2013 worldwide tablet shipments rose by 60 % year - on - year to 45.1 m , even while the three top - line vendors Apple , Samsung and Asus all saw a sequential drop in sales .
Apple also saw year - on - year sales drop in the absence of a refreshed version of its iPad .
And while Apple was the single largest vendor , with 32.5 % of the market , Google 's Android took over the majority share with 62.6 % .
Forrester 's analysis points to tablets becoming an essential part of office as well as home life , which will "" catapult the tablet from merely a popular mass - market device to a highly visible mainstay device among consumers and businesses in developed nations . ""
"" Tablets have hit hyper - growth , "" Forrester notes in its new report . ""
Using a kitchen metaphor , we could say they have become the microwave of personal computing , after the refrigerator and the oven .
In other words , they have exceeded the status of mass market to become what we can term a ' mainstay ' device'â€ ¦ the earlier big two - the PC and the smartphone - have become a big three .
"" It reckons tablet sales will grow at a compound rate of 25.6 % annually through to 2017 to reach 381 m - larger than the worldwide PC market has ever been .
Yet even that figure looks modest compared to a forecast made in May by IDC , which reckoned that in 2017 tablet sales would hit 410 m , against PC sales of 333 m down from a 2011 peak of 364 m .
In fact , a series of forecasts shown above from IDC ( collated by The Guardian ) show that it has kept raising its forecasts for how many tablets will be sold ( the yellow column ) while cutting that for PCs ( the other colours supporting the yellow column ) .
Each successive line on the graph is a newer forecast ; on each , the red line is a little lower - in some cases , substantially so .
And if you 're wondering how accurate they are , the green overlays show the years where the prediction has met reality .
For 2012 , it 's particularly noticeable that a small initial forecast for tablets , and large one for PCs , shifted the other way - and in the end saw more tablets shipped than initially expected .
That points to deeper travails for companies which rely mainly on PCs for their business and profits .
IDC 's second - quarter tablet figures contrast with its figures for PC shipments for the quarter of 75.6 m â€ “ which fell by 11.4 % year - on - year .
That means that tablet shipments are now 60 % as large as PC shipments , in a category which had languished since Microsoft created it in 2000 until January 2010 , when Apple reinvigorated it with the first iPad .
Since then Apple has sold 140 m iPads , and they have begun to filter into businesses such as British Airways , American Airlines and Barclays Bank .
Dell , meanwhile , which does n't have an offering in either tablets or smartphones , is struggling so badly that it is going private in order to give itself time to reinvent itself and its offerings .
HP , which burnt more than $ 1bn on the TouchPad , has only just got into the tablet business ( with a Â£129 7 in Android tablet ) , which does n't seem to have made any impact on its PC business , which in the quarter to 22 May was down 20 % .
The key to tablets ' success , says Forrester , is its "" hyper - portability "" : it can be used in the home , while travelling , in restaurants (
30 % of adults with a tablet said they 'd done that ) , while at work "" tablets rival smartphones in terms of their mobility "" for applications ranging from simple email to LOB ( line of business ) apps : Logitech created a proprietary tablet app for its sales staff in China which can take photos of retail outlets to check inventory and window displays , tagged to location .
It 's the sort of thing that would be unwieldy - or impossible - with a conventional laptop , and hugely fiddly on a smartphone .
Small is n't always beautiful The introduction by Amazon of the Kindle Fire , and then Google 's Nexus 7 , followed by Apple 's iPad mini , and the successive media coverage might make it seem that small tablets are what people really want .
Not so , says Forrester : 61 % of people who own or "" have interest in "" tablets preferred tablets between 8.9 in and 10.1 in ( the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 through to the iPad and Samsung 10.1 ) .
Then , 16 % prefer the smaller 7in-8 in size .
So that leaves 23 % who could be persuaded either way .
There are some who could be interested in even larger tablets ( there have been rumours , unsubstantiated , of Apple working on a 13 in iPad ) .
But the key element is that there 's a sizeable segment who need to see a tablet in a shop before deciding .
As for Windows , there 's a little chink of light : "" 20 % of global information workers indicated that they would prefer to use Windows 8 on their next tablet , "" a Forrester survey found in Q4 2012 .
But that 's only if the ecosystem of apps for it - both in size and quality - improves .
As for Apple , its eclipse in the latest IDC figures is n't a cause for worry , by Forrester 's lights .
"" iOS will continue to maintain a lead , albeit at a diminished plurality of market share , due to the incredible ecosystem of applications and support for the platform , "" it suggests .
But for the PC businesses , the outlook still looks grim .
PC sales are only falling - and the "" post - PC "" age , where the PC of old is only one of many ways in which we carry out computing tasks , is becoming more and more clear .
PCs do one class of task ; smartphones do another ; and tablets do a class that slots in between both of those .
One thing 's clear - they 're not netbooks , which hit a total of 60 m shipped worldwide in 2010 .
They were forecast to hit double that number this year - whereas instead the figure is 100 % lower .
But then , predicting the future has always been fraught ."
2013-08-13,"Ashton Kutcher stunned his young audience at the Teen Choice awards on Sunday night by offering a stream of "" insider secrets "" from the podium inspired in part by Steve Jobs , the Apple co - founder who Kutcher has recently portrayed on film .
There to receive the Ultimate Choice award , Kutcher decided to use his status as a tech pioneer and investment guru to impart some worldly advice .
First he revealed felt like a "" fraud "" , and that until he was 19 he was known by his first name , Chris .
But then he launched into an extraordinary life primer compressed into a few minutes .
First he listed his pre - acting jobs , including sweeping a factory floor , saying "" I believe that opportunity looks like hard work "" . ""
Every job I had was a stepping stone to the next one , and I never quit a job before I had the next one . ""
Then he turned to "" sexiness "" . ""
The sexiest thing in the entire world is being really smart .
And being thoughtful .
And being generous .
Everything else is crap !
â€
¦
It 's just crap people try to sell to you to make you feel less . ""
And finally , citing Jobs as a specific inspiration , he told his screaming audience that "" everything around us that we call life was made up people who were no smarter than youâ€
¦ so build a life , do n't live one .
Build one .
Find your opportunities and always be sexy . ""
No doubt Kutcher was spurred on by the fact that , at 35 , he is likely to have less influence over young people in the immediate future .
After all , he referred to his appearance as the "" old guy awardâ€ ¦ after this I go to the geriatric home . """
2013-08-21,"Ashton Kutcher has found himself caught up in a war of words with Apple co - founder Steve Wozniak over his portrayal of late technology icon Steve Jobs in a poorly - received biopic .
Joshua Michael Stern 's Jobs follows the Apple guru from his student days at Reed College in Portland , Oregon , in the mid-1970s to the launch of the world - beating iPod in 2001 .
The film opened outside the top 5 at the US box office at the weekend with $ 6.7 m ( Â£4.2 m ) and currently maintains a disappointing 25 % "" rotten "" rating on the review aggregator rottentomatoes.com .
Wozniak , who founded Apple with Jobs in 1976 , took to the tech site Gizmodo on 16 August to post his own impromptu review : "" I thought the acting throughout was good .
I was attentive and entertained but not greatly enough to recommend the movie , "" he wrote .
"" I suspect a lot of what was wrong with the film came from Ashton 's own image of Jobs .
Ashton made some disingenuous and wrong statements about me recently ( including my supposedly having said that the movie was bad , which was probably Ashton believing pop press headlines ) and that I did n't like the movie because I 'm paid to consult on another one .
These are examples of Ashton still being in character .
Either film would have paid me to consult , but the Jobs one already had a script written .
I ca n't take that creative leadership from someone else .
And I was turned off by the Jobs script .
But I still hoped for a great movie . ""
Kutcher , 35 , has questioned Wozniak 's dismissive attitude towards the film . ""
Steve Wozniak is being paid by another company to support their Steve Jobs film , "" he said recently .
"" It 's personal for him , but it 's also business .
We have to keep that in mind .
He was also extremely unavailable to us when producing this film .
He 's a brilliant man and I respect his work , but he was n't available to us as a resource , so his account is n't going to be our account because we do n't know exactly what it was .
We did the best job we could .
Nobody really knows what happened in the rooms . ""
Wozniak , 63 , is working as a consultant on a rival , Aaron Sorkin - scripted biopic , which will follow Jobs into production .
The Oscar - winning screenwriter 's take adapts the bestselling official biography of the technology icon ,
Walter Isaacson 's Steve Jobs : The Exclusive Biography .
Isaacson 's book is based on more than 40 interviews with its subject , conducted over two years , as well as interviews with more than 100 family members , friends , adversaries , competitors and colleagues .
Jobs died on 5 October 2011 , of cancer .
Sorkin 's hotly - anticipated film , as yet untitled , reputedly plays out over just three scenes and in real time .
The writer of The Social Network said in November he planned to deliver a trio of snapshots from Jobs ' life , each from just before a vital product launch , in order to form a vision of the technology guru seen through the prism of his major successes ."
2013-08-26,"What can we learn from Ashton Kutcher ?
Hot on the heels of George Saunders ' commencement speech , in which the novelist shocked the class of 2013 by urging them less toward professional advancement than personal integrity â€ “ to "" be kind "" â€ “ comes Kutcher at the Teen Choice Awards , with a speech expressly modelled along the same "" life lessons "" lines .
Kutcher , of course , is promoting a biopic of Steve Jobs and all those hours in the black turtleneck have probably gone to his head .
His manner on stage and in his media appearances of late has been of a man who has seen the meaning of life and does n't know if the rest of us can take it .
( For which also see : James Franco ) .
But the three inspirational bullet points he works through at the awards , somewhat to the bafflement of the pubescent crowd , are an interesting departure in the context and indication of a newish celebrity arena that flagging movie stars want in on : the rock star nerd guru .
The TED franchise has a lot to do with this , of course ; and the boom in the self - help market , wherein the spirit of "" and you can too "" has proved lucrative to those who can bolt on a spurious business application to their cultural or journalistic insights .
It 's not an obvious route for film and TV stars , who have traditionally based their appeal on the notion of intangible superiority ; they have what they have because of something we ca n't have â€ “ stardust , the secret of which ca n't ever be shared .
But this is the age of spilled secrets â€ “ of a general dismantling of the barriers between Us and Them â€ “ in which the other model starts to look rather old - fashioned and dim .
If we know anything at this point , it 's that there can be greater rewards for giving away free what was latterly hoarded .
And so here 's Kutcher , a shrewd guy who runs a successful investment fund alongside his acting career , and whose speech one takes as an expression of sound business sense , as well as anything more altruistic .
If you can get through the unbearable opener , when he reveals that his civilian name was "" Chris "" ( Ashton is his middle name ) , and that as Chris , the mortal , he figured out the key to success , the insights are solid :
that there is no particular secret beyond application .
That "" opportunity looks like hard work "" .
That being smart is being sexy ( a huge cheer goes up on "" sexy "" , suggesting the crowd is n't fully absorbing his message ) .
And â€ “ quick on the uptake
, old Kutcher â€ “ that it 's a good idea in life to "" be generous "" .
"" It 's just crap that people try to sell to you , to make you feel like less , "" he says in a riff on consumerist culture ( see also : his ad - campaigns for Nikon , and Popchips ) and as if he is talking on a panel at the Y.
The pay off , too , is straight from the new lecture playbook : grandiose , uplifting , slightly non - sensical : "" build a life , do n't live one "" .
Brad Pitt has his dull architecture schtick ; Matt Damon his thoughts on education ; but here Kutcher pulls into a clear lead with his Man of Ideas play and the rest better look lively .
Expect to see a lot more like this coming soon ."
2013-09-01,"Job : chief executive , Apple Age : 52 Industry : digital media New entry
Tim Cook has occupied the top seat at Apple for two years .
That his company remains able to induce wild - eyed fanboyism in customers of all ages is a testament to the man who replaced Steve Jobs .
The 52-year - old chief executive has faced no shortage of difficulties in his tenure to date â€ “ not least over the company 's corporate tax arrangements
â€ “ but the iPhone and iPad maker still sits among the top power - brokers in media and technology .
In Apple 's most recent earnings call in July , Cook was typically enthused when alluding â€ “ albeit vaguely â€ “ to new products due to be unveiled in the next 12 months .
"" We are laser - focused and working hard on some amazing new products that we will introduce in the fall and across 2014 , "" he said , speaking after Apple 's profits fell for the second successive quarter but managed to beat analysts ' estimates .
The nugget was designed tactfully to tantalise Apple 's greatest cheerleaders , but the message was also aimed at analysts who have questioned the company 's ability to innovate at speed .
It has been a year since the company launched a key hardware device and competitors have continued to gain significant ground .
Apple 's share of the smartphone market fell to 21.8 % , from 23 % , in the year to 2012 's final quarter , according to figures from analysts IDC .
Meanwhile , Samsung has broken from the pack and surged to a dominant 29 % slice of the market â€ “ aided by a slew of Google Android smartphones â€ “ from 22.4 % the year before .
Cook has also faced heat from Washington .
The Alabama - born executive , who was hired by Jobs at pre - iPhone Apple in 1998 , was called before US senators in May to answer accusations that the company uses a "" highly questionable "" network of offshore entities to avoid paying billions in US income taxes .
He survived , urging the US government to overhaul and simplify its tax code , although Apple emerged with inevitable bruising .
Talk that Apple will unveil a new lower - cost iPhone has grown louder in recent months , with Apple - watchers circling 10 September as the date for a possible product announcement .
Cook said recently that the company has "" intense interest "" in revolutionising the television .
Whether he will be able to fulfil what Jobs always described as a "" hobby "" remains to be seen ."
2013-09-28,"When Steve Jobs was still with us , many commentators â€ “ yours truly included â€ “ used to complain about the "" reality distortion field "" that surrounded Apple 's charismatic leader .
Those in attendance when Jobs launched the devices and services ( iPod , iTunes , OS X , iMac , MacBook , iPhone and iPad ) that blew such huge holes in the business models of established industries told of events that were more like religious revival meetings than corporate press conferences .
As Apple 's dominance grew , the man who led it came to be seen as a unique combination of visionary , guru , saint and mogul .
But then mortality intervened and His Steveness passed away .
The reality distortion field persisted , however , though now in reverse .
It led people to conclude that the death of the magician would inevitably lead to the end of the magic that made Apple the most valuable company in the world .
In comparison to Jobs his successor , Tim Cook , was seen as charismatically challenged .
And while we could expect Apple to thrive for a little longer , it was only because Cook would be unveiling innovations that were in the works when Jobs was alive .
After that , the well would surely run dry .
It was against this background that the hapless Cook unveiled the new iPhones on 10 September .
He announced a cheaper model ( the 5c ) , the more upmarket 5s and a new version of Apple 's mobile operating system ( iOS 7 ) .
Although the event was accompanied by the usual hoopla , the overall media reaction was a barely stifled yawn .
Sure , the 5c came in bright colours and was a bit cheaper , but it was n't cheap enough to break into the lower end of the market .
And although the 5s came with a more powerful processor , a motion - sensing chip and a significantly better camera , it was really just more of the same .
Well , except for the fact that it had a fingerprint sensor for user authentication .
And as for iOS 7 , well , the only really interesting thing about it was that it now had flat icons rather than the faux-3D ones of iOS 6 .
It all went to show ( so the narrative implied ) that Apple had lost its mojo .
As a case study in how a media narrative can miss the point , this one would be hard to beat .
So here 's an alternative one .
What Apple did on 10 September was to release the first operational 64-bit hardware and software ever seen in a mobile device .
The number of bits is important , because every mobile processor up to this has been a 32-bit chip , which means in essence that it can only address 4 GB of working memory .
This has hitherto been enough for mobile devices ( and indeed most desktop machines ) but it 's not enough for more powerful computers .
So the really intriguing questions raised by the iPhone 5s 's A7 processor , with its ability to address colossal amounts of memory , are : why is it there ?
And what clues does it give as to what Apple is planning next ?
Given that what Apple thinks today , the rest of the industry thinks next year , the answers to these questions will be interesting .
( Readers with long memories will recall that Apple was the first to drop floppy disks , internal modems , CD / DVD drives and laptop hard drives , and that on each occasion the omissions were greeted by howls of derision from the industry , followed rapidly by shamefaced adoption . )
In the same vein , most of the media coverage of iOS 7 focused on the radically different "" look and feel "" of the user interface , the sparseness and minimality of which was widely attributed to Jony I ve , who is now in overall charge of both hardware and software design at Apple .
This is fair enough : after all , for most people , the most important aspect of a device is its user interface .
Is the thing easier to use after the latest "" upgrade "" ?
The answer for iOS 7 seems to be a qualified "" yes "" .
But for geeks , two things about iOS 7 stand out .
One is the fact that Apple could completely rewrite a complex operating system for a 64-bit environment â€ “ and ship it in a relatively bug - free state , on time .
The other is the way iOS 7 solves a problem that has been bugging internet engineers for years
â€ “ how to ensure that if one mode of connecting to the network fails , your device can seamlessly switch to another mode .
The solution is called multi - path TCP and â€ “ guess what ?
â€ “ iOS 7 has it .
But you 'd have to read a lot of media coverage of the iPhone launch to learn that .
Those who think that Apple has peaked ought to think again ."
2013-09-30,""" The greatest artists like Dylan , Picasso and Newton risked failure .
And if we want to be great , we 've got to risk it , too . ""
Steve Jobs quotes are probably overused at the moment , but I think there 's more to this one than first appears .
Fear of failure is natural , especially in professional life .
From talking yourself up in the mirror before a big meeting , to hiding mistakes behind technical errors , slipping on a mask to hide your vulnerability is common practice in the corporate world .
There 's a widely held assumption that showing weakness will relegate us from the front of the pack , that admitting we can make mistakes means we are somehow not built for the top .
But where does this attitude get us ?
An organisation that denies its vulnerability ends up with scapegoating , an unpleasant atmosphere and a culture of blame that leaves it drained of energy and enthusiasm .
A working environment in which people do n't feel free to be open or make mistakes is corrosive .
People will do anything to avoid blame , and genuine accountability goes out of the window to be replaced by bullying and sniping .
Trust and teamwork are eroded and the workplace becomes somewhere to dread .
It 's troubling for those in the management team , who are also likely to be the bearers of the stress transferred from person to person .
A workforce that operates in this way is suffering from what psychologists call burnout : a state of blame , lethargy and negativity .
This in turn can lead to individuals simply withdrawing from workplace life , or pushing themselves too much , neglecting their own needs as well as those of others .
This is more common than you might think , in the US , for example , one study found that 70 % of workers are disengaged from their work and "" sleepwalking through their day "" .
Worse still , 18 % of those say they actively seek to undermine their co - workers ' success .
The opposite of burnout is engagement , and an engaged workforce is one that thrives on energy , positivity and communication .
Ideas can be shared freely and everyone benefits from the moments of brilliance and idiosyncrasy that come from groups of enthused people working together .
An engaged workforce ca n't be fashioned from the odd brainstorm or a staff ideas box .
Stirring up real creativity takes a complete change of mindset .
Companies need to embrace vulnerability and work with staff to be open with each other about ideas and emotions .
Companies synonymous with innovation â€ “ Google , for instance , or Facebook â€ “ operate in a melting pot of ideas that could easily be mistaken for a stroke of luck .
It takes leaders who admit their own mistakes and promote an ethos that work is for experimentation as well as diligence to engage people in a creative way of working .
A pioneering case in point is Building 20 , a workspace for MIT , where innovation and experimentation were the norm until its demolition in 1998 .
The building was everything that should demotivate its inhabitants
â€ “
it was ugly , it leaked , it smelled bad and had the sort of heating system that was uncomfortable whatever the weather .
But this long , narrow workspace hosted an incredibly diverse range of projects , from Chomskyan linguistics , to Bose speakers and even a piano - tuning facility .
Building 20 evolved to fit the needs of whoever was inside , with walls literally coming down to facilitate larger projects .
The changing environment forced people to work together and interact , creating an openness about each other 's projects .
Having some great minds in the room was important , but allowing them to proceed without fear gave way to fleeting moments of genius that spawned many incredible discoveries .
So how do you spark a more emotionally open , engaged office environment ?
It 's actually a remarkably simple principle , just a difficult execution .
You need to open the workplace to emotion , starting at the top .
In this way corporate vulnerability can work as a valve to the bubbling stresses that people bring into the workplace .
Steve Jobs 's quote about failure is half true
â€ “ great people have all risked failure .
But it is n't just a requirement to be great ; rather it is one to be happy and thrive in professional life .
It 's not something everyone is capable of , but the potential gains are immeasurable .
Picture a team of people working without fear of failure and you see innovation .

2013-10-17,"With Apple apparently losing its mojo since the death of Steve Jobs , the appointment of Angela Ahrendts seems like an inspired move .
The Burberry chief executive turned around a business that was more associated with football hooligans than high fashion , and while Apple might not need such a dramatic turnaround , as a brand famed for product invention , the need for retail innovation is ever present .
Part of Burberry 's success can obviously be attributed to Christopher Bailey and his vision and creativity
â€ “ we can all remember the Kate Moss swimsuit ad that almost single - handedly propelled the brand back into the luxury fashion stratosphere .
However , it was Ahrendts ' innovative approach that has truly transformed the business .
Relaunching the online store and reinventing the physical store has reaped huge rewards for Burberry , while the acceleration of the retail portfolio with bold moves into untapped markets has been impressive .
What particularly interests me about this move is the true opportunity that lies in the convergence of high technology and high fashion .
Who wants to wear Google glasses when you can wear Gucci ?
Or HP when you can have Hermes ?
Ahrendts ' appointment would seem a natural fit for a brand that could well lead the way in wearable technology â€ “ probably likely to be the single most influential trend over the next couple of years , and a category that is about to explode .
Or to quote Richard Stoppard , global head of retail strategy at Nokia : "" The convergence of beauty of design and pack - leading technology is at the core of Nokia and continues to drive the mobile category .
As key players begin to explore wearable technology , it is clear that recruiting visionary leaders who understand the fusion of design , fashion and technology such as Ahrendts will drive true benefits . ""
So what will this mean more broadly for the consumer electronics category ?
Fashion has always been about aspiration and lifestyle , and the world of consumer electronics has produced some almost magical products .
So why has the consumer electronics category behaved more like the kitchen appliances category ?
Perhaps we 'll start to see the long overdue demise of the "" techs and specs "" approach to a more "" desires and dreams "" vernacular ?
After all , the price of the average laptop far exceeds the price of your average pair of shoes .
Fashion brands have always created stores that allow shoppers to dream â€ “ in fact , many are cathedrals to the brand , every detail considered , every material interrogated and every vista choreographed .
An almost solitary but sparkling example of these principles at work is in the Vertu store in Ginza , Tokyo .
The environment was created from the beauty and craft of the devices outwards .
The brand stands for the elegance of the extraordinary and the environment is tailored to reflect that ethos .
Shopping is now an event and a social experience
â€
“
it 's the difference between "" doing "" the shopping and "" going "" shopping .
One is a chore that has to be endured ( and more often than not online ) and the other is entertainment .
Consumer electronics have generally failed spectacularly to deliver anything close to entertainment â€ “ ironic considering the product they are selling .
The old view that shoppers can touch and feel in - store and will therefore purchase is simply not enough .
Fashion brands know how to create that "" must have now "" moment .
Take the Mulberry store on Bond Street .
Sure , you can buy a bag online ( and probably cheaper ) but when you cross the threshold of the store you enter the Mulberry world .
It is a monument to British craft â€ “ the dry stone wall does n't just add texture to the environment ; it adds texture to the experience .
It does n't even have to be the luxury end of fashion that consumer electronics can learn from .
What if Topshop did consumer electronics ?
Masterclasses from the coolest tech geeks ; an audio department that feels like a nightclub ; and a TV lounge where shoppers can hang out with friends and choose a movie , all served up with popcorn and ice cream .
Fashion brands have always strived to match the dream of their brand with the reality of the physical environment .
In contrast , the magic of technology and how it is retailed always seems to fall short of our expectations .
After all , the physical store is still the greatest opportunity a brand has to wow you with its thinking , its story and its products .

2013-10-29,"Back in 2005 , when BlackBerry brought instant messaging to the mobile phone , the company was just entering its boom times .
While the iPhone was still a gleam in Steve Jobs ' eye , BlackBerry 's innovations ensured its smartphone joined maple syrup on the list of Canada 's biggest exports .
Six years later , in the summer of 2011 , as violence engulfed London and spread to Birmingham , Nottingham , Liverpool and Manchester , so effective was BlackBerry Messenger ( BBM ) at mobilising the rioters that politicians called for the service to be temporarily shut down .
But two years later , it is the users themselves who are pulling the plug .
As demand for BlackBerry handsets fades , the once noisy BBM grapevine is falling silent .
Dozens of alternatives have sprung up to take its place , from Facebook and Apple 's own - brand instant messaging applications to independent startups such as WhatsApp and Kik ( which also hails from Canada ) .
Free to download and use ( although WhatsApp costs $ 1 a year after the first year ) , they use the internet to swap text messages , pictures , voice clips , "" stickers "" , and even videos in WhatsApp 's case , between most types of phones .
In an attempt to retain its following , BBM was last week released on Android and Apple phones .
Despite the competition , the response has been overwhelming , with an announcement that there have been more than 20 m downloads .
But despite the initial interest , many believe BBM 's wider release will do little to save the service . ""
The move to bring BlackBerry to the iPhone is four or five years too late , "" says James Gooderson , an 18-year - old classical civilisation student at Nottingham University who blogs on technology .
"" WhatsApp has captured the reason why young people would use a BlackBerry . ""
BBM claims 80 million monthly users after its upgrade , but WhatsApp has 300 million .
Other services expose BBM 's limitations : unlike Skype and Viber , it does not yet offer video or voice calls .
Unlike Path , it does not do location sharing .
There is no video sharing , as on iMessage .
And the stickers ( a more sophisticated version of the smiley face ) adored by kids the world over are also unforgivably absent .
Even the contacts and calendar sharing that BBM made possible on BlackBerry handsets have not migrated to the Apple and Android versions .
Messaging is moving from verbal to visual .
Photos uploaded to Instagram trigger a wave of comments and Snapchat 's pictures , which self - delete after 10 seconds , have opened a world of other possibilities .
Like BBM , all of these services are free for any phone with an internet connection .
Yet only three years ago , BBM was so powerful it was credited with starting a revolution in Egypt ; and at the time of the London riots , it was a more urgent source of news than the television screen .
"" We could see on our BlackBerry messages where the rioters were going next ; TV news would catch up four hours later , "" said Jean - Pierre Moore , 28 , .
He manages the karting track at Oasis youth club in Stockwell , south London , an area with some of the highest levels of crime and economic deprivation in Britain .
Moore mainly communicates on an iPad now .
He dismisses the notion that the BBM curfew urged by some MPs would have stopped the looting . ""
The social networking was n't the reason , "" he says .
"" I know a lot of people who were out rioting .
People had been angry for a long time .
Mention the words stop and search around here , and you immediately have a room full of angry young men . ""
Yet for the young people around the karting track , no single alternative with the same viral power , the ability to connect a generation on one platform , has replaced BBM .
"" There 's too many things now .
I 'm on WhatsApp , iMessage , Instagram , Kik .
Every year a new one comes out , "" says Moore .
Nearly 80 % of young smartphone owners regularly use a social networking application , says the research firm Enders Analysis , but two - thirds use more than one .
Among 16- to 24-year - olds , 60 % use Facebook everyday , but 46 % use alternatives .
"" It 's a much more complex , multi - faceted environment , "" says Benedict Evans , a digital media specialist at Enders .
"" The smartphone itself has become the platform .
All of these apps plug into your phone book and your photo library .
Apps rise and fall like fireworks .
Some , like Instagram , last , others disappear into thin air .
"" Bennett , a 13-year - old at Oasis , is typical of this dispersed smartphone culture .
He has three devices , all hand - me - downs from family members .
He keeps his BlackBerry for messaging , uses an iPhone over Wi - Fi to play games and makes phone calls on an HTC - branded Android phone .
His friends are still on BBM – the four phone robberies at his school so far this term were all BlackBerrys .
At the touch of a few buttons , a single BlackBerry message can be sent to the phone owner 's entire contacts book – several hundred people in some cases ; on WhatsApp , the limit for a broadcast message is 50 .
But for Bennett , Instagram is now a major social network .
"" Instagram is Facebook without parents , "" he says .
"" Facebook has been taken over by the older generation .
Once I saw my mum on Facebook , I deleted my account . ""
For families that may struggle to pay their heating bills this winter , the low price tag attached to buying and communicating on a BlackBerry retains its appeal .
Unlimited BBM messages are available to anyone with a secondhand device and a £ 7-a - month deal from T - Mobile .
But trust in the privacy of BBM 's system has been eroded .
Part of the attraction to business people , revolutionaries , demonstrators and rioters was a belief that encrypted words sent over the company 's secure servers could not be traced back to their writers .
Prosecutions after the riots put an end to that belief .
In the aftermath , BlackBerry worked closely with police to help identify those who had used BBM to incite violence .
In Nottingham , a young man called Sam Lowe was last year jailed for a message , later deleted , which he sent to his 160 contacts .
It read : "" Girls , grannies , mums , dads , lads , grandads – everyone meet on Sneinton Dale tonight at 9 o'clock as we are all going to kick off …
"" Lowe a 39-month prison sentence .
Across town from Stockwell , outside the gates of a private school in well - heeled South Kensington , the older pupils all have Apple logos on their handsets .
They all use WhatsApp .
For many , BBM is a distant memory .
"" I still have a Blackberry , but I 'm the only one , "" says a teenager standing with a circle of friends .
And how does that make him feel ?
"" Isolated , "" he replies .
The contenders Whatsapp : 300 million active users The most popular cross - platform phone messaging app , WhatsApp is the go - to text message replacement .
Line :
270 million users Japan 's answer to WhatsApp now has 80 % of its users outside Japan , challenging for the text - message replacement crown .
Instagram : 150 million monthly active users , 55 m photos per day Packed with filters , this photosharing app allows you to blast your best images out into the ether .
Snapchat : 350 m photos shared per day A playful , picture messaging app , Snapchat allows you to send drawings your five - year - old would be proud of .
Kik Messenger : 80 million registered users Kik messenger
is another , smaller cross - platform text - messaging replacement that once challenged WhatsApp .
Viber :
200 m downloads in May Viber is a free phone - calling app that lets you send messages and make calls over the internet to other Viber users , just like Skype .
BBM : 60 million monthly active users The original phone - to - phone messenger , recently unshackled from its BlackBerry phone exclusivity to go land on Android and iPhone .
WeChat :
( with Chinese sister app Weixin ) 240 million active users
WeChat is China 's equivalent to Line and WhatsApp .
Facebook Messenger : 819 million mobile monthly active users Starting as an instant messenger isolated on the social network ,
Facebook Messenger now has dedicated cross - platform apps on mobile too .
iMessage : 140 million users ( at latest count , in June 2012 ) Built into iOS , iMessage allows iPhone users to seamlessly swap between text and iMessages within the same application ."
2013-11-17,"Someone once said that one of the advantages of religion is that it offers security in return for obedience .
This point was not lost on the late Steve Jobs , the co - founder , saviour and high priest of Apple .
And it led Umberto Eco , in an essay published in the 1980s , to describe the Apple Mac as a Catholic machine , in contrast to the IBM PC , which Eco characterised as a Protestant device .
His reasoning was that the Mac freed its users / believers from the need to make decisions .
All they had to do to find salvation was to obey the Apple way .
All the important choices , including whether a mouse should have one button or two , had been made for them , whereas the poor wretches who had to use a PC had , like the Calvinists of yore , to make their own salvation : installing expansion cards , anti - virus software , wrestling with incompatible peripherals and so on .
Poor Steve has gone to the great computer lab in the sky , but the church he founded endures .
And it still knows what is best for its adherents .
Recently , the company launched the latest release of its OS X operating system , codenamed Mavericks .
What happened was this : one day , while millions of the devout were tapping industriously on their keyboards , a small dialogue box appeared on the top right - hand corner of their screens .
It informed them that important upgrades were available for their computers .
For members of the Apple communion , such a message has much the same status as a text from the Vatican would have for devout Catholics .
So they acted upon it .
And lo !
It came to pass that their computers were upgraded .
Many of them were then enjoined to update their copies of Apple 's iWork package â€ “ Pages ( Apple 's word processor ) ; Keynote ( the PowerPoint equivalent ) ; and Numbers ( the Excel competitor ) â€ “ and they dutifully complied .
At this point , the ordure hit the rotating blades .
For it turned out that these "" updates "" were not quite what the believers expected .
And they 're not all naive users .
For example , Lawrence Lessig , the celebrated Harvard professor and founder of Creative Commons , is one . ""
The latest version of Keynote , "" he blogged , "" breaks my slideshow ( eg the deck that produced my TED talk now wo n't work ) .
"" Given that Lessig is one of the best lecturers in the business , one can imagine why this would be a really big deal for him .
But there was worse to come â€ “ with his copy of Pages . ""
Right away , "" he writes , "" I confronted a truly insane ' upgrade ' : Apple has added an ability to automatically smartify quotes â€ “ as you type them at least .
But a functionality that used to exist â€ “ where you could search and replace single and double quotes and the replaced quote would be a smart quote â€ “ has been removed .
So now , the only way to smartify those
quotesâ€
¦ is to manually search for a single or double quote and then retype it .
I ca n't imagine this is a feature and not a bug . ""
Apple is like the Vatican in that it finds it very difficult to admit that it has screwed up .
( Just think of how it bungled the aftermath of the Maps fiasco . )
But this time it was sufficiently moved to offer , if not an apology , at least a grudging explanation .
"" These applications were rewritten from the ground up , "" it explained , "" to be fully 64-bit and to support a unified file format between OS X and iOS 7 versions . ""
In the rewriting , it continued , "" some features from iWork ' 09 were not available for the initial release .
We plan to reintroduce some of these features in the next few releases and will continue to add brand new features on an ongoing basis . ""
To which the obvious response is : "" OK , but why did n't you tell us this before encouraging us to upgrade ? ""
The second response is to ask why were n't the tech media on to it earlier ?
Given the remarkable expansion in the number of people using Apple computers , you would have thought that any disruption , intentional or otherwise , in the software ecosystems on which they depend for work would be regarded as news .
Serious , careful reviewing of changes in operating systems , for example , does n't require rocket science â€ “ just hard work and attention to detail , as in Pixel Envy 's review of iOS 7 .
But in general , technology sites and newspaper tech sections seem to be still obsessed with gadgets and novelties .
This was understandable 15 years ago but the world has moved on .
Breathless puffs for a new smartphone or yet another way of "" sharing "" photographs or movies do n't make up a useful signal any more
â€ “
they 're just noise ."
2013-11-28,"Launched on Friday in the UK and Australia , Sony 's PlayStation 4 is the final video game console to enter the fray in the current war for the space beneath our TV sets .
This sleek black system , engineered in Japan but designed by an American , Mark Cerny ( a game designer who cut his teeth at Atari around the time Apple 's founder Steve Jobs worked there ) , goes head to head with Microsoft 's Xbox One , which launched last week and sold a million units in 24 hours .
Both consoles are super - computers that can play Blu - Ray discs and the latest high - definition , online - enabled video games , as well as acting as conduits to a host of other music , film and televisual services .
In the Xbox One 's case , this includes a camera - enabled fitness program .
The battle to "" own "" our living rooms has been waged between the two tech giants since 2001 , when Microsoft entered the video game market with the first Xbox to compete against Sony 's PlayStation 2 .
Nintendo , with its enormously successful Wii ( and less successful follow - up , the Wii U ) , which emphasises gimmicks such as motion - control and a second screen over processing power , stepped out of the technological arms race that has defined the console business since the early 1980s , leaving Sony and Microsoft to duke it out this Christmas as they court older players , particularly men in their 20s and 30s .
It 's a high - stakes war .
Video games have been the most profitable medium across the entertainment industries for decades .
Even in the early 1990s Nintendo generated more annual profits than all the American film studios combined .
In 2012 , the traditional video game market boasted revenues of Â£35.5bn , excluding smartphone , tablet and Facebook games .
Since the first PlayStation launched in 1994 , Sony has sold approximately 350 m consoles â€ “ roughly equivalent to the total number of iPods sold by Apple up to the end of 2012 .
Culturally too , video games are slowly emerging from the shadow of the long - held view that theyare children 's playthings .
In August a New York Times article argued that , due to their ubiquity , "" these days , writing about video games feels more important than writing about politics "" .
The philosopher Slavoj Å½iÅ¾ek has a Call of Duty : Black Ops poster on his apartment wall , while novelists John Lanchester and Will Self have written about video games in the London Review of Books .
Mark DeLoura , the White House 's senior adviser for digital media , has held managerial positions at Sony and Nintendo , and advises Barack Obama on the potential role of games .
Despite this , the role of the traditional console is in question .
The stratospheric rise of smartphones and tablets has vastly broadened the audience of "" gamers "" , even if many do not see themselves that way .
Downloadable games such as Angry Birds and Minecraft , which can be played on mobile phones and basic PCs , are now a major part of the industry .
In April , Angry Birds ' developer , Rovio , estimated its games had been downloaded 1.7bn times .
Jack Tretton , the president of Sony Computer Entertainment America , has no fear the games console will decline .
He says he has managed to "" ride the ' last console ' "" wave for 27 years .
"" There 's a reason the console came about .
[ People like ] sitting in front of a big - screen TV on a couch with [ their ] friends . ""
Early sales figures support his claim .
PlayStation 4 's US launch was a resounding success : more than a million consoles were sold in its first week , a feat Sony hopes to repeat in Europe and Australia ."
2013-12-20,"In all the many interviews he has given recently , distracted by the need to engage with the substantive issue of why he is not currently the creative director of Yves Saint Laurent , Kanye West has n't talked much about Yeezus .
He has discussed some of the concepts therein : the idea , articulated in the song New Slaves , that rich black Americans of the modern age are still exploited by a white power structure ( one whose most pernicious behaviours , you are led to believe , occur in houses of haute couture ) ; or the belief that because West is Steve Jobs , Walt Disney and Bill Gates combined , it 's OK for him to rip off Billie Holliday 's Strange Fruit for a jam about disputed alimony .
Of the rest , not much has been said and , therefore , the role of Will Ferrell in Yeezus has passed largely unremarked .
Ferrell , playing Chazz Michael Michaels in Blades of Glory , is sampled halfway through Niggas in Paris , a song from West 's Watch the Throne project of 2011 and a track that closely matches the styles he would develop in Yeezus .
"" I do n't even know what that means ! ""
wails Chazz 's ice - dance partner as he is told they will only dance to My Humps by Black Eyed Peas in future .
"" Nobody knows what it means , "" replies Chazz , "" but it 's provocative , gets the people going . ""
That 's Yeezus in a nutshell .
While much discussion has been made of the West persona , both in public and on record , the most immediately provocative element of Yeezus is its sound .
In the very first second of opener On Sight , you are left alone in a field of distortion , a squelch of 303ish acid that rolls up and down a scale before settling into a loop of abrasive snarls .
That sets the tone for what follows .
There 's the whining , flared synthesisers of Send It Up , the distorted glam - rock stomp of Black Skinhead , and the neutered drone of
I 'm in It .
Most hip - hop and pop this year has had the club in its mind , all 4/4 rhythms and extended technicolour drops .
Yeezus was apparently conceived for a BDSM dungeon .

Listen to Yeezus on Spotify here
That is one of the ways in which his sixth solo album divided West 's public .
For some listeners , the sound is simply too unpleasant .
For others it 's a betrayal of the soul - infused style that made his name .
Even these responses acknowledge that Yeezus is difficult to ignore : once heard , it 's hardly forgotten .
When it comes to the lyrical content , meanwhile , people hear an egocentric fit played out on record , the undeserved pique of someone genuinely angry at the absence of his damn croissants .
Others hear lyrics full of grandstanding and aggression ( quite frequently sexual ) , a deadened desensitisation , and conclude they want no part .
That Yeezus might be a work of art deliberately designed to provoke such responses does n't seem to get much consideration .
"" Yeezus "" â€ “ as in the character doing the rapping â€
“ is a construct as much as any beat on the album .
It may be constructed from parts of West 's psyche , for sure , but it is also constructed by him .
Any conflation of the character with the man denies West the right to create art .
It also unwittingly drags listeners ( let 's face it , white ones ) into the very issues of black American identity that West is keen to discuss .
The grand provocations in Yeezus are matched , step for step , by its craftsmanship .
There are only 10 songs and each one , as deliberately discomfiting as it might be , contains the essential properties of a pop song .
This is not by accident and for those who could endure the style , or even enjoy it , there were powerful hooks and melodies to latch on to and emulate awkwardly while waiting for the bus
( try singing the tune to Send It Up without looking like a weasel drinking vinegar ) .
The process by which these songs were created is already the subject of a semi - mythology .
First West would solicit music from , it seems , all the world 's upcoming producers .
He 'd then strip them for parts , just as earlier hip - hop producers would mine funk seven - inches for samples .
These songs would be reconfigured , vocals added , perhaps â€ “ Frank Ocean might be good for 25 seconds at the end of a track â€ “ in the company of more renowned producers .
Their work was then further , finally revised by Rick Rubin in his cliffside retreat in California .
By that point the sound was so refined , so reduced , that it was like a classical French stock .
It was bouilla - bass .
If that pun is terrible , then it 's only fitting , because there are tonnes of similar efforts on Yeezus ( "" I 'm a rap - lic priest "" , he says on I 'm
In It
, "" I be speaking Swag - hili "" ) .
There 's also endless innuendo â€ “ "" Yeezus just rose again "" â€ “ and the odd wry confession : "" I slightly scratched your Corolla [ pause ] , OK I smashed your Corolla .
"" That is to say there 's a sense of humour in there and a love of wordplay , too .
In turn , that is matched by an attention to the key part of the rapper 's craft : twinning sound and meaning with meter to best effect .
The final verse of New Slaves , which rails against entrenched white privilege , is unsettling and incoherent but boy is it powerful , pulling you along on its staccato rhythms and emphatic repetitions .
All its provocations mean that Yeezus will never be as beloved by as many people as , say , The College Dropout .
But I have n't been able to stop thinking about it for six months .
I 've listened again and again , found new details , new jokes , new coinages that make me puzzle about the character who 's uttering them .
Yeezus is undoubtedly the work of one of the greatest creative minds working today .
The fact that he 's messing with you throughout only makes it more exhilarating ."
2013-12-20,"It says something about the kind of year Kanye West 's had that his claim to be "" the World 's No 1 Rock Star "" was relatively easy to miss .
What price a bit of self - aggrandisment no different from the claims of dozens of hopeless Britpoppers to be "" the best band in the world "" , when set next to the other stuff he 's said in 2013 ?
There was the interview with the New York Times , in which he announced that "" the world would win "" if only more people would "" respect my trendsetting abilities "" , then variously compared himself not merely to Gil Scott Heron and Miles Davis , but Le Corbusier , Steve Jobs , Walt Disney , Henry Ford , Nicolas Ghesquière ( the creative designer of Louis Vuitton ) , Anna Wintour and David Stern .
It was n't 100 % clear if by the latter he meant David Stern the artist , David Stern the commissioner of the National Basketball Association or indeed David E. Stern , voted the 22nd most influential rabbi in America by Newsweek magazine in 2011 , although given the tenor of the interview , you would n't bet against him meaning all three of them .
There was the interview with Radio 1 's Zane Lowe , which succeeded in making the normally irrepressible DJ sound like the voice of calmness and reason , as he gently suggested West might consider some formal training before moving into the field of architecture , the rapper 's self - proclaimed similarity to Gaudi notwithstanding .
West , meanwhile , proffered the intriguing notion that the only possible response to any of his creative endeavours in any field of the arts was to thank him "" for making civilisation better "" .
And then there was the interview on Eminem 's Sirius XM radio station in which he appeared to go completely bananas .
At one juncture , he yelled at the interviewer : "" I 'm standing back and telling you I AM WARHOL !
I AM THE NO 1 MOST IMPACTFUL ARTIST OF OUR GENERATION .
I AM SHAKESPEARE IN THE FLESH ! "" , but it was n't all as bashful and self - effacing as that .
Indeed , if we mentioned every one of Kanye West 's extravagant claims over the last 12 months , we 'd be here all day .
( We have n't even touched on the interview with Philadelphia 's Hot 107.9 , in which he appeared to suggest he was more important than President Barack Obama . )
Suffice to say that when a satirical website ran a spoof news story reporting that West had suggested he was "" the next Nelson Mandela "" , thousands of people , including one South African daily newspaper , took it seriously .
The parody just did n't seem that far - fetched , particularly if you took into account his line on Blood on the Leaves , a track from his most recent album Yeezus , that claimed he was a victim of "" apartheid "" because he 'd once been forced to seat his partner and a "" second - string "" girlfriend in different sections of a basketball arena ( "" the injustice of apartheid is nothing like separating one 's wife and mistress at a basketball game , "" offered the self - styled "" hip - hop Wikipedia "" rap genius , for the benefit of anyone tending to think West might have a point ) .

But when it comes to his claim to be the world 's No 1 rock star , it 's hard not to think that West might well have a point , assuming the ideal rock star is someone provocative , complex , remote , strange , fascinating , outrageous , unpredictable , infuriating , ridiculous and willing to push at their own musical boundaries .
It seems fairly safe to say it is – no one ever fell for the myth of a legendary rock star because they seemed so eminently sensible , conventional and grounded – and equally safe to say those kind of rock stars are in desperately short supply these days .
There have been lots of theories posited as to why , some more convincing than others : everything from a desire to avoid inflaming social media 's penchant for indignation and outrage , to a tendency by record companies to play it safe in an uncertain climate , to the rise of colleges and other institutions that try to teach people how to become pop stars , an area that was once wide open to the intuitive and autodidactic .
But whatever the reason , rock bands in particular seem to be getting gradually more anonymous : in the UK , the year 's big breakthrough guitar acts were Bastille , the Lumineers , the singer - songwriter Passenger and Imagine Dragons , none of whom are selling albums on the basis of their fathomless charisma and gripping unpredictability .
Kanye West , on the other hand , ticks all the boxes .
He 's certainly provocative , and not merely because he keeps bellowing at radio presenters about his manifold similarities to Shakespeare or Gaudi : the merchandise for his most recent tour was based around the racially - charged symbol of the Confederate flag .
He 's certainly pushing at his own musical boundaries : whatever you make of Yeezus ' lyrical content –
and it 's a doughty soul indeed who attempts to argue that it is n't , at the very least , hopelessly contradictory – in purely sonic terms
, it 's audibly the most radical and challenging album that any star of West 's commercial stature has made this year .
He 's got ridiculous grandiosity and a certain remoteness from everyday life down
pat : this is , after all , a man who proposed to his fiancé by hiring a 45,500-capacity sports stadium and a 50-piece orchestra , who appears on stage rapping from the top of a mountain and conducting a dialogue with a man dressed as Jesus .
( "" Oh shit !
I ca n't believe it ! ""
offered West when the messiah took the stage . )
And he is genuinely fascinating .
Attempts to explain his public behaviour in 2013 have ranged from , at one extreme , the suggestion that he 's having some kind of nervous breakdown to , at the other , the belief that he 's a maverick voice speaking truth to power about race and art .
Somewhere inbetween lie the theories that he 's either a brilliant manipulator of the media – he 's certainly omnipresent in the headlines – or a petulant little berk throwing a strop because fashionistas did n't like the leather jogging pants he designed .
And as anyone who 's watched Mick Jagger act or read Billy Corgan 's poetry or indeed seen the computer art of Ringo Starr will tell you , he 's not the first person to believe that selling a lot of records automatically confers upon you the status of polymath genius , but he 's certainly the most vociferous and unrelenting in his claims to that title .
But however tempting the urge to just dismiss West as a narcissistic crank or a nutcase , there 's something weirdly compelling about him , perhaps because there 's frequently a germ of truth to what he says , even if you have to delve through several leagues of demented - sounding solipsistic old cobblers to reach it .
It 's perhaps erring on the reckless side to claim , as West has done , that anyone who dares to suggest he might be a better rapper than a fashion designer is a bigot , or to demand a global boycott of Louis Vuitton products because the company 's vice - president declined to meet him ( maybe he just did n't fancy being subjected to a monologue about Kanye West 's similarities to a variety of legendary artists , film makers and designers ) , but
equally , it 's hard not to notice that there are virtually no black faces in the world of haute couture , other than on the catwalks .
There 's something faintly pathetic about his motivation for writing Yeezus '
I Am a God –
apparently he was cross because designer Hedi Slimane attempted to secure West 's exclusive presence at one of his shows –
but something intriguing about his point that if he 'd called the song I Am a Nigger
or I Am a Gangster
or I Am a Pimp
, no one would have flinched .
There may even be a tiny grain of truth to his constant claims of selflessness : "" I 'm doing this for you , "" he recently told one audience during one of his regular onstage rants ( or , as he prefers to have them described , "" motivational speeches "" ) .
It has to be said , it seems a little improbable that West is motivated by altruism , but there 's certainly a positive side - effect of his behavior for everyone else .
It would be as crazy as he sometimes appears to be to suggest West should be given an easy ride : what he says and does should be interrogated , argued over , mocked .
But we should understand that if he took his loudest detractors ' advice and just shut up , then the world of pop would immediately become a less interesting place , because , almost uniquely at the moment , Kanye West seems to have an innate understanding of what it takes to be a great rock star .
Long may he rant .
Or , rather , deliver "" motivational speeches "" .

2014-01-20,"Many 20 and 30-somethings ( if not those older and younger than that ) grew up hearing the advice that all you need to do in life is "" find your passion "" .
The implication is that if you "" do what you love "" ( in shorthand : DWYL ) , success â€ “ and presumably happiness and money
â€ “ would follow .
People like Apple 's Steve Jobs and Facebook 's Mark Zuckerberg were held up as examples ( if not gurus ) of this "" DWYL "" trend , alongside people who quit investment banking jobs to become cheese farmers , plumbers or yoga entrepreneurs .
But writer and art history scholar
Miya Tokumitsu argues that this romanticized notion of the working world is a dangerous fallacy .
It 's the modern - day equivalent of the emperor 's new clothes myth .
In a much shared commentary for Jacobin magazine ( later re - printed on Slate.com ) , Tokumitsu writes : DWYL is a secret handshake of the privileged and a worldview that disguises its elitism as noble self - betterment .
According to this way of thinking , labor is not something one does for compensation but is an act of love .
If profit does n't happen to follow , presumably it is because the worker 's passion and determination were insufficient .
Its real achievement is making workers believe their labor serves the self and not the marketplace .
She points out that the vast majority of jobs have no place in the DWYL world because they are "" done out of motives or needs other than love "" .
Most people do n't grow up wanting to clean up after others or work in low - end retail or fast food jobs .
The idea that everyone gets to choose what they want to do only applies to the wealthy .
She also notes that professions such as journalism and academia have eroded over time because people are supposed to accept lower and lower pay in return for being lucky enough to "" follow their passion "" .

2014-01-24,"When Steve Jobs launched the Mac 30 years ago today , I was already a user .
As editor of Practical Computing magazine , I 'd made the pilgrimage to Apple 's UK headquarters for a briefing , along with staff member Ian Stobie , and been "" seeded "" with its vision of the future .
One of the freebies was a deep blue T - shirt with a squiggly Mac drawing and a brilliant slogan : "" I 've seen the future of computing
but I 'm not allowed to talk about it .
"" This was n't strictly true .
The Mac was n't really a secret , and my loan machine sat happily in the living room through December 1983 .
To be honest , I was somewhat disappointed with the reaction .
Visitors regarded it as a curiosity , not an object of lust .
Even my art director friend Steve Kibble did n't seem enthusiastic , and I had him down as the prime market .
My main problem with that Mac was that it did n't do very much .
There were only two programs , MacWrite and MacPaint , MacWrite maxed out at writing a resume .
The Motorola 68000 processor was too slow , it had too little memory ( 128 K ) , one floppy , no hard drive , and a cramped 9 in monochrome screen .
Computer scientist Alan Kay famously described it as "" a Honda with a one - quart gas tank "" .
Worse , it was a sealed box .
Steve Jobs had the idea that a computer should be an appliance , like a washing machine .
Or a games console .
But in those days , buyers wanted computers they could adapt , expand and upgrade , like the Apple II and the IBM PC .
The Mac 's limitations were bad enough , but Apple had made it really hard to fix them .
Of course , the Mac did represent a real vision of the future of computing , and many of us expected graphical user interfaces to replace character - based computing .
But this idea was n't new to the Mac , or even to Apple .
The Xerox Alto and , later , Star had introduced it a decade earlier , and directly inspired both Steve Jobs and the Mac .
( Xerox got a deal in payment â€ “ 100,000 Apple shares at $ 10 each â€ “ and Apple also hired several of its staff . )
However , many other companies were working on similar systems .
Apple had already introduced the Lisa in January 1983 , and the Mac was just its little brother .
Personal Software had shown off its graphical VisiOn suite , and Microsoft had announced but not shipped Windows .
Digital Research was working on GEM ( Graphical Environment Manager ) , which appeared on the PC and Atari ST .
Commodore bought a small company that was developing a powerful colour system , the Amiga .
There were many more .
In fact , we had all seen the future of computing : we just did n't know which version would win .
Not many people were betting on the Mac .
Nonetheless , the Mac came in with a bang that still reverberates three decades later .
It was launched with a single showing of a TV commercial , 1984 , during the American Super Bowl XVIII .
This memorably portrayed brave little Apple saving the world from Big Brother â€ “ the giant IBM had controlled the data processing market for decades , and its IBM PC had rapidly taken over the microcomputer market .
This was followed up by saturation advertising in leading American magazines , and reviews from the numerous journalists "" seeded "" with pre - release Macs .
The result was that thousands of Macs flew off the shelves .
Although there were n't many programs , Steve Jobs got the leading software houses to promote the Mac , with personal appearances from Mitch Kapor of Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 fame and an enthusiastic Bill Gates .
Microsoft had been working closely with Apple and was developing Word and Excel for the new machine .
The future looked brightâ€ ¦
But while the Mac was exciting , it was very expensive for what it could actually do , and sales slumped .
Jobs 's sales forecasts and manufacturing plans were , to put it politely , hopelessly optimistic .
In the middle of 1985 , Apple closed three of its six factories , shed 20 % of its staff , and announced the first quarterly loss in its history .
In September , after a boardroom showdown , Jobs was fired from the company he had co - founded .
It could have been the end , but it was n't .
The Mac found a profitable niche thanks to its laser printer and Aldus 's PageMaker program , which created a new industry : desktop publishing .
Also , Jobs 's sealed Mac got redesigned into a standard , modular PC - style system with the Mac II in 1987 .
At last , Mac buyers had bays for hard drives , expansion slots , and support for colour screens .
Jobs 's strategy for the Mac was a mistake in 1984 , but it 's one he kept repeating with great success after his return to Apple .
Heavily publicised "" big bang "" launches for sealed appliance - style devices worked for the iMac , iPod , iPhone and iPad .
Although the Mac barely dented what was then IBM 's monopoly , its children have turned out spectacularly well ."

Her voice , effortless and earnest as ever , seems out of step when she 's sampling 50 Cent 's Candy Shop , referencing Macklemore and his thrift shop , or insisting that "" my colour is black , black , black "" .
Most curious is Portrait of the Knight of Wands ( "" His mission : the transmission of technology "" ) â€ “ a eulogy for Steve Jobs in ballad form ?"
2014-02-04,"Satya Nadella , Microsoft 's new CEO , looks like everything his predecessors Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates were not .
For one thing , as Microsoft 's lovingly crafted , iOS7-inspired , nearly devotional website to him shows , Nadella 's techie cool look is in marked contrast to the crumpled oxford shirts and dad jeans favored by both Ballmer and Gates .
In well - fitting hoodie , finely crafted t - shirt and suit jackets over chic jeans , Nadella 's image as presented by Microsoft shows him to be the Esquire - styled love child of Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs , with a touch of the finely tailored panache and shiny suits of JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon .
He inhabits a variety of modes : the lecturer , the thinker , the math geek in a hoodie in front of a chalkboard of formulas , the leader with a lightly clenched fist to show decisiveness and determination .
In a world where his overenthusiastic , bear - like predecessor Ballmer might have been described as Comic Sans , Nadella is a slim , cool , minimal Helvetica .
Nadella 's comments are pitch - perfect in light of that image : Our industry does not respect tradition .
It only respects innovation .
Nadella 's quirkiest aspect â€ “ quirky , at least , for the number - and - code - loving tech world â€ “ is his love of literature and , especially , poetry .
In his first memo , he paraphrases Oscar Wilde on the improbable and impossible .
He tries to help techies get a handle on poetry by comparing it to code : You 're trying to take something that can be described in many , many sentences and pages of prose , but you can convert it into a couple lines of poetry and you still get the essence , so it 's that compression .
Indeed , he says , the best code is poetry .
This , at least on the polished surface , is the man of innovation that Microsoft needs .
There 's only one problem : there 's nothing new about Nadella , and that may be a problem for his tenure .
He 's a 22-year veteran of Microsoft , and has been watching along as the company was put on probation by analysts and shareholders , particularly one influential firm named ValueAct that has been bird - dogging Microsoft for months .
It 's safe to say it was ValueAct 's exasperation with Microsoft 's slipping competitive rank that pressured Ballmer to step aside .
Nadella pleases ValueAct
â€ “ see this enthusiastic statement today
â€ “ which has been until now Microsoft 's biggest critic .
Analysts , too , say that Nadella is a fine and capable leader with technical knowledge of the company 's workings , and his chief financial officer , Amy Hood , is bright and can manage costs .
Employes , too , are likely to be grateful to avoid the upheaval an outsider would have brought , as MKM Partners analyst Israel Hernandez said last month when Nadella 's name was floated : "" We believe the hiring of an insider is also likely to have a positive impact on employee morale as an external hire would likely have contributed to a significant change in the corporate culture . ""
That pressure is why , to the harsh eye of Wall Street analysts and shareholders , Nadella will need to do more than look or even talk the part of the innovative maverick .
There is tension , however , for Nadella here .
Now at the helm of Microsoft 's new leadership , his job is to disrupt Microsoft 's old leadership , whom Wall Street sees as the people who brought the company to its current competitive lows .
Unfortunately , those are the same people â€ “ Bill Gates , Steve Ballmer and likely new chairman John Thompson â€ “ who put Nadella in his job .
Nadella is n't quite doing that yet .
He said in his first memo he expects to be working particularly closely with both Thompson and Gates : "" I 've asked Bill to devote additional time to the company , focused on technology and products .
I 'm also looking forward to working with John Thompson as our new Chairman of the Board . ""
This is not what Wall Street wants to hear , and it 's Wall Street â€ “ and its powerful pressure of the dollar â€ “ that has been the audience for Microsoft 's narrative so far .
Analysts wo n't be convinced that Nadella means change at Microsoft until he bites the hands that fed him the executive suite .
They want Nadella to get distance from his predecessors , not pull them closer .
Hernandez , of MKM , noted that Nadella will be judged on "" his ability to truly exercise change , "" including this question : "" will he break with Gates / Ballmer strategy "" ?
This pressure for a clean break with the old Microsoft strategy is a consistent theme among analysts and shareholders .
"" We do not want to see a continuation of the existing direction for the business , so it will be important that Mr Nadella be free to make changes , "" said Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund last week , calling for Nadella to "" effect change independent of the influence [ and ] constraints of previous management "" .
Sherlund specifically wanted Ballmer and Gates â€ “ or at least one of them â€ “ out of the picture .
"" We do not think having two previous CEOs on the Board to report to as he redirects the business is a good idea .
"" The story is the same for Thompson , in Sherlund 's eyes .
Shareholders such as ValueAct have a very specific prescription that would put Microsoft back in their good graces .
As Sherlund wrote last week : In our conversations with Mr Thompson , he has not appeared receptive to taking steps to enhance shareholder value through accelerated share repurchase , cost cutting and better focusing the business .
This could be disappointing for investors , and it could take time for ValueAct to change the dynamics on the Board to effect a change in thinking with regard to shareholder value .
Where does that leave Nadella ?
Possibly , at sea .
He has to come up with a new strategy while remaining embedded in the company 's old power structure .
Nadella 's to - do list , from Wall Street , is clear .
One is to cut operating costs by at least 10 % .
Another is to revitalize the limping consumer and hardware businesses that include Nokia , the Bing search engine and the XBox video game player ; as Deutsche Bank analyst Karl Keirstead pointed out last month , Microsoft will count on a whopping 12 % of its revenues from two underperforming pieces of hardware : the Surface tablet and recently acquired Nokia .
The focus on those two products , Kierstead argues , has been keeping Microsoft 's growth lower than it might be .
Microsoft has hardly felt the wrath of Wall Street yet ; even with all the doom and pressure , the company 's stock rose an impressive 40 % in 2013 .
That rise , however , is largely because Microsoft became a spectacle as investors bought the stock in hopes that the entire company might change its direction .
That is Nadella 's job .
Microsoft 's loss of its competitive position under Ballmer may have been misfortune ; if the company loses its grip even further under a second CEO it would â€ “ to paraphrase Nadella 's admired author Oscar Wilde â€ “ look like carelessness ."
2014-02-13,"Steve Jobsâ€ ™ lost time capsule was found in Colorado , 13 years after it was meant to have been dug up , containing a his personal computer mouse from an Apple Lisa .
The time capsule was put in the ground at the Aspen International Design Conference in 1983 , and contained dozens of other items from the era .
It became known as Steve Jobs Time Capsule after he gave a speech foreshadowing the development of wireless technology , the iPad and the App Store at the conference and put his own mouse in the historic pod .
Lost for 30 years The historic vessel was meant to have been dug up in 2000 , but a major landscaping project in the Aspen area caused the organisers to lose the position of the time capsule until last year .
A National Geographic television programme called Diggers was able to locate the capsule last September , only now releasing a video of the discovery and what was inside ahead of the showâ€ ™ s debut on 25 February .
Sealed in a protective plastic bag , the simple one - button mouse from Appleâ€ ™ s Lisa computer , which was a commercial failure .
The Lisa eventually evolved into the first Macintosh computer released in 1984 .

Now they 're poised to do the same for the another major technology company of the contemporary era :
Apple , and its founder Steve Jobs .
Variety reports that Fincher is in talks to direct the as - yet untitled drama , written by Sorkin as an adaptation of the official Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson .
Sorkin revealed in 2012 that he envisaged an unusual structure for the film : three single - take scenes , each one following a major Apple product launch . ""
This entire movie is going to be three scenes and three scenes only .
That all take place in real time , "" he told The Daily Beast .
There has already been one movie about Jobs following the Apple founder 's death in 2011 , simply titled Jobs , starring Ashton Kutcher .
It is more of a traditional biopic , charting Jobs ' turbulent history with the company he founded .
It has grossed a fairly modest $ 35 m at the global box office , and is yet to be released in the UK .
Fincher 's latest film , an adaptation of the bestselling novel Gone Girl , will be released in October , and he 's also signed on to executive produce and direct an episode of the US remake of Channel 4 's acclaimed drama Utopia .

2014-03-10,"Haunted Empire : Apple
After Steve Jobs is a terrific book title .
Pity the book doesnâ€ ™ t live up to it .
Or , indeed , provide us with any clear indication of whether the company best known for its iPhones and iPads ( letâ€ ™ s call it an â€œempireâ€ � for convenience ) is indeed haunted .
Iâ€ ™ d really like to know whether rank and file employees at Appleâ€ ™ s Cupertino headquarters constantly look over their shoulder , troubled by the question of whether â€œSteve wouldâ€ � ( or wouldnâ€ ™ t ) â€œhave done thatâ€ � .
Reading the authorâ€ ™
s note that leads the book , you expect the answer to be a shoo - in .
Yukari Iwatani Kane is a former Wall Street Journal reporter ( an imprimatur that demands precision in facts ) , who covered Apple from about 2011 for that paper .
Sheâ€ ™ s quick to point out that â€œalthough I had access to the companyâ€ ™ s media events and some of its executives during my reporting for the newspaper , Apple chose not to grant any further access apart from one shareholdersâ€ ™ meeting.â€ �
Presumably , thatâ€ ™ s
â€œfurther
accessâ€ � sought because she was writing a book .
Reality check :
Apple doesnâ€ ™ t give special access to anyone , unless theyâ€ ™ re writing Steve Jobsâ€ ™ s biography .
And that chance has gone .
But fear not , says Kane :
â€œEven so , I was able to draw from more than two hundreds interviews with nearly two hundred sources who have firsthand knowledge of Appleâ€ ™ s world in the United States , Europe and Asia .
They include Apple executives and employees - past and present ...
â€ �
At this , the reader perks up : surely weâ€ ™ re going to hear about whether the empire that Steve Jobs built is , you know , haunted ?
Certainly that â€œ200 interviewsâ€
� figure sounds impressive .
In 2011 I wrote â€œDigital Warsâ€ � ( published 2012 , second edition - updated to February 2014 - imminent ) contrasting how Apple , Microsoft and Googleâ€ ™ s management and development style had helped or hindered their progress in search , digital music , smartphones , tablets and ( in the new edition ) China .
I havenâ€
™ t tried to count up how many interviews I carried out over the years leading up to it .
It might be 200 .
It might be less .
Iâ€ ™ d never try to do a headcount , though .
Doing so seems distinctly strange , to be honest ; itâ€ ™ s as though the writer is nudging us to put our faith into the sheer number .
Never mind the quality , feel the width .
Can you keep a secret ?
Apple is
- letâ€ ™ s be clear - a difficult company to report on .
Far more so than any other , it has a cult of secrecy , not only about when and what new or updated products it will launch , but also about its workings and internal interactions ; you donâ€ ™ t get documentaries taking you around Jonathan
Iveâ€ ™ s design labs .
Apple cultivates mystique , and prefers to let its devices do the talking .
Thatâ€ ™ s also why thereâ€ ™ s a ready market for books which try to lift the lid on what does go on there .
For which , Iâ€ ™ d definitely recommend a short but highly worthwhile ebook , â€œDesign Crazyâ€ � by Max Chafkin , which is entirely made up of interviews with former Apple staff and observers ( perhaps as many as 200
- I didnâ€
™ t count ) and explaining how the company designs products , the fights that has sometimes caused , and how they are resolved .
It will tell you far more about Apple as it was and is than Kaneâ€ ™ s book .
Also helpful is â€œJony Iveâ€ � by Leander Kahney - though I found it a little too admiring where Chafkinâ€ ™ s is astringent .
The problem is this : Steve Jobs was a compelling figure .
There was nobody quite like him in technology because he had had the success ( with Apple in its early days ) and the failure ( with NeXT , his next startup ) , and returned to make Apple a success again , pulling it back by its shirttails as it teetered on the cliff of bankruptcy ( from which it was only 90 days away in 1996 when he rejoined ) .
He could spin plausible lines , and near - enough lies , and enthuse people into believing him .
As a manager , he was by all accounts ruthless , charming and terrifying .
His death has highlighted how none of the Apple executives quite has his ability to hold a stage and spin a story .
This much is known .
Tim Cook , picked by Jobs , often looks ill at ease on stage .
Heâ€ ™ s regarded as a numbers guy , the man who helped pull Apple out of that nosedive in the late 1990s ( he joined in 1998 ) and since then has grown it to be the only other company besides the gigantic conglomerate Samsung which can turn out more than 50 m smartphones for sale in a single three - month period .
I read this book hoping to get a clearer picture of Cook .
But as with many areas , the books fails to give that .
We are treated to some quite routine biography about his upbringing in Alabama , from which we learn nothing useful save that he thinks you get ahead through hard work ( Iâ€ ™ m guessing at least 10 interviews were spent on that ) .
Heâ€ ™ s tough on other executives and on suppliers .
Well , yes .
I also found it puzzling that so much of the book - about the first 90 pages of a 338-pager - were about the with - Jobs Apple , even including those 1990s escapades .
Isnâ€ ™ t this well - known ?
Perhaps not , but while it offered a couple of little nuggets , it noticeably lacked insight into the design process , or indeed any process inside the company .
What happened to the narrative ?
Once Jobs dies , though , things fall apart .
Not Apple - the book .
( In passing , could I say that I really detest the use of the word â€œpassingâ€ � for â€œdeathâ€ � ?
It just sounds mimsy , as though the writer is worried about upsetting an audience of maiden aunts .
People die .
Itâ€ ™ s death .
Itâ€ ™ s natural . )
Thereâ€
™ s no clear narrative structure ; no portrait is painted .
Kane jumps about all over the shop .
Jobs dies , and we go to China , where Appleâ€ ™ s â€œsupply chainâ€ � which assembles iDevices mostly lies .
Then weâ€ ™ re at Buckingham Palace and learning a little more about Jonathan I ve , the head of design , a linchpin in the company .
Then weâ€ ™ re pondering whether Siri , Appleâ€ ™ s voice - driven â€œassistantâ€ � , is a flop or a flier , and if so ( either way ) whose responsibility that was .
Hereâ€ ™ s the problem with the latter chapter , which is quite typical of many :
the acquisition of the Siri technology happened while Jobs was alive .
Did he OK that acquisition ?
He certainly used it before he died , though the phone using it hadnâ€ ™ t been released .
So ... are Siriâ€ ™ s limitations down to Jobs ?
Or not ?
Those 200 interviews provide no answer - though there is the tantalising nugget that the team behind Siri has an entire backstory worked out for it , which can in theory be teased out by asking the right questions .
With Siri sort - of done , we jump - for no apparent reason - to Appleâ€ ™ s patent battle with Samsung , which spilled over into courtrooms .
Here , I feel Kane shows a lack of insight into the subtle complications of patents ( theyâ€ ™ re not all born equal ; and Apple canâ€ ™ t sue Google over features in the Android software , but can sue companies which sell physical things that embody Android software ) .
Again she doesnâ€ ™ t answer how strongly
Appleâ€ ™ s executives post - Jobs feel about the whole patent thing .
My impression , having talked to them since Jobsâ€ ™ s death , is that theyâ€ ™ re just as determined to pursue the cases .
People outside Apple may view that as quixotic , but inside they clearly donâ€ ™ t .
You wouldnâ€ ™ t discover that from the book , though .
Disrupt thisThen we jump ( why ? ) to Clayton Christensen , the high priest of disruption theory .
This chapter immediately undermines itself by quoting Chistensen from 2007 saying that the iPhone would fail .
Remind us - how did that play out again ?
Kane , however , tries to shore up her intervieweeâ€ ™ s position by saying that by 2013 â€œhe was starting to look prescient as Appleâ€ ™ s iPhone and iPad began to steadily lose market share to Android smartphones and tablets.â€ �
At this , my teeth began to grind .
So six years on , Christensen had been vindicated in his prediction ( quoted in the chapter ) that â€œthe existing players in the industry are heavily motivated to beat [ the iPhone]â€
� ?
Nonsense .
Android phones werenâ€ ™ t on sale when the iPhone arrived .
Apple and Android , have swept away all the mobile OSs that existed then , and many of the companies that sold them :
Nokia has dwindled , BlackBerry is on life support , Palm is gone , Windows Mobile is dead , and no mobile OS introduced since 2009 has had any significant impact on the market .
Thereâ€ ™ s iOS , and thereâ€ ™ s
Android , which looks and feels a lot like iOS , because the Android engineers in 2007 who were building a BlackBerry - alike watched Steve Jobs unveil the iPhone and realised they needed to change course damn fast , and - to their vast credit - did .
And â€œmarket shareâ€ � ?
The trouble with that metric is that it overlooks two things : whoâ€ ™ s earning the profits ( and so who can afford to stay in the market ) , and whether the company whose market share is being eroded might perhaps be doing better , year - on - year , than before because the overall market is expanding .
Iâ€ ™ ve written at length on why â€œmarket shareâ€ � is a crude , often misleading metric .
Apple is selling more phones annually , and gaining in overall mobile market share - but itâ€ ™ s losing smartphone market share because the smartphone market is growing .
Apple has however got a giant chunk of mobile profits , so it can keep expanding while companies like HTC , Sony , LG and Motorola nurse losses and struggle .
The same holds in tablets : Apple truly doesnâ€ ™ t care if a zillion $ 50 tablets are sold .
It just wonâ€
™ t compete for the wafer - thin profits ( if any ) at that price .
Itâ€ ™ ll stick with selling fewer tablets for more profit to people who want a premium device .
If thatâ€ ™ s a company in trouble - well , weâ€ ™ d all like that problem .
But if you donâ€ ™ t understand that Apple doesnâ€ ™ t care about market share in that way , you donâ€
™ t understand Apple at all .
From Christensen weâ€ ™ re off to China , again for no discernible reason - it tells us nothing about how Appleâ€ ™ s executives and staff think about how their roles might have changed since Jobsâ€ ™ s death - and then to a dull recap of the Apple - Samsung trial of summer 2012 ( lawyersâ€ ™ court arguments donâ€ ™ t make good reading ; theyâ€ ™ re just posturing ) and then to the launch of the iPhone 5 in September 2012 .
Busted flush ?
By this time , Kane has pretty much decided that because Appleâ€ ™ s current lineup doesnâ€ ™ t contain Steve Jobs , that itâ€ ™ s a busted flush .
Unveiling the iPhone 5 in 2012 , Cook is wooden on stage .
Schillerâ€ ™ s touting of its larger screen ( compared to previous iPhones ) was - apparently - a jab at Samsungâ€ ™ s
Galaxy Note .
I missed that reference myself , though I was watching the same presentation .
And â€œ[Schillerâ€ ™ s ] remark signalled Appleâ€ ™
s increasing vulnerabilityâ€ � .
Huh ?
The iPhone 5 sold more than any previous iPhone .
Vulnerability to what ?
I found the bizarre attribution of meaning to events which didnâ€ ™ t seem to have meaning more and more intrusive .
I also found it incongruous to have an American journalist from the WSJ offering her own interpretations ; I thought it was an article of faith in that trade to get someone else to express your opinions - just choose carefully so theyâ€ ™ re the ones you wanted to express anyway .
But hardly any experts are quoted in the whole book ; a pity , as they could have provided a narrative framework .
More to the point , didnâ€ ™ t any of Kaneâ€ ™ s
200 interviewees or her time on the WSJ team reporting on Apple uncover anything about the tension inside the company about the iPhone 5 ?
It simultaneously changed the screen size and dumped the 30-pin connector it had used since 2003 , replacing it with a thinner 8-pin one that was incompatible with hundreds of millions of third - party boom boxes .
For third - party developers , it meant rewriting their apps just to fit the iPhone 5 screen , which was longer but not wider .
For makers of music players , it meant redesigns and inventory headaches .
Would Steve Jobs have done that ?
Post - Jobs Apple did , with the same lack of compunction with which Jobs used to hand out mandates .
Does that mean itâ€ ™ s haunted by the spirit of Jobs ( would he had done it ) ?
Or not ?
After the skirmish with the iPhone 5 comes the disaster of the Apple Maps launch .
But here again , thereâ€
™ s none of the background of the vicious manoeuvring between Apple and Google that led to Apple kicking Google off the iPhone 5 for both video and maps .
A giant failing of this book is its focus only on Apple .
You simply canâ€ ™ t write about its position without also writing about Google and Microsoft and their ambitions , at the very least .
Their strategies are so interlocked , with each feinting while also trying to move to places the other wants to reach , that any examination of them in isolation is a map without landmarks .
Nor is there any insight into what people thought inside Apple about the maps debacle .
Would it have â€œnever happened with Steveâ€ � ?
Or was it because of his Google - hatinâ€ ™ ways ?
( Neither , actually .
Jobs would have done what Cook did :
OKâ€ ™
d it , apologised for the mess , and fired and torn strips off people internally .
Jobs did just that on other failures . )
Interpret
this Kane also falls prey to simplistic interpretation , thinking that because Google offered a maps app for the iPhone , that it would be a hit .
That overlooks the power of defaults .
( Google Maps is now hardly used on the iPhone compared to Apple Maps . )
You have to understand how people use technology to give your readers context .
The book lumbers on , through a riot in China ( I had no idea what the point of the chapter was ) , to a chapter on the talkative foreman of the Samsung - Apple trial post - verdict and how Appleâ€ ™ s win wasnâ€ ™ t much of a win at all , to one called â€œCritical Massâ€ � which isnâ€ ™ t really about anything specific , to â€œHoly Grailâ€ � which is actually about Appleâ€ ™ s taxes ( yet again omits the unholy row going on in other countries over lots of US companiesâ€ ™ taxes ) and then diverts into the antitrust decision over Appleâ€ ™ s attempts to get book publishers to go with its pricing model for ebooks on the iPad .
Whatâ€ ™ s the inclusion of the latter subject trying to show ?
Kaneâ€ ™ s overarching thesis is that without Steve Jobs , Apple is doomed to a downward spiral as innovation and staff leak out .
( No information is offered on the latter , not even from the job site Glassdoor.com , but hey ho . )
The ebooks decision though largely grew from Jobsâ€ ™ s intrusions into the negotiations - one of his draft emails was a crucial piece of prosecution evidence .
So should we conclude that post - Jobs , Apple wonâ€ ™ t make stupid antitrust - breaching decisions ?
Or is it that his acts hang over the company like a pall - in which case , wouldnâ€ ™ t staff welcome moving on to new ground ?
Kane seems to want it both ways .
Everything Jobs did was wonderful , except the stuff that left Apple screwed when it tried to do anything else .
This , though , rests on the concept of the Immaculate Jobs , which anyone whoâ€ ™ s covered Apple for any time will tell you is bunk .
Tons of mistakes happened under his watch ; and he could be as shortsighted as anyone , the two biggest examples being that he didnâ€ ™ t want third - party apps on the iPhone , and he didnâ€ ™ t want the iPod to work on Windows .
If heâ€ ™ d prevailed , he would have sunk the company .
By this stage of the book ( page 307 ) I was reading through whatever the visual equivalent of gritted teeth is .
â€œThe
Red Chairâ€ � details , excruciatingly , Tim Cookâ€ ™ s
hey - heâ€ ™ s - not - as - cool - as - Steve - Jobs appearance at the All Things D conference in May 2013 .
Kane clearly thinks he did poorly by not leaping to his feet and announcing a new iThing , or giving the crowd some ole Southern charm like a Bill Clinton of technology .
Cook basically didnâ€ ™ t have a lot to tell people , because Apple wasnâ€ ™ t going to release a new product category in 2013 .
Cook did offer a head fake by talking about how â€œwearablesâ€ � are â€œinterestingâ€ � ( perhaps thus driving Samsung to hurriedly release its critically panned Galaxy Gear â€œsmartwatchâ€ � ) .
Roiling in the deep
She then heads to the June 2013 Worldwide Developers Conference ( WWDC ) in San Francisco , where apparently â€œApple was revealing its true nature : the endless self - congratulation , the perpetual breeziness so obviously straining to respond to roiling doubts.â€
�
Apple hardly has a monopoly on self - congratulatory breeziness in Silicon Valley - have you read a blogpost from Yahoo , Google or pretty much any startup recently ?
- but from where I sat in the media pen of the same audience ,
I didnâ€
™ t feel a fog of roiling doubts overhead .
Apple is a bit like the weather : it doesnâ€ ™ t work by other peoplesâ€ ™ timetables .
It just does stuff when itâ€ ™ s ready .
Having written about all three of Apple , Microsoft and Google since the 1990s , I know that each has its own rhythms for releasing stuff .
In Googleâ€ ™ s case , itâ€ ™ s pretty much no rhythm ; stuff just bursts out when someone hits a button .
Microsoft moves in a lockstep .
And Apple fiddles with it until itâ€ ™ s done .
But for someone with a thesis and a book deadline , thatâ€ ™ s not enough .
One could play â€œwhat if?â€ � - what if Apple had launched a wearable something or a new set - top box last April ?
Would that have exorcised the ghost that Kane seems sure haunts the corridors of 1 Infinite Loop ?
I suspect not .
After all , any new Apple product launch is met by derision - the iPod was too pricey and had too little storage , the iPhone was an overpriced gewgaw from a company new to mobile , the iPad was just a big iPod Touch .
No doubt the next iThing will attract much the same derision from plenty of outlets , but the real test - how it gets used , and by how many people , and whether itâ€ ™ s profitable enough to continue with - wonâ€ ™ t be known for some time .
But someone who needs a quick hit saying that Appleâ€ ™ s well has run dry will find plenty of material .
Kane manages this with the bookâ€
™ s epilogue , which mentions the iPhone 5S with its fingerprint sensor in a single line .
Apparently a new feature that loads of people use and which enhances their security ( most phone users donâ€ ™ t use passcodes ) and which comes from a company ( Authentec ) bought after Steve Jobs died , well , thatâ€ ™ s not interesting .
But the lower - priced iPhone 5C and its failure to mimic hot cakes sales - wise in its first month ?
Now youâ€ ™ ve got something doomy to write about !
( Sales of the 5C have picked up since the new year , following price cuts .
Youâ€ ™
d almost think Apple had some sort of strategy there rather than doing this stuff randomly . )
The â€œgold iPhoneâ€ � is compared unfavourably to blue - sky research from Google on understanding death , which was enthusiastically hyped up by tech bloggers .
Only one of those two things , though , is on sale now ; the other might never happen .
Google kills a lot of projects , in case people had forgotten .
Do you prefer your innovation in the palm of your hand , or in an uncertain future ?
Ultimately , I was unsatisfied by this book .
Still , as I say , itâ€ ™ s a great title .
Iâ€ ™
d still like to know whether staff at Apple rue the day , and wish olâ€ ™ Steve was still there - or if they just shrug and say â€œyeah , got stuff to do right
nowâ€ � and move on .
Trouble is , this book wonâ€ ™ t tell you .
Perhaps someone else will one day .

2014-03-21,"Christian Bale is in line to play Steve Jobs in the forthcoming biopic to be directed by David Fincher and written by Aaron Sorkin , reports the Wrap .
Bale , recently Oscar nominated for American Hustle , is Fincher 's first choice for the role in a film seen very much as a companion - piece to the Fincher - Sorkin tech - study The Social Network .
According to the Wrap , Fincher made it a condition of his accepting the task of directing the film that producing studio Sony secure Bale for the lead .
Studio co - chair Amy Pascal previously worked with Fincher on The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and is believed to be happy to go along with his demand .
The long - gestating project will take a different approach to its subject than that of The Social Network : Sorkin suggested in 2012 that it will revolve around three long scenes , each dealing with a different product launch .
The poor performance of the recent film Jobs , a biopic of the Apple co - founder starring Ashton Kutcher , does not appear to have dented confidence in this one .
Bale , who has just finished work on Ridley Scott 's biblical epic Exodus , has not yet been formally approached to play Jobs ."
2014-03-26,"Steve Jobs gave the original iPhone engineers just two weeks to provide a "" software vision "" for the company in February 2005 , threatening to hand the work over to another group inside Apple , according to a former engineer with the company .
Speaking to the Wall Street Journal , Greg Christie - who is still in charge of Apple 's user interface team - said that he was working for former iPhone software chief Scott Forstall , who recruited him to the top - secret team in late 2004 for a project codenamed "" purple "" which was to become the iPhone .
The revelation appears to be part of a publicity push by Apple before a patent trial in California with rival smartphone firm Samsung which begins on Monday .
Apple is asserting a number of software - based patents against four smartphones and tablets from the Korean company .
Among the patents Apple is asserting is the "" slide to unlock "" system introduced on the iPhone - which Christie says his "" shockingly small "" team devised early in 2005 .
It is also suing Samsung over patents relating to "" unified search "" , autocompletion of typing and data synchronisation .
In 2004 , Apple did not have any touchscreen products ; it was still selling iPods which used spinning hard drives .
The solid - state iPod nano was more than a year away , and Apple did not offer an iPod able to play video .
But Christie says Jobs "" wanted bigger ideas and bigger concepts "" .
Can touch this Christie says that even in 2004 the idea of Apple 's product was clear - to have a touchscreen handset which incorporated music - playing functions .
He says that the team "" banged their head against the wall "" in determining basic behaviour such as the ideal speed for list scrolling and how to get the right feel for the "" bounce "" when the end of the list was reached .
Apple has sued companies including HTC for infringement of the "" bounceback "" behaviour , which it has patented .
He says that besides the "" bounceback "" and list scrolling system , the team also devised the method by which an address book contact could be used to make a call , and the touch - operated music player system .
Samsung is countersuing , saying Apple has infringed two of its patents .
None of the patents at issue is classed as "" standards - essential "" , which the holder would be obliged to license to a willing counterparty .
Christie says that the team continued giving fortnightly presentations to Jobs for months as the software progressed , but that design chief Jonathan I ve - who was designing the physical phone , which the team did not see - was n't shown the software until Jobs himself was satisfied with it .
Apple staff who were working on the iPhone designs at home had to use "" secluded "" rooms and encrypt their work .
A separate account by Fred Vogelstein in the book "" Dogfight "" has described how the iPhone team worked almost continually on the iPhone software through the second half of 2006 , and that even when Steve Jobs showed the device off in January 2007 his presentation had to be carefully planned with a "" golden path "" of screens and functions in case so that it would n't crash due to the numerous bugs in what was still incomplete software .
Even after that demonstration , Christie 's team removed a split - screen view for email showing the sender and the message because Jobs thought it was "" foolish "" - though the idea was revived for email on the larger - screen iPad .
Apple and Samsung now dominate the smartphone market , with Apple having sold an estimated 500 m iPhones since its release in June 2007 .
Clinical trial
The trial will once more pit the two biggest and most profitable smartphone companies against each other .
In summer 2012 Apple sued Samsung in California and won damages of $ 930 m for infringement by Samsung of a number of software and "" design "" patents .
The battle between the two companies has been fought through the press as much as in court .
Ahead of the 2013 launch of Samsung 's then - new Galaxy S4 flagship phone , Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller gave an interview to Reuters in which he said that it would ship with Android software that was nearly a year old , and queried Android users ' engagement with their phones , saying "" it 's not just enough to have products pumped out in large numbers .
You have to love and use them . ""
Samsung separately angered the judge in the 2012 trial by issuing a press release on the first day of the trial , after being denied permission to enter evidence which it said "" would have established beyond doubt "" that Samsung did not copy the iPhone 's design , with links to websites showing the evidence that it said showed Apple was influenced by Sony designs .
The judge threatened to sanction Samsung 's lawyers over the release , but took no action after the jurors said they have not read it .
Christie joined Apple in 1996 to work on its ill - fated Newton personal digital assistant .
Apple is now suing Samsung alleging infringement of its patents by four key products - its Galaxy S3 smartphone , Galaxy Note "" phablet "" and Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet .
Unlike the previous trial , Apple is not asserting any "" design "" patents relating to the physical appearance of the products ; instead it is focusing on the way that the software behaves .
â€¢ Apple ' in talks with Comcast ' over special treatment for streaming TV"
2014-04-15,"David Fincher has left a high - profile biopic of the late Apple founder Steve Jobs after Sony Pictures turned down Fincher 's alleged "" aggressive "" demands for $ 10 m ( Â£5.9 m ) in up - front wages and control of the marketing of the movie , according to the Hollywood Reporter .
Fincher was named as a frontrunner to direct the as - yet untitled drama , which has been adapted by Aaron Sorkin from an official Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson .
Sorkin and Fincher had worked together on the Oscar - winning 2010 biopic The Social Network , about the founding of Facebook .
A source with ties to the studio told the Hollywood Reporter , Fincher was not entirely out of the running , but labelled his wage demands "" ridiculous "" .
The source said : "" You 're not doing Transformers here .
You 're not doing Captain America .
This is quality â€ “
it 's not screaming commerciality .
He should be rewarded in success , but not up front . ""
The Social Network took a decent $ 225 m ( Â£138 m ) worldwide in 2010 and won Sorkin an Oscar for best adapted screenplay .
Fincher 's followup , an English - language adaptation of Stieg Larsson 's bestselling crime novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo , was expected to have even greater commercial appeal , but ultimately scraped in $ 235 m ( Â£140.7 m ) .
A sequel has not yet been confirmed .
It is unusual for details of a director 's wage demands to emerge , though reports of actors ' pay cheques are occasionally revealed .
In other news about the film , Fincher had wanted Christian Bale to play Jobs .
Sorkin , who remains on board as screenwriter , said he envisaged an unusual structure for the biopic : three single - take scenes , each one following a major Apple product launch .
There has already been one movie about the Apple founder following his death in 2011 .
Starring Ashton Kutcher and titled simply Jobs , the traditional biopic charted the technology guru 's turbulent history with Apple .
It grossed a modest $ 35 m at the global box office last year .
Sony is currently tightening its belts following disappointing results for its film division .
The company said in November that it was considering a shift towards television and would be reducing its forthcoming film slate , with at least $ 250 m ( Â£149.7 m ) in cuts expected before 2016 .

2014-04-16,"Witnesses at an upcoming trial over no - hire agreements in Silicon Valley should not be allowed to offer evidence that Apple co - founder Steve Jobs was "" a bully "" , four major technology companies argued in a court filing .
Technology workers filed a class action lawsuit against Apple , Google , Intel and Adobe Systems in 2011 , alleging they conspired to avoid competing for each other 's employees in order to avert a salary war .
The trial is scheduled to begin at the end of May on behalf of roughly 60,000 workers in the class , and defendants say damages could exceed $ 9bn .
The case , which is being closely watched in Silicon Valley , is largely built on emails sent between top executives , including Apple 's late chief executive Steve Jobs and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt , who is now the search company 's executive chairman .
When one Google recruiter solicited an Apple employee , Schmidt told Jobs that the recruiter would be fired , court documents show .
Jobs then forwarded Schmidt 's note to a top Apple human resources executive with a smiley face .
In a joint court filing late last week , the companies told US District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose , California that they were not seeking to bar Jobs ' interactions with other witnesses about the no - hire agreements .
However , opinions based on other evidence , such as Walter Isaacson 's bestselling biography about Jobs , should be kept out of trial , they argued .
An attorney for the plaintiffs could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday , nor could a representative for Apple .
Representatives for Google , Intel and Adobe declined to comment .
"" Plaintiffs ' only purpose for offering this testimony would be improper - to cast Mr. Jobs in a bad light , "" the companies said in the filing , adding that such evidence has no bearing on whether any defendant entered into an illegal conspiracy . ""
Free - floating character assassination is improper , "" they wrote .
Apple , Google , Adobe and Intel agreed to settle a US Department of Justice probe in 2010 that barred them from entering into such no - hire agreements in the future .
The four companies have since been fighting the civil antitrust class action , arguing that the plaintiffs can not successfully prove an overarching conspiracy to impact wages .
In addition to evidence about Jobs ' character , the tech companies also asked Koh to prohibit discussion of the government probe at trial . ""
To admit evidence of the DOJ investigation for any purpose would be unduly prejudicial , "" they wrote in the filing , "" because the jury might incorrectly assume defendants have admitted to or been found guilty of antitrust violations . ""
At a hearing last month , attorneys for Google and the plaintiffs said they were "" making progress "" in settlement talks with the government .
Walt Disney 's Lucasfilm and Pixar - previously headed by Jobs - and the software company Intuit have already agreed to a settlement , with Disney paying about $ 9 m and Intuit paying $ 11 m .
A hearing on final settlement approval is scheduled for 1 May.
â€¢ Steve Jobs :
The Exclusive Biography by Walter Isaacson â€ “ review"
2014-04-22,"A dream team of actor Leonardo DiCaprio and director Danny Boyle are in line to take over the high - profile biopic of pioneering tech entrepreneur Steve Jobs after The Social Network 's David Fincher relinquished the reins .
The Hollywood Reporter suggests that producers have begun courting Trance director Boyle for the film , scripted by Aaron Sorkin , with the prospect of allowing him to sign DiCaprio as the lead .
Fincher , who reportedly left the project in a dispute over salary demands and creative control , had made Christian Bale his "" first choice "" for the role , but that would no longer appear to be on the cards .
Boyle previously worked with DiCaprio on The Beach , and therefore would be in a good position to secure the actor .
However , days ago DiCaprio committed to Alejandro GonzÃ¡lez
IÃ±Ã¡rritu 's revenge thriller
The Revenant as his next film , meaning that a quick start date for a Jobs film could be unlikely if he did take the role ."
2014-04-23,"Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi , which outsold Samsung and Apple in its domestic market at Christmas , is expanding to 10 new countries as it races larger rivals to flood emerging economies with low - cost gadgets .
Founded just four years ago by Lei Jun , a digital entrepreneur known as the Chinese Steve Jobs for his showmanship and penchant for wearing jeans on stage ,
Xiaomi will begin exporting phones to countries including Brazil , Russia , India , Turkey and Mexico this year .
In December , Xiaomi outsold even Samsung in China , according to research firm Kantar , and it is now planning to take the battle abroad as the cost of parts needed to build high - end smartphones continues to drop .
The falling cost of mobile computing pushed down the share price of British chip designer ARM Holdings nearly 3 % on Wednesday .
Sales of top - end smartphones were lower than expected at Christmas , a factor that hit growth in royalty revenues for ARM .
The company reported slower growth than in previous years , with pretax profits up 9 % compared with a 44 % leap a year ago .
Hugo Barra , recently poached from Google to lead Xiaomi 's international effort , will play a key role in the Chinese firm 's latest move .
In preparation , the group has already changed its web address to mi.com , paying $ 3.6 m ( Â£2 m ) to acquire the rights to a brand that it hopes will travel more easily outside China .
Xiaomi shipped almost 19 m handsets last year and was valued at $ 10bn in an August funding round .
It plans to sell 40 m handsets in 2014 , and Lei has set a goal of 100 m by 2015 .
Expansion outside China has already begun .
Xiaomi has started selling phones in Singapore and set its sights on five other Asian markets : Malaysia , Indonesia , the Philippines , Vietnam and Thailand .
Xiaomi 's growth has come largely through word of mouth â€ “
the company sells high - end products , which use Google 's Android operating system , at low - end prices .
Costs are kept low because the company spends little on advertising and on distributing stock to physical stores , selling mostly via its website .
"" You can certainly call this acceleration , "" its co - founder , Bin Lin , told Bloomberg .
"" It 's our mission and our belief that this model should be able to achieve some level of success outside of China . ""
The business captured 7 % of the Chinese smartphone market in the fourth quarter of last year , ranking just ahead of Apple , according to research firm Canalys .
It has also put pressure on native manufacturers , which tend to dominate in China , forcing vendors ZTE and Huawei to offer more affordable high - end phones .
"" It 's definitely disrupting everyone , "" said Ryan Lai , a researcher at IDC .
"" Now consumers expect phones with high - end specs at low prices . ""
Xiaomi 's business is not limited to smartphones .
The expansion plans were announced at a product launch in Beijing on Wednesday , where the company updated its television set - top box and unveiled two new wireless routers .
Lei , 44 , made his first fortune in software , and his Hong Kong business KIS Holdings could soon join fellow Chinese digital company Alibaba on Wall Street .
In January , an application was lodged to float KIS Holdings in the US .
The company specialises in security software and makes the Clean Master app , one of the top non - gaming downloads from Google 's store , which wipes junk files from Android phones ."
2014-05-30,"There 's a watchful quietness about Tim Cook : he weighs people , and his answers , before responding to questions .
Where Steve Jobs had a fizz of nervous energy about him , Cook , 53 , is quieter
â€ “ although no less forceful .
A fitness enthusiast who rises early and triages his email on an iPad in a coffee shop
, Cook was the person who made Apple 's unseen manufacturing and distribution systems supremely efficient .
At big public events , he often seems hesitant , but in private , when he speaks on subjects on which he feels strongly , his voice hardens and he becomes deliberate and insistent .
Apple has shifted subtly since he took over as chief executive in 2011 , having joined in 1998 .
Under Cook , Apple has started matching employees ' charitable donations , and is pushing for equal rights legislation .
It also emphasises green topics
â€ “ so much
so he told climate change deniers at an AGM to sell their shares .
And although Cook has said little about the Snowden revelations , it 's noticeable that Apple has emphasised that its business does n't rely on monetising customer data .
Cook , following on from Jobs , has faced criticism .
"" The world 's great companies all seem to decline after their founder or early leader leaves , "" said Pascal - Emmanuel Gobry , a writer and analyst .
"" Sony has been listless since its iconic founder Akio Morita left in 1994 .
Since Bill Gates left his day - to - day role at Microsoft [ to be replaced by Steve Ballmer ] , the company 's stock price has been flat and lost its edge .
General Motors has been on a secular decline since it lost its legendary chief executive Alfred P Sloan . ""
For Gobry , a $ 3bn deal to buy the headphones and streaming company Beats is the final straw :
Cook , he says , is "" Steve Ballmer to Jobs 's Bill Gates , "" and a "" suit "" ."
2014-06-04,"Steve Jobs may have wanted the iPad to be free of porn , but that certainly hasnâ€ ™ t stopped users turning to the deviceâ€ ™ s Safari browser view porn sites .
Safari on the iPhone and iPad is used more than any other mobile browser , according to new data from Pornhub , one of the biggest free pornography sites , with 38 million users a day .
â€œOver the past year , Pornhub has seen a major shift in the types of traffic coming to our site , â€ � said a company spokesperson in a blog post .
â€œOf the 38 million people who visit Pornhub each day , over half are now using mobile devices like tablets and smartphones.â€ � iPad claims the lion 's share
Appleâ€ ™ s iPad was the most used tablet by quite some margin , with Safari claiming 73 % of the porn siteâ€ ™ s tablet visitors , with Googleâ€ ™ s Chrome , which is available on the iPad and Android tablets , a distant second used by 13.6 % of visitors .
The Android browser built into Googleâ€ ™ s mobile software came third with 7.8 % of tablet browsers , leading Amazonâ€ ™ s
Kindle Fire browser Silk with 4.8 % and leaving BlackBerryâ€ ™ s
Playbook in last with 0.69 % .
The data is not quite as surprising as it sounds , despite the iPadâ€ ™ s Safari browser dominating Pornhubâ€ ™ s tablet browsing .
Appleâ€ ™ s iPad maintains a dominant share of overall tablet users in the majority of developed markets , including the US where it had a 54.5 % share and the UK where it had 59 % share of tablet users in 2013 , according to data from research firm eMarketer .
iPhone users also avid viewers
Appleâ€ ™ s iPhone users are also avid viewers of Pornhub .
The smartphone version of Safari claims a 38.2 % share of all the porn site smartphone users globally , beating the Android browser , which holds a 29.4 % share .
Googleâ€ ™ s Chrome mobile browser , which is available on both Android and the iPhone , holds an 18 % share and Window Phoneâ€ ™ s
Internet Explorer comes in fourth with 2.4 % of visits .
Operaâ€ ™ s Mini browser , which is available on various smartphones including BlackBerrys was in last place with 2.3 % of visitors .
Appleâ€ ™ s iPhone held a 40 % share of smartphone users in the US in 2013 , while int eh UK
Appleâ€

More than half of Internet Explorer users using latest version 11 ' Desktop browsers were still used by a significant number of Pornhubâ€ ™ s purveyors , with Chrome leading the charge at 44.4 % , with Internet Explorer coming second with a 23.2 % share , leading Firefox with 20.1 % , Safari with 7 % and Opera with 2.6 % .
The porn siteâ€ ™ s desktop browser statistics mirror the current browser marketshares , according to data from research firm StatCounter , which places Chrome in the top spot with a 45.22 % of global browsers , leading Internet Explorer at 21.43 % and Firefox at 18.72 % in April .
Pornhub also analysed the distribution of Internet Explorer versions , which showed Microsoftâ€ ™ s attempts to get users to upgrade to the latest and safest version 11 is gaining traction with porn viewers , although discontinued versions including IE5 , which was released 15 years ago , are still in active use .
â€œMore than half of Internet Explorer users coming to Pornhub are using the latest version 11 .
Version 10 was released in 2012 and brings 17.5 % of the traffic .
Version 9 ( 2011 ) and Version 8 ( 2009 ) each bring just over 14 % of visitors .

2014-07-02,"China 's fast - growing handset maker Xiaomi says it sold more than 26 m smartphones in the first half of the year , almost four times the 7 m it sold in the same period a year ago , and is on track to reach 60 m handset sales by Christmas .
Established in 2010 , Xiaomi only released its first smartphone in 2011 , but founder Lei Jun 's reputation as "" the Chinese Steve Jobs "" has helped the company attract a cult following among younger consumers .
The company sold 7.2 m smartphones in 2012 and 18.7 m in 2013 , with the total reaching 26.11 m in the first half of 2014 .
These totals , Xiaomi said in a statement on Tuesday , mean its mobile division â€œalready has a considerable user groupâ€
� .
The 26 m shipment was 30 % more than Taiwanese rival HTC , once the world 's biggest Android smartphone maker , shipped in the whole of 2013 .
HTC has been struggling to find profitability , and cut capacity in 2013 to 38.6 m devices - suggesting that Xiaomi will outsell it this year .
The increase in sales , which produced a 150 % rise in revenues to 33bn yuan renminbi ( Â£3bn ) , means Xiami devices outsold Samsung in China for the second time in April , according to market research from Kantar , with its budget RedMI device the top selling smartphone in the country .
Nearly a quarter of new users previously owned a Samsung handset , according to Kantar .
Xiaomi 's strategy is to sell devices at rock bottom prices , via online shops and with minimal marketing spend , in order to recruit users for the company 's software and internet services .
Its phones use a customised version of Google 's Android software .
It already outsells Apple in China , and the size of its domestic market means two of its handsets â€ “ RedMI and Mi3
â€ “ were among the world 's top 10 bestselling smartphones in April , said Hong Kong - based Counterpoint Technology Market Research .
Xiaomi sells its cheaper RedMi handsets for $ 130 unlocked , and its higher quality Mi3 for $ 330 , undercutting similar handsets from Apple and Samsung .
Having recriuted senior Google executive Hugo Barra in September 2013 to run international sales , Xiaomi has announced plans to expand this year to more than a dozen fast growing markets , including Malaysia , Indonesia , India Thailand , Russia , Turkey , Brazil and Mexico .
Valued at $ 10bn in a fundraising last August , privately held Xiaomi hopes international growth will push smartphone sales to 150 m units in 2015 .

2014-07-02,"Ab - Soul â€ “
These Days â€
¦ Black Hippy and TDE crew member Ab - Soul turned heads earlier in the year , when he released Tree of Life ; a weird , off - kilter cut which gave shout - outs to Steve Jobs and pastoral scenery .
Tree of Life is included on These Days and the rest of the album continues on that trippy feel : opener God 's Reign is slow - burning and anthemic and features a turn from fellow TDEer SZA , who provides the chorus .
Other guests include Schoolboy Q , Kendrick Lamar , Rick Ross and Danny Brown , but at no point does it feel as if Ab - Soul is ever out - gunned .
A lot of people have been hyping up
his labelmate Isaiah Rashad this year , and while his introverted flow might well have a bigger critical impact , Ab - Soul makes solid , varied hip - hop that manages to be imaginative
( it 's actually a concept album , aimed at commenting on the current state of hip - hop ) and banging at the same time .
Juicy J â€ “ Stop

Juicy J gets to live out his wildest Scarface / GTA V fantasies in the video for Stop It .
Super violent beat - down of a rival : check .
Gun - wielding threats : check .
Claims he could cuckold you and get your wife to make him breakfast in bed the morning after : check .
A MASSIVE BLOODY CHAINSAW : check .
If you 've kept up with the current torture techniques of the Mexican drug cartels this will ring a horrible bell .
It 's graphic , bloody and pretty disturbing .
You would n't call this progressive , but it is Juicy J doing what he does best : trap mixed with ridiculously violent lyrics .
Nicki Minaj at the BET awards Nicki Minaj continues to dominate every award show she goes to .
Earlier in the year , she turned up at the Hot97 Summer Jam , played a live set that left a lot of people open - mouthed and finally convinced seasoned Minaj doubters ( such as Pete Rosenberg ) that she was a credible artist .
At the BET awards , she played a live medley including pop track Pills N Potions and the harder Chiraq , and threw some serious shade at Iggy Azalea during her acceptance speech for best female artist ( the fifth time she 's won it ) .
Following the abuse she took from hip - hop heads after the success of Super Bass and Starships , it looks as if she is determined to prove that she is still one of the best MCs out there , and that her forthcoming album , The Pink Print , will place straight - up pop next to street - level trap and drill .
The Alchemist â€ “ Alchemix Serial mixtape producers UpNorthTrips have put together a mix in tribute to New York producer the Alchemist .
Their back catalogue is pretty magnificent .
They 've previously dedicated tapes to Ghostface Killah 's storytelling raps , Illmatic and Jeru The Damaja , and this week they unveiled a decade - spanning retrospective mix of the Alchemist 's best work .
It 's a year - by - year look at his back catalogue , starting with Tick Tock , his 2004 hook - up with Nas and Prodigy , and takes in tracks with Raekwon , Pusha T and Action Bronson before finishing on Break the Bank , his track from Schoolboy Q 's album Oxymoron .

2014-07-07,"Think of digital innovation and two people will most likely come to mind : Steve Jobs and Bill Gates .
The pair are widely considered the world 's greatest when it comes to inventing and innovating , making it into top lists alongside the likes of Thomas Edison and Leonardo da Vinci .
But what does innovation really mean ?
The word has certainly been misused over the years , by eager CEOs launching new products at conferences and in deceiving press releases ( where the word is often a substitute for "" new "" or "" different "" ) .
Jobs defined innovation less tangibly when he said that it "" distinguishes between a leader and a follower "" .
But in practical terms , Gates said it best : "" Software innovation , like almost every other kind of innovation , requires the ability to collaborate and share ideas with other people , and to sit down and talk with customers and get their feedback and understand their needs .
"" You just have to look at the success of a company like Apple or Microsoft to see how far good research and development can get you .
Of course , it 's about the new and the different
but it 's also about the user experience , collaboration and constant iteration .
So what does good innovation and R&amp;D look like for startups or companies in their early years ?
Is it even necessary ?
If it is , what are the challenges and implications associated with it ?
Treading in the footsteps of greats like Jobs and Gates , we 'll be joined by a panel of experts to answer those questions and more .

2014-07-08,"Steve Jobs was known for being ruthless and controlling , driven by a desire for perfection with a clear image of how products , practices and Apple
should be , which helped him turn the company around after rejoining it from NeXT in 1996 when Apple bought the computing startup .
But that same drive had an effect on his relations with employees .
â€œSome of my very best friends in Apple , the most creative people in Apple who worked on the Macintosh , almost all of them said they would never , ever work for Steve Jobs again , â€ � said Wozniak in an interview with the Milwaukee Business Journal at the Flying Car conference in Milwaukee two weeks ago .
â€œIt was that bad.â€ � Wozniak explained that in his earlier years at Apple , Jobs pushed people to bring products out before they were ready , creating enormous strain on employees and creating rifts .
â€œHe would directly confront people and almost call them idiots
, â€ � explained Wozniak .
â€œBut you know what ?
When they confronted him back and told him why they were right in understandable forms , he was just testing and learning , and he would respect those people and give them high privileges in the company.â€ �
â€œThat was one thing he did respect â€
“
someone who believed enough in their own ideas to speak for him , not just shut up and be shy around him , â€ � he said .

2014-07-26,"America 's willingness to back the pioneering entrepreneurs that have transformed its industries and fuelled its economy should not be underestimated .
From Henry Ford to Thomas Edison and , more recently , Steve Jobs , those who have harnessed technology to create vast wealth cast a long shadow over the new world 's corporate history .
Loyalty to the visionary may go some way to explaining why , the day after Amazon warned that its operating loss in the coming September quarter could be as high as $ 810 m , support for its founder shows no sign of wavering .
Jeff Bezos has a reputation for sacrificing profits in favour of long - term growth , but the warning still came as a shock .
Wall Street had been expecting just $ 8 m .
The shares dived 15 % , wiping Â£15bn from Amazon 's stock market value .
The heads of British chief executives have rolled for less .
Tesco 's business may be shrinking , but it was still making a Â£3bn profit when Philip Clarke was ousted last week .
Two years ago , AstraZeneca 's David Brennan had to fall on his sword earlier than planned because of a lacklustre drugs pipeline .
But reaction to Amazon 's profit warning among the analysts who set the tone on Wall Street was a series of reiterated buy recommendations .
"" One of the best management teams on the internet , "" cheered broker RBC Capital Markets .
"" We still have conviction , "" declared the equity strategists at Morningstar .
The reasons given for the upcoming losses are a very diverse range of aggressive , well - funded investments .
Amazon is investing in faster dispatch for all goods , with more Sunday and same - day deliveries .
More ambitiously , it wants to become an online grocer , bringing fresh food to the doorstep just like Ocado or Sainsbury 's .
AmazonFresh drivers are already dropping off weekly shops in Los Angeles and San Francisco .
Even more ambitiously , Amazon Studios is having a stab at becoming the next HBO or Netflix , committing $ 100 m in the current quarter alone to commissioning its own shows .
This spring , it gave the green light to six full series .
There is a new instalment of the Birmingham crime drama Peaky Blinders , co - produced with the BBC , and supernatural thriller
The After , from X - Files creator Chris Carter .
There are no half - measures here : a third wave of pilots later this year will include no fewer than 10 new shows .
Amazon may make more money from general merchandise , but its window display has always been entertainment â€ “ books , music , films , TV series ; a sector that will sooner or later be sucked into a black hole .
Digital downloads are doing away with the need for warehouses full of CDs and box sets .
And Amazon is far from dominant in the download arena .
The device makers and software writers â€ “ Google with its Playstore and Apple with iTunes â€ “ are already building billion - dollar music and video retail businesses .
And so Amazon is building its own devices .
First a tablet , then a set - top box , and now a mobile phone .
Creating hit television series , running an online supermarket , making smartphones : these are difficult things to do well , even for companies that specialise in only one of them at a time .
None the less , Amazon 's can - do approach has proved doubters wrong in the past â€ “ most notably with its Kindle tablet .
But Bezos wants customers to live in a company town , in the same way that some of its authors write books that are published by Amazon , reviewed by Amazon customers , sold in its online store , and read on its Kindles .
The model has a niche in the book trade , but how many people will watch The After on a Fire TV box , while munching popcorn delivered by AmazonFresh ?
Amazon should focus on retail and forge alliances â€ “ with device makers , TV companies and studios .
Unfortunately , while Bezos has achieved much , his turbulent relationship with the publishing industry suggests alliances are not his strong suit .
Wage inflation ?
We 'll believe it when we see it
The timing of the first interest rate rise in more than five years will depend on how many workers get a decent wage rise .
Bank of England rate setters let it be known at their last meeting that inflation - busting pay is a key indicator of an economy 's health , and a trigger for higher rates .
Optimists believe that , after six years of falling real incomes , workers are due an above - inflation rise .
So far it has n't come , but they argue that staff shortages will soon translate into higher pay .
As the Bank 's regional agent network recently reported , the UK is facing the worst recruitment difficulties since the beginning of 2008 .
Recruitment agencies are also recording record rises in starting salaries for new employees .
So wages are on the up .
Are interest rates too ?
The flipside of this argument can be found in the minutes from July 's MPC meeting .
Officials said a halving in average weekly earnings growth to 0.7 % in the three months to April , from 1.4 % in the three months to January , could reflect a trend for new jobs to be "" concentrated in lower - paid sectors "" .
It added : "" Perhaps relatedly , recent employment growth had been more heavily skewed towards lower - skilled occupations . ""
Rate setters also worry about self - employment , up by 700,000 since 2008 and accounting for more than two - fifths of job creation in this parliament .
Many new members of this 4.5 million - strong sub - group are redundant public sector workers picking up contract work .
Then there are the 100,000 or so construction workers who have probably rejoined the ranks of the self- employed .
It is a mixed bag of people , some of whom could see their incomes rocket as the economy recovers , and others who wo n't .
George Osborne said last week he expects a bumper tax take in January when the self - employed pay their contributions .
He may be right .
But it may not be all they are paying .
Higher mortgage payments could be another hit on their bank account soon .
RBS shares are up â€ “ but the watchdog still lurks Royal Bank of Scotland has set an upbeat tone for the start of the half - yearly reporting season for high street banks .
Belting out its profits a week early , the bailed - out bank has raised the bar for rivals .
Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group were dragged up the FTSE 100 leader board on the back of the 10 % jump in the RBS share price on Friday ;
handily , Barclays and Lloyds are due to report his week .
Better news about the economy was demonstrated in the dramatic fall in RBS 's provisions for bad debts , and official data showing the economy has recovered the losses it incurred during the banking crisis .
Such things bolster sentiment .
But as RBS spelt out , no matter how much good news there is around , there is always the lingering problem of conduct and litigation risks .
This week may well provide more evidence of these party poopers ."
2014-08-06,"They may not know who Steve Jobs was or even how to tie their own shoelaces , but the average six - year - old child understands more about digital technology than a 45-year - old adult , according to an authoritative new report published on Thursday .
The advent of broadband in the year 2000 has created a generation of digital natives , the communication watchdog Ofcom says in its annual study of British consumers .
Born in the new millennium , these children have never known the dark ages of dial up internet , and the youngest are learning how to operate smartphones or tablets before they are able to talk . ""
These younger people are shaping communications , "" said Jane Rumble , Ofcom 's media research head .
"" As a result of growing up in the digital age , they are developing fundamentally different communication habits from older generations , even compared to what we call the early adopters , the 16-to-24 age group .
"" Ofcom devised a "" digital quotient "" , or DQ test to put 800 children and 2000 adults through their paces , which rather than measuring intelligence attempts to gauge awareness and self confidence around gadgets from tablets to smart watches , knowledge of superfast internet , 4 G mobile phone networks and mobile apps .
Among six to seven year olds , who have grown up with YouTube , Spotify music streaming and the BBC iPlayer , the average DQ ( digital quotient ) score was 98 , higher than for those aged between 45 and 49 , who scored an average of 96 .
Digital understanding peaks between 14 and 15 , with a DQ of 113 â€
“ and then drops gradually throughout adulthood , before falling rapidly in old age .
The nation is now being invited to test its digital knowledge with an abbreviated version of the questionnaire that will give any member of the public a DQ score , along with advice on how to improve their understanding and protect themselves and their families online .
While half of all adults claimed to know a lot about smartphone and tablet apps , nearly half had never heard of Snapchat , the picture messaging service launched in 2011 .
The smart glasses being developed by Google , and the smart watch Apple is expected to launch before the end of the year , are also something of a mystery to older technology users , with nearly half of all adults unaware of these devices .
More than half of children aged 6 - 15 claim to use and know a lot about smartphone and tablet apps , with only 3 % having never heard of them .
Snapchat is particularly popular , with 18 % of children claiming to have used the app and a further 11 % knowing a lot about it .
The ways in which millennial children contact each other and consume entertainment are so different from previous generations , forecasters now consider their preferences a better indication of the future than those of trend setting young adults .
The most remarkable change is in time spent talking by phone .
Two decades ago , teenagers devoted their evenings to monopolising the home telephone line , dissecting love affairs and friendships in conversations that lasted for hours .
For those aged 12 to 15 , phone calls account for just 3 % of time spent communicating through any device .
For all adults , this rises to 20 % , and for young adults it is still three times as high at 9 % .
Today 's children do the majority of their remote socialising by sending written messages or through shared photographs and videos .
"" The millennium generation is losing its voice , "" Ofcom claims .
More than 90 % of their device time is message based , chatting on social networks like Facebook , or sending instant messages through services like WhatsApp , or even firing off traditional mobile phone text messages .
Just 2 % of children 's time use is spent emailing â€ “ compared to 33 % for adults .
But 10 % of children 's device time is spent sending video and photo messages , sharing or commenting on photos via services like Snapchat , or circulating 15 second videos over Instagram 's sister app Vine .
Away from their phones , 12- to 15-year - olds have a very different relationship with other media too .
A digital seven day diary shows live television accounts for just half of viewing for this age group , compared to nearly 70 % for all adults .
They spend 20 % of their time viewing short video clips , for example on YouTube , or news clips distributed via Facebook and other social sites .
The rest of their viewing is shared between DVDs , streamed content through Netflix or iTunes , or recorded television programmes .
Young adults aged 16 to 24 are voracious consumers of almost all media , devoting 14 hours and seven minutes a day to communications , if the time spent multi - tasking , for example texting while watching TV , is added up .
However , live radio and print based media have all but disappeared from their daily diet .
Even among adults , television is becoming less important .
The number of hours spent in front of the box fell for the first time since a new measurement system was introduced in 2009 , from 4 hours and two minutes in 2010 and 2011 to 3 hours and 52 minutes in 2013 .
Had it not been for the London Olympics in 2012 , television viewing would have fallen during that year as well .
"" The jury is still out on whether it 's a one off blip or the start of a new trend , "" said James Thickett , research director at Ofcom .
"" But younger people are moving away from live television and moving to streaming and catch up services . ""
Television viewing among 16- to 24-year - olds has been dipping each year since 2010 , but 2013 was the first year where researchers found viewing fell across all age groups .
The theory is that tablet computers â€ “ among the most popular Christmas presents in the last two years â€ “ have brought many older people online for longer .
With large screens and simple , touch based interfaces , tablets are being credited with a jump in internet access among the over 65s . ""
For years there has been a very stubborn resistance by the over 65s to accessing the internet , "" said Thickett .
"" In the last three years we have seen that change and we think that 's down to tablets . ""
Britain is embracing internet enabled devices across the generations , to the extent that the balance between sleep and screen based activities has now tipped .
The typical adult spends eight hours and 41 minutes each day communicating or consuming media , including old fashioned books and newspapers , and just eight hours and 21 minutes asleep .
The scales are likely to tip further .
With sleep monitoring sensors linked to smartphone apps heralded as one of the next big technology trends , the nation may soon remain plugged in all night ."
2014-08-11,"Many companies have internal training programmes , but Appleâ€ ™ s goes far further than most teaching employees how to think like Steve Jobs .
The highly secretive Apple University , profiled in detail by the New York Times , was established by Jobs in 2008 to teach what it meant to be an Apple employee , educating them about the companyâ€ ™ s culture and history .
Some are tailored to different topics like how to integrate your recently purchased company into Apple , which could be useful for Jimmy Iovine , Dr Dre and their recently acquired Beats team .
â€˜What makes Apple , Appleâ€ ™ One of the courses , entitled â€œWhat makes Apple , Appleâ€ � , uses the difference between the remote from Googleâ€ ™ s failed TV initiative with its 78 buttons and the Apple TV remote , which has just seven buttons to teach the â€œless is moreâ€ � approach Apple takes with most things .
Another likens Apple to Picasso using a series of 11 lithographs of a bull created by the artist showing a refinement from fully detailed sketch of a bull to a characteristic line - art stick figure of a bull .
â€œYou go through more iterations until you can simply deliver your message in a very concise way , and that is true to the Apple brand and everything we do , â€ � a person who attended the course anonymously recalled to the New York Times .
Jobs put the former Yale School of Managementâ€ ™ s dean Joel Podolny in charge of the programme , and managed to attract faculty members from a raft of US universities , including Harvard , Stanford and Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
The courses are run all year round at a dedicated facility at Appleâ€ ™ s headquarters in California , but they are not compulsory despite being full most of the time .

2014-09-14,"In what was to be his last public appearance before his death , Steve Jobs detailed to Cupertino city council , California , in 2011 the plans behind Apple 's new headquarters â€ “ a 71 hectare ( 176 acre ) campus with an enormous O - shaped building for 13,000 employees at its heart .
Jobs claimed that they had the opportunity to construct "" the best office building in the world "" , the donut - like plan by Norman Foster hinged not just on aesthetics but also ensuring the possibility for collaboration between workers who would be able to walk around the new campus , a concept which is central to how architects now look at the modern office .
Much like when he scrapped plans for three buildings for a new Pixar headquarters in 2000 in favour of one vast space with an atrium at the centre so that employees had to run into each other and interact , the building is aimed at encouraging collaboration â€ “ a trend which illustrates that the modern workplace is no longer just seen as the desk but also the area around it .
Simon Allford , a director of architects Allford Hall Monaghan Morris ( AHMM ) , said that when he started his career , design centred around getting from the lift to the desk as quickly as possible .
This has changed in the last decade .
"" The journey is actually seen as beneficial because as people are working in different ways , you are not expecting them to be only working in one place , therefore work is a kind of continuous activity and you are always thinking , "" he said .
The BBC 's new Broadcasting House headquarters in central London has large units similar to American diner booths in common areas where staff can have chance meetings , while the redeveloped headquarters of the Royal Institute of British Architects ( Riba ) at Portland Place will have a "" forum '' where different parts of the organisation can congregate .
In California , the design of technology firm NVIDIA 's new headquarters takes its influence from computer chip design , where the connections for the flow of information are made before other parts of the chip are added on .
With this in mind , stairs were replaced with platforms so that other activities could be carried out there and landings are oversized and used for meetings .
"" There are great stories of researchers having incidental space and just bumping into one another and having ideas , "" said Stephen Hodder , president of the Riba and chairman of Hodder and Partners Architects .
This move away from the office desk as the main place of productivity is one of the developments in workplace design which has seen the real estate departments of large corporations realise that packing employees tightly into spaces will not necessarily result in greater productivity , according to Philip Tidd from the design and architecture firm Gensler . ""
The idea that the desk is a unit of productivity is changing very , very rapidly .
Your productivity is not measured by the amount of time you sit behind a thing called a desk .
It is what you do .
It is about your output , "" he said .
"" It is about getting the balance of specs right
so it is not just get everybody in the open , have open plan but have the right balance of spaces where you can get in a zone of concentration .
"" This requirement for varied features in office buildings is cemented by the longer hours of many workers , notably in the technology sector , and as a result new offices are now seen to need different areas for working and letting off steam , a tactic most notably championed by Google .
The new White Collar Factory , which is to open beside east London 's "" Silicon Roundabout '' and designed by AHMM , will have a running track for the companies that take up space there .
"" When people work longer hours , you need to escape from work at work and also do different kinds of work in different places , "" said Allford .
The new Google building in King 's Cross is being designed along the lines of a theatre with the furniture as props which can be moved depending on the needs of the staff , he said .
The all - inclusive use of office space and breakdown of traditional barriers has also been seen in the new BBC building , the interior of which was designed by architects HOK .
As all carpets and fabrics have been tested for the screen , filming can now take place across the whole building , according to Andy Baker , who oversees the corporation 's London locations .
Radio studios were also rehoused in glassed areas which cut the space they needed and added to the atmosphere , he said .
This breakdown of traditional barriers is also beginning to creep into status and hierarchy , according to Tidd .
Those higher up the food chain got bigger offices â€ “ culminating in the cherished corner site .
But those who usually get the prime spaces are typically executives who are out a lot and do not need them . ""
Your seniority in the organisation , your status in the organisation , does not need to be reinforced by how much space you get , "" he said , citing a Brimingham law firm which is all open plan where none of the partners have offices .
The Riba says the demand for high - quality workplaces is on the rise constantly and contributes to the recruitment and retention of staff . ""
As the country has shifted from being a largely manufacturing base to a service base , I think there is a staggering statistic which is that almost three quarters of the UK 's GDP is generated largely by office service industries .
It is incredible to think of that and so the design of those and the optimisation of design of workplace is hugely important to underpin , "" said Hodder .
To seat or not to seat One feature of the new BBC building which raised the ire of staff and jokes in the comedy W1A was the reduction of workstations to 3,500 for the 5,600 staff â€ “ the thinking being that shift patterns and mobility would allow for sharing with workers sitting around the campus and create "" positive crowding "" .
Philip Tidd of Gensler said that with mobile working , there is not necessarily the need for a seat for everyone but current "" smart '' working areas dictate that there is space for a team where there may be eight seats for 10 staff ."
2014-10-03,"Leonardo DiCaprio has quit the Steve Jobs biopic that Danny Boyle has been preparing , thus ending hopes that the actor and director would reunite for the first time since making The Beach in 2000 .
According to the Hollywood Reporter , DiCaprio had been on track to play the Apple co - founder after completing work on The Revenant , the western directed by Alejandro GonzÃ¡lez IÃ±Ã¡rritu that is currently in production .
However , DiCaprio has now pulled out of the Jobs film , with the Reporter suggesting he plans to take a long break from acting .
This untitled project has been in the works for some time , with a script from Aaron Sorkin that will reportedly focus on three significant episodes in Jobsâ€ ™ life .
At one stage it looked as if producers had secured David Fincher â€ “ who had worked with Sorkin on The Social Network â€ “ as director , with Christian Bale the first choice for the lead role .
However , agreement with Fincher could not be finalised , with sources suggesting fees and creative control were sticking points , leaving the way clear for Boyle to get involved .
Producers also had to contend with a rival biopic , starring Ashton Kutcher , which was released to little acclaim in 2013 in the US ( though not , as yet , in the UK ) .
Now , however , a new search for a lead actor will have to be instituted , with Bale reportedly alongside Matt Damon and Bradley Cooper at the top of the shopping list .
Aaron Sorkin :
Steve Jobs biopic to play out in three scenes"
2014-10-07,"The glimmer of screens hypnotises a group of children who swipe their hands from side to side and then up and down , captivated by whatâ€ ™ s in front of them .
This isnâ€ ™ t a scene from a sci - fi film or a description of the electronics floor in Hamleyâ€ ™ s toy shop , it is life inside Netherlandsâ€ ™ new iPad schools .
Just over a year ago , seven schools serving 1,000 four- to 12-year - olds opened their doors in cities such as Amsterdam and Almere .
Because of their focus on learning through iPads , these institutions â€ “ pioneered by market researcher and entrepreneur Maurice de Hond â€ “ became known as â€œSteve Jobs schoolsâ€
� .
There are now 22 of them across the Netherlands .
There are no notebooks , blackboards or even formal lesson plans : children drop into 30-minute workshops on various subjects .
There are no seating plans and 45 % of learning takes place on an iPad which every child is given when they join .
What workshop each pupil goes to is decided by teachers , parents and the pupils themselves as part of their six - week learning plan .
De Hond says it is about children achieving specific learning goals with teachers acting as â€œtalent coachesâ€ � .
Children must attend school for a full day , but the devices let them learn at any time anywhere , taking screen grabs to indicate their progress to teachers .
Marina Donker , who teaches at The Ontplooiing Steve Jobs School in Amsterdam , explains that they use web - based learning programmes which adapt work to a childâ€ ™ s results .
â€œThere are no piles of school notebooks at the and of the day waiting for us .
Children can work by themselves in a quiet room ; this means that we can work with smaller groups during our workshops.â€ � While these schools offer a unique approach , the use of iPads in classrooms is not new .
According to Apple , more than 10 m iPads have been purchased by educational institutions worldwide , 7 m in the US and 750,000 in the state of Texas alone .
De Hond has noticed children getting more self - assured in their learning over the year in his schools .
There has been no formal research conducted so far , but De Hond believes iPads are helping children to concentrate for longer , having a particularly positive impact on those who suffer from attention deficit disorder ( ADD ) .
â€œA lot of the time attention disorders are when someone is bored .
If you spend your spare time in a stimulating environment then go to school and are stuck in an uninspiring environment ,
itâ€ ™ s no wonder children rebel , â€ � he says .
Kim Kampman , who teaches at the main Steve Jobs school in Sneek , says that one child with behavioural difficulties who came to them from a special school is doing well although she acknowledges that for other children the iPad approach , which puts emphasis on independent learning , does not work .
â€œSome children need someone to tell them what to do and can not pick things up by themselves.â€ � Kampman , however , does say that this it the minority and the school , which started with 60 children , now has 150 .
Robin Smorenberg , an Apple distinguished educator ( ADE ) in the Netherlands , says iPads let children show what they have learnt in ways other than just scoring highly in exams .
But , he adds , teachers need a clear idea of what the learning goals are to make sure that alternative modes of testing are reliable .
The Steve Jobs schools carry out the same statuary assessments as other Dutch schools and last year Kampmanâ€ ™ s schoolâ€ ™ s scores were â€œas expectedâ€ � .
She says that the government has been interested in their results but it is still too early to say .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve only worked [ with iPads ] for one year so we donâ€ ™ t have a lot of evidence .
But we see children are much more motivated and they get more work done independently.â€
�
One of the biggest discoveries for De Hond is that iPads can help you reorganise the way a school works .
â€œChildren can do a lot of training in maths and languages with adaptive programmes that take up almost no teacher time .
They can follow their own learning path , which might be faster or slower.â€ �
This frees up teachers to give more attention to the pupils who need it , De Hond says , adding that giving children their own six - week learning plan devised by them and their parents means they are more engaged in their own education .
But Freek Leemhuis , an independent consultant and software developer in the Netherlands , worries that iPads are mainly used by children to consume information rather than be creative .
Critics also say thereâ€ ™ s something inherently wrong with building your school around a brand .
â€œSchools are independent and shouldnâ€ ™ t be linked to a product , â€ � says ESRC future research leader , Andrew Manches , who works at the University of Edinburgh .
For Kampman the biggest challenge has been how you follow the development of a child who is learning through an iPad .
â€œChildren can practice on an app but you can not always see how they did it .
The challenge is following children in a way that you can see how they have done something.â€
� Manches says that there is a lot of rhetoric around technology and â€œpersonalisedâ€ � learning , but he thinks that while apps are useful in telling you what youâ€ ™ ve got right they are not always good at explaining things to children .
Children often learn a lot from understanding their mistakes .
Then there is the coordination of it , with issues around data protection , setting iPads up and replacing them with the latest model .
Manches says : â€œIf all childrenâ€ ™ s data is online then that needs to be protected .
Itâ€ ™ s important to know what infrastructure and training is needed and what works in one school wonâ€ ™ t necessarily work elsewhere.â€ �
In terms of the finances , Kampman says the government - funded schools provide every child with an iPad and parents pay just â‚¬16 a year for their child to attend .
In the time they have been open , of the 150 iPads , five have been broken and a few needed to be replaced .
In Steve Jobs schools children are also free to use the internet on their devices .
If a child finds a website that is unsuitable they tell their teacher , says Kampman .
â€œItâ€ ™ s the responsibility of the teacher to make sure children know how to use the internet and what to do if they find something inappropriate.â€ � Schools in the UK have made some movement towards using iPads , with an estimated 500 British schools using the devices .
The Stephen Perse Foundation in Cambridge has gone a step further , weaving tablets into the curriculum .
De Hond says those looking to copy the Steve Jobs school model should first think about what children should learn if they are to be prepared for the future .
â€œUse the tablet to redefine the school and not just as an extension of what youâ€ ™ re currently doing , â€ � he says .
Despite his reservations , Manches is keen to see what results they have in the Netherlands .
He says that education needs evangelists but also critical voices to help other schools understand how and why things are working .
â€œWhat we hear nowadays is that things are great but it would be nice to have case studies of what works and how it can be replicated .
We need critical debate.â€ �

2014-10-09,"Science isnâ€ ™ t the enemy of creativity .
The two mingle happily .
Steve Jobs insisted that instead of the original design for Pixarâ€ ™ s studios , which proposed three separate buildings for computer scientists , animators and everyone else , there should be one cavernous space with just two bathrooms .
Now , everyone at Pixar has a â€œbathroom storyâ€ � of an inspirational conversation they had while washing their hands .
Science inspires creativity and for the CMO who wants to make their brand language more memorable , a famous professorâ€ ™ s book and an overlooked scientific paper might provide the answers .
You can see the size of the challenge facing the CMO when you add up all the words that they are responsible for producing â€ “ and keeping on - brand â€ “ every day .
A typical brand produces about 225 words a day in social media and , of course , it creates a verbal identity in its website updates , press releases , investor relations announcements , posters , radio ads and digital banners .
When you add in the hundreds of letters and emails that customer service produces , which can soon have a negative impact on your brandâ€ ™ s reputation if you get them wrong and the conversations in - store every day , the total shoots past 100,000 words in no time .
If youâ€ ™ re the editor of a newspaper , publishing similar quantities , youâ€ ™ ve been brought up on words .
But if youâ€ ™ re the CMO with a background in media , innovation or retail , how can you make sure that those words live on past midnight â€ “ or at least stay in the heads of your customers when they walk out of the store ?
Internet memes in photographs like â€œplankingâ€ � and videos like â€œHarlem Shakeâ€ � are well - known .
The concept of a â€˜unit of cultureâ€ ™ passed from person to person originated in Richard Dawkinsâ€ ™ s book The Selfish Gene .
He proposed that ideas , just as much as physiological adaptations , can be subject to Darwinian principles , being replicated by cultural transmission with only the most useful ideas surviving .
A meme , meaning a â€œunit of cultureâ€ � , is societyâ€ ™ s equivalent of the gene , according to Dawkins .
Memes exist in language too .
Take a walk along the bank of your local river on Sunday morning and thereâ€
™ s a chance
youâ€ ™ ll hear them at work .
Parents are busy warning their toddlers to be careful around the swans : â€œThe swans are strong.â€ �
â€œHow strong is a swan?â€
�
â€œStrong enough to break a manâ€ ™ s
arm.â€ �
Now , Iâ€ ™ ve never seen a manâ€ ™ s arm broken by a swan .
Iâ€ ™ ve never even heard of a manâ€ ™ s arm being broken by a swan .
But this is the same warning Iâ€ ™ ve given my own children about swans .
And I was told it by my mother , who said it was her mother who told it to her .
One meme , four generations , 100 years .
There are plenty of memes in the English language : â€œi before e except after Câ€ � .
â€œDonâ€
™ t swim for an hour after eating.â€ �
And they are there in commercial copywriting too .
â€œNever knowingly undersoldâ€ � is a meme : it lives beyond the paid - for posters or the press ads :
itâ€ ™ s the phrase John Lewisâ€ ™ s
shoppers use to explain why they shop there .
Tescoâ€ ™ s internal culture , as much as its customers perceptions have been steered by the successful little piece of verbal branding that is â€œEvery Little Helps.â€
�
Saatchiâ€ ™ s â€œDouble Whammyâ€ � and Ronsealâ€ ™ s â€œDoes
what it says on the tinâ€ � have been transmitted out of their commercial sphere into daily life .
In time , â€œTo Fly , To Serveâ€ � can become a meme that helps us remember for ourselves ( and explain to other people ) why we choose British Airways , but only if the brandâ€ ™ s behaviour lives up to the promise â€ “ the meme must transmit usefulness .
Phrases that do more than just report on a positioning seem to do well .
When a brandâ€ ™ s language captures the promise that the brand is making , its words seem to live on past the paid - for medium that brought them into the world .
But what makes a phrase memorable ?
And what makes it memorable enough to be passed from person to person ?
An overlooked scientific paper from the July 2012 Proceedings of the 50th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics might provide the answer .
Four linguists from Cornell University looked at the way in which a piece of information is phrased â€ “ the choice of words and the sentence structure used â€ “ affects the way in which it reaches widespread public awareness .
They analysed film quotes , comparing memorable and on - memorable quotes , controlling their analysis for the speaker , the setting of the quotes and the context .
There were two variables involved in memorability , they discovered .
First , â€œlexical directivenessâ€ � : memorable quotes are built from simple sentences , constructed in the normal way ( or with â€œcommon syntactic patternsâ€ � as the linguists call it ) .
But , the memorable phrases that we use are unexpected in those unsurprising sentence constructions .
Their second finding was that memorable quotes tend to be more generally applicable , and arenâ€ ™ t tied to the particular area in which they were first developed .
Even better , they found strong evidence that these principles apply to non - movie lines , such as advertising slogans and brand language .
For the more technically minded writer , they even observed how some sounds of speech , such as front vowels ( represented by the letter
i ) are more common in memorable quotes than some other sounds .
Perhaps itâ€ ™ s time that creativity and science were encouraged to mingle a little more .

2014-10-10,"Appleâ€ ™ s chief designer , Jony I ve , has criticised companies that copy Appleâ€ ™ s design calling it â€œtheftâ€ � and â€œlazyâ€ � and certainly not â€œflatteryâ€ � .
I ve discussed life with Steve Jobs , his design team , the iPhone 6 , and why it took so long to create a larger - screened smartphone , in a rare interview with Vanity Fair at the New Establishment Summit in San Francisco on Thursday .
â€œIâ€ ™ ll stand a little bit harsh , I donâ€
™ t see it as flattery , â€ � said I ve when asked about Chinese smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi , described as â€˜the Apple of Chinaâ€ ™ by many .
â€œWhen youâ€ ™ re doing something for the first time
, you donâ€
™ t know itâ€ ™ s gon na work .
You spend seven or eight years working on something , and then itâ€ ™ s copied .
I think it is really straightforward .
It is theft and it is lazy .
I donâ€
™ t think it is OK at all.â€ � Xiaomi , Samsung and other smartphone manufacturers have been accused of copying Appleâ€ ™ s designs , with long - running patent lawsuits between Apple and Samsung as well as others taking arguments to court .
Samsung and Apple agreed to drop lawsuits outside of the US in August after cases spanned multiple countries including Germany , Britain , France , Spain , Italy , the Netherlands , South Korea , Japan and Australia .
This marks the first time I ve has personally struck out against alleged copiers of his work , which has seen Apple reinvented first with the original iMac and then with the iPhone and iPad line as a design - focused company .
â€˜Many years ago we made prototypesâ€ ™
I ve also said that Apple had been working on larger - screened smartphones for years , having created product models and decided that larger screens were more intuitive and useful .
â€œMany years ago we made prototypes of phones with bigger screens .
They were interesting features , having a bigger screen , but the end result was a lousy product , because they were big and clunky , â€ �
I ve noted when asked why it took Apple so long to follow the trend first set by Android smartphones with screens larger than 4 in around the 4.7 in to 5 in mark .
The designer explained that it was only as technology advanced and designs could be iterated that Apple reached a point where it was happy with the size and feel of the device , insisting that â€œitâ€ ™ s very important to make the edges comfortable , to feel less wide than it really is.â€ � â€¢ iPhone 6 review : thinner , faster and slightly cheaper â€¢ Apple iPhone 6 and 6 Plus can bend in pockets , users complain â€¢ iPhone 6 and 6 plus bending fears â€˜seem overblownâ€ ™"
2014-10-15,"Christian Bale is back in line to play Steve Jobs in a new biopic about the Apple co - founder after Leonardo DiCaprio backed out in order to take a break from acting .
The film industry magazine Variety reports that Bale will take the lead in the film Jobs , directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin , scriptwriter of The Social Network and The West Wing .
Based on Walter Isaacsonâ€ ™ s
Steve Jobs :
the Exclusive Biography , the film will be divided into three long scenes taking place in real time , each set on the eve of a product launch .
Sorkin has revealed that the products are the Mac in 1984 ; the NeXT computer Jobs launched in 1990 after leaving Apple ; and the iPod , which launched 2001 .
David Fincher had originally been announced as the filmâ€ ™ s director , but left the project after an argument with Sony about his salary and the marketing of the film .
Bale had been Fincherâ€ ™ s first choice to play Jobs .
Bale and Boyle are set to shoot the film in spring 2015 .
Sorkin said that writing a film about Jobs â€œis a little like writing about the Beatles .
There are so many people out there that know him and revere him.â€ �"
2014-10-16,"In January 2010 , as Steve Jobs showed off the first iPad , the question that many asked was : what is it for ?
Why would people want a tablet that couldnâ€ ™ t run Windows desktop apps , as Microsoft had assumed they would when it first pushed the form factor in the early 2000s ?
Four years later , the answer seems clear - though the answer might not be much comfort at first to Tim Cook , Jobsâ€ ™ s successor .
In many cases , tablets including iPads have replaced the TV set , becoming a mobile form of entertainment thatâ€ ™ s a lot more convenient than a portable DVD player , and with a far better screen .
Overall , tablet ownership has rocketed from a standing start .
In the US , 44 % of households had one in January 2014 , according to Pew Internet ; Ofcom found the same figure at the same time .
But shipments have stalled .
After enjoying 78 % and 68 % growth in 2012 and 2013 , tablet shipments have slowed dramatically , so that Apple has seen year - on - year falls in tablet shipments in the first six months of 2014 , and is likely to report another for the three months
o the end of September when it reports results later this month .
As a market , tablet sales are forecast to grow only 6.5 % in 2014 , according to IDC , a research company .
So as Cook prepares to unveil the successor to last yearâ€ ™ s super - thin , light iPad Air , questions are being asked about the entire tablet category .
Gartner , another research company , reckons that this year tablets will have made up less than 10 % of device sales - mobile phones , PCs and tablets .
In part thatâ€ ™ s because mobile phone sales are so gigantic - 1.8bn total including basic featurephones .
Tablet sales are forecast to be 229 m this year , up from 207 m in 2013 , rising to 272 m in 2015 ; that would put them past â€œtraditionalâ€ � PCs ( desktops and laptops ) , which Gartner says will shift 276 m this year and fall to 261 m in 2015 .
By Gartnerâ€ ™ s measure , though , sales of PC - like â€œultramobilesâ€ � - like Microsoftâ€ ™ s Surface , with detachable keyboards - will rise from 37 m to 64 m in the same time , which gives the total â€œPCâ€ � market a lead over tablets .
This depends on definitions ; IDC , a rival research firm , puts ultramobiles into â€œtabletsâ€ � , and so has them overtaking PCs more quickly .
Brand struggles Itâ€ ™ s not only Apple that is struggling .
The tablet market has been brutally competitive from the start , but only Apple and Samsung â€ “ which supplied the screen for the first iPads and was among the first to market with Android tablets in autumn 2010 - have maintained significant share .
Itâ€ ™ s not clear how well Samsung is faring financially : at the launch of its latest top - end tablet , executives intimated that if this didnâ€ ™ t sell well , they would instead begin chasing the low - end market .
For the rest , much of the market is consumed by low - priced Chinese - made â€œwhite boxâ€ � tablets , which appear largely to be used to watch video content â€ “ either on YouTube , or â€œsideloadedâ€ � from computers .
That would bolster the statistic quoted at Google I / O by Sundar Pichai , who said that Android tablets made up 42 % of YouTube viewing - in line with the installed base of tablets .
â€œThe tablet market is separating into two - the branded side , which is slowing , and the low - cost which is continuing to grow , â€ � says Neil Mawston of Strategy Analytics , a global research company .
â€œThe branded side is struggling because itâ€ ™ s already taken the low - hanging fruit of people who had netbooks , who moved swiftly to tablets.â€
�
The question of what people do with tablets seemed to be answered , at least in part , by Ofcom last week , in a report which found that tablets were replacing TVs in the bedroom , with a third of children having their own , and over 60 % having access to one at home .
Half of those tablets were iPads , according to eMarketer .
That speaks to a dramatically fast uptake of tablets .
According to data collected by Horace Dediu , who runs the Asmyco consultancy , tablet adoption in the US has been faster than for any previous technology , including the smartphone , refrigerator or car .
But the problem facing Apple , and evident in its sales statistics , is that tablets donâ€ ™ t wear out as quickly as PCs , and if theyâ€ ™ re principally used to watch video , theyâ€ ™ re not as susceptible to forced upgrade cycles : social network apps and YouTube work as well on a four - year - old tablet as a brand new one .
â€œPeople have worked out what they want really do with tablets , and whether they really need one , â€ � says Francisco Jeronimo , smartphone and tablet analyst for IDC .
â€œThe thing is , if youâ€ ™ ve got a big smartphone , itâ€ ™ s running the same apps , then the tablet is the same except in most cases it hasnâ€ ™ t got a mobile connection .
Thereâ€ ™ s no real way the tablet can really replace the laptop.â€
�
That leaves growth at the cheaper , smaller - screened segment , where parents and schools buy for children , he suggests .
Apple isnâ€ ™ t , however , interested in cutting prices and hence profit margins in order to retain its market share .
Instead , it is looking around for new customers that are willing to pay its prices .
The most obvious untapped ones : businesses .
Big Blue deal So far , consumersâ€
™ eager adoption of tablets hasnâ€ ™ t been matched by businesses , where tablet uptake has been slower as they consider the possible benefits of products like the Surface , with its detachable keyboard and desktop chip .
But Cook has a plan there : in the summer Apple announced a deal with IBM , where â€œBig Blueâ€ � , usually known for mainframes and services , will begin pushing iPads and iPhones together with custom software as part of full service deals with its bigger customers .
â€œApple has done well in terms of persuading some board - level executives in various companies to adopt iPads , and the price point makes it easier for enterprises to afford than a low - income consumer , â€ � says Tim Coulling , senior analyst at Canalys .
â€œWith IBM , I expect they will go after vertical markets - specialist uses such as healthcare , retail point of sale , and so on.â€
�
But , Coulling adds , itâ€ ™ s still early days for the tablet in the business world .
â€œBusinesses are always slow to adopt new technology - look at how slowly theyâ€ ™ re moving with Windows.â€
�
Indeed , the PC marketâ€ ™ s uplift earlier this year was largely ascribed to companies replacing machines running Windows XP , last updated in 2008 .
Wonâ€
™ t those enterprise customers want something special ?
Such as a larger tablet ?
Rumours that Apple will make a bigger tablet - up to 12 in diagonally - have swirled for months .
As is standard , the company hasnâ€ ™ t commented , but expectations of a â€œProâ€ � tablet have some interested , even as others question whether it would take sales away from the Macbook line of computers .
JP Gownder of Forrester Research says : â€œan improved iPad Air is a certainty , and a 12.9â€ � iPad would be a competitor to the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 - and to the Mac.â€ � Cannibalising the Mac Would Apple introduce a tablet that might hurt its laptop line ?
Itâ€ ™ s never been reluctant to cannibalise its own lines : the iPad arguably subtracted from Mac sales , but Apple executives have repeatedly argued that there are more PCs to steal sales from than Macs ( which have a 5 % share of PC sales , though steadily rising as that market shrinks ) .
The â€œphabletâ€ � -sized iPhone 6 Plus with its 5.5 in screen will surely subtract from sales of the 7 in iPad mini - but Apple wonâ€ ™ t mind , because it makes more profit on the 6 Plus , and gets a customer who is likely to go for a two - year replacement cycle , rather than the three years of a tablet .
So the possibility of a bigger iPad - and perhaps productivity enhancements such as split - screen apps - seems strong .
Even so , as Cook prepares to take the stage in California to announce the new tablets - and new notebooks , and perhaps some entirely new category - the tablet market is in the doldrums for two simple reasons : most of the consumers who want one already have one , and businesses arenâ€ ™ t sure yet if they want one - or one thousand , or none .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t see the IBM deal having much impact before next year , â€ � says Jeronimo .
â€œApple will need to do something unique , perhaps tying it in with the Apple TV [ set - top box ] , doing something in software and services .
But this is definitely a very difficult time for Apple.â€
�
Steve Jobs might have thought that explaining the benefits of the iPad was tough .
But four years after the first one , it seems that explaining the benefits of a replacement iPad - or a new one - could be even tougher .
â€¢ Apple upstages its own launch as details of new iPads appear online â€¢
Appleâ€ ™ s Jony I ve : copying designs is â€˜lazy thievingâ€ ™"
2014-10-20,"The year was 1984 : Steve Jobs unveiled the first Macintosh computer , Prince Harry was born , we were all watching Ghostbusters and the average house price was a measly Â£33,000 .
It was also the year that ethical investing took off , with the launch of the first ever â€œgreenâ€ � fund , the F&amp;C Stewardship Growth Fund .
At the time , the Thatcherite City traders dubbed the launch â€œthe Brazil fundâ€ � â€ “ as they thought the idea was nuts .
But fast forward 30 years and investors can now choose from around 100 green and ethical funds that take a wide variety of approaches from investing in â€œgoodâ€ � causes such as human rights to avoiding â€œbadâ€ � practices such as animal testing .
But does all this choice mean ethical investing is easier â€ “ and more popular ?
According to Ethical Investment Research Services , once the 2013 figures are finalised the amount ethically invested in the UK is expected to exceed Â£13bn for the first time .
However , although screening processes have become increasingly advanced , ethical still accounts for only a tiny percentage of the total number of funds .
According to the Investment Management Association , in August just 1.2 % of the money invested in funds went into those with a specific ethical mandate â€ “ a figure that has remained practically unchanged for the past 10 years .
So what is â€˜ethicalâ€ ™ ?
Part of the reason the green revolution has yet to take hold may be that it is difficult to construct an investment portfolio that will replicate the ethical beliefs of an individual investor .
This is because ethical funds adopt different approaches â€ “ one fund may consider a stock ethical , another might not .
â€œNothing is straightforward , â€ � says Jason Hollands of financial planning group Tilney Bestinvest .
â€œWhile there are a handful of activities broadly recognised as â€˜unethicalâ€ ™ , such as tobacco or pornography , many are neither black nor white but shades of grey .
In certain areas , such as pharmaceuticals , there are fiercely differing and sincerely held views.â€ �
He cites the â€œemotiveâ€ � area of animal welfare .
â€œFunds managed by Kames Capital and Standard Life exclude all companies that test products on animals , but most others are allowed to invest in those that do for research into the treatment and cure of disease.â€ �
Some funds have â€œnegativeâ€ � screens that avoid certain sectors and stocks , such as gambling or weapons manufacturers , while others use a â€œpositiveâ€ � screening approach where they actively target companies which might make positive contributions to society or the environment .
F&amp;Câ€ ™ s ethical funds , which include its Stewardship Growth Fund ( or Responsible UK Equity Growth Fund as it is now known ) use a combination of both negative and positive screens , and over the years have moved away from the strict avoidance approach of the past .
Alice Evans , manager of the Stewardship International Fund , now the Responsible Global Equity fund , says : â€œOver time , screening processes have become much more sophisticated .
We no longer take the approach of blanket eliminating companies , so we might approve certain businesses because they are making huge leaps forward in making a positive contribution to the world.â€
�
Historically , pharmaceutical companies would have been excluded due to animal welfare , for example .
â€œNow , any companies which test on great apes are excluded , â€ �
she says .
â€œOtherwise we look for those which can demonstrate they have replaced , reduced or refined animal testing wherever possible.â€
�
A third approach is for funds to target â€œbest of breedâ€ � , says Patrick Connolly of advisers Chase de Vere .
â€œSome ethical funds wonâ€
™ t hold shares in oil companies because they do harm to the environment , while others will hold those oil companies that they consider â€˜best of breedâ€ ™ and think will cause less damage or look for greener solutions.â€
�
Check the facts
It is no wonder that ethical investing is still relatively small scale given the potential confusion from widely differing approaches to stock picking .
Do your own research by using websites such as yourethicalmoney.org , a consumer website of global ethical research company EIRIS and Ethical Consumer , a sort of ethical version of Which ? .
You can get an overview of the investment criteria of various funds but then you will need to take a detailed look at the prospectuses of the companies that catch your eye .
If all this sounds too time consuming or complicated you might want to take professional advice .
â€œIf investors want to be sure their money will not go into funds whose holdings include particular issues , they should consult an IFA able to do a screening exercise which matches their ethical concerns , â€ � says Robin Keyte , chartered financial planner at IFA Keyte Financial Planners .
â€œThere is a nationwide network of such IFAs called the Ethical Investment Association ( ethicalinvestment.org.uk).â€ � Patrick Henry , 42 , who lives in south - east London , took advice from Chase de Vere before moving his pension pot .
Henry , a curator , lives with his partner , Laura Parker , 31 , and holds three Alliance Trust funds : the Sustainable Corporate Bond Fund , the Sustainable Future Managed Fund and the Sustainable Future UK Growth Fund .
â€œI wanted to avoid the oil industry , the arms industry and big tobacco companies , â€ � he says .
â€œItâ€ ™ s easy not to think about the implications ,
but I think we all need to take responsibility for the impact these industries have.â€
�
What are the returns ?
However good an investorâ€ ™ s intentions , any decisions are unlikely to be taken without considering performance .
Perhaps , surprisingly , many ethical funds have proved the returns can easily keep up with , and even better , those of conventional funds .
According to investment research company Morningstar , the average ethical fund has returned 2.76 % over the past year , compared with 2.19 % from the average performing fund in the UK All Companies sector .
Five - year performance figures show the average ethical fund returned 42.87 % , compared with 55.4 % from the average performing UK All Companies Fund .
One of the top - performing over both a one- and five - year period is the First State Asia Pacific Sustainability Fund , which has returned 15.64 % over the past year , and 95.38 % over the past five years .
This is in the Asia Pacific Excluding Japan IMA sector .
In the UK All Companies sector , the top - performing ethical fund over one and five years is the Premier Ethical Fund , which has returned 8.60 % over a year , and nearly 75 % over five years .
However , investors must be aware of the risks , says Connolly .
â€œEthical portfolios will tend to be skewed toward mid and small cap companies , as they are less likely to be causing any harm or damage , which can make these portfolios more volatile.â€ � â– Good Money Week , formerly National Ethical Investment Week , starts today and aims to raise awareness of sustainable , responsible and ethical finance .

After 30 years of F&amp;Câ€ ™ s range of ethical funds being known as Stewardship funds , investors will now have to get used to calling them â€œResponsibleâ€ ™ .
In March , Friends Life , which owns the Stewardship brand , announced it would transfer Â£12.2bn of assets from F&amp;C to Schroders by the end of this year .
These include the Stewardship life and pension funds .
The retail OEIC funds still belong to F&amp;C and wonâ€ ™ t be moving .
The changes mean that F&amp;C can no longer use the Stewardship name , so the three F&amp;C Stewardship OEIC funds have been rebranded â€œResponsibleâ€ � .
Customers were notified in September and they came into effect on 10 October .
The F&amp;C Stewardship Growth Fund is now called the F&amp;C Responsible UK Equity Growth Fund , while the F&amp;C Stewardship Income Fund is the F&amp;C Responsible UK Income Fund .
The F&amp;C Stewardship International Fund has been renamed the F&amp;C Responsible Global Equity Fund .
The F&amp;C Ethical Bond Fund has also been renamed and will now be known as the F&amp;C Responsible Sterling Bond fund .
A spokesman for F&amp;C said it was otherwise â€œbusiness as usualâ€ � for investors in these funds ."
2014-10-22,"Beats was nearly a brand worn on the feet rather than the head .
According to the company co - founder and now Apple employee Jimmy Iovine , the genesis of the Beats headphone brand with rap star Dr. Dre originally started with the idea of making trainers .
Accepting an award at the Revolt music conference in Miami , Florida , the 61-year - old Iovine on Tuesday used the spotlight to talk about Steve Jobs , Beats headphones and to say that the distribution of music must be improved otherwise music is likely to lose its inherent value in society .
â€œI met Steve Jobs and the team at Apple , and I thought : this is where cool lives right now .
The party is at Steveâ€ ™ s house , â€ � explained Iovine .
â€œThis was a man who understood the lyrics , who understood the music , who understood The Beatles and Bob Dylan , but who also in a visionary way , truly understood lifestyle and technology .
â€œIn other words , this was a great and dangerous man who I quickly decided to make my friend.â€ �
Iovine was a key player in the negotiations over the setup of Appleâ€ ™ s iTunes Music Store in 2003 , when he was at Interscope , a label inside Universal Music .
After discussions with Jobs , he backed the idea of licensing per - song downloads , and pressed Doug Morris , Universalâ€ ™ s head , to sign with Apple .
â€˜Letâ€
™ s not do sneakers
â€ “
letâ€ ™ s do speakersâ€
™ Years later Dre was approached by his own lawyer Peter Paterno , who suggested setting up a trainer brand to expand Dreâ€ ™ s personal business with merchandise .
Dre told Iovine , who decided sneakers werenâ€ ™ t where the future lay for music brand expansion .
â€œThe shining example of Steve Jobs and his company stuck in my head , â€ � Iovine explained .
â€œI said , â€˜Dre , letâ€ ™ s not do sneakers
â€ “
letâ€ ™ s do speakers.â€ ™ â€ � Beats originally saw Iovine and Dre team up with Monster , then primarily a cable manufacturer .
Beats later split from Monster , and was bought by Apple in May for $ 3bn , the iPhone makerâ€ ™ s largest - ever acquisition .
Beats had also developed a streaming music service , Beats Music , before the Apple purchase , promising on - demand music curated by music professionals and critics .
That was an attempt to change the way music was distributed , but Iovine believes more is needed .
Donâ€ ™ t stop the music â€œThe great artists of music have always innovated and boldly changed the game , but the industry itself has not , â€ � he explained .
â€œToo often , the music business allowed third - party companies to innovate for us â€ “ and that simply does not work any more.â€
�
Apple was one of those companies ; from its opening in April 2003 , the iTunes Music Store became the largest music vendor online or offline in the US by 2008 .
â€œWe must face the fact that our delivery and distribution systems are too sterile and not compelling enough for a new generation of young people who love music in their own way , â€ � warned Iovine .
â€œIf we donâ€
™ t fix the distribution of music , we run the risk of music being sent out into the world in such an uninspired way that music loses its value â€ “ and not just its financial value , but even worse , its emotional value too â€ “ and therefore its position as arguably the most dominant art form going forward .
â€œLadies and gentleman , the time has come for the music business itself to innovate.â€ �
Despite once being part of the music industry , Iovine now has different allegiances as an Apple employee .
Apple hasnâ€ ™ t said yet what it will do with Beats : â€œWe closed the Beats transition in July and weâ€ ™ re off to a great start with some wonderful plans weâ€ ™ ll share with you in the future , â€ � was all that chief executive Tim Cook would say in the recent quarterly earnings call .
Apple is however expected to apply downward pressure on music subscription prices by lowering Beats Music contracts to $ 5 a month , pushing music labels for more extensive price cuts to achieve that price .
The most valuable iTunes users spend an average of $ 60 buying music downloads in a year , which equates to $ 5 a month .
But many people buy far less , and so canâ€ ™ t be tempted with subscription packages that cost more .
With the shift to streaming , though , Apple risks losing those download buyers to rival companies such as Spotify .
Appleâ€ ™ s argument is that pricing subscription services at $ 5 a month will mean labels earn the same amount of money as they would from music purchasers .
â€¢ Apple will not shut down Dr Dreâ€ ™ s Beats Music but could fold it into iTunes"
2014-10-23,"Christian Bale will play Steve Jobs in an upcoming biopic of the Apple co - founder , according to the filmâ€ ™ s writer , Aaron Sorkin .
Bale was the favourite to play Jobs after Leonardo DiCaprio left the project earlier this month .
Other actors previously linked to the role included Matt Damon and Bradley Cooper .
â€œWe needed the best actor on the board in a certain age range and thatâ€ ™ s
Chris Bale , â€ �
Sorkin told Bloomberg .
Sorkin , the Oscar - winning screenwriter of The Social Network , has reportedly delivered a script that plays out three key scenes from Jobsâ€ ™ s life in real - time .
Each one takes place backstage at an Apple product launch .
â€œ[Bale ] has more words to say than most people have in three movies combined , â€ � said Sorkin .
â€œThere isnâ€ ™ t a scene or a frame that heâ€ ™ s not in .
So itâ€ ™ s an extremely difficult part and he is gon na crush it.â€
�
Sorkinâ€ ™
s take will be directed by Danny Boyle and is based on Walter Isaacsonâ€ ™ s Steve Jobs : The Exclusive Biography , the bestselling official biography of the tech genius .
Isaacsonâ€ ™ s book , which featured interviews with more than 100 family members and colleagues , was published shortly after Jobs died on 5 October 2011 of complications arising from pancreatic cancer .
The Bale - Sorkin - Boyle collboration follows the 2013 film Jobs , in which Ashton Kutcher took the title role .
A more traditional biopic , it charted the rise of the computer wizz from college dropout to the man with everyoneâ€ ™ s number .
It was panned by critics on its release , with New York Magazineâ€ ™ s
Bilge Ebiri calling it â€œthe equivalent of a feature - length slow clapâ€ � ."
2014-10-30,"Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi has leapfrogged Lenovo and LG to become the third - largest smartphone manufacturer in the world behind Samsung and Apple .
Xiaomi is commonly described as â€œChinaâ€ ™ s Appleâ€ � and founder Lei Jun as â€œthe Chinese Steve Jobsâ€ � , yet the company is only four years old and did not release its own smartphone until 2011 .
Research firms IDC and Strategy analytics both now place Xiaomi in overall third place for smartphone shipments in the third quarter of 2014 , more than tripling shipments year - on - year overtaking South Koreaâ€ ™ s LG by between 0.4 m and 1.2 m smartphones .
â€˜Star performerâ€
™ â€œXiaomi was the star performer in the quarter , capturing a record 6 % marketshare and rising into third place in the global smartphone rankings for the first time ever , â€ � said Neil Mawston , executive director of Strategy Analytics .
â€œXiaomiâ€ ™ s Android smartphone models are wildly popular in the Chinese market and it shifts millions of them every quarter through its extensive online and operator channels.â€ � â€œXiaomiâ€ ™ s next step is to target the international market in Asia and Europe , where it may face stronger headwinds of low brand awareness and technology - patent challenges next year , â€ � explained Mawston .
Xiaomi shipped 17.3 m smartphones in the third quarter , 5.3 % of the 327.6 m total global shipments , according to data from IDC .
In the same period , Samsung shipped 78.1 m smartphones and Apple 39.3 m , while Lenovo shipped 16.9 m and LG 16.8 m , which IDC describes as a tie due to the variability in the data .
Strategy Analytics places Samsung first with 79.2 m smartphones , Apple in second with 39.3 m , Xiaomi in third with 18 m and LG in fourth 16.8 m out of a total 320.4 m smartphones sold in the third quarter .
â€˜Still room to competeâ€ ™ â€œXiaomi , Lenovo , and LG Electronics â€ “ all posted market - beating growth and with markedly different strategies , â€ � said Ramon Llamas from IDCâ€ ™ s mobile phone research group .
â€œThis shows that there is still room to compete in this market , whether it be in the low end as Lenovo has done , at the high end where Xiaomi competes , or in both as LG Electronics has shown.â€ � Shipments of smartphones are slowing to single - digit growth in developed markets , such as the UK and US , where smartphone penetration is reaching around 80 % .
The majority of smartphone sales in the UK are customers replacing an existing smartphone rather than picking one up for the first time .
However , global smartphone shipments are still increasing thanks to developing markets such as India and China , which are still growing at 30 % collectively according to IDCâ€ ™ s data .
â€˜Challenge has now become how to make moneyâ€ ™ â€œIn these markets , smartphone price points are making mobile computing possible where we once expected feature phones to remain dominant.â€
� explained Ryan Reith , program director of IDCâ€ ™ s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker .
â€œThis is great news for overall volumes , but the challenge has now become how to make money on devices that are quickly becoming commodity products .
Outside of Apple , many are struggling to do this.â€ �
Samsung announced its lowest quarterly profit in more than three years due to poor performance from its smartphone division despite being the worldâ€ ™ s largest smartphone manufacturer .
Samsung Mobile is the companyâ€ ™ s biggest business , but it has seen stiff competition from Apple , LG , HTC and Sony at the high end and Chinese manufacturers at the low end .
Xiaomi has found success in China , but its expansion into markets outside its home country has seen issues around privacy .
India recently warned its military not to use the Chinese smartphones over fears of data snooping , which prompted Xiaomi to state that it never collects user data without permission and to set up an Indian data centre .
The company has also begun moving non - Chinese data out of Beijing and onto data centres run by Amazon .
The Chinese smartphone company has also faced criticism with a reputation for copying the designs of other companies .
Appleâ€ ™ s chief designer Jony I ve recently hit out at Xiaomiâ€ ™
s alleged copying dismissing suggestions of flattery saying â€œI think it is really straightforward .
It is theft and it is lazy .
I donâ€
™ t think it is OK at all.â€ �
But Xiaomi has made efforts to be more appealing to the west , hiring key executives from Google , including the outspoken Brazilian vice president of Android Hugo Barra , who became Xiaomiâ€ ™ s head of international sales .
Xiaomi has announced plans to expand this year to more than a dozen fast growing markets , including Malaysia , Indonesia , India Thailand , Russia , Turkey , Brazil and Mexico .

2014-10-31,"Seth Rogen is in early talks to play the Apple co - founder Steve Wozniak in a high profile biopic of Steve Jobs , according to the Hollywood Reporter .
Christian Bale is in line to play Jobs himself , the famed technology guru who died on 5 October 2011 of cancer .
The Oscar - winning writer of Facebook movie The Social Network , Aaron Sorkin , is writing the screenplay for Britainâ€ ™ s Danny Boyle to direct .
Rogenâ€ ™ s appointment is said to be in no way a done deal , especially given that Bale has not yet signed on the dotted line .
The Canadian star of This Is the End and Neighbours is best known for his work in comedic fare , and would be taking a rare step into the dramatic spotlight with the untitled biopic .
Sorkinâ€ ™ s take is effectively the â€œofficialâ€ � Jobs biopic , since it adapts the bestselling official biography of the technology icon , Walter Isaacsonâ€ ™ s Steve Jobs : The Exclusive Biography .
Isaacsonâ€ ™ s book is based on more than 40 interviews with its subject conducted over two years , as well as interviews with more than 100 family members , friends , adversaries , competitors and colleagues .
A rival biopic , titled Jobs , was released in 2013 with Ashton Kutcher as the Apple founder and Josh Gad as Wozniak .
It received mostly negative reviews and was not a hit at the box office ."
2014-11-04,"Christian Bale has become the second high - profile Hollywood star to decide that the role of the late Apple technology guru Steve Jobs is not for him , according to the Hollywood Reporter .
The Oscar - winning Welshman was revealed as producersâ€ ™ first choice for the biopic last month when screenwriter Aaron Sorkin described him as â€œthe best actor on the board in a certain age rangeâ€ � and hinted the signing was a done deal .
But Bale now follows Leonardo DiCaprio in deciding to pass on the movie , which is being directed by Danny Boyle .
The latest departure adds to the sense of a revolving door phenomenon at Sony Pictures , which has been trying to put the film together for two years .
Bale was previously first choice for the role of Jobs prior to Leonardo DiCaprio moving briefly into the hot seat .
David Fincher was in line to direct prior to Boyleâ€ ™ s appointment but left in April following a reported dispute about his proposed $ 10 m ( Â£6.25 m ) paycheque .
Sorkin , the Oscar - winning screenwriter of Sonyâ€ ™ s The Social Network , has previously said he envisages a biopic comprised of just three scenes , shot in real time .
Each snapshot of Jobsâ€ ™ s life would take place just before a vital product launch .
Sony intends to move the biopic into production this winter , but Boyle has not yet confirmed his cast , according to reports .
Seth Rogen remains in discussions to play Apple co - founder Steve Wozniak , but has not yet received an offer ."

Itâ€ ™ s not a genre , but more like a door to condescension .
By adding the prefix , it sidelines R&amp;B itself by implying itâ€ ™ s not experimental , boundary - pushing or intellectual .
It throws side - eye at the genre , while at the same time claiming to have discovered something worthy within it .

Seth Rogen remains in discussions to play Apple co - founder Steve Wozniak , with Boyle due in Los Angeles this week to meet potential members of his cast .

2014-11-11,"Elton John has spoken out against Russian homophobia during a concert in St Petersburg .
The singer criticised the fact that the cityâ€ ™ s statue of Apple founder Steve Jobs had been taken down following revelations that the companyâ€ ™ s current CEO , Tim Cook , is gay .
John expressed concern that â€œif we start punishing people for that , the world will lose its humanityâ€ � .
According to a post on the singerâ€ ™ s Facebook page , John told the crowd : â€œHow dignified that St Petersburg should erect a memorial to Steve Jobs , the remarkable founder of Apple .
But last week it was labelled â€˜homosexual propagandaâ€ ™ and taken down !
Steveâ€ ™ s memory is rewritten because his successor at Apple , Tim Cook , is gay ? !
Does that also make iPads gay propaganda ? !

He continued : â€œAs a gay man , Iâ€ ™ ve always felt so welcome here in Russia .

2014-11-14,"On Monday 17 July 2000 , the graphics card company ATI put out a press release telling people to watch out for its Rage and Radeon cards in three new iMac computers to be unveiled by Steve Jobs , then Appleâ€ ™ s chief executive , in his keynote at Macworld in New York the coming Wednesday .
On the Wednesday , Jobs did show off new iMacs - but ATI and its Radeons were absent .
Furious at having his thunder stolen , Jobs had removed ATI and Radeon from the keynote , Apple press releases , its booths and the machines themselves .
â€œSteve has been so careful to hide any details - even the smallest of details such as the number of new products to be announced , â€ � a company source told ZDNet at the time .
â€œSomething like this can really ruin things.â€ �
Though Apple under Tim Cook seems a calmer place , getting things wrong can have similarly disastrous fallout - as the executives at GT Advanced Technologies ( GTAT ) , until last year a little - known maker of solar power systems in New Hampshire , found over the past three months .
A $ 578 m deal signed between Apple and GTAT in November 2013 looked as though it would not only bring sapphire screens to iPhones , but also create thousands of jobs in the US , salving a sore point with legislators critical of Appleâ€ ™ s use of foreign assembly for almost all its products , especially the iPhone and iPad .
But it ended in October 2014 with GTAT filing for bankruptcy , hundreds of people put out of work , and GTATâ€ ™ s chief executive and chief operating officer facing questions about insider dealing after they sold millions of dollars worth of GTAT stock before Appleâ€ ™ s iPhone announcement in September .
As quickly became clear , the new iPhones donâ€ ™ t have sapphire screens , leading some to ask if the stock sales were triggered by insider knowledge about GTATâ€ ™ s worsening financial position .
Apple wanted sapphire screens - and at scale GTATâ€ ™ s downfall also gives a tantalising glimpse into what might have been .
Apple wanted sapphire - a super - hard , very transparent crystal which can be made industrially and has to be cut with diamond - coated wire - for camera lenses and the Touch ID sensor on iPhones and iPads , and also for its forthcoming Watch , due for release in spring 2015 .
But itâ€ ™ s clear it also wanted it for millions of phones - and had the GTAT deal succeeded , Apple would have cornered the market for cheap sapphire , giving itself a notable lead over rivals such as Samsung , which boasts super - AMOLED screens that it makes and uses exclusively .
Though Kyocera of Japan and the super - expensive Vertu offer sapphire screens , neither makes them in the gigantic numbers that Apple does for its iPhone .
Cornering supplies is often key for companies trying to control a market .
In 2005 , Apple bought up huge amounts of flash memory for its iPod Nano music player - shutting most rivals out .
It demanded an exclusivity arrangement with Toshiba , maker of the 1.8 in hard drive in the first iPod .
Though it doesnâ€ ™ t actually own any factories , Apple pours gigantic amounts of money - about $ 12.5bn in the past four quarters - into â€œplant , property and equipmentâ€ � , the majority equipping its suppliers to make its products .
( It is spending about $ 3bn - nearly as much as chipmaker Intel , though far less than Samsung Electronics , which has factories making screens , hard drives , and memory chips as well as phones , tablets and computers .
Apple can make or break a supplier
The reality is that Apple , as the most valuable company on Earth by market capitalisation , now has the power to make or break a company through its supplier relationships ( unlike Jobsâ€ ™ s pique , which had minimal effect on ATI ) .
Being known as a supplier to it has definite value , one company - which is listed in Appleâ€ ™ s top 200 list - told the Guardian : â€œThe value lies in the fact that Apple is recognised as having a high - quality build spec , so a relationship reflects well on that supplierâ€ ™ s products , â€ � an executive said .
And even if Apple doesnâ€ ™ t name a company as a supplier , its name will still leak out , as one supplier executive explained to the Guardian : â€œTech analysts always â€˜tear
downâ€ ™ a new model
â€ “ components are usually stamped with the suppliersâ€ ™ names inside .
Reviews of new phones will mention key components with regard to performance enhancement.â€
�
The executive didnâ€ ™ t want to be named - or to have their company named .
He said that isnâ€ ™ t unusual : â€œNone of the top players let their suppliers talk about supplying them â€ “
itâ€
™ s too competitive an industry to allow this.â€ �
The Guardian contacted a number of suppliers to Apple ; all indicated that they could not talk on the record .
In that sense , GTAT was unusual , because its supplier relationship was so public .
On paper , the deal looked like a marriage made in heaven .
The â€œmulti - yearâ€ � deal was in effect a loan to operate 2,600 of sapphire furnaces ( which Apple would own ) in a disused 1.3 m square foot factory in Mesa , Arizona and another in Salem , New Hampshire .
Then Apple tweaked the deal : GTAT would buy 2,036 furnaces , borrowing the money from Apple ; in return it would only supply Apple , and nobody else in the consumer electronics market .
But as the forecast volumes and revenues strongly indicate , it also wanted GTAT to begin making sapphire iPhone screens .
Apple declined to comment on whether GTATâ€ ™ s sapphire production would have been used for phone screens .
Through the Apple deal , GTAT expected revenues to double GTAT , meanwhile , had joined the stock market in 2012 , but increasing competition pushed it into loss .
In February 2013 , seeking new revenue streams , it took a booth at Mobile World Congress , where it showed off a sapphire screen overlay - put over an iPhone 5 - that withstood whacks from pieces of concrete while a similar glass cover using Corningâ€ ™ s Gorilla Glass was soon scratched and battered .
Apple , which had begun using sapphire in 2012â€ ™ s iPhone 5 camera lens and was now preparing to use it in the 5Sâ€ ™ s Touch ID , got in touch .
In July 2013 , GTAT was profiled by Greentechmedia as â€œselling solar equipment and survivingâ€ � , and â€œone of the more mature solar companies that most people havenâ€ ™ t heard ofâ€ � .
GTAT was sure it had the magic element that was needed to go beyond that : the ability to make enough sapphire to cover millions of smartphone screens .
Announcing its ( loss - making ) third - quarter results in November 2013 , GTATâ€ ™ s business had three branches : polysilicon , making about 75 % of revenues ; photovoltaic , about 10 % ; and sapphire crystals , about 15 % .
But unveiling the Apple deal , GTAT said it expected in 2014 that total revenues would more than double to between $ 600 m and $ 800 m , compared to the $ 290m-$320 m for 2013 .
Crucially , the sapphire segment would rocket to â€œapproximately 80 % of the yearâ€ ™ s total revenueâ€ � .
That would mean between $ 480 m and $ 640 m in sapphire revenues , compared to about $ 45 m in 2013 .
Expectation that the deal would pay off saw GTATâ€ ™ s share price double between November 2013 and March 2014 .
The company would produce up to 200 m sapphire phone screens , estimates said A forecast of a tenfold increase in sapphire sales makes it highly unlikely that GTAT was only going to make screens for the Apple Watch , and camera and Touch ID lenses .
Neither company has ever said what the plan was .
But the February 2013 demonstration , and ambitious scale of the Mesa plant , indicates that sapphire screens were the aim .
Ralph Gutierrez , GTATâ€ ™ s chief executive , made encouraging noises in February 2014 about progress ; independent calculations suggested it could produce enough sapphire for between 100 m and 200 m phone screens .
( Apple sold 153 m iPhones in 2013 . )
In March , Corning , which had made previous iPhone screens , betrayed its nervousness in its results call , dismissing sapphire as too expensive , not that much better than glass , and prone to shattering instead of cracking if dropped .
However , court documents released in the past two months show that GTAT found Appleâ€ ™ s supplier terms onerous .
Targets were ambitious - to make 262 kg cylindrical â€œboulesâ€ � of pure sapphire , twice as large as it had made before , in four times as many furnaces , operating at full capacity within seven months of the contractâ€ ™ s signing , in a seven - year exclusive deal .
Apple crushed GTAT with the terms of the deal
But GTAT faced an uphill battle almost immediately .
Apple offered a lower price for the sapphire than GTAT expected , and wouldnâ€ ™ t budge - meaning GTAT was selling its sapphire at a loss .
It faced a $ 650,000 fine if it let another company use one of the $ 200,000 furnaces ; a $ 640,000 fine if it sold a 262 kg boule of sapphire ( worth $ 20,000 ) to a rival ; a $ 320,000 fine for late boule delivery ( or $ 77 per millimetre of sapphire ) .
Apple , though , could cancel a purchase at any time .
Plus a $ 50 m - thatâ€ ™ s million - â€œbreach of confidenceâ€ � liability if GTAT disclosed any of the agreements ; but Apple was under no such liability .
Daniel Squiller , GTATâ€ ™ s chief operating officer , said that when GTAT queried the many terms in the contract - and their clear tilt in Appleâ€ ™ s favour - it was told â€œsimilar terms are required for other Apple suppliersâ€ � .
The key problem was yield .
GTAT couldnâ€ ™ t get the furnaces to make sapphire in the amount and quality required .
If it had , the average price of sapphire would have been low enough that Apple could have used it for phone screens , and GTAT would have been handsomely rewarded .
Instead , Squiller complains that Apple wouldnâ€ ™ t let GTATâ€ ™ s staff choose the tools for working the boules , and that nearly a third of the staffâ€ ™ s time was spent interacting with a delegation from Apple from its supply chain , manufacturing and quality engineering team .
Reports surfaced in July that GTATâ€ ™ s production had hit an obstacle .
Doubts grew .
Apple refused to pay the next loan installment By mid-2014 , progress was so bad that Apple refused to pay GTAT the second instalment of the payment .
That quickly caused a cashflow crisis for the company as it tried to pay a workforce , fix the furnaces , and achieve ignition on the deal .
Squiller said in a court affidavit on 28 October that the losses were â€œlargely due to actions not within [ GTATâ€ ™ s ] control.â€ �
He said GTAT spent $ 900 m on the work , of which Appleâ€ ™ s loan only covered $ 439 m .
And it would still have to repay Apple , which in the event of non - payment could foreclose on the furnaces and sell them to recover its loan .
Apple , and the city of Mesa , bore responsibility too , argue GTATâ€ ™ s executives : the first phase of factory construction wasnâ€ ™ t finished until December 2013 , leaving just six months to be at full capacity , and there were problems with power supplies to the giant site which caused a crucial three - month delay , and Appleâ€ ™ s refusal to have power backups for the furnaces led to some failures that held it up , Squiller argued .
GTAT chose bankruptcy to release itself from Apple deal Gutierrez meanwhile sold stock in the first three days each of May , June and July ; GTAT has said the timings had been agreed in March , and were not impromptu .
In May , Squiller sold 116,000 GTAT shares then worth $ 1.2 m - after Apple had refused to make the final $ 139 m loan payment in April .
He later sold $ 750,000 worth of stock ahead of GTATâ€ ™ s bankruptcy filing at the start of October .
On 9 September Cook showed off the new phones - without sapphire screens .
By 10 September GTAT stock was down 25 % to $ 12.78 ; by Friday 3 October it stood at $ 11.05 .
On Monday 6 October , GTAT filed for Chapter 11 , and its stock plummeted to $ 0.80 .
Trading ceased on 15 October .
Squiller says in the deposition that GTAT put itself into Chapter 11 bankruptcy ( which protects a company from its creditors ) simply to release itself from the Apple deal - and hence save the company .
The US manufacturing success story -
that never happened Are such onerous terms unique to Apple , I asked another of its suppliers ?
â€œThe leading handset manufacturers all have strong pricing power vis - a - vis their suppliers , but that is universal across most industries , â€ � its executive said .
â€œAs a supplier , one needs to find a USP [ unique selling point ] that the customer values enough to pay for it.â€ �
And would they take a loan from Apple ?
Are they offered on better or worse terms than a bankâ€ ™ s ?
â€œWe have good cash flow and a robust balance sheet so do not have need of loans from any customers
, â€ � the executive replies , cautiously .
For Apple , meanwhile , the loss of one supplier is not the end of the world .
It reverted to Corning for its screens , with Phil Schiller talking of their â€œion - strengthenedâ€ � qualities .
The story of GTAT shows us what might have been : iPhones with sapphire screens , and a successful US - based manufacturing story .
It also shone a light on the desperate struggle to implement new technology at a global scale - and the penalties for failure ."
2014-12-10,"Angry and passionate email exchanges between major Hollywood players have been exposed by the recent hack into Sony Pictures .
Producer Scott Rudin and Sony Pictures co - chairman Amy Pascal were working together on a biopic of Steve Jobs written by Aaron Sorkin , until the studio pulled out last month .
Progress had already been fairly tortuous , with David Fincher pulling out as director , then Christian Bale as star â€ “ they were replaced with Danny Boyle and , tentatively , Michael Fassbender .
Universal have now picked up the project .
In the wake of Sonyâ€ ™ s decision to leave the film , Rudin reportedly emailed Pascal to tell her : â€œYouâ€ ™ ve destroyed your relationships with half the town over how youâ€ ™ ve behaved on this movie , and if you donâ€ ™ t think itâ€ ™ s true , wait and see ...
you donâ€ ™ t deserve one exhalation of breath on your behalf .
Youâ€ ™ ve behaved abominably and it will be a very , very long time before I forget what you did to this movie and what youâ€ ™ ve put all of us through.â€ �
The pair had worked together on critically and commercially successful movies like The Social Network and Captain Phillips ; Rudin has won an Oscar , Grammy , Emmy and Tony for his productions .
Thanks to sifting by the Defamer blog , the emails reveal the arguments began back in February , after Angelina Jolie wanted Fincher to direct her in Cleopatra , rather than take on the Jobs film .
Rudin tells Pascal to â€œshut Angie down before she makes it very hard for David to do Jobs.â€ �
Despite acknowledging Cleopatra could be a â€œbig commercial hitâ€ � , Rudin then escalated his opposition to the film , writing : â€œThere is no movie of Cleopatra to be made ( and how that is a bad thing given the insanity and rampaging ego of this woman and the cost of the movie is beyond me),â€ � referring to Jolie .
â€œWatch how you talk to me , â€ �
he says to Pascal , prompting her response :
â€œDonâ€
™ t fucking threaten me.â€
�
Another Rudin email also attacks Jolie , calling her a â€œa minimally talented spoiled brat who thought nothing of shoving this off her plate for eighteen months so she could go direct a movie [ Unbroken ] ...
Sheâ€ ™ s a camp event and a celebrity and thatâ€ ™ s all and the last thing anybody needs is to make a giant bomb with her that any fool could see coming.â€ �
Other titbits include a conversation about Michael Fassbender for the part of Jobs â€ “ Michael DeLuca , president of production at Sony studio Columbia , writes that Fassbenderâ€ ™ s role in Shame â€œjust makes you feel bad to have normal - sized male genitalia.â€ �
David Fincher meanwhile told Pascal that the casting of Adam Driver in Star Wars was a â€œterrible idea , â€ � while Rudin also attacked Her and True Grit producer Megan Ellison , calling her a â€œbipolar 28 year old lunaticâ€ � .
Conversations with agents were also revealed , as stars including Tom Cruise , Charlize Theron , Matthew McConaughey and Leonardo DiCaprio were put forward for roles in the Jobs film .
In the end , the Sony - Jobs deal seems to have fallen apart thanks to lack of financing from partners including Ellison and New Regency , with Sony exec Doug Belgrad finally telling Pascal : â€œI love the script
but I canâ€ ™ t do this to the company.â€ �
In other emails raked over by the Wall Street Journal , Pascal said that Marvel considered featuring Spider - Man in its upcoming Captain America sequel , and that Marvel and Sony would collaborate on a new Spider - Man trilogy
â€ “ the talks later broke down , with Sony going alone with the character .
Possible plans now include an animated adventure helmed by the creators of The Lego Movie .
The hacked emails were revealed as a result of an attack by the group Guardians of Peace , who have demanded that Sonyâ€ ™ s upcoming North Korea - baiting comedy The Interview go unreleased ."
2014-12-14,"When hackers attacked Sony Pictures recently , the greatest fears of Hollywood studio executives â€ “ and surely the wildest dreams of their assistants
â€ “ came true .
Thanks to the as yet unidentified , reputedly but actually probably not North Korean hackers , juicy details of executive salaries and executive emails have been thrown open for all to see .
Here are five things we have learned so far : Hollywood executives are mean â€ ¦
An email exchange between producer Scott Rudin and Sony Pictures co - chairman Amy Pascal involved a spirited discussion about Angelina Jolieâ€ ™ s desire to have David Fincher direct her in Cleopatra , instead of Fincher taking on a film about Apple mogul Steve Jobs .
Rudin did not want Jolie , whom he called â€œa minimally talented spoiled bratâ€ �
getting involved with the production of the Jobs film .
Laboring the point , Rudin , went on to say that the â€œbratâ€ � â€œthought nothing of shoving this off her plate for 18 months so she could go direct a movie [ Unbroken ] â€
¦ Sheâ€ ™ s a camp event and a celebrity and thatâ€ ™ s all and the last thing anybody needs is to make a giant bomb with her that any fool could see coming.â€
�
â€ ¦ and casually racist â€ ¦
Pascal , while discussing a breakfast at which she would be meeting President Barack Obama , asked Rudin : â€œShould I ask him if he like DJANGOâ€ �
â€ “ a reference to the Quentin Tarantino film Django Unchained , which is about a freed slave .
She continued with this line , asking if she should see if he liked Lee Danielsâ€ ™
The Butler , about a black man who served eight US presidents , and Think Like a Man , an ensemble romantic comedy featuring many prominent black actors .
Think Like a Man actor Kevin Hart spoke out against the comments , as did TV megastar Shonda Rhimes , who called the exchange â€œracistâ€ � .
â€
¦ and they donâ€ ™ t get paid the same â€ ¦
Sonyâ€ ™ s chief executive , Kazuo Hirai , makes about $ 1.5 m .
Nine executives below Hirai made as much , or more , than their boss , including Sony movie studio executive Michael Lynton , who made $ 3 m .
â€ ¦ and female actors are paid differently too
Emails showed that Jennifer Lawrence made less than her male co - stars in American Hustle .
In an email exchange between executives , it becomes clear that Lawrence is making less .
â€œYou may recall Jennifer was at 5 ( amy was and is at 7 ) and WE wanted in 2 extra points for Jennifer to get her up to 7 .
If anyone needs to top jennifer up itâ€ ™ s megan .
BUT I think amy and Jennifer are tied
so upping JL , ups
AA.â€ �
â€œAAâ€ � and â€œAmyâ€ � are Amy Adams , the filmâ€ ™ s other female lead ; Megan is Megan Ellison , head of the company that financed the film with Columbia .
They also gently bend scripts to suit foreign markets For The Interview , a comedy about assassinating the supreme leader of North Korea , Kim Jong - un , executives considered making the ending less violent .
In an email to Hirai , Pascal wrote : â€œThere is no face melting , less fire in the hair , fewer embers on the face , and the head explosion has been considerably obscured by the fire , as well as darkened to look less like flesh.â€ �"
2015-01-28,"Danny Boyleâ€ ™ s long - gestating biopic of the late technology guru and Apple founder Steve Jobs has finally begun shooting in San Francisco with Michael Fassbender in the lead role .
The as - yet - untitled film , working from a screenplay by the Oscar - winning writer of The Social Network , Aaron Sorkin , has been through numerous painful permutations on its way to getting the green light .
It was originally a Sony production with David Fincher directing Leonardo DiCaprio , then Christian Bale , in the lead .
But the final version sees Boyle and Fassbender working with rival studio Universal .
Fincher withdrew in April following a reported dispute about his proposed $ 10 m ( Â£6.25 m ) paycheck .
There were also suggestions in leaked emails released following Decemberâ€ ™ s Sony cyber - attack that he walked away under pressure from Angelina Jolie , who was hoping to secure his services for her long - planned Cleopatra movie .
DiCaprio followed suit in October , by which time Boyle had come on board , and replacement Bale jumped ship a month later just prior to Sonyâ€
™ s controversial decision to pass on the project .
Joining Fassbender in the final cast are Kate Winslet as former Macintosh marketing chief Joanna Hoffman , Seth Rogen as Apple co - founder Steve Wozniak and Jeff Daniels as former Apple CEO John Sculley .
The film also features Katherine Waterston , Michael Stuhlbarg , Sarah Snook , Adam Shapiro , and child actors Perla Haney - Jardine , Ripley Sobo and Makenzie Moss in supporting roles .
It is understood Sorkinâ€ ™ s unorthodox three - act structure remains in place .
The screenwriter , who has adapted Walter Isaacsonâ€ ™ s bestselling Steve Jobs :
The Exclusive Biography , previously said he envisages a biopic comprised of just three scenes , each shot in real time and taking place just before a vital Apple product launch .
Reports suggest the final sequence will be set in 1998 with the unveiling of the first iMac .
Jobs died on 5 October 2011 of cancer .
An earlier biopic , titled Jobs , was released in 2013 with Ashton Kutcher as the Apple founder and Josh Gad as Wozniak .
It received short shrift from critics and struggled at the box office ."
2015-02-13,"The old photos show a young man , white shirt rolled at the sleeves and wearing a small bow tie , waving his arms excitedly as he gave a conference speech in Aspen in the summer of 1983 .
This was Steve Jobs , six months away from launching the first Macintosh .
Twenty - four years before the first iPhone ; 27 years before the first iPad .
That day in Aspen , Jobs predicted the evolution of a new digital distribution system .
It would be a little like a record store , he said , where software would be downloaded over phone lines .
Jobs saw apps and app stores coming .
Apps emerged from early PDAs , through the addictively simple game Snake on the Nokia 6110 phone , to the first 500 apps in the Apple App Store when it made its debut in July 2008 .
Matthew Panzarino , co - editor of TechCrunch , has charted three phases of app development that took mobile technology from telephony to gaming and utilities , to apps that wanted to be your â€œhome screenâ€
� and dominate your experience , to apps armed with content that â€œare more about maximizing their usefulness without dominating your attention.â€
�
So what comes next ?
The volume of content produced is going to lead us towards managing our apps in a different way .
The most persuasive concept is the idea of the â€œcardâ€ � â€ “ a design treatment you can already see on Twitter and Facebook across different devices â€ “ and which allows content to be aggregated and presented to the user in a consistent way .
Secondly , mobile is moving out of the pocket and becoming wearable .
With the growth of wearable tech , the need for intelligent aggregation of content will fuel app innovation .
One possible future is that apps as we know them will eventually cease to exist at all â€ “ being replaced by brand names and services that give you actionable insights throughout the day .
Imagine a customised newsfeed full of the services you use â€ “ presented at the right time .
Think of how Google Now might evolve , for example .
Thirdly , the idea of multiscreen will become â€œevery - screenâ€ � .
App developers wonâ€ ™ t design for desktop and mobile any more .
They will design a single experience that will stretch across any internet connected terminal .
That brings us back to the concept of cards and how content presented in this way could work well for users on almost any type of screen and be meaningful .
So the future of the app may be no future at all as we move to an era of seamless connectivity and experience wherever we are and whatever device we use .

The AACTAs are Australiaâ€ ™ s version of the Academy Awards , and the day before we speak , Sarah Snook won one for best lead actress .
Her remarkable dual - gender performance in time - travel thriller Predestination â€ “ directed by Australiaâ€ ™ s Spierig brothers â€ “ beat Mia Wasikowska ( for Tracks ) and Essie Davis ( for The Babadook ) , but Snook is in California working on Danny Boyleâ€ ™ s Steve Jobs film with Michael Fassbender .
Thanks and everything Australia , but needs must .

Adapted from Robert A
Heinleinâ€ ™ s 1958 short story
All
You Zombies , Predestination is a loopy action thriller and a bold , bizarre calling card for Snook , who plays a female born with both reproductive organs , surgically forced to switch gender .
Starring with Ethan Hawke , she steals the show as both the pretty , fresh - faced teenage girl and the angry , grizzled man she becomes .
Both Jane and John wear their hearts on their sleeves , and Snook â€ “ like a Claire Danes or Jessica Chastain â€ “ is arresting ,
her big desperate eyes demanding compassion whether sheâ€ ™ s radiating love or hate .
She brings to the film a brittle vulnerability and deep sadness ; you feel her pain .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re not used to talking about such a moving performance inside a genre film , â€ � says Hawke of his co - starâ€ ™ s performance .
â€œAnd here it is , in the middle of this crazy - ass genre film , this young woman giving this incredible performance .
There are critics who think itâ€ ™ s two actors .
Theyâ€ ™ ve said : â€˜Whoâ€ ™ s the young DiCaprio lookalike?â€ ™ â€ �
The Spierigs had discussed casting a male and a female to take on Jane and John , but Snook was determined to prove she could do both , auditioned , and got the parts .
From there , she did research into being transgender and intersex , plus gender - reassignment issues , speaking to male friends about their thoughts and behaviour .
â€œItâ€
™ s very easy to say that men think about things more simply , but it kind of is true , â€ � she laughs .
â€œAnd thatâ€ ™ s not actually a bad thing .
Approaching things in a more logical , practical fashion .
This is a massive generalisation , but women tend to think about things more first , then act afterwards .
I was speaking to a friend who made a female - to - male transition recently , about the physiological change when she started taking testosterone supplements .
She said : â€˜I now understand what people mean when they they say theyâ€ ™ re so angry they could kill someone , because thatâ€ ™ s exactly what I suddenly felt.â€ ™ Itâ€ ™ s chemical .
Itâ€ ™ s fascinating.â€ � Snook was raised in Adelaide , and moved to Sydney at 18 to study drama .
Graduating in 2010 , she got TV work immediately , then in 2012 appeared in the film Not Suitable For Children , a romantic comedy about a guy who gets testicular cancer .
Hollywood found her quickly : she made it to the final three to play Lisbeth Salander in David Fincherâ€ ™
s
The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo , and scored the lead in Clementine , an ABC pilot about a criminal with supernatural powers .
Last year , she starred in horror film Jessabelle , and recently replaced Isla Fisher in revenge drama
The Dressmaker , appearing alongside Kate Winslet .
Right now , though , sheâ€ ™ s in San Francisco with Boyle and Fassbender .
Snook plays Andrea Cunningham , the influential PR who began working with Jobs on the 1984 Apple Macintosh launch .
â€œYeah ,
itâ€ ™ s very amazing ,
â€ �
she says of the gig .
â€œIâ€

â€œI totally know about this .

2015-02-17,"Kanye West is nothing if not tenacious when it comes to breaking into the fashion industry .
His latest strategy ?
Telling Gap that he should be the companyâ€ ™ s new creative director or â€ “ to use a recurring West metaphor â€ “ â€œIâ€ ™ d like to be the Steve Jobs of the Gapâ€ � .
â€œWhen
I say Steve Jobs of the Gap , â€ �
he told Style.com , â€œas
I talk to the people at the Gap right now ,
Iâ€ ™ m not talking about a capsule .
Iâ€ ™ m talking about full Hedi Slimane creative control of the Gap is what I would like to do .
And I can say this because it doesnâ€ ™ t conflict with my Adidas contract.â€
�
This isnâ€ ™ t Westâ€ ™ s first overture to Gap â€
“ in 2013
he approached them but â€œcouldnâ€ ™ t get past the politicsâ€ � .
What is tantalising , this time , is that in theory it could actually happen .
West has just launched a collection for Adidas , receiving a tentative critical thumbs up .
The ailing Gap is currently short of a creative director , having cut ties with Rebekka Bay last month .
Bay â€ “ the woman who successfully launched Cos â€ “ was hired two years previously to bring fashion nous to the US chain , but her nuanced approach did not work on a multinational scale .
A West - helmed Gap , though , could be genius .
Hereâ€ ™ s why : 1 .
A brave new look
Judging by his collection for Adidas , Westâ€ ™ s Gap would involve sportswear and hosiery .
Specifically , an apocalyptic Flashdance vibe with Prada - influenced wrinkly knees on tights .
There is not enough of this on the high street .
2 .
The references West would be unafraid to pay clear homage to fellow designers rather than resorting to the usual esoteric designer cliches .
â€œYou know my fucking influences , â€ � he told Style.com : â€œYou see Raf Simons right there , you see Helmut [ Lang ] , you see
[ Martin ] Margiela , you see Vanessa [ Beecroft ] , you see Katharine Hamnett .
Itâ€ ™ s blatantly right there .
Iâ€ ™ m not going to try and act like I was influenced by a fucking dog walking down the street that broke its ankle that I had a heartfelt discussion with .
I had a heartfelt discussion with all of these fucking Helmut Lang images that I stared at for so many years .
I had a heartfelt discussion with my Tumblr.â€ � 3 .
Mediocrity ?
Nah
There are normal clothes and there is aspirational faux - normal fashion â€ “ a distinction West understands .
He can not abide mediocrity , saying : â€œI just feel like weâ€ ™ ve been hit with this barrage of extreme medium .
And you never go and ask , â€œHey , can I get an extreme medium?â€ � Gap , on the other hand , was pilloried for its â€œdress normalâ€ � advertising campaign , which attempted to capitalise on the â€œnormcoreâ€ � trend for understated dressing in a series of adverts that made even Anjelica Huston look a bit boring .
As in actually boring , not fashion boring .
Got it ?
4 .
He used to work in Gap
In 2004â€ ™ s Spaceship , West spoke of working at Gap .
â€œLetâ€ ™ s go back , back to the Gap / Look at my check , wasnâ€ ™ t no scratch /
So if I stole , wasnâ€ ™ t my fault /
Yeah I stole ,
never got caught /
They take me to the back and pat me / Askinâ€ ™ me about some khakis /
But let some black people walk in /
I bet they show off their token blackie

letâ€ ™ s put him all in the front of the store

So I quit , yâ€ ™ all welcome.â€

Clearly it didnâ€

Democratic design Having courted the rarefied side of fashion â€ “ that critically panned Paris fashion week collection in 2011 ; his work with APC in 2013 â€ “ Westâ€ ™ s current stance is to focus on the mainstream : â€œIâ€ ™ m only concerned with making beautiful products available to as many people as possible , â€ �

2015-03-09,"Apple has announced that its first smartwatch , the Apple Watch , will start at $ 349 for the smaller model and $ 399 for the larger , and be available to pre - order and preview in the US and Europe on April 10 , and available to buy from April 24 .
The price of the watch rises to more than $ 10,000 for the solid gold Apple Watch edition .
Chief executive Tim Cook took to the stage in at the Yerba Buena Center in San Francisco to demonstrate Appleâ€ ™ s first completely new product since the death of founder Steve Jobs .
The Watch will act as a second screen for an iPhone , showing customisable watch faces , texts , calls and other notifications , as well as running widget - style apps powered by the smartphone connected over Bluetooth .
It will be controlled by a dedicated iPhone app , that allows users to change settings , manage notifications and apps .
Watch face options include a range of analogue and digital faces , as well as a licensed Micky Mouse face , where the cartoon characterâ€ ™ s arms become the hands of the watch .
Wearers will be able to reply to messages via voice dictation or voice recording , or by using short canned responses that can be customised using the companion iPhone app .
But Apple said that the watch will also enable new forms of communication between Apple Watch users , including the ability to remotely tap on a recipients wrist through the watch , and the ability to stream another userâ€ ™ s heart beat in vibrations on the watch .
The back of the watch contains an optical heart rate monitor , which logs a userâ€ ™ s heart rate throughout the day and plugs directly into the companyâ€ ™ s Health app .
An accelerometer will also monitor activity , much like a fitness band , and remind users to get up and walk around if sat for an extended period of time .
The watches fitness features were one of the three major functions of the watch cited by Apple CEO Tim Cook , who said that â€œin addition to being a beautiful object , the Apple watch is the most advanced timepiece ever created ; itâ€ ™ s a revolutionary way to connect to others ; and itâ€ ™ s a comprehensive health and fitness companion .
â€œWe make products that enhance peopleâ€
™ s lives , and the Apple Watch carries that to a new level .
[ It ] tracks your daily movement , and it even reminds you if youâ€ ™ ve been sitting too long .
â€œItâ€ ™ s like having a coach on your wrist.â€ �
But Cook also highlighted the ability of developers to create their own apps for the watch â€ “ albeit currently only when subordinate to an iPhone app .
â€œThat is really just the beginning , because you will also learn that you can pay with apple pay , you can view your photos , and you can control your music .
You can interface with Siri just using your watch , and , one of my favourites , you can receive notifications on
Apple Watchâ€
¦
so you can keep track of your favourite sports teams
, you can connect to social media , and you can keep track of the daily news right at the moment it happens.â€ �
The watch , the brainchild of Appleâ€ ™ s chief designer Sir Jony I ve , is available in three separate versions and in two sizes , one with a 38 mm case and one with a larger 42 mm case ; the larger size is $ 50 more for the base model .
Neither will use industry standard watch straps , but Apple has many different straps and colours available allowing users a degree of customisability .
Given the vast array of models , the full pricing for the watches is as follows :
Apple Watch Sport , 38 mm : $ 349 Apple Watch Sport , 42 mm :
$ 399 Sapphire and steel Apple Watch
38 mm : $ 549 - $ 1049 , â€œdepending on your selection of watch
bandâ€ � Sapphire and steel Apple Watch
42 mm : $ 599 - $ 1099
Gold Apple Watch Edition : starts at $ 10,000
The Apple Watch was first announced in September last year alongside two new larger iPhones , the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus .
The watch is designed to be paired with an iPhone , including older models as old as the iPhone 5 .
Similar to Googleâ€ ™ s Android Wear smartwatches , the Apple Watch does not have phone capabilities , instead relying on the paired iPhone for an internet connection .
Apple said that the watch will also rely on the iPhone for heavy processing duties for running apps reducing impact on battery life of the watch .
Most competing smartwatches , including those from Samsung , will last over a day .
Sonyâ€ ™ s Android Wear Smartwatch 3 , for instance , can last three days of normal use before charging , while the Samsung Gear S lasts well over a day .
Apple said that the watch will last a day per charge ( specifically , â€œ18 hoursâ€ � of typical use ) and so needs to be charged overnight using its magnetic charging cable .
Cook demonstrated features of the Apple Watch , including its â€œDigital Crownâ€ � that acts like a jog dial for zooming and scrolling and the watchâ€ ™ s detection of gentle or forceful taps , which can trigger different actions .
Cook also showed off a collection of apps from third parties , tapping Appleâ€ ™ s large developer community for killer features to convince customers that they need a smartwatch that is essentially an expensive accessory for a smartphone .

2015-03-13,"Steve Jobs rejected an offer of a liver transplant from Tim Cook in 2009 , a new biography of the late Apple co - founder reveals .
Despite becoming increasingly ill from cancer , Jobs angrily turned down the proposal by the man who would go on to run Apple after he died .
â€œHe cut me off at the legs , almost before the words were out of my mouth , â€ � said Cook .
â€œâ€˜No , â€ ™
[ Jobs ] said .
â€˜Iâ€ ™ ll never let you do that .
Iâ€ ™ ll never do thatâ€ ™
.â€ �
The revelation is made in Becoming Steve Jobs , by Fast Company executive editor Rick Tetzeli and co - author Brent Schlender , published later this month .
The incident , which underlines the closeness of the relationship between the two men , showed how selfless Jobs was , according to Cook .
â€œIt was : â€˜No , Iâ€ ™ m not doing that!â€ ™
He kind of popped up in bed and said that .
And this was during a time when things were just terrible .
Steve only yelled at me four or five times during the 13 years I knew him , and this was one of them , â€ � Cook said .
Jobs , who suffered from a rare type of pancreatic cancer , went on to receive a liver transplant in 2009 .
He took a six - month medical leave of absence that year , and another period in mid - January 2011 before stepping down as chief executive in August .
He died in October 2011 aged 56 .
The book also reveals the close friendship between Jobs and Bob Iger , chairman and chief executive of the Walt Disney Company , in the final yars of his life .
His relationship with Iger had become so strong that Steve had wanted Iger to join the Apple board , which Iger couldnâ€ ™ t do for fiduciary reasons .
In fact , because of their friendship , Iger also turned down an invitation from Sergey Brin , Larry Page , and Eric Schmidt to be on Googleâ€ ™ s board .
â€œHe told me heâ€ ™ d get jealous , â€ � says Iger .
Jobs served on the board of Disney until his death .
Iger went on to become an Apple director after Jobs died ."
2015-03-15,"Having tackled the Scientologists in his most recent film Going Clear , documentary maker Alex Gibney takes on a cult that is even more ardent , and with considerably more members â€ “ that of Apple .
His unsparing portrait of Steve Jobs will prove extremely displeasing to devotees , but itâ€ ™ s a riveting and important corrective to the myths Jobs helped to propagate , and which in the four years since his death have proved as seductive as his machines â€ “ and a lot more durable .
Gibneyâ€ ™ s film comes ahead of the forthcoming Jobs biopic , directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin .
That film is said to comprise of three acts , each set just before one of Jobsâ€ ™ s presentations , but Gibney sets about zeroing in on certain aspect of Jobsâ€ ™ s life to paint a compelling portrait of a modern - day Citizen Kane .
Jobs , a die - hard Bob Dylan fan whom Gibney paints as a product of 60s counterculture , was set alight by early â€œblue boxâ€ � hacking technology , which allowed users to make long distance phone calls without paying for them , a way Jobs could delightedly stick it to the Man .
Yet this man , whose belief in his own righteousness was unshakeable , also terminated Appleâ€ ™ s philanthropic programmes , presided over huge corporate tax evasion , paid Chinese workers making iPhones a pittance , and only stumped up maintenance for his first daughter after dragging his ex - girlfriend through the courts , claiming that she was promiscuous and he was infertile , until a DNA test proved otherwise .
Finally , he agreed to pay $ 500 a month â€ “
he was worth $ 200 m at the time .
The film also spends some time on the 2010 incident when a drunk engineer lost a next - generation iPhone 4 prototype in a San Francisco bar , and the man who found it sold it to Gizmodo , who splashed its secrets around the world .
Jobs , just one year from death from pancreatic cancer , enacted a revenge that included the police battering down of the door of the journalistâ€ ™ s house .
Gibney presents footage of an ailing Jobs justifying such Mafia - style vengeance on the grounds that not to do so would be a betrayal of Appleâ€ ™ s values .
But what were these values ?
Gibney traces Jobsâ€ ™ s
love of the hippy set text
Be Here Now and his journeys to India , before Jobs concluded that he was most fulfilled in the Japanese walled gardens of Zen Buddhism .
Jobs took on Zenâ€ ™ s minimal design , and applied it to Apple with world - eating success , but the spiritual dimension was beyond him .
Aged 18 , Jobs had knocked on the door of Buddhist monk Kobun Chino Otogawa and said that he believed he was enlightened , but didnâ€ ™ t know what to do with it .
The monk , who died in 2002 , asked for proof , and Jobs returned with a chip from a PC , a first computer he would name Lisa , after the daughter he had fought so hard not to acknowledge .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s brilliant , but heâ€ ™ s too smart , â€ � was the monkâ€ ™ s conclusion .
The film points out that Jobsâ€ ™ s genius was in personalising computers â€ “ Lisa being the first â€ “
but it also reveals that this impulse came from a pretty messed - up place .
As well as being deeply ambivalent about being a father , Jobs also felt at once rejected and anointed by the fact that he was adopted .
Jobs has somehow transmitted that mess to us too .
Our iPhones connect us to faraway friends and family , yet we spend increasing amounts of time alone with them , seduced by machines that can never really fulfil us .
Gibneyâ€ ™ s film concludes that Jobs had the monomaniacal focus of a monk but none of the empathy of one , and it makes a powerful case .
Jobsâ€ ™ s was an astonishing life of such significance that it will probably be studied for centuries , and Gibney does not downplay his genius .
Yet the kernel of the film is probably the ex - girlfriend who says that Job â€œblew itâ€ � .
How so ?
Jobs achieved things that the vast majority of us would never dream of .
Yet Gibneyâ€ ™ s film forensically anatomises the contradictions , the ruthlessness , and the pointlessly crappy behaviour that reveal Appleâ€ ™ s ideals to be a sham , even while the products themselves continue to prove almost irresistible ."
2015-03-16,"Appleâ€ ™ s head of internet software and services , Eddy Cue , has hit out publicly against the new Steve Jobs :
Man in the Machine biopic calling it â€œinaccurate and mean - spiritedâ€ � .
Documentary - maker Alex Gibneyâ€ ™
s
unsparing portrait of Apple co - founder Jobs is unlikely to please fans , zeroing in on certain aspects of his life , painting a compelling portrait of a modern - day Citizen Kane .
A public outburst , such as Cueâ€ ™ s tweet , is highly unusual for a senior executive at a company with a history of strongly controlling its messaging .
The film portrays a man with unshakable righteousness , and goes over Appleâ€ ™ s 2010 incident of the lost iPhone 4 prototype , which was acquired by technology site Gizmodo , as well as Jobsâ€ ™ control of phone production in China , and Appleâ€ ™ s philanthropic programmes .
For Cue , none of the biopics and biographies have yet captured Jobs correctly :
â€œThe best portrayal is about to be released â€ “ Becoming Steve Jobs ( book ) .
Well done and first to get it right.â€ �
Since his death various movies and books have been written and made , most recently an adaptation of Walter Isaacsonâ€ ™ s authorised biography Steve Jobs , which is written by Aaron Sorkin , directed by Danny Boyle and starring Michael Fassbender as Jobs .
The film is due for release in the summer ."
2015-03-20,"As the youngest actress to ever receive six Oscar nominations at the age of 33 , Kate Winsletâ€ ™ s CV offers up a long list of fine performances .
Admittedly , given a recent run of questionable choices ( from Movie 43 to Labor Day to this weekâ€ ™ s
YA sequel The Divergent Series : Insurgent )
, it would be tempting to suggest that sheâ€ ™ s peaked early , but with roles in Danny Boyleâ€ ™ s Steve Jobs biopic and Australian thriller The Dressmaker on the way , weâ€ ™ re expecting a return to form .
For now , here are five excellent reminders of why sheâ€ ™ s such an Academy favourite : Heavenly Creatures In Peter Jacksonâ€ ™ s haunting true crime drama , Winslet gave a stunning breakout performance that took her from starring in one episode of Casualty to becoming one of the most sought after actresses in Hollywood .
She arrives in the film with remarkably obnoxious confidence in this scene , where she makes an enemy of her new French teacher after correcting her in front of the class .
Sense and Sensibility Winslet displayed her ability to convey heartbreak , something which would crop up throughout her career , with effortless ease in Ang Leeâ€ ™ s 1996 period saga .
After receiving an unexpected â€œDear Johnâ€ � letter , we see her romantic hope collapse around her .
Her gradual realisation of what sheâ€ ™ s being forced to give up was an early sign that sheâ€ ™ d be a dependable weeper .
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Playing a free - spirited eccentric with a variety of hair colours , Winsletâ€ ™ s Oscar - nominated role in Michel Gondryâ€ ™ s
sci - fi take on a breakup was an unexpected career move .
But , in a similar way to Helena Bonham Carterâ€ ™ s corset - trashing role in Fight Club , she proved to be perfect casting and showed herself to be impressively versatile .
This brief but beautifully orchestrated moment has a brutally honest speech being surprisingly rewarded with acceptance .
Little Children
Throughout the noughties , Winslet pretty much cornered the market on sexually repressed housewives with lofty aspirations and Todd Fieldâ€ ™ s adaptation of Tom Perrottaâ€ ™ s suburban satire was proof of why .
She was awarded another Oscar nomination for playing an intellectual trapped by vapidity and this scene shows her first , somewhat misguided , attempt to break free .
Revolutionary Road
A darker take on a similar character ,
Winsletâ€ ™ s turn in 2008â€ ™ s devastating Richard Yates adaptation was cruelly overlooked by the Academy for more perfunctory drama in The Reader .
But her brutal dynamic with co - star Leonardo DiCaprio allowed for a range of uncomfortably well - observed marital arguments which come to a head in this horrifically worded showdown ."
2015-03-26,"Tim Cook is planning to give away all of his near $ 800 m fortune before he dies , the Apple boss said in a surprisingly frank interview , in which he also described his sexuality as a â€œyawnerâ€ � .
Cook , 54 , who took over as Apple chief executive from Steve Jobs in 2011 , told Fortune magazine that he planned to donate all of his wealth to charity after providing for his 10-year - old nephewâ€ ™ s education .
Cook , who has spoken publicly about the importance of stopping HIV / Aids and climate change , as well as championing human rights and equality , did not specify which causes he would support but said he had already begun donating money quietly .
He said he would develop a systematic approach to philanthropy , rather than just writing cheques .
Fortune estimated that Cook holds $ 120 m worth of Apple shares and a further $ 665 m of restricted stocks .
Cook follows other high - profile executives in giving their money away .
In 2010 , Warren Buffett and Microsoft co - founder Bill Gates launched the Giving Pledge , an appeal to billionaires to give at least 50 % of their wealth to charity .
Tesla chief executive Elon Musk , former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg , Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg and eBay founder Pierre Omidyar have all signed up .
Cook has previously spoken of his affection for his nephew .
In a speech last year , he said : â€œI have a nephew that I dearly love thatâ€ ™ s 10 , and when I look at him , and when I think of leaving a world thatâ€ ™ s not as good as when I entered it ,
thereâ€
™ s no bigger sin than that.â€ �
In 2012 , Cook donated $ 50 m to Stanford hospitals , near Appleâ€ ™ s Silicon Valley headquarters , including $ 25 m for a new childrenâ€ ™ s hospital .
He also gave $ 50 m to Product Red , a charity working to combat Aids , tuberculosis and malaria , according to Silicon Valley website the Verge .
Cook also spoke about his decision to come out as gay last year â€ “ making him by far the most influential gay business executive as head of the worldâ€ ™ s most valuable company .
He said he made the decision to come out â€œquite some time agoâ€ � and that his announcement was viewed internally at Apple â€ “ where most people already knew he was gay â€ “ as a â€œyawnerâ€
� .
However , Cook said making his sexuality public knowledge was difficult because he is a very private and guarded about his personal life .
â€œTo be honest , if I would not have come to the conclusion that it would likely help other people , I would have never done it , â€ �
he said .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s no joy in me putting my life in view.â€ �
In the interview , Cook also took a strong line on investors trying to make a quick buck out of Appleâ€ ™ s rising share price .
â€œThe kind of investors we seek are long term because thatâ€ ™ s how we make our decisions , â€ � he said .
â€œIf youâ€ ™ re a short - term investor , obviously youâ€ ™ ve got the right to buy the stock and trade it the way you want .
Itâ€ ™ s your decision .
But I want everybody to know thatâ€ ™ s not how we run the company.â€

Earlier this week , a financial analyst predicted that Apple could soon become the worldâ€ ™ s first trillion dollar company .
Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald on Monday said they thought Appleâ€ ™ s shares â€ “ which are currently trading at about $ 127 , valuing the company at $ 733bn â€ “ could soon be worth $ 180 each , which would value the iPhone maker at $ 1.05tn .
It would be the first time any company had ever been valued at more than $ 1tn , and would make Apple more valuable than the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of Indonesia , the Netherlands or Saudi Arabia , according to World Bank statistics .
It would also mean Apple would be worth 2.6 times as much as Google , the second most valuable company in the US , with a market valuation of $ 383bn ."
2015-04-04,"Not long ago it seemed like Tim Cook faced an impossible task emerging from the shadow of Steve Jobs , his lauded predecessor as Apple CEO .
Yet over the last year or so , and especially in recent weeks , the contrast between Cook and Jobs â€ “ who died of cancer in 2011 â€ “ has appeared starker than ever .
The evidence can be found in business decisions such as Cookâ€ ™ s effort to bolster Appleâ€ ™ s music streaming service â€ “ Jobs thought users preferred to own individual songs â€ “ but also in the current CEOâ€ ™ s far greater emphasis on social justice and political causes .
A few days ago , Cook â€ “ who last year publicly came out as gay , the first Fortune 500 CEO to do so â€ “ wrote a strongly worded editorial for the Washington Post condemning anti - LGBT legislation in states such as Indiana .
Jobs , by contrast , guarded his own privacy so zealously that he was somewhere between circumspect and misleading when it came to acknowledging the extent of his cancer .
And whereas Jobs was never keen to throw his weight behind political causes , Cook has been outspoken about user privacy , speaking before Barack Obama at a White House - organized cybersecurity summit in February , and warning that governments or companies encroaching on an individualâ€ ™ s right to privacy risk â€œdire
consequencesâ€ � .
Cook has also upped Appleâ€ ™ s philanthropic efforts considerably , with Apple giving more than $ 40 m to the Thurgood Marshall College Fund , and matching $ 25 m in employee financial contributions to charities since Cook become CEO .
On a personal level , Cook has also said he plans to eventually give away most of his wealth to charity .
In addition to his push on music streaming , Cook has made other product decisions that reverse trends of the Jobs era , such as introducing bigger iPhones , closer in size to tablets , something Jobs had resisted .
IBM was an old foe of Jobs , one to which he once literally gave the finger , yet Cook last year reached a deal for Apple to collaborate with IBM on business software for the iPhone and iPad .
As UBS Apple analyst Steve Milunovich said , Cook â€œalso has helped improve conditions for supply chain workers [ and ] shifted data centers to renewable energy sourcesâ€ � , something â€œit is hard to see Jobs undertaking with much gustoâ€ � .
Milunovich added : â€œIt appears that Jobs knew what he was doing in picking Tim Cook as his successor and telling Cook to be his own man .
Cook has maintained basic beliefs while tackling issues Jobs might have shied away from , such as capital return and worker conditions .
â€œWhile many have been concerned that Jobs is irreplaceable and few would disagree , Cook has successfully moved the company forward in his own style : soft on the outside , hard on the inside.â€ �
With its soon - to - be - released smartwatch , Apple is preparing to venture into a major new product area as it prepares to mark its 40th anniversary next year .
That moment will serve to highlight the kind of company Apple has become today and the recent changes it has undergone under Cook .
â€œReplacing Steve Jobs was an impossible task , and certainly many of us believed Apple would never be the same without Steve , â€ � said Michael Cusumano , a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management and co - author of the forthcoming Strategy Rules : Five Timeless Lessons from Bill Gates , Andy Grove and Steve Jobs .
â€œI do believe itâ€ ™ s not the same company today , but enough of Steveâ€ ™ s legacy is still there in terms of how it thinks about design and users .
And Tim has shown himself to be an extraordinarily competent chief executive .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s apparently reduced some of the chaos , got people to cooperate more , heâ€ ™ s spent more time on process and
heâ€ ™ s clearly driving efficiency.â€ �
But Cusumano cautions that on developing new products , the jury is still out .
â€œWhether he can push the breakthrough innovations like Steve â€ “
thatâ€ ™ s still an open question.â€
�
The Apple Watch is a high - wire moment , and is already raising eyebrows over the high price tag ( $ 17,000 ) at the top end of what will be a range of watches running specially developed apps .
Jobs himself once said Cook is â€œnot a product person , per seâ€ � , according to Walter Isaacsonâ€ ™ s Jobs biography .
The company that helped bring personal computers to the mass market has , with the watchâ€ ™ s focus on high fashion over the once - mooted health - related innovations , left itself open to criticism that it is now happy to make products mostly for big spenders .
Perhaps the price of the watch will come down over time .
Or perhaps it will end up as Appleâ€ ™ s version of the Amazon Fire Phone â€
“ a me - too product the company decided it wanted to have before it really settled on why .
And if the watch fails , Appleâ€ ™ s board and shareholders may find themselves asking whether Cook truly is the right man for the job ."
2015-05-06,"Like so many other products of the UK education system , I went into business without any entrepreneurial experience or training .
Nothing I learned during my schooling prepared me in any meaningful way for the realities of running a company .
Nor did I have the natural genius of a Steve Jobs or a Richard Branson ; the ability to say â€œscrew it ,
letâ€ ™ s do itâ€ � and damn the consequences .
Every first - time entrepreneur will be aware of their shortcomings and inexperience , and will have their own strategy for correcting these deficits .
Part of the satisfaction of being an entrepreneur is finding solutions for yourself , yet if I were advising any first - time entrepreneur Iâ€ ™
d recommend the three principles that have served me well : education , discipline and information .
Education can only begin once you have identified and prioritised the core areas where youâ€ ™ re lacking .
Any new entrepreneur should outline the key skills they need to be an effective founder , and give themselves an honest score out of 10 .
The key is then to gain access to these skills , either through hiring or finding mentors with the right experience and expertise .
Not every founder is immediately ready to start hiring , which is why
itâ€ ™ s so important to pick up the phone and build a network of mentors .
At the time I found this daunting , but I was amazed by how many specialists will be generous with their time and expertise .
Mentors might be motivated by kindness , a desire to apply their own research or because they think your idea is a good bet for the future .
Donâ€ ™ t be shy â€ “ pick up the phone : the worst anybody can do is say no .
Discipline , my second principle , was hardest to ingrain but most critical to success .
It requires you to focus with incredible precision on your strategic priorities for each day , week , month or quarter .
Itâ€ ™ s tempting to focus on the easy jobs , but if you do then youâ€ ™ ll find yourself working incredibly â€œbusyâ€ � days where nothing actually gets accomplished .
Instead , identify your top three priorities â€ “ the ones that affect your immediate business goals â€ “ and focus exclusively on them .
Itâ€ ™ s easier said than done , but with practice and the right support
( I find Trello an invaluable organisational tool ) , youâ€ ™ ll find yourself controlling your business more than it controls you .
Every stage of business poses new challenges that must be quickly mastered â€ “ from subsidies and new business pipelines in the early days , to staff acquisition and fundraising as the business finds its feet .
The best method of learning new disciplines is to consume as much relevant information as possible .
Given the work that we do â€
“ Signal is a market intelligence agency
â€ “ weâ€ ™ re at an advantage when it comes to cutting through the noise .
However access to data alone isnâ€ ™ t enough , itâ€ ™ s how this new knowledge is applied that will shape the success of an enterprise .
And this is where a â€œjack - of - no - tradesâ€ � CEO can develop their own killer USP : becoming chief learning officer .
This enables the new CEO to carve out an essential role as the repository and channel for information within a company .
They build their own knowledge while simultaneously helping to shape the culture of education and development within their business .
This approach has enabled us to create a culture where information and education is valued .
The advantage is that training isnâ€ ™ t formalised and employees compelled to take part .
Instead , we hire people who are hungry for knowledge and development , who are constantly reading or visiting research teams , conferences and universities to find the next big thing in their field .
Iâ€ ™ d always hire someone who is young , inexperienced but enthusiastic â€ “ as I was when I started â€ “ rather than someone who didnâ€ ™ t fit our culture .
When I founded my business I had an idea
but I didnâ€ ™ t have a role .
By taking on the mantle of chief learning officer , I made a virtue of my own lack of experience , enabling me to develop a culture where knowledge and personal development are valued throughout my business .

2015-05-17,"Steve Jobsâ€ ™ vision of Apple products helping to change the world has come true , Apple chief executive
Tim Cook said on Sunday , thanks to iPhone cameras enabling people to capture instances of injustice on film .
Cook was delivering the commencement speech at George Washington University , in Washington DC .
â€œHis vision for Apple was a company that turned powerful technology into tools that were easy to use , tools that would help people realize their dreams and change the world for the better , â€ �
Cook said of Jobs , Appleâ€ ™ s co - founder who died in 2011 .
â€œOur products do amazing things , and just as Steve envisioned , they empower people all over the world , â€ �
Cook continued .
â€œPeople who are blind and need information read to them because they canâ€ ™ t see the screen .
People for whom technology is a lifeline because they are isolated by distance or disability .
â€œPeople who witness injustice and want to expose it .
And now they can , because they have a camera in their pocket all the time.â€

In one recent , high - profile instance , a video recorded by a bystander in South Carolina showed a white police officer shooting Walter Scott , a 50-year - old black man , eight times in the back as he ran away .
The officer , Michael Slager , was charged with murder .
In his 20-minute speech , Cook spoke about growing up in southern Alabama , where former governor George C Wallace blocked school doors to prevent blacks from enrolling .
According to Cook , Wallace â€œembraced the evils of segregationâ€ � .
â€œMeeting my governor was not an honor for me ,
â€ �
Cook said .
â€œMy heroes in life were Dr Martin Luther King and Robert F Kennedy , who have fought against the very things that Wallace stood for .
â€œKeep in mind that when I grew up , I grew up in the place where King and Kennedy were not held in high esteem .
When I was a kid , the south was still coming to grips with its history .

Cook said that when he was 16 , shaking hands with Wallace felt like a betrayal of his own beliefs .
He impressed upon the students that â€œinjustices like segregation have no place in our worldâ€ � and that â€œequality is a rightâ€ � .

Since coming out last October , Cook has used his position to speak out against â€˜religious freedomâ€ ™ laws mooted in states such as Indiana and Arkansas , which critics say enable discrimination against gay people .
As he introduced Cook , GWâ€ ™ s president , Steven Knapp , said : â€œYouâ€ ™ ve used your position as a platform to speak out about injustice and press for societal progress in the United States and around the world .
As you recently told Fortune magazine , you want to be the pebble in the pond that creates the ripples for change.â€ �
Cook was invited to be the commencement speaker on the suggestion of the GW students .
He joined Apple in 1998 and served as chief operating officer before taking over as CEO in 2011 .

2015-05-18,"The debut trailer for Danny Boyleâ€ ™ s long - gestating biopic of Steve Jobs has hit the web , powering up our first glimpse of Michael Fassbender as the late Apple tech guru .
The German - Irish actor is seen in full briefly at the end of the trailer , receiving applause from the crowd at a product launch
â€ “ expected to be the 1998 unveiling of the first iMac .
Other than that , we only see him in profile from behind as audio from the film plays out .
â€œYou canâ€ ™ t write code .
You are not an engineer .
What do you do?,â€ � asks
Seth Rogenâ€ ™ s Steve Wozniak , incredulously .
Replies Jobs : â€œThe musicians play the instruments .
I play the orchestra
â€
¦ I sat in a garage and invented the future â€ ¦ Because artists lead and hacks ask for a show of hands.â€ �
Thereâ€ ™ s a hint that Boyle and Sorkin wonâ€ ™ t hold back from presenting Jobsâ€ ™ darker side .
One female character with a German accent tells him : â€œI love that you donâ€ ™ t care how much money a person makes ; you care what they make .
But what you make isnâ€ ™ t supposed to be the best part of you.â€ �
Boyleâ€ ™ s film has a troublesome pre - production back story .
It was set up at studio Sony with David Fincher directing Leonardo DiCaprio , then Christian Bale , in the lead .
But the final version sees Boyle directing , Fassbender cast as Jobs and studio Universal providing financial backing .
Sorkin , the Oscar - winning screenwriter of Sonyâ€ ™ s The Social Network , has previously said he envisages a biopic comprised of just three scenes , each shot in real time and taking place just before a vital product launch .
The trailer also gives us our first glimpse of Jeff Daniels as early Apple CEO John Sculley and Kate Winslet as Apple marketing chief Joanna Hoffman , who once won a tongue - in - cheek prize from her employer for being the member of staff most willing to stand up to Jobs .
An earlier biopic of the Apple co - founder , titled Jobs , was released in 2013 with Ashton Kutcher in the title role and Josh Gad as Wozniak .
It was not a hit with the critics and bombed at the box office .
Steve Jobs is due for release on 9 October in the US , four days after the fourth anniversary of Jobsâ€ ™ death of cancer , timing which suggests a tilt at the 2016 Oscars .
The biopic is due to hit UK cinemas on 13 November ."
2015-05-23,"When a technology journalist suggested to Steve Jobs , in 2010 , that his children must have loved the just - released iPad , he replied flatly : â€œThey havenâ€ ™ t used it .
We limit how much technology our kids use at home.â€
�
His former righthand man , Jonathan I ve , whose design for the iPad is so simple that toddlers can operate it , recently revealed that he sets strict limits for his 10-year - old twin boys .
Steiner Waldorf schools , which exclude screen time before the age of 12 in favour of physical activity , art and experiential learning , are particularly popular with Silicon Valley executives and their UK counterparts .
Kevin Avison , executive officer of the Steiner Waldorf Schools Fellowship in the UK , says that when he was teaching near Reading , â€œnearly 50 % of parents of children in the class worked at Oracle or other hi - tech computer companiesâ€ � .
This approach is much more stringent than official guidelines recommend .
The American Academy of Pediatrics discourages any screen time for the first two years of life , but after that recommends no more than one to two hours a day , no screens in childrenâ€ ™ s bedrooms and enforcing meal - time and bedtime media - device curfews .
In the UK , the only official screen - time ruling comes from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence , which recently advised trying TV - free days , or limiting it to fewer than two hours a day , to maintain a healthy weight .
According to Ofcomâ€ ™ s latest Media Use and Attitudes Report , seven in 10 of the UKâ€ ™ s five- to 15-year - olds have access to tablet computers , with 34 % owning their own .
Households often have more than one laptop , smartphone , games console and TV , too .
There are concerns that these devices have negative impacts on childrenâ€ ™ s attention spans and social development , as well as their physical health ( not to mention the additional worries of exposure to sex , violence and cyberbullying ) .
But how much screen time is too much ?
We asked the real experts .
â€˜It inspires them to draw and createâ€ ™ Johnny Taylor is art director at games company Mind Candy , which makes Moshi Monsters and World Of Warriors .
He lives in Brighton and has an eight - year - old son and a six - year - old daughter .
We have loose rules .
I donâ€
™ t say my children must have only two hoursâ€ ™ screen time a day , but it often ends up like that .
Technology is part of their life , and as a parent I have to make sure that other things are just as important , like going out , exercising , drawing and being creative .
At weekends , my son can play computer games as long as heâ€
™ s done his homework , but a lot of times , his homework involves screen time , too .
Weâ€ ™ ve got a Nintendo Wii .
My daughter has an iPod touch , and weâ€ ™ ve got two iPads , a Nexus tablet and a couple of computers .
Iâ€ ™ m the keeper of the passwords , so they canâ€ ™ t download games without our permission .
We have all the safety features turned on , and theyâ€ ™ re pretty good at knowing what they should be looking at .
Once , I found my daughter watching videos about pregnant parents .
She said : â€œI really love babies .
I just want to see babies being born.â€ � World Of Warriors was inspired by my son .
He loved play - fighting and Iâ€ ™ d say to him , â€œMaybe fightingâ€ ™ s not the best thing.â€
�
We talked about warriors in the past â€ “ Ottomans , Vikings and Romans â€ “ and how they shaped the world we live in .
He was fascinated , and it led to this game idea that is about collecting warriors throughout history .
Itâ€ ™ s covertly educational .
I got home the other night and couldnâ€ ™ t wait to show my son the new Mario Kart , because weâ€ ™ ve been playing it together .
Itâ€ ™ s a racing game thatâ€ ™
s been out since I was young , and now my sonâ€ ™ s into it and collects the toys .
It doesnâ€
™ t stop at the device , for a lot of children ; it inspires them to draw and make things , and play with toys .
Itâ€ ™ s easy for technology to take over , so we try to manage that and make sure the kids arenâ€ ™ t all red - faced and anxious .
Theyâ€ ™ re not involved in social media yet , although my sonâ€ ™ s really into swimming and I find him watching Michael Phelps videos on the iPad .
Iâ€ ™ ve been videoing him swimming in competitions , and heâ€ ™ s started asking if we can post them on YouTube .
I havenâ€ ™ t , because I donâ€ ™ t have permission from the other childrenâ€ ™ s parents , and I feel that he is a little young now .
â€˜No TV or computers before age 12â€ ™ Pierre Laurent , a former Microsoft and Intel marketing manager , is currently working on a Silicon Valley startup .
He has two daughters , aged nine and 15 , and a 17-year - old son .
I love computers .
They can do wonderful things , if you use them properly .
But you can overuse technology , and become a slave to it .
We allowed screen time for our son until he was two .
Then I read a book called The Growth Of The Mind , by Stanley Greenspan , which explains how we learn when we are small through our interaction with the world , and because of emotions .
We did some research , and started connecting with Waldorf schools â€ “ which all our children attend .
We saw that Waldorf teenagers had a different way of approaching adults and were very interested in the world .
We decided that thereâ€ ™ s no harm in not exposing children to screens until theyâ€ ™ re big enough .
It can only be beneficial .
Young children like stories , to play with things , sing , make things , build and be in nature .
So thatâ€ ™ s what we did .
They havenâ€ ™ t complained .
You could offer an hourâ€ ™ s screen time a day , but media products are designed to keep peopleâ€ ™ s attention .
Itâ€ ™ s not that thereâ€ ™ s an intent to harm children , but thereâ€ ™ s an intent to keep them engaged .
In the late 90s , when I was working at Intel and my first child was born , we had what was called the â€œwar of the eyeballsâ€ � .
People donâ€ ™ t want you to wander and start playing with another product , so it has a hooking effect .
It looks like itâ€ ™ s soothing your child and keeping them busy so you can do something else , but that effect is not very good for small children .
It stops them discovering the world with their senses .
And thereâ€ ™ s a risk to attention .
Itâ€ ™ s not scientifically proven yet , but thereâ€ ™ s an idea that attention is like a muscle that we build .
Itâ€ ™ s about being able to tune out all the distraction and focus on one thing .
When you engage with these devices , you donâ€
™ t build that capacity .
Itâ€ ™ s computer - aided attention ; youâ€ ™ re not learning to do it .
Our children start interacting with computers and smartphones at around 12 .
When theyâ€ ™ re in the house , they put the phones to charge on the table in the hallway and donâ€ ™
t use them much .
My son has a Facebook account and uses email , and he does some texting .
Heâ€ ™ s connected and engaged , but heâ€ ™ s not a slave to technology .
He started getting interested in video games when he was 14 , because thatâ€ ™ s how he keeps in touch with his cousin in Europe â€ “ through a multiplayer game about the Napoleonic wars .
Weâ€ ™ ve also had a no - TV rule , and they watched movies maybe once during the weekend , and we ease it out as they grow up .
My son is pretty much free to watch what he wants now , but heâ€ ™ s good at self - regulating , partly because he has built other interests .
â€˜I let them play on devices â€ “
it beats being thrown out of a restaurantâ€ ™ Anne Wojcicki is co - founder and CEO of gene - testing startup
23andme .
She has a six - year - old son and a three - year - old daughter with Google co - founder Sergey Brin .
Being in Silicon Valley makes me strict when it comes to my childrenâ€ ™ s technology use .
I am surrounded by it all day , so I try to avoid it when I get home .
I set screen - time limits , because I think itâ€ ™ s good to diversify activities .
My son has an iPod touch , so he can text me when he comes home from school to tell me about his day .
In terms of kidsâ€ ™ apps and games , I loved Starfall , which helps teach phonics , and I use BrainPop , the educational website with videos and games , a lot now .
I tried to minimise exposure to technology before two .
After that , Iâ€ ™ ve taught the kids to use devices in moderation .
Itâ€ ™ s important for them to learn how to control their behaviour themselves .
Simply restricting access makes them want it more .
Yes , I worry about what they might be exposed to on the internet , but I think itâ€ ™ s more important to teach children judgment .
You canâ€
™ t shield them from everything , so you need to teach them to make good decisions .
I do let the kids play on devices when we eat out â€ “ itâ€ ™ s better than being thrown out of a restaurant .
And I let them play with them on their own .
Itâ€ ™ s very important that children learn to use technology â€ “ itâ€
™ s part of life
â€ “ but also that they learn when to put it down .
They donâ€ ™ t put up a fight .
The five - minute warning always works .
I donâ€
™ t get a thrill out of seeing my kids using tech , and they havenâ€
™ t tried Google Glass .
I much prefer when they get wonder out of picking strawberries in the garden .
That said , I do love that my son texts me .
He has all kinds of fun uses for emoticons .
â€˜They both have Twitter accounts â€ ™ Rachel Bremer is Twitterâ€ ™ s head of international communications .
She has a five - year - old son and a two - year - old daughter , and lives in London .
Weâ€ ™ re still in the early stages .
They use our devices , under our supervision , so I can help them understand the right ways to use the web and the value they can get out of it .
My son is curious , and loves watching videos about space shuttles taking off and finding out what different animals like to eat .
Weâ€ ™ re helping them see technology as a way of finding out more about the world , rather than just a source of entertainment .
When I was growing up , I wasnâ€ ™ t allowed to play video games .
My dad worked at Apple , so we had computers around the house , but the things I played on them involved maths , learning and writing .
This has probably influenced my parenting more than working in technology has .
My son plays games from kidsâ€ ™ apps on our phones , but they have to be educational â€ “ puzzles or problem - solving .
When they get older , weâ€ ™ ll give them more freedom , but weâ€ ™ ll probably have a certain amount of screen time that theyâ€ ™ re allowed , in a day or week , and theyâ€ ™ ll be able to choose how they spend that time .
We use iPhones and iPads when weâ€ ™ re travelling .
Travelling as much as you can with kids is a great way to broaden their world view .
If it takes some iPad time to get you to an interesting destination and keep everyone happy , thereâ€ ™ s nothing wrong with that â€ “ as long as youâ€ ™ re not bothering other people .
Both children have had private Twitter accounts since they were born , which we use to share photos and videos .
Our families are in the US , so itâ€ ™ s a way to stay in touch .
We used Periscope , the live - streaming app Twitter just bought , privately to broadcast our sonâ€ ™ s school assembly for his grandparents .
Weâ€ ™ re gradually getting our son comfortable with social media .
I wouldnâ€ ™ t want to restrict it for my children altogether , and then one day in the future open the floodgates and let them at it .
It seems like the longer he uses a device or watches something , the harder it is to get him to give it up .
Weâ€
™ re clear with him that when he gets upset about putting it down , then he wonâ€ ™ t get to use it again .
Thatâ€ ™ s part of it : teaching them that they have to walk away .
â€˜We follow our son on Instagramâ€ ™ Nitin Ganatra is a wearable technology software developer and former Apple staffer .
He worked on iPhone software from the initial development stage until IOS version 5.1 ( 2012 ) .
He has two sons , aged 10 and 12 , and lives in California .
We do have quite a few gadgets around :
iPads ; my oldest son has an iPhone , and my younger son has an old iPhone , but itâ€ ™ s not on a plan so it operates like an iPod touch .
My oldest son also has a Kindle Fire , and we have a PlayStation 4 .
Weâ€ ™ re pretty strict on that , because my wife doesnâ€ ™ t like violent games .
We have rules about having your homework done and playing outside before coming in and hunkering down in front of the TV .
My 10-year - old has an Instagram account .
It has to be a private account , and we follow him .
With his phone , one of the rules is that at any moment we can take a look .
We have had talks with him about making sure that only people he knows can follow him .
He does a pretty good job .
At first , we were more suspicious and wanted to know what he was chatting about with his friends .
These days , we donâ€ ™ t look too often : we felt a little bit like stalkers .
We also have â€œfind my friendâ€ � turned on , so we always know where he is .
We do stalk him quite a bit in that way .
They both need to use the internet for homework and have their own user accounts on our laptops .
The deal is that work on a laptop has to be done in an open area
â€
“ you canâ€ ™ t hole up in your room with the computer .
My line of work affects how I view their screen use .
Even though Iâ€ ™ m pro - technology , I donâ€ ™ t want it to be all - consuming .
Itâ€ ™ s easy to get so wrapped up very quickly .
I try to limit the amount of time I spend in front of a screen as well .
Humans are not designed to sit for too long , staring at a fixed distance .
In addition , there are benefits to being outside : sunlight , social interactions , learning .
If my kids have a fight with a buddy , they need to resolve these things in person , and not come in and complain on social media about it .
But some of the things I owe my current career to go way back to those times when I was fascinated by a video game , and how the thing worked .
Iâ€ ™
d like to foster a little bit of that excitement around technology in my children .
I love to see them using technology I helped create .
Itâ€ ™ s my physical baby playing with my work baby .
â€˜I donâ€ ™ t want her to get obsessedâ€ ™
Karim Dia Toubajie is an interaction designer at band - and - gig - tracking website Songkick , and previously worked for PlayStation .
He has a 16-month - old daughter and lives in London .
My wife and I are pretty conscious about exposing our daughter to too much early on .
We both like creative play , so prefer her to focus on toys , crayons and books .
She seems more stimulated by texture , smell and physical movement , which digital canâ€ ™ t really provide .
That said , if I use my phone in her proximity , she is attracted by the bright light and will want to grab it off me â€ “ denied !
Her current usage is limited to a xylophone app on my phone â€ “ which looks like her real xylophone
â€ “ if she needs an emergency distraction .
Sheâ€ ™ ll normally play for about 10 to 20 seconds before activating the home screen .
About once a week , when she has come into our bed in the morning , weâ€ ™ ll let her watch CBeebies on the iPlayer app , so we can grab a few extra winks .
But she only watches for a couple of minutes before resorting to crazed swiping and button hitting .
At Christmas , we spent a weekend with a six - year - old who watched Minecraft YouTube videos for about 10 hours daily , and Iâ€ ™ m conscious of how easy it might be for children to get obsessed with digital .
Working in technology , Iâ€ ™ m also aware how these channels are designed for continual user journeys , with no defined end point .
Some games that parents consider harmless , like Farmville , encourage in - app purchases in order to progress in the game , and stories have circulated online about people becoming so obsessed with it that theyâ€ ™ re neglecting their children , or children have taken their parentsâ€ ™ credit cards .
These kinds of games are designed to capture revenue by capitalising on certain parts of human nature , to be addictive .
However , some games are culturally important .
To make The Last Of Us , on PlayStation , they brought together hundreds of people in the arts â€ “ musicians , designers , actors â€ “ who effectively created film - sized games .
Monument Valleyâ€ ™ s another example .
Thatâ€ ™ s definitely a game
Iâ€ ™
d let my daughter play when sheâ€ ™ s older .
And Iâ€ ™ ll start getting her into programming .
But Iâ€ ™ ll take a similar approach to my parents :
I didnâ€ ™ t get a computer until I was 11 , and then it was one hour a day .
Iâ€ ™
d like my daughter to have a diverse set of hobbies , and not get obsessed .
â€˜My daughter said the cinema was the biggest iPad sheâ€ ™
d
ever seenâ€ ™ Alex Evans is co - founder and technical director of games company Media Molecule , and creator of the game LittleBigPlanet .
He has a daughter aged four and a one - year - old son , and lives in London .
I donâ€ ™ t play games myself , but Iâ€ ™ ve always been obsessed with making them .
When I was a child , Iâ€ ™ d wake up at five in the morning and play Lego until I went to sleep , and then it was computers â€ “ to make my Lego models come to life .
My parents chose not to limit me , because I think my mum , who is a composer , decided it was sufficiently creative .
I put in my 10,000 hours , and it is now my profession .
So with my kids , if I feel theyâ€ ™ re doing something that is sufficiently creative or stimulating , Iâ€ ™ ll let them carry on .
As long as there are other things in their lives , like reading and playing outside and everything else , it doesnâ€ ™ t bother me .
The universal obsession is Minecraft .
It is a remarkably creative and social endeavour .
Itâ€ ™ s the game Lego said they wish theyâ€ ™
d made â€ “
itâ€ ™
s mostly about building things out of blocks .
Itâ€ ™ s hard for our generation to understand , but it isnâ€ ™ t just a game : thereâ€ ™ s a culture and community thatâ€ ™ s evolved around it , through YouTube and books .
The Candy Crush types of games , that are mindlessly addictive , are mostly played by commuters on the train .
Violent games are a media touchpoint , but theyâ€ ™ re the equivalent of Transformers in the cinema â€ “ the noisy minority .
If my kids had a diet of blockbusters only , that would be a shame , but if you look at what most kids consume games - wise , itâ€ ™ s far more varied and interesting than what my generation has consumed .
Maybe my limiting will be saying , â€œHey , have you tried this game or watched this movie?â€
� Iâ€ ™ ll try to broaden rather than limit .
My daughter recently went to the cinema for the first time and told me it was â€œlike the biggest iPad youâ€ ™ ve
ever seenâ€ � .
Her gaming reference point isnâ€ ™ t video games on TV any more , but the iPad .
Even my one - year - old is already aware of what an iPad is and how to unlock it .
The games brands my daughter loves are Sega Mini , which has an exploratory feel , and Toca Boca , who do things like Hair Salon .
She doesnâ€ ™ t spend hours on it yet ,
so I havenâ€
™ t had to be heavy - handed .
I bought her an iPad mini , which has been by her side and is now battered .
We do a terrible thing , which youâ€ ™ ll frown at , but if sheâ€ ™ s playing up in a restaurant , weâ€ ™ ll put on the iPad and use it as a digital pacifier .
Thatâ€ ™ s the one time when I question my parenting .
Itâ€ ™ s me pushing it on her â€ “
sheâ€ ™ s not asking for it .
Itâ€ ™ s literally like a dummy .
Itâ€ ™ s like saying , â€œPlease go into your own world so I can have a conversation.â€ �
â€˜His grandfather sent him a Vineâ€ ™ Ryan Swigart , a web designer at Vine , has a three - and - a - half - month - old boy and lives in New York .
Having a baby has made me very aware of my own habits .
His exposure to technology is something Iâ€ ™ m thinking about constantly : how much do I have the phone or television on ?
Technology enhances your ability to do all kinds of good things , but also passively to absorb stimulation .
When youâ€ ™ re young , especially , learning happens better when youâ€ ™ re physically active : not only because it gets the blood flowing , but also because youâ€ ™ re using all your senses , which helps you remember things .
If you allow someone to be stimulated so easily , thereâ€ ™ s not much motivation to put work into that relationship .
Not to demonise any particular technology , but I want to be very involved in how much and what sort of information is coming to my son .
Iâ€ ™ m wondering whether maybe 30 minutes a day of internet or television would be a good place to start , when heâ€ ™ s ready .
He has very limited exposure now ; we donâ€
™ t keep a TV on at all .
We do send Vine messages to family members with him , and use Facetime .
My father - in - law blew a raspberry into a Vine message that loops over and over again , and heâ€ ™ s mesmerised by it .
It could become the way he calms down from being upset , if we were to lean on that .
Itâ€ ™ s interesting how powerful it is , how one particular image has such an effect on his mood .
It reminds me we need to be careful ."

2015-05-31,"When Steve Jobs was alive it was tempting to draw analogies between Apple and a religious cult .
Product launches in the Moscone centre in San Francisco seemed more like evangelist congregations than capitalist rituals .
And in the days before the revered new products actually appeared in the cultâ€ ™ s retail outlets , excited worshippers could be seen camping out in surrounding streets .
I remember once being in a British shopping arcade on the day that the local Apple Store opened for the first time .
Long queues had formed from the moment the arcade gates had been unlocked that morning .
Then came the magic moment :
the glass doors opened , a hush fell on the assembled crowd , a group of T - shirted staff walked out , formed a human avenue leading into the store and then clapped rhythmically as the mob surged in .
It was a truly extraordinary moment in which the conventional marketing mantra about the customer being king was turned on its head .
In the case of Apple , it seemed , the customers felt privileged to be allowed to enter the store .
At the time , I concluded that much of this Apple worship could be put down to the astonishingly charismatic personality of Jobs .
He was , after all , the only chief executive in the history of the world to be accorded the kind of adulation normally granted to rock stars and messiahs .
Apple was obviously a one - man band and he was the Man .
It seemed reasonable to conclude when he died , therefore , that the cult of Apple would diminish or at any rate that its share price would have peaked .
How wrong can you be ?
Jobs has been succeeded by Tim Cook , a nice man for whom the phrase â€œcharisma deficitâ€ � might have been invented .
But the cult of Apple is still going strong â€ “ witness Stephen Fryâ€ ™ s oleaginous piece in the Telegraph the other day , which was based on a recent trip he made to Apple headquarters at No 1 Infinite Loop , Cupertino ( described by Fry as â€œthe coolest address in the universeâ€ � ) .
And as for the share price , instead of declining gracefully it continues to rocket .
As I write , Appleâ€ ™ s stock market valuation is $ 746.7bn ( Â£489.1bn ) which makes it the most valuable company in the world and one that is set , according to Fry , to become â€œthe worldâ€ ™ s first trillion - dollar companyâ€ � .
When Jobs was in his pomp , we used to say that he was surrounded by a â€œreality distortion
fieldâ€ � that made it impossible to have an objective view of him .
No such field surrounds Mr Cook , but it certainly seems to envelop his company .
At any rate , people have come to believe that , as far as Apple is concerned , anything is possible .
Hence the fevered speculation that its next target is the car industry .
All kinds of portents â€ “ from straws in the wind to chicken entrails and recent corporate hirings
â€ “ are leading people to conclude that Apple must be working on a car .
I call it an iCar
but the codename for the project is apparently
â€œtitanâ€ � .
Classicists ( and readers of Wikipedia ) will immediately recall that the titans were giant Greek deities of incredible strength .
This implies that the iCar will not be just a mobile iPhone docking station , but something more substantial â€ “ hardware powered by an electric motor or two , perhaps .
There must be something in the water in Silicon Valley ( assuming they still have water ) which leads geeks to become obsessed with the car industry .
Thereâ€ ™ s
Google with its self - driving car ( which in its first manifestation is likely to be more like a self - driving golf cart ) and Elon Muskâ€ ™ s Tesla company producing electric cars for millionaires who do not suffer from a new condition known as â€œrange anxietyâ€
� .
And now thereâ€ ™ s
Tim Cookâ€ ™
s
Apple apparently trying to get in on the act .
Why this obsession with cars ?
There are only two possible explanations .
One is the kind of lunacy that is brought on by smoking your own exhaust : the car industry , despite the blatherings of Jeremy Clarkson , is a tiresome , low - rent , low - margin , grisly business .
The other possible motivation is at least rational , based on a strategic view that the information technology industry will eventually peak and that it makes sense to have a beach - head in industries such as healthcare and transportation , for which there will always be stable consumer demand .
If this is indeed what is driving project titan , then maybe itâ€ ™ s time to consider whether those Apple shares of yours might be approaching their peak .
As the ancient Greeks knew , those whom the gods wish to destroy , they first make mad ."
2015-06-21,"Not many contemporary artists would risk measuring themselves up against Renaissance polymaths , yet Kanye West has compared himself to Leonardo da Vinci as he prepares for his headline set at Glastonbury .
The 38-year - old US rapper , nicknamed Yeezy , who has in the past likened himself to Pablo Picasso , Steve Jobs , Walt Disney , Andy Warhol , Shakespeare and even Jesus , said he defies convention and , in the past 12 years , has fought , bought and spat his way out of being boxed in to a certain genre .
Like Renaissance thinkers such as Michelangelo , Galileo and da Vinci , West said , he resists strict categorisation .
The Gold Digger star told the Sunday Times Culture magazine : â€œImagine if da Vinci or Michelangelo or Galileo were asked not to think of anything except for the one thing they first became famous for .
â€œSo da Vinci could only have one idea .
For all haters , Iâ€ ™ m not saying Iâ€ ™ m da Vinci , but I feel itâ€ ™ s right for any human being to compare themselves to anything.â€ �
He said critics get uptight about the comparisons he makes of himself , adding : â€œIâ€ ™ m an extreme speaker , and I speak through comparisons.â€ �
A producer - entrepreneur worth $ 30 m , West has branched out of music to become a fashion designer and is one of Americaâ€ ™ s most divisive stars .
More than 130,000 people have signed a petition calling for him to be dropped from the bill at Glastonbury , which he is due to headline on Saturday , branding his music an â€œinjusticeâ€ � .
The Yeezus producer is to follow in the footsteps of his close friend and long - time collaborator Jay Z , and the latterâ€ ™ s wife , BeyoncÃ © , in topping the festival playlist .
Kanyeâ€ ™ s seventh album , originally titled
So Help Me God and later changed to SWISH , is to be released this autumn ."
2015-06-24,"Women are notoriously under - represented in Stem ( science , technology , engineering and mathematics ) .
Steve Jobs , Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg are male tech pioneers who trip off the tongue , while a measly 26 % of computing jobs in the US are held by women .
But thatâ€ ™ s not the full story â€ “ pick a slice of the sector from across the globe and you will see women carving a space for themselves .
The experience of women varies by country and the wealth or liberalism of a nation doesnâ€ ™ t necessarily correspond to womenâ€ ™ s achievements in the sector .
So how does UK and US diversity in Stem compare with other global regions ?
UK
When it comes to maths , the UK lags behind .
It falls in 26th place out of 65 countries for gender equality in the OECDâ€ ™ s latest survey .
The general conclusion was that â€œgirls feel less motivated to learn maths and have less confidence in their abilities than boysâ€ � .
The gender gap is also pronounced at the top of the academic scale and in work .
One study found 42 % of maths undergraduates are female , yet only 6 % of maths professors are women .
A woman defying this trend is Dr Eugenia Cheng , senior lecturer in mathematics at the University of Sheffield .
Cheng says a lack of confidence could be responsible for the drop - off in women pursuing maths post - degree .
â€œIâ€ ™ ll often get a lot of female students saying â€˜I donâ€ ™ t understand anything ; Iâ€ ™ m much worse at this than everyone elseâ€ ™
.â€ �
But less confident female students often score higher marks than their more self - assured male peers , she says .
Cheng tries to encourage her tentative female students .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s often
one â€ “ dare
I say it
â€ “ male student , who will be loud and shout things out a lot .
And you have to take care to show that doesnâ€ ™ t necessarily mean theyâ€ ™ re good at maths.â€
�
Another way to help young women develop confidence in Stem studies is by celebrating successful women in the field .
â€œVisibility of women in senior roles in science helps to normalise it in young womenâ€ ™ s minds , â€ � says Professor Anne Glover , vice - principal at University of Aberdeen and the first chief scientific adviser to the European Commission .
US
In the US , only 26 % of computing jobs are held by women .
Cultural attitudes there have a significant influence on the number of women in Stem careers .
A recent study found that rather than too few girls opting to study scientific subjects or women forgoing careers to care for their children , the biggest cause of gender imbalance in Stem is cultural .
Women feel the need to straddle a thin line between being masculine enough to fit in with the culture and feminine enough to not appear pushy .
Women making a noise about the cultural bias in Stem is also effective .
Ellen Pao may have lost a high - profile gender discrimination lawsuit against her former employer , but in the process she highlighted the lack of women in the most powerful positions in Silicon Valley .
The lawsuit , and the resulting media coverage , is said to have encouraged venture capital firms to address the gender imbalance .
In the weeks following the court ruling , former Twitter and Facebook employees similarly filed gender discrimination lawsuits .
India Technology firms in India have a better female to male staff ratio than the tech giants of Silicon Valley .
In his book Geek Sublime , Vikram Chandra points out that 30 % of programmers in India are female compared with 21 % in the US .
Female role models could be having a positive influence .
Kumud Srinivasan offers a positive example of an Indian women excelling in technology .
President of Intel India and chairperson of the board of governors of the National Institute of Technology - Trichy , Srinivasan offers an insight into the relatively high proportion of women in technology roles in India .
â€œThere have been focused efforts by the government , industry and academia towards attracting and retaining girls and women in Stem , â€ �
she says .
She also points to Chandraâ€ ™ s book in which he describes â€œthe machismo of tech geeks in the USâ€ � and says that itâ€ ™ s something that appears to be absent in India .
â€œIt may well be the reason behind the higher proportion [ of women in IT ] here , â€ � Srinivasan says .
Latin America
While the number of women in Stem in many countries can be disheartening , there are some bright spots where progress can be seen .
Latin America , for example , presented some positive achievements in a recent Unesco report â€ “ 45 % of scientific researchers in Latin America are women , putting the region ahead of the global average of 29 % .
Alicia Kowaltowski is a professor of biochemistry at the University of SÃ£o Paulo .
She says the recent development of six - month paid maternity leave for women , including graduates and postdoc researchers , has helped .
She adds : â€œOur pay comes fully from the universities , so missing a grant deadline due to raising a family will not decrease your salary .
To me , the situation of women in the US , who mostly donâ€ ™ t have paid maternity leave and where childcare costs half a postdocâ€ ™ s salary , is unfathomable.â€ � Kowaltowski believes female role models are important .
â€œThere are many women scientists who frequently appear in the media here .
High - level awards for female scientists help [ get ] the word out about these womenâ€ �
she says .
â€œIt is an irony that in countries where a science career is seen as lower status , female representation is higher , â€ �
she adds , connecting this with the high gender imbalance in the UK .
She points out that there are more successful female astronomers in Brazil than in the UK .
It seems that a change in cultural perceptions is crucial to encourage girls and women to pursue Stem careers .
â€œWe need it to be seen as something very normal for a woman to embark upon a career in science , not a major challenge , â€ � Glover says .

2015-07-01,"â€œLadies and gentlemen , please welcome ...
â€ � booms the announcer at the end of the trailer : then up pops the words , as if typed into a computer ,
â€œsteve jobsâ€
� .
Itâ€ ™ s a suitable sign - off line for a film that looks to be about performance as much as anything else : scriptwriter Aaron Sorkin has said it will revolve around three separate product launches at different points in Jobsâ€ ™ career .
So in a trailer that flashes up one shot after another , we get lots of glimpses of the frenzied crowds that Jobs addresses , the coalface of the cult of Apple .
But lest anyone think this is just a corporate snowjob , the trailer throws in lots of full - on dramatic conflict : Jobs tricky relationship with his then - girlfriend and their daughter Lisa ( denying paternity at one point ) ; strained relationships at work ; and plenty of maverick genius type yelling and arm - waving .
Fassbender , of course , is the headline act , and the trailer is a feast of vein - popping , hair - flicking intensity ( though did Jobs actually speak with a soft Irish accent ?
Maybe Fassbender is ahead of the curve there ) .
Kate Winslet , as key early Mac collaborator Joanna Hoffman , is absolutely recognisable , and playing Steve Wozniak
doesnâ€ ™ t seem like a massive stretch for Seth Rogen .
Rogen , however , does get to ask the opening voiceover question â€ “
â€œwhat do you do?â€ � â€ “ which the film looks like itâ€ ™ s been designed to answer .
Steve Jobs is due to be released on 8 October in Australia , 9 October in the US , and 13 November in the UK ."
2015-07-03,"Apple co - founder Steve Wozniak has revealed he feels torn about the new trailer for Danny Boyleâ€ ™ s Steve Jobs , in which Michael Fassbender and Seth Rogen star as a tyrannical take on the late tech guru and a fiercely critical version of Wozniak himself .
â€œWhat do you do ?
Youâ€ ™ re not an engineer , â€ � says the screen Wozniak .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re not a designer .
You canâ€
™ t put a hammer to a nail .
I built the circuit board .
The graphical interface was stolen .
So how come , 10 times in a day , I read Steve Jobs is a genius ?
What do you do?â€ � Wozniak , 64 , told Bloomberg he did not recognise himself in the performance of Rogen , but seemed to suggest that the general tilt of Aaron Sorkinâ€ ™ s screenplay was correct .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t talk that way , â€ � said Wozniak via email .
â€œI would never accuse the graphical interface of being stolen .
I never made comments to the effect that I had credit ( genius ) taken from me.â€ �
He added : â€œThe lines I heard spoken were not things I would say but carried the right message , at least partly .
I felt a lot of the real Jobs in the trailer , although a bit exaggerated.â€ �
The trailer touches on a grim incident in Jobsâ€ ™ life , the tech guruâ€ ™ s public disavowal of his daughter Lisa Brennan - Jobs in the late 1970s , even after a paternity test established him as the father .
â€œIt was hard on me , even being quiet , when Jobs refused to acknowledge his child when the money didnâ€ ™ t matter , â€ � said Wozniak .
â€œAnd I can almost cry remembering it.â€
�
The Apple co - founder said he nevertheless enjoyed watching the trailer .
He is looking forward to seeing the final film , which arrives in US cinemas on 9 October and debuts in the UK on 13 November .
The personal computer pioneer confirmed he consulted with Sorkin on the project and had dinner with Rogen , though he said he had not asked to see the script .
â€œI do not think that would be appropriate , â€ � he said , adding that he felt honoured to be played by a famous actor such as Rogen .
â€œIt is the creative work of the producer and writer and actors and director and others â€ ¦ Accuracy is second to entertainment in a movie like this.â€ �"
2015-07-27,"Steve Jobs , the upcoming film about the Apple maverick â€ “ which stars Michael Fassbender in the titular role and was directed by Danny Boyle â€ “ will screen as the centerpiece film for the 53rd New York film festival .
The Film Society of Lincoln Center , which hosts the event ,
doesnâ€ ™ t list it as a world premiere .
Sources say it will bypass the Toronto and Venice film festivals that occur a month beforehand , so a Telluride film festival world premiere seems likely .
Boyle said in a statement : â€œI am honored that our film has been selected as the centrepiece of this yearâ€ ™ s festival .
And thrilled and terrified too , unlike the subject of our film , who would have taken the whole thing very much in his stride.â€ �
The Trainspotting director added that Jobs was a thoroughly â€œcontradictoryâ€ � and â€œcomplexâ€ � character who has â€œforged our digital ageâ€ � .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s the kind of brilliant , flawed character that Shakespeare would have relished writing about , and storytellers of all kinds will be fashioning and re - fashioning the mythology of the digital revolution for generations to come ,
â€ � he said .
Unlike the critically bashed Jobs biopic that starred Ashton Kutcher , Boyleâ€ ™ s film has a compressed timeframe , focusing on three iconic product launches and ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac .
Joining Fassbender in the film are Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman , Seth Rogen as Steve Wozniak , Jeff Daniels as John Sculley , Michael Stuhlbarg as Andy Hertzfeld , and Katherine Waterston as Chrisann Brennan .
Coincidentally , Waterston also starred in last yearâ€ ™ s centerpiece film , Inherent Vice .
As previously announced , Nyff will open with the world premiere of Robert Zemeckisâ€ ™ s 3D drama
The Walk , starring Joseph Gordon - Levitt as Philippe Petit , the man who crossed the Twin Towers on a high - wire in 1974 ; and close with the world premiere of Don Cheadleâ€ ™ s directorial debut ,
Miles Ahead , the biopic of jazz musician Miles Davis .
The New York film festival runs from 25 September to 11 October"
2015-07-28,"The race for next yearâ€ ™ s
Oscars is officially on .
On Tuesday , the Toronto international film festival ( Tiff ) revealed the first tranche of films to make the cut for the October event .
On Monday it was announced that Danny Boyleâ€ ™ s surefire Academy Award contender Steve Jobs will screen at the New York film festival a month later .
The NYFF also has Robert Zemeckisâ€ ™ s 3D drama The Walk and Don
Cheadleâ€ ™ s directorial debut ,
Miles Ahead , on its slate - both considered awards season heavy - hitters .
And before Toronto even kicks off , the Venice and Telluride film festivals will take place , debuting films weâ€ ™ re sure to hear more about in the coming months .
Although Torontoâ€ ™ s schedule announcement is just the first of many , its early slate still presents a nice primer for the films which will excite audiences and critics over the months to come .
The Venice and Telluride effect So far Venice has revealed its opening night film , the Jake Gyllenhaal - led survival drama Everest , and an out - of - competition screening for Scott Cooperâ€ ™ s Johnny Depp vehicle Black Mass , while Telluride wonâ€ ™ t announce its lineup until shortly before the annual event launches on 4 September .
However , a close look at the initial Tiff slate offers a clear indication of where many of this yearâ€ ™ s potential Oscar players are choosing to premiere â€ “ and itâ€ ™ s not Toronto .
Tom Hooper struck it huge by debuting The Kingâ€ ™ s Speech in Toronto in 2010 , going on to win the best director and picture Oscars months after taking home the festivalâ€ ™ s audience award .
As for The Danish Girl , his timely period drama about the first known trans person , Focus Features â€ “ the company distributing the film â€ “ has by all accounts made the surprising decision to debut the film in Venice ( itâ€ ™ s listed as making a North American premiere in Toronto ) .
Reviews will have already leaked about the filmâ€ ™ s Oscar chances before it arrives in Canada .
Other films that have chosen to show in Telluride ( with a possible first stop in Venice ) include Cary Fukunagaâ€ ™ s Netflix drama Beasts of No Nation ; the Brie Larson - starring Room , based on Emma Donoghueâ€ ™ s bestseller ; Tom McCarthyâ€ ™ s ensemble drama Spotlight , starring Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams ; Legend , in which Tom Hardy plays the Kray twins , who ruled Londonâ€ ™ s gangland during the 1950s and 1960s ; and Remember , which , ironically , is directed by one of Canadaâ€ ™ s most famous auteurs , Atom Egoyan .
All the films are making their Canadian premieres in Toronto .
The major world premieres Despite the likes of The Danish Girl deciding to debut elsewhere , a number of potential Oscar players have chosen the tried - and - tested Toronto launchpad for their campaigns .
Of the world premieres , the major gets for Toronto include Freeheld , Peter Sollettâ€ ™ s LGBT drama starring Julianne Moore and Ellen Page ; Stonewall , Roland Emmerichâ€ ™ s drama about the birth of the gay rights movement ;
Alan Bennettâ€ ™ s
The Lady in the Van , which is rumored to feature an awards - worthy performance from Maggie Smith ; Jay Roachâ€ ™ s film Trumbo , starring Bryan Cranston as the famed Hollywood screenwriter Dalton Trumbo , who was blacklisted in the 1940s ; Terence Daviesâ€ ™ s anticipated follow - up to The Deep Blue Sea , Sunset Song ; Charlie Kaufmanâ€ ™ s first stop - motion film , Anomalisa ; and Eye in the Sky , Gavin Hoodâ€
™ s thriller about piloted aircraft warfare , starring Aaron Paul and Helen Mirren .
All the films are screening in either the galas or special presentations sections .
Stephen Frears will also be heading to Toronto with his latest , the Lance Armstrong thriller The Program , starring Ben Foster as the cyclist .
The director is known for premiering his work at either Venice ( The Queen , Philomena , Dirty Pretty Things ) or Telluride ( Tamara Drewe ) , so his filmâ€ ™ s inclusion comes as a small surprise .
The same can be said for Ridley Scottâ€ ™ s star - packed sci - fi epic The Martian .
The film isnâ€ ™ t taking the route traveled by Gravity , which debuted in Venice followed by a Toronto bow .
Instead , The Martianâ€ ™ s world premiere will be in Toronto .
Under the radar
Every year , Toronto ambushes critics with films that failed to factor into the industry chatter in the weeks leading up to the major announcement .
One such surprise was Torontoâ€ ™ s opening night selection : Jean - Marc Valeeâ€ ™ s Demolition , starring Jake Gyllenhaal .
The drama , about a recent widowed man struggling to cope with his wifeâ€ ™ s death , was seemingly primed for a 2015 awards run , before distributor Fox Searchlight recently announced an April 2016 release .
Given that itâ€ ™ s now debuting at Toronto , more than seven months before its slated theatrical rollout , an Oscar campaign seems unlikely â€ “ unless it plays like gangbusters in Toronto and is given an awards - qualifying release into select cinemas , months before opening .
One film sure to garner a lot of attention that few saw coming is Michael Mooreâ€ ™ s first documentary in six years , Where to Invade Next .
Previously unreported , the stealth project was discreetly shot in several countries , â€œunder the radar of the global mediaâ€ � , according to Toronto .
The documentary has Moore â€œtell[ing ] the Pentagon to â€˜stand downâ€ ™ [ as ] he will do the invading for America from now onâ€
� .
Finally , writer / director Rebecca Millerâ€ ™ s first film since 2009â€ ™ s The Private Lives of Pippa Lee , Maggieâ€ ™ s Plan , wasnâ€ ™ t expected to make it on to this autumnâ€ ™ s circuit because it finished principal photography just a few months ago .
The romantic comedy , starring Greta Gerwig , Julianne Moore and Bill Hader , seemed like a good fit for Sundance in January , but it will be making its world premiere at Toronto following a remarkably tight turnaround ."
2015-08-06,"He is already the subject of two feature films and a bestselling biography , but the ongoing lionisation of Steve Jobs is about to get rather more highbrow , as an opera about his life is announced .
The Revolution of Steve Jobs will be staged by Santa Fe Opera in the US in 2017 , and will follow the Apple founder as he confronts the cancer that would go on to kill him , taking in â€œthe events and people in his past that shaped and inspired him , â€ � according to Associated Press .
It will be written by Mason Bates , a composer in residence at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra who is known for blending classical and electronic instrumentation ; the librettist is Mark Campbell , who is writing a â€œnon - linearâ€ � narrative .
The opera company describes Jobs as â€œan innovator who simplified communication with sleek devices , but who paradoxically learned that complex human relationships require more than one button to work.â€ �
Jobs was known for an exacting perfectionism and a fractious personal life , as he founded Apple , was fired , and then returned to shepherd the iMac , iPod and iPhone to unprecedented global success .
His story is next to be told by West Wing and The Social Network writer Aaron Sorkin , in a film directed by Danny Boyle and starring Michael Fassbender as Jobs .
It too avoids the safely linear story of most biopics , instead being set backstage at three Apple product launches over the years .
The film , simply titled Steve Jobs , will premiere at the New York film festival on 3 October ."
2015-08-26,"This autumnâ€ ™ s films will be full of exceedingly intense actors playing exceedingly intense men in glasses : Tom Hardy as Ronnie Kray in his half - rimmed spectacles ; Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs in his rimless ones ; Dane DeHaan as James Dean in his tortoiseshells .
Menâ€ ™ s glasses are about to have a fashion moment , and itâ€ ™ s about time .
Glasses can make you appear cleverer in a job interview , they can be lowered slightly and peered over quizzically , they can be whipped off in complete exasperation .
Also , theyâ€ ™ ll improve your vision
â€ “ no longer will life pass you by in a vague and abstract blur .
Here are five frame styles from the silver screen .
Ronnie Kray
In the ( rather tasty ) trailer for Legend , Hardy plays both Kray twins , Reggie and Ronnie .
You can tell them apart because the latter wears nice 60s glasses and a permanently displeased expression â€ “ like Mark Lamarr on Shooting Stars â€ “ and acts like an absolute nutcase .
Reggie didnâ€ ™ t wear glasses , except once when he snuck into Dartmoor prison in disguise to visit Frank â€œThe Mad Axemanâ€ � Mitchell .
â€œOf
course , I stuck a hat on and a pair of heavy glasses , â€ � he recalled in his memoir .
But Ronnie was renowned for his half - rimmed spectacles , with which he exuded an air of studious menace .
â€œWhen he was in Broadmoor , he had a tortoiseshell pair , â€ �
his wife , Kate Kray , explained recently , â€œbecause I wore a pair on one visit and he said he wanted glasses like mine.â€
�
Last summer , she sold off his original frames at a rural auctioneers in Towcester , Northamptonshire , but Ray - Ban makes a rather similar model .
Ronnie likes â€ ¦ Ray - Ban Clubmasters , from Â£79 .
James Dean
In Anton Corbijnâ€ ™ s forthcoming film Life , about James Dean ( more specifically , about photographer Dennis Stock shooting the then - unknown actor for Life magazine ) , DeHaan spends much of the time moping around in Deanâ€ ™ s trademark tortoiseshell spectacles , smoking cigarettes and squinting .
Thereâ€ ™ s something quite cool and arty about wearing glasses and smoking .
It brings to mind Andy Warhol and David Hockney , and suggests an intoxicating mix of wild nights out and nerdy afternoons in .
Itâ€ ™ s bad for your heart , but good for your sight .
It suggests a very cinematic inner complexity .
James likes â€ ¦ Cutler and Gross square - frame glasses , Â£295 .
Steve Jobs
Whatever you may think of Apple products , Steve Jobs certainly knew a thing or two about stylish design ; his look was inspired , apparently , by a calligraphy class he took after dropping out of college .
His signature black rollneck has already swept through the world of menswear : JW Anderson and Raf Simons showed variants of it on their catwalks , and everybody followed suit .
Now , with Michael Fassbender portraying the Apple founder in a second biopic ( this time directed by Danny Boyle , so it will be much better than the atrocious first effort , Jobs ) , the signature rimless spectacles are set to do the same .
These are the most serious , business - like frames out there .
Steve likes â€ ¦ Savile Row rimless glasses , Â£266 .
George Falconer Tom Fordâ€ ™ s directorial debut A Single Man ( 2009 ) was sad , yes , but also very stylish .
Its abiding image was George Falconer ( Colin Firth ) in his suit , tie and thick , horn - rimmed vintage frames .
These were extra large â€ “ allowing him to clearly see all the tragedy , regret and longing in the world .
They were also very popular , so much so that Ford eventually released his own take on the classic frame : the TF 5178 .
George likes â€ ¦ Tom Ford horn - rimmed glasses , Â£175 .
Harry Potter
Really , though , if weâ€ ™ re thinking about glasses from recent cinema , then Harry Potterâ€ ™ s thin , round metal frames are the most iconic and the most magical .
Theyâ€ ™ re not just for imaginary wizards
â€ “
Le Corbusier and John Lennon also favoured something similar .
If youâ€ ™ re interested in looking like a sorcerer , a modern architect or an experimental musician ( or an owl professor ) , these are a little unusual and well worth trying on for size .

2015-08-31,"Kanye West has likened himself to Jesus , Pablo Picasso , Steve Jobs and even Walt Disney .
Perhaps the only ascent left for the ambitious and outspoken rap artist , producer and fashion designer is to the Oval Office .
West announced his decision to run for president in 2020 during his acceptance speech for a video award at Sunday nightâ€ ™ s VMA show after admitting that he had â€œsmoked somethingâ€ � before his speech to knock â€œthe edge offâ€ � .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t know what I stand to lose after this ; it donâ€
™ t matter though , because it ainâ€ ™ t about me , itâ€ ™ s about new ideas , bro , new ideas .
People with ideas , people who believe in truth .
â€œAnd yes , as you probably could have guessed by this moment , I have decided in 2020 to run for president ,
â€ �
West said , and dropped the mic .
But making the leap from rap superstar to president of the United States in the next four years has its challenges , even for West .
â€œIt would be unusual for someone to go directly from celebrity status to running for president , â€ � said Richard Skinner , a professor of political science at George Mason University .
â€œMost of the people who have done that have started off from a lower - level position.â€
�
Ronald Reagan , an actor from the 1930s to the 1960s , was the governor of California before was elected president .
Comedian Al Franken was elected to the Senate before he floated the idea of running for president .
Arnold Schwarzenegger , who can never be president because he is not a natural - born US citizen , built himself up as a prominent Republican in Hollywood before being elected governor of California .
Skinner noted that West is not a particularly political celebrity , and that it is not even obvious which party he would run for .
West registered to vote in the state of New York in 2013 , but did nor declare a party affiliation , according to the state board of elections .
Nonetheless , the Democratic party was quick to welcome him .
Perhaps the most political moment of Westâ€ ™ s career so far came in 2005 , when he criticized George W Bush over the federal governmentâ€ ™ s delayed response to hurricane Katrina .
â€œGeorge Bush doesnâ€ ™ t care about black people ,
â€ �
West declared during a Katrina benefit telethon .
During the 2014 midterms , West said he would support the Democratic party after he and his wife met Barack Obama before the November elections , and he asked his millions of Twitter followers to do the same â€œIf itâ€ ™ s a pure Trump - type candidacy , then heâ€ ™ s just a rich guy running for fun , â€ � Skinner said .
â€œBut if he seriously wants to do it the way other celebrities have pursued political careers , then he might want to try speaking out on issues , might want to try to get more politically active before he actually runs.â€
�
West set himself a target date of 2020 , rather than 2016 â€ “ perhaps in order to avoid potential problems at home , seeing as his wife , Kim Kardashian West , has already posted a selfie perceived as expressing her support for Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton .
The Wests paid $ 2,700 each towards her campaign to attend the function where the picture was taken , and in 2012 Kanye donated $ 1,000 to two Super Pacs set up to support Barack Obama .
Meanwhile , fans are preparing for Yeezy to move in to the White House .
Yeezy hopefuls have set up a countdown to the big day at Kanye2020.com , and Ian Cioffi , a libertarian activist , has snapped up the URL KanyeWest2020.com and redirected it to LibertyFest NYC , an annual event that invites speakers from across the political spectrum .
Some fans have suggested his famously large ego would not allow him to pick a vice - president , leading to a Kanye - Kanye 2020 ticket .
Obamaâ€ ™ s famous Hope posters are circulating with Westâ€ ™ s face above the slogan Yeezy , and a Ready
For Kanye Pac has been registered with the Federal Election Commission .
â€œI think Kanye West would be a great leader for this country , â€ � said Eugene Craig III , who registered the Ready for Kanye Pac .
â€œPersonally , Iâ€ ™ d like to see him seek the mayorship of Chicago before running for president .
But in an age when weâ€ ™ re taking Donald Trump seriously , I think we should absolutely take Kanye seriously.â€ �
Craig noted Westâ€ ™ s criticism of the public school system and his calls to end the war on drugs .
He said one of Westâ€ ™ s most lucid lines during his Sunday night rant was when he said : â€œWeâ€ ™ re not gon na control our kids with brands.â€ � â€œHeâ€ ™ s anti - corporatism while still being a person that understands the power of entrepreneurship , â€ � said Craig , who is also the chairman of the Young Minority Republican Fund .
Craig , too , isnâ€ ™ t sure what party West would run for , though heâ€
™ s hopeful the musician would be a Republican .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think thereâ€ ™ s a better way to reach out to young minority voters than to bring Kanye West into the fold of the Republican party , â€ � Craig said .
So , will the boundary - pushing artist truly run for president ?
â€œImagine if Da Vinci or Michelangelo or Galileo were asked not to think of anything except for the one thing they first became famous for ,
â€ �
West once said .
â€œSo Da Vinci could only have one idea?â€ �"
2015-08-31,"Steve Jobs famously declared that the Segway would be â€œas big a deal as the PCâ€ � , until he actually saw one , at which point he recanted and decided that â€œit sucksâ€ � .
Since its launch , the self - balancing motorised scooter has had just one other big moment in the spotlight , in 2011 , when Jimi Heselden , the British businessman who acquired the US - founded company , rolled off a cliff to the great scrapyard in the sky .
Far from changing the world , the Segway has been an underwhelming innovation , limited in its reach , lacking in transformative powers .
It evokes images of retirees gently trundling through Florida towards the golf course , or portly security guards trundling towards the coffee machine , or tourists with tired legs trundling around European landmarks .
Trundle is not a very sexy word .
Until last week , when a humble , trundling scooter took out the fastest man in the world .
At the World Athletic Championships in Beijing , cameraman Song Tao interrupted Usain Boltâ€ ™ s 200 m victory lap , knocking the worldâ€ ™ s greatest sprinter clean off his speedy feet with a misjudged lean against an unseen barrier .
The Segway was everywhere , again , for the wrong reasons , again .
It looked as if Taoâ€ ™ s battery - run vehicle had careered out of control .
It looked painful .
But how hard can it be to learn to ride the worldâ€ ™ s most talked - about gyroscopic balancing machine ?
I went to Segway Unleashed to find out .
Itâ€ ™ s hard to say Segway Unleashed without sounding like youâ€ ™ re doing the voiceover for a disaster movie trailer .
On the way to one of its two centres â€ “ where we are promised â€œthe most exciting Segway experience in the south east and Milton Keynesâ€ �
â€ “
I asked my friend what she thought of when I said â€œSegwayâ€ � .
She thought about it for a minute , then said , with certainty : â€œfleeceâ€ � .
To Segway is to trundle , in a fleece .
Clearly we have preconceptions .
The branch of Segway Unleashed that I visit is just off the M25 , in the grounds of a beautiful farm near Godstone in Surrey .
I stick my head into the workshop and say hello to Ben Morling , founder and MD of both branches , who got into the Segway business after some success with a sphering , or zorbing , company .
( Youâ€ ™ re strapped into a giant , inflatable ball and rolled down a hill .
Ben shows me the shape of his broken fingers , all sphering - related injuries , and I can see why he got into Segway instead . )
Ben is reassembling a Segway , which came back from the repair shop this weekend , with a Â£1,000 bill .
I thought they might cost around Â£1,000 , which is twice as much as the car I arrived in , so I ask him exactly how much a Segway would set me back .
Six thousand pounds
, he tells me , immediately dashing my dreams of zipping around Guardian HQ using only my natural balancing skills and the scientific might of gyroscopic sensors .
Canâ€ ™ t you get one cheaper ?
â€œThatâ€
™ s why a Ferrari is a Ferrari , â€ � he tells me .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not the cheap , plastic crap .
I went to the Gadget Show
and I tried them , and nah.â€
�
He shakes his head .
There will be no cheap , plastic crap at Segway Unleashed .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve never taken out an Olympic runner on one of these .
Weâ€ ™ ve taken each other out , but not a runner!â€ �
Ben is pretty sure it wasnâ€ ™ t a Segway that took out Usain Bolt .
Not an official one , anyway .
He shows me a still from the incident on his phone , and zooms in for forensic analysis .
The rubber footplates that distribute the riderâ€ ™
s
weight were absent .
He thinks the mudguards were too small .
The charge port is the wrong colour .
There is no red line on the battery .
It just wouldnâ€ ™ t happen at Segway Unleashed .
The price tag is one of the reasons people think Segways havenâ€ ™ t really taken off â€ “ even though other companies have brought out cheaper versions costing a few hundred pounds .
That , and the fact that in many places , you canâ€ ™ t just jump on one and use it to nip to the shops , or for your daily commute .
In the UK , they are banned from pavements ( though only one man has ever been prosecuted â€ “ Philip Coates , from South Yorkshire , who was fined Â£75 under Section 72 of the Highways Act 1835 ) .
In Germany , they must be licensed .
In Canada , they are banned from public roads and sidewalks .
Legislatively , they are confusing , at best .
But here , on private land , seven of us are ready to learn exactly how far these two - wheeled mean machines will take us .
We have signed to accept that there is some risk of a broken bone .
I agree that I am not under the influence of alcohol or narcotics , and do not have any medical conditions that might impact my ability to control the unit .
I am given a red motorcycle helmet that I decide makes me look like a Power Ranger , though when I say this to my friend , she has a look that suggests she is thinking , â€œPower Plonker , more likeâ€ � .
We are ready .
To be .
Unleashed !
The Segways are in beginnerâ€ ™ s
â€œturtle
modeâ€
� and will go at a maximum speed of 4.5 mph .
Our group â€ “ me , my friend , a couple in their 20s , and a father and his two kids â€ “ begin the session in Zone One : a field in which we learn how to balance and lean .
Our instructor , Kieran Richards , is on his third season at Segway Unleashed .
He got into Segway after a couple of seasons of sphering , where he met Ben , who introduced him to the harder stuff .
Confounding my notions of fleece , Kieran is a laidback skater who says he falls off the Segways all the time , but only because heâ€ ™ s trying to do tricks on them , which even he admits can be foolish .
Leaning , he says to the group , is the key to everything .
â€œBe consistent with your leaning , â€ � he tells us .
â€œDonâ€
™ t be too aggressive with your leaning.â€ � Usain Bolt has made his life a whole lot easier , because people didnâ€ ™ t really think you could fall off a Segway , and then suddenly , a video went around the world proving that you could , and how .
Poor Song Tao , I think .
Once a noble cameraman , now a â€œhow not toâ€ � punchline in an off - road Segway experience on a farm in Surrey .
Kieran says that people only fall off when they catch their wheels , like Tao did , or when they get too cocky .
I resolve not to get too cocky .
4.5 mph sounds pretty slow , until youâ€ ™ re standing on a self - balancing scooter controlled by a gyroscope that relies solely on your ability to lean forwards and backwards with just enough oomph to make sure it moves .
Itâ€ ™ s a bit like stepping onto solid ground if youâ€ ™ ve been on water for hours .
It should be the easiest thing in the world to stand still and upright , but suddenly my legs are untrustworthy , and I rock back and forth .
The trick is to relax , apparently .
I am glad I donâ€
™ t have a chest full of camera equipment to carry with me .
Once balance is established , itâ€ ™ s fairly easy : forward to go , back to stop .
Donâ€ ™ t be aggressive with your leaning .
The seven of us zip around the training field , at 4.5 mph .
I avoid the bumps .
After five minutes , I seek out the bumps .
I wonder how hard it would be to do Segway tricks .
Zone Two : the woods .
In the woods , we learn to use our knees as shock absorbers , and Joe Hammond , another skater - turned - instructor , starts â€œcatching airâ€
� from a tree root that acts as a launching ramp .
â€œYou will not catch air , â€ � he reassures us , though I start to think I would like to catch air .
The woods are fun .
Theyâ€ ™ re muddy and bumpy and even though the Segway is still going at 4.5 mph ( maximum ) , it no longer seems like a trundle .
This is what extreme sports must feel like !
If youâ€ ™ re doing them very slowly !
I go over a root and feel my Segway lifting at least 2 mm off the ground .
I wonder if I could get sponsorship .
Perhaps Nike would like to see their logo on my raincoat as I amble around a track in a wood .
Maybe Vans would pay me to wear their trainers , as I lean forward into the unknown .
An Adidas helmet .
A Red Bull jumper .
Perhaps , perhaps .
I am ready for the final step .
Zone Three : the time trials .
The time trials are the most dangerous part of the session .
â€œThis is where the psychology kicks in , â€ �
Ben tells me .
Simply , he says , people are desperate to be the fastest , even though â€œthereâ€ ™ s no prize or anything.â€
�
I am desperate to be the fastest .
We get a practice run around the track , after a final lesson in leaning .
Here , Kieran explains , you can actually put your weight on the sideplates , like a parallel turn if youâ€ ™ re skiiing , or like taking a corner on a motorbike .
Joe does some leans that say : I mean business .
None of us quite pull it off , but itâ€ ™ s getting serious .
Turtle mode is switched off .
We are about to enter maximum Segway speed : 12.5 mph .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve come off at that before , â€ � says Joe , like a man who has known trauma .
We line up for the time trial .
I lean forward as hard as Iâ€ ™ ve ever leaned , except on the corners , which are muddy , and look as if they could be slippy .
Then I lean some more .
I whizz â€ “ no more trundling â€
“ across the finish line , and wait for our times to come in .
I am not seventh !
Applause .
I am not sixth !
More applause , this time for my friend , who fell off taking the corner a little bit too keenly , proving that I was right not to go feral .
I am not â€ ¦ hold on .
I am fifth .
I am only marginally faster than someone who stacked it and had to get back on before she could continue the time trial .
I get my applause .
The sponsorship dream dies .
We were all beaten by an 11-year - old , who managed the track â€œwith a very quick time indeed , very fastâ€ � , according to an impressed - looking Kieran .
Kids are fearless , we agree .
It does not look like Segways are going to take the UK by storm , but Joe thinks a version of them may become mainstream yet .
The â€œnew , smaller , cheaper thingsâ€ � he refers to have yet to adopt a common name , but are called swegways by some , hover boards by others .
They are , essentially , Segways without handles , made more cheaply .
Segway Unleashed has had people bringing their swegways to the farm , to see if they can be repaired .
â€œI tell them , send it back to who made it , â€ � says Ben .
They are more of the â€œcheap , plastic crapâ€ � of which he does not approve .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re saying itâ€ ™ s a Segway like youâ€ ™ d say Hoover for a vacuum
, â€ � he says .
His Segways are metal , not plastic .
They are built to last .
Down and out : Segwayâ€ ™ s other celebrity victims
George Bush : Of course George Bush has had a Segway fail .
The former president could no more stay away from a two - wheeled transporter than a Thanksgiving turkey could keep out of his trousers .
In 2003 , while visiting the family house in Maine , the then president stepped on to a Segway and went down instantly .
Being Dubya , he got back up and proceeded to cruise up the driveway with his father , George Bush Sr , bringing up the rear on , yep , another Segway .
One wonders if the company slogan â€ “ â€œsimply
movingâ€ �
â€ “ was inspired by this very scene .
Piers Morgan :
After Bushâ€ ™ s fall from grace , Piers Morganâ€ ™ s
Daily Mirror ran the gleeful headline : â€œYouâ€ ™ d have to be an idiot to fall off , wouldnâ€ ™ t you Mr President ,
â€ � adding that â€œif anyone can make a pigâ€ ™ s ear of riding a sophisticated , self - balancing machine like this ,
Dubya can.â€ �
However , Segways have their own way of redressing the gyroscopic balance of power and soon enough the another powerful white man was beckoned on to the bucking bronco .
Four years later Morgan had an epic fall off a Segway while cruising along the promenade at Santa Monica beach , breaking three ribs .
â€œSince only [ Bush ]
and I appear to have ever fallen off one ,
â€ � he later said ,
â€œI think the makers of the Segway can probably still justifiably claim the machines are â€˜idiot - proof.â€ ™ â€ �
Joe Previtera :
Aussie cameraman Joe Previtera provided a foreshadowing of Usain Boltâ€ ™ s fate when he catapulted off his Segway during the 2011 Australia v India Test match in Melbourne .
The culprit this time was a helmet on the ground , which Previtera drove over .
The commentators burst into laughter and Previtera , who was helped to his feet by the wicketkeeper , confessed he had earlier bragged : â€œNo way , I will never crash this thing ever.â€ �
Fact : sports cameramen can not shoot and Segway at the same time .
They would be safer , cooler ( and possibly faster ) gliding about the pitch in kidsâ€ ™ roller shoes .
Ellie Goulding :
Itâ€ ™ s not just world leaders and cameramen who are cocky enough to think they can tame the 12.5 mph Segway .
Pop star Ellie Goulding hopped on one on holiday in Miami , at first â€œtaking off effortlessly along the pavement by the beachâ€ � , according to the tabloid who captured the tumble frame by mind - numbing frame .
Disaster ( OK , sand ) struck , Goulding went flying , then got up and took a bow .
In beachwear .
You can see why this made the news .
Ellen DeGeneres :
At the start of 2010 the US talkshow host did a monologue on the Segway X2 that Portia de Rossi had just bought her for Christmas .
During the skit she rode the machine around the studio , then admitted : â€œIâ€ ™ ve already hurt myself on it
twice.â€
�
The first time was on Christmas morning when , heading for a flowerbed , she threw herself off and split her shin open .
The second was rehearsing the monologue and falling off while demonstrating her ability to go backwards .
Cut to a clip of the fall and DeGeneres shouting : â€œDid we get it on tape because thatâ€ ™ s the most important thing?â€
�
What a pro ( or ego ) .
Jimi Heselden :
The Segway falls into the tragic category of inventions that have killed its inventors or owners .
In 2010 , less than a year after taking over the company , millionaire businessman Jimi Heselden was driving his off - road Segway X2 when he fell off a cliff and into a river near his West Yorkshire estate and died .
The coroner later said the 62-year - old reversed the machine to make way for a dog walker and died as a result of this â€˜act of courtesyâ€ ™ .
Less than 48 hours after Heseldenâ€ ™ s death , research was published indicating that accidents involving Segways are on the rise .

2015-09-03,"Suffragette , the highly anticipated drama about the fight for equal voting rights for British women in the first part of the last century , is to world premiere at the Telluride film festival this weekend .
The film , which stars Carey Mulligan and Helena Bonham Carter , with Meryl Streep as Emmeline Pankhurst , will have its first screening on 4 September as part of this yearâ€ ™ s four - day event in Colorado .
Mulligan wonâ€ ™ t be attending as the screening coincides with the due date of her first child , but Streep will present the movie alongside writer Abi Morgan ( who scripted The Iron Lady ) and director Sarah Gavron .
Speaking to the Guardian , the festival executive director , Julie Huntsinger , said the story was an â€œincredibly important oneâ€ � that â€œvery few Americans â€ “ even really savvy feminists â€ “ are that familiar withâ€ � .
The premiere is one of a number of high - profile first looks at the event , which is sandwiched between the Venice and Toronto film festivals , and has a reputation for debuting key Oscar titles .
Steve Jobs , the Danny Boyle - directed biopic starring Michael Fassbender , screens for the first time , followed by a tribute to its director .
Scripted by Aaron Sorkin , the movie focuses on three key Apple product launches and co - stars Seth Rogen and Kate Winslet as company seniors Steve Wozniak and Joanna Hoffman .
â€œItâ€ ™ s transcendent , â€ � reported Huntsinger .
â€œI
couldnâ€ ™ t believe how it made me feel.â€
�
Telluride will also screen Room , Lenny Abrahamsonâ€
™ s adaptation of the Emma Donoghue bestseller about a woman ( played by Brie Larson ) locked for years in a room with her child .
The film moves to Toronto the following week .
It also gets a five - day head start on the Venice screening of Anomalisa , Charlie Kaufmanâ€ ™
s
Kickstarter - funded , stop - motion love story , which he co - directs with Duke Johnson .
Despite being animated , the movie appears grounded in familiar Kaufman territory : itâ€ ™ s about a depressed manâ€ ™ s midlife crisis , and has been awarded an R rating for â€œstrong sexual content , graphic nudity and languageâ€ � .
It contains , according to Huntsinger , â€œthe most awkward sex scene in the history of cinemaâ€ � .
Founded in 1974 , Telluride is now run by Huntsinger with festival co - creator Tom Luddy , and is known for its commitment to world and archive cinema , its restricted number of passholders and its relatively relaxed atmosphere .
Other programme highlights include screenings of Cannes hits Son of Saul , Rams and Carol â€ “ preceded by a tribute to Rooney Mara , the filmâ€ ™ s
lead actor â€ “ as well as a strand of programming from guest director , Rachel Kushner .
Two hot - potato documentaries also premiere :
Winter on Fire , about the crisis in Ukraine , and Time to Choose , in which Charles Ferguson examines the shifting attitude of big business towards sustainable energy solutions .
There is also a spot for Sydney Pollackâ€ ™ s swansong : a study of Aretha Franklin , Amazing Grace .
The festival also pays tribute to British documentary - maker Adam Curtis , with screenings of his latest film , Bitter Lake , about the relationship between Afghanistan and the west , as well as 2002â€ ™ s The Century of the Self , which traced the influence of Sigmund Freud and Edward Bernays on the power of governments and corporations to exercise mind control .
â€œIt shocks me when people donâ€ ™ t know who [ Curtis ] is , â€ � said Huntsinger .
â€œBut then he is telling them something very hard to avoid : that all their fairytales are bullshit.â€ �
Curtis will be quizzed on stage by Geoff Dyer and by Laurie Anderson , whose film essay about her dog , Lolabelle , is also screening .
A 24-hour showcase of the best of the BBCâ€ ™ s arts series Arena , which turned 40 this year , will be broadcast on the townâ€ ™ s regional TV station .
The Telluride film festival runs from 4 - 8 September ."
2015-09-05,"Four years ago , the death of Apple co - founder Steve Jobs triggered a global expression of mourning of a depth and duration that Oscar - winning documentary - maker Alex Gibney found hard to explain .
Were the people who gathered at candlelit vigils at Apple stores around the world grieving for Jobs , or the perceived loss of a future that seemed to promise an endless procession of gadgets and devices each more extraordinary and innovative than the last ?
This is the central question that underpins Gibneyâ€ ™ s Steve Jobs :
The Man in the Machine , a potent critique of the man and the company that , in tandem with Gibneyâ€ ™ s previous work , including Taxi to the Dark Side and Going Clear : Scientology and the Prison of Belief , seeks to penetrate well - defended citadels of belief .
But neither this , nor Danny Boyleâ€ ™ s Michael Fassbender - starring Steve Jobs biopic due next month , is likely to win the approval of Jobsâ€ ™ family or Appleâ€ ™ s executives , since both films dwell on the contradictions in Jobsâ€ ™ character
â€ “ the adopted child who initially denied paternity of his own daughter ; the creator of the worldâ€ ™ s most valuable company who considered philanthropy a waste of time ; the Zen seeker who short - changed colleagues , and oversaw an executive culture of backdated stock options and tax avoidance schemes .
â€œSteve was so hugely successful , yet he treated so many people so badly ,
â€ �
Daniel Kottke , Jobsâ€ ™ college friend and Apple employee number 12 , tells the director .
â€œHow much of an asshole do you have to be to be successful?â€ �
Gibney says he came to consider Jobs as a â€œmonk without empathyâ€ � .
â€œAs
the guy who presided over a company that came to be the most valuable on Earth , and as somebody who came out of the counterculture , itâ€ ™ s a critique of how values become compromised .
How you can take on their surface effects
â€ “ the black turtleneck , listening to Bob Dylan , friends with Bono â€
“ yet still pay your Chinese workers a pitiful amount , despoil the environment , do shady stock transactions , pay no tax.â€
�
Gibney says Jobsâ€ ™ widow Laurene Powell initially offered to help with the project but then backed off .
He claims he later found she had sought to dissuade potential interviewees from participating .
Apple executives are known to regard the media with suspicion , a tradition , the film shows , established by Jobs himself â€ “ and not without some justification .
The publication date of Walter Isaacsonâ€ ™ s biography of Jobs was brought forward as Jobsâ€ ™ health failed ; his children had to be restrained from confronting the author at their fatherâ€ ™ s memorial .
Apple has not commented on Gibneyâ€ ™ s portrayal .
However , following a screening earlier this year , software chief Eddy Cue described it as â€œan inaccurate and mean - spirited view of my friendâ€ � .
Four years on , perhaps , a new perspective on Jobsâ€ ™ achievements is timely , not only , as Gibney says , because â€œgovernments are withering and corporations assuming ever more powerâ€ � but also because technology is assuming an ever greater role in the way we communicate .
As Apple prepares to unveil a new version of its most profitable product , the iPhone , in San Francisco , itâ€ ™ s
Gibneyâ€ ™ s view that the sharp contours of Jobsâ€ ™ personality remain set into the highly proscribed way they function .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s something magnificent he did in terms of making us feel more comfortable with our machines
â€ “ they have become extensions of ourselves .
Yet thatâ€ ™ s the very thing that should make us cautious , â€ � says Gibney .
â€œThese machines connect us , but they isolate us , too .
People at Apple get so upset if you criticise Steve .
But why shouldnâ€ ™ t we ask tough questions about where weâ€ ™ re going with technology and how technology works for us?â€ �
Gibney says Jobs very consciously created a story whereby he was the man who was guiding the universe , â€œbut it wasnâ€ ™ t necessarily like that at allâ€ � .
â€œJobs knew the people around him could make him great and he could make them rich .
So he crafted a vision of him as the grand vizier because that was easier for everyone to appreciate and understand .
He provided direction .
I think people inside Apple thought , â€˜Fine , heâ€ ™ s making us zillions .
Weâ€ ™ ll pump the bellows in the engine room while Steve goes out and tells a story about himself.â€ ™ â€
� Through the film
, Jobsâ€ ™ character appears to evolve :
the tech geek routing telephone calls through international networks and exchanges , the 80s Tom Cruise clone , the 90s cult leader , and finally the weakening prophet who seemed to diminish even as Apple grew more dominant .
â€œHe was a narcissist , no question about that , â€ � says Gibney ,
â€œbut
I think he wisely perceived that all of us are narcissists in some ways .
One of the reasons these products are so attractive to us is that they are a reflection of who we are .
That was his genius.â€ �
Gibney believes the expression of grief that accompanied Jobsâ€
™ death was of followers cut adrift .
Jobsâ€ ™ sense of self - certainty ( â€œMake great products and fuck everything elseâ€ � ) was compelling .
In his absence , the company has been forced to backtrack on several occasions .
There was the issue of third - party apps , automatically placing U2â€ ™ s new album on iTunes , the recent battle between Apple and record labels over streaming payments .
In film editing , Appleâ€ ™ s
Final Cut Pro was once the industry standard .
But , according to Gibney , Apple dumbed it down , made it more rigid , and film - makers deserted it .
If David is now Goliath , are we still interested in the stories Goliath has to tell ?
â€œApple sells you freedom , but the mechanism of its design is extremely rigid , â€ � says Gibney .
â€œâ€˜I know better than you what you really wantâ€ ™ â€ “ that came from Steve .
Apple is not sacred .
At some point , if Apple continues to go that way , people will desert them , too.â€ �
â€¢ Steve Jobs :
The Man in the Machine is released in the US on 4 September ."
2015-09-06,"The director Danny Boyle has called for more films to be made about the creators of influential new technology .
Speaking at the Telluride film festival , where his Aaron Sorkin - scripted biopic of Apple co - founder Steve Jobs is winning largely rave reviews , Boyle said that those in the movie industry had a responsibility to examine the import of people such as Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg , the Facebook creator who was the subject of Sorkinâ€ ™ s 2010 hit , The Social Network .
â€œThese films have to be made , â€ � he said .
â€œBenign as they may seem , they have created forces that are more powerful than governments and banks .
And they donâ€ ™ t seem motivated by money .
I find that extraordinary .
Itâ€ ™ s a paradigm shift we seem blissfully unaware of .
Theyâ€ ™ re not interested in money but in data .
Our data.â€ �
The film is largely an interiors piece , unfolding in real time in the 40 minutes before three key Apple product launches : the Mac in 1984 , the NeXT box in 1988 , once Jobs has split from Apple , and the iMac in 1998 , when heâ€ ™ s back in business with the company .
Yet despite the offer of tax breaks from countries such as England and Hungary , Boyle was insistent that the film not be shot far from Silicon Valley .
â€œSan Francisco is the Bethlehem of the second industrial revolution , â€ � he said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s where the extraordinary forces emerged that now rule our lives.â€
�
The film had a slightly bumpy production history : originally David Fincher was set to direct for Sony , before Universal and Boyle took up the baton .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve been told not to say this , â€ � said Boyle ,
â€œbut for me
itâ€ ™
s clearly the second part of The Social Network.â€ � Boyle
reported that he watched Fincherâ€ ™ s film closely in preparation and was struck by how much time people in the film spend sitting down .
â€œWhen they do stand up itâ€ ™ s at incredibly critical moments.â€ �
Steve Jobs inverts this model .
â€œLike
Jobs himself itâ€
™ s a film of movement .
We thought of the film as the sound of his mind.â€ �
The aesthetic of the three acts was , says Boyle , carefully delineated so as not to feel repetitious .
Therefore the â€œpunkyâ€ � first third shows Jobs trying to forge a â€œcreationist
mythâ€
� , the second is all about elegance , while the third has even cleaner lines .
â€œAnd simplicity is now seen as the ultimate sophistication , â€ � said Boyle .
â€œProducts and world vision are both heading that way.â€ � Early notices have been struck by the centrality of Sorkinâ€ ™ s machine gun dialogue and a particularly strong performance by Michael Fassbender in the lead .
Sorkin said heâ€ ™ d felt a great deal of anxiety embarking on the project .
â€œ[Jobs ] is someone a lot of people have a lot of very strong feelings about .
Itâ€ ™ s a bit like setting out to write about the Beatles.â€
�
His intention , he said , was akin to creating a painting rather than taking a photograph .
â€œI
didnâ€
™ t want it to be a cradle - to - grave biopic or a piece of journalism .
Art isnâ€ ™ t about what happened.â€
�
Sorkin also praised Alex Gibneyâ€ ™ s documentary about Jobs , which was released in the US last week .
â€œYou can see a very good piece of journalism about him.â€ �
By contrast , Sorkin said he identified points of friction between Jobs and five people â€ “ Apple co - founder Steve Wozniak , Jobsâ€ ™ right - hand - woman Joanna Hoffman , one - time Apple CEO John Sculley , original Mac team member Andy Hertzfeld and Jobsâ€ ™ daughter Lisa ( as well as her mother )
â€ “ and chose to dramatise them .
Sorkin spoke to key players in his research , including Lisa , whose paternity Jobs initially denied , and who his biographer Walter Isaacson had been unable to talk to , but said most of the dialogue was fictional .
One scene in which Jobs rinses his feet in a lavatory was taken from truth , however - â€œgestural not slavish , â€ � said Boyle .
â€œAnd British films always have to have at least one scene in a toilet.â€ �
And a key line in the film â€ “ when Jobs asks Hoffman how it is theyâ€ ™ ve never slept together â€ “ was also lifted from dialogue with Hoffman herself .
Winslet said she too had met with Hoffman while preparing to play the role and was struck by the sense that â€œshe didnâ€ ™ t need anything from him .
It seems to me everyone else did for personal gain - money or a job .
She just needed him to be a decent man.â€ �
A relatively traumatic childhood , starting in Armenia , had also given her a fearlessness in the face of a man many were intimidated by .
â€œShe said : â€˜Steve Jobs was just like a frat boy , â€ ™ â€ � said Winslet .
â€œShe did genuinely love him .
And spending time with her , when I was figuring out how to play this difficult fucking terrible part , she would become very emotional .
She misses him terribly.â€ �
Speaking about her lack of resemblance to Hoffman , Winslet said sheâ€ ™ d first heard of the role through a make - up artist with whom she was working on another film in Australia .
Eager to be considered , Winslet dispatched her husband , Ned Rock n Roll , to buy her brown - haired wigs â€ “ then later donned one , with spectacles , and sent a selfie to the producer , Scott Rudin .
Then came the challenge of accessing the closely - guarded script .
â€œIt was like trying to get into King Tutâ€ ™ s
Tomb , downloading five apps to access the fucking thing.â€
�
The particular structure of the film , she said â€ “ one scene in the final reel especially â€ “ had her weeping with nerves as to whether she would be able to manage such extended sequence without recourse to easy edits .
â€œI was like : fuck .
Iâ€ ™ m not going to be able to do that .
If you canâ€ ™ t do it [ then ] you canâ€ ™ t do it .
Then your name will be shit and your career will go down the toilet.â€ �
Rogen , meanwhile , reported heâ€ ™ d done his first audition in eight years to play Wozniak but assumed he hadnâ€ ™ t landed the part .
â€œI heard nothing for eight months and during which time i ruined the studio that was making the movie [ after his North Korea baiting comedy The Interview triggered hackers to infiltrate Sonyâ€ ™ s emails ] .
So they had to go somewhere else
and I was a little worried that might affect things.â€
�
The actor also met his character , and found him , he said , more than happy to speak about his experiences .
â€œHis feelings towards Jobs were very complex and interesting .
Part of it was taking it at face value and part was reading between the lines.â€ �
After the premiere on Saturday evening , Wozniak had reported been pleased with the results , saying that if he didnâ€ ™
t recognise some of the specifics , he felt the film did capture the sentiment .
Not present was Fassbender , currently shooting the Assassinâ€ ™ s Creed movie .
All cast and crew were united in their admiration for the actor , who they said they never saw look at the 200 page script on set , and who , according to Winslet , turned his â€œtrue white heat of fear into the most incredible determination we have ever seen.â€ �
Rogen echoed the sentiment .
Watching Fassbender turn into Jobs was â€œhorrifying at times â€ ¦ truly unsettling but it was also the most impressive thing
Iâ€ ™ ve ever seen an actor do .
And Iâ€ ™ ve worked with Danny McBride ."
2015-09-06,"After The Social Network proved tech entrepreneurs could be just as fascinating a big screen subject as any other kind of entrepreneur , the same team was assembled for a look at the life of Apple co - founder Steve Jobs .
But David Fincher ultimately dropped out , along with backers Sony , and Aaron Sorkinâ€ ™ s script fell into Danny Boyleâ€ ™ s lap instead , with Michael Fassbender in the lead .
Boyle isnâ€
™ t an automatic fit for the material .
His hyper - kinetic style , growing tiresome since 2013â€ ™ s misjudged thriller Trance , clashes with what would essentially act as a fact - based document of the lauded tech icon .
But , to his credit , heâ€ ™ s respectably restrained , easing up on the unnecessary flourishes and allowing his actors , and Sorkinâ€ ™ s talky script , to dominate .
The film takes the unusual route of focusing on three key product launches , acting as equally weighted self - contained plays , of sorts .
The first takes place in 1984 as Jobs prepares to unveil the Mac , the second in 1988 as he splits from Apple to launch a rival computer with his company NeXT and finally in 1998 as he returns to the fold to revolutionise the industry with the iMac .
Throughout the film , recurring characters progress alongside Jobs , including Kate Winsletâ€
™ s no - nonsense head of marketing Joanna Hoffman ,
Seth Rogenâ€
™ s little - seen computer programmer Steve Wozniak and Jeff Danielsâ€ ™ stern CEO John Sculley .
We also see a personal sub - plot slowly increase in importance with a paternity wrangle involving an ex - girlfriend , played by Katherine Waterston and her five - year - old daughter .
With a Sorkin script at play , weâ€ ™ re never unsure who the ultimate auteur of the piece is .
The staples ( breakneck pace , frantic walk and talks , comfortably smug one - liners ) are all there in an almost overwhelming quantity .
While thereâ€ ™ s something to be admired about a script
thatâ€ ™ s unwilling to make things overly easy for the viewer ,
Sorkinâ€ ™ s terse prose and immediacy assumes enormous prior investment and an unwavering interest in the cult of Apple .
While The Social Network opened up a similar world and made it engaging to viewers who would proudly flaunt their lack of Facebook profile , Steve Jobs is aimed at the die - hard iPhone fetishists .
Sorkinâ€ ™ s
heavily heightened sense of drama works best when the stakes are equally aligned but , despite the film constantly informing you of just how incredibly important everything all is , itâ€ ™ s disappointingly difficult to truly care about whatâ€ ™ s taking place .
The lack of public acknowledgement for certain team members ( ! ! ) , the optional hard drive which isnâ€ ™ t really optional ( ! ! ! ) , the absence of a completed operating system for a product thatâ€ ™ s about to be demoâ€ ™ d ( ! ! ! ! )
, these are all treated with the same urgency as political crises in The West Wing .
The dialogue stifles , as is often the case with latter - day Sorkin , and the actors are tasked with trying to wrangle enough breathing space to offer up something of their own .
Fassbender succeeds and gives a self - assured , Oscar - friendly turn .
If his semi - autistic egotist comes a second place to Jesse Eisenbergâ€ ™ s similarly frustrating Mark Zuckerberg ,
thatâ€ ™ s not through lack of trying .
Winslet is a strong presence , even if her Polish / American accent wavers distractingly , while Rogen is given precious little to do .
Itâ€ ™ s Boyleâ€ ™ s best film for years , however .
This is admittedly faint praise but itâ€ ™ s worth recognising a leap in maturity , with a stronger focus on performances over his trademark flashiness .
His often distracting jukebox of song choices has also been largely replaced by mood - enhancing orchestral choices .
But , like the actors , he also plays second fiddle to Sorkinâ€ ™ s dominating script .
One wonders how Fincher would have dealt with it or whether he left the project , realising that no director could possibly compete .
While the film appears to be admirably unsentimental in its portrayal of Jobs , by the end , weâ€ ™ re getting close to Apple - sponsored hero iWorship .
The careless behaviour towards his ex and daughter is seemingly justified by his genius and thereâ€ ™ s something awfully overblown about the final scenes , as if Boyle and Sorkin were tempted to show him crossing through the gates of heaven but were hampered by budget constraints .
Thereâ€ ™ s undeniable craftsmanship here , especially in Fassbenderâ€ ™ s confident and transformative performance , but Sorkinâ€ ™ s
script fails to shout and quip its way to anything approaching dramatic vibrancy .
If you spent hours queuing up for the latest iPhone , this might prove masturbatory .
For everyone else , youâ€ ™ ll remain a PC , and proudly so ."
2015-09-08,"Is Mark Zuckerberg seeking to become the Steve Jobs of grey T - shirts ?
That is to say , just as black polonecks were a key part of Jobsâ€ ™ s brand , so grey marl has become visual shorthand for the Facebook CEO .
Zuckerberg has always claimed that his dedication to grey is simply an Obama - like strategy for minimising daily decisions ( â€œI feel like Iâ€ ™ m not doing my job if I spend any of my energy on things that are silly or frivolous , â€ �
he has said ) .
In fashion we call this the â€œwhat this old thing?â€ � defence .
Actually , this Vanity Fair cover is as grey , and as chic , as a Ralph Lauren campaign .
The T - shirt is the perfect shade of marl .
The neckline has just the right slouch .
And the greyscale is ramped up in the styling : smoky shades continue on the blackboard walls , behind him , and the slate floor beneath .
Itâ€ ™ s not quite 50 shades , but there are at least three .
Like Jobs before him , this self - identified fashion refusenik knows a thing or two about branding â€ “ and
heâ€ ™ s building his own through signature style ."
2015-09-09,"The race to next yearâ€ ™ s
Academy awards came into clearer perspective this weekend as the 42nd Telluride film festival unspooled its awards - friendly lineup of hard - hitting dramas and period biopics .
Sandwiched between the Venice and Toronto festivals , both of which also screen Oscar - hopeful fare ( Venice recently premiered Tom Hooperâ€ ™ s new bid for hardware , The Danish Girl , which next screens at Tiff ) , Telluride boasts fantastic Oscar odds : six of the last seven best picture winners premiered at the festival â€ “ four of them ( Slumdog Millionaire , The Kingâ€ ™ s Speech , Argo , 12 Years a Slave ) were world premieres .
No slam - dunk screenings occurred at this yearâ€ ™ s edition to rival the rapturous receptions 12 Years a Slave and Birdman received in years past , but a number of films â€ “ including Steve Jobs and Spotlight â€ “ made strong impressions , and will surely factor into the race to Oscar night .
The sure bets Steve Jobs Steve Jobs had everything going for it going into Telluride .
And it delivered , emerging as the probable frontrunner among the pack .
Directed by Oscar - winner Danny Boyle ( who also received a career tribute at the event ) , written by The Social Network scriptwriter Aaron Sorkin and starring Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet , Steve Jobs is fast - paced , smart entertainment â€ “ the kind Academy voters that love .
Fassbender is commanding as the Apple maverick , with Winslet and Jeff Daniels both providing solid supporting turns that merit consideration .
Sorkinâ€ ™ s script is expectedly very talky , but it also surprises with an ingenious three - act structure that defies the typical biopic template .
David Fincher was originally slated to direct the project , but Boyle manages to put his own distinct imprint on it : the film has Boyleâ€ ™ s characteristic frenetic energy , and boasts colourful visuals .
Sorkinâ€ ™ s treatment and Boyleâ€ ™ s pacing lend Steve Jobs a creative edge that drew comparisonâ€ ™ s to recent Oscar - winner Birdman .
Likely major nominations : Best picture , director , actor ( Fassbender ) , supporting actress ( Winslet ) , screenplay .
Spotlight
Following a strong showing at Venice , Tom McCarthyâ€ ™ s bracing account of the Boston Globeâ€ ™ s Pulitzer prizewinning investigation into a massive child molestation cover - up within the local Catholic archdiocese earned similarly rave notices at Telluride .
Expertly paced and acted by a stellar ensemble led by Michael Keaton , Spotlight is robust entertainment that emerged as a favourite among festivalgoers .
Likely major nominations : Best picture , supporting actor ( Keaton ) , screenplay .
Room Emma Donaghueâ€ ™ s novel was never going to make for an easy film to watch , and yet despite the grim nature of the material â€ “ a mother and son confined by a kidnapper â€ “ Lenny Abrahamsonâ€ ™ s adaptation managed to win over critics and audiences at Telluride , largely thanks to Brie Larsonâ€ ™ s raw performance as a woman abducted and raped at a young age .
Newcomer Jacob Tremplay , playing her son , is arguably the lead of the film , and astonishes with a remarkably assured turn for such a young performer .
Likely major nominations : Best actress ( Larson ) , supporting actor ( Tremblay ) .
Carol
Already a hit at Cannes , Todd Haynesâ€ ™ s lush period lesbian romance Carol arrived in Telluride with plenty of goodwill .
Rooney Mara , who plays a young store clerk who falls for Cate Blanchettâ€ ™ s regal housewife , tied to win best actress honors at Cannes .
She continued her victory run at the festival , receiving a career tribute despite her young age .
In the months since its Cannes premiere , Maraâ€ ™ s performance has come into focus as the standout of the two for its remarkable subtlety and precision .
Blanchett is terrific as always , but Maraâ€ ™ s haunting gaze lingers even longer in the mind .
Likely major nominations : Best picture , director , actress ( Mara ) , screenplay .
Son of Saul Another major hit with critics at Cannes , where it won the runner - up prize to the Palme dâ€ ™
Or , Son of Saul stopped by Telluride to devastate audiences and build momentum .
The intense Holocaust drama achieved both goals , earning further acclaim for GÃ © za RÃ¶hrigâ€ ™ s deeply felt debut performance as a Hungarian - Jewish prisoner in Auschwitz tasked with a horrifying duty , and the amazing work by first - time feature director LÃ¡szlÃ³ Nemes .
Likely major nominations : Best foreign language feature .
Possibilities Black Mass
After debuting to good word of mouth in Venice , Scott Cooperâ€ ™ s gangster epic Black Mass played in Telluride .
As rumoured , Johnny Depp makes a hell of a comeback as Irish / American Boston crime lord Whitey Bulger , and should factor into the best actor race for his transformative and eerie turn .
Matching him every step of the way is Joel Edgerton , whoâ€ ™ s having a great year , having just released his stellar directorial debut , The Gift .
Edgerton has the less showy role as a corrupt FBI agent , but heâ€ ™ s arguably the lead of the thriller , and holds the entire enterprise together with deft assuredness .
Possible major nominations : Best actor ( Johnny Depp ) , supporting actor ( Joel Edgerton ) .
Suffragette Carey Mulligan gives a layered and powerful performance as a young mother who fights for equality in the late 19th century by joining the Womenâ€ ™ s Social and Political Union .
The film is well - intentioned and moving in parts , but unfortunately lacks the urgency that made similarly themed historical dramas like Selma feel bracingly current .
Meryl Streep always helps boost a filmâ€ ™ s Oscar chances , and while she leaves a lasting impression as the founder of the movement , Emmeline Pankhurst , she only appears in a few minutes of screen - time , and probably wonâ€ ™ t factor into the race .
Possible major nominations : Best actress ( Mulligan ) , screenplay .
45 Years Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay drew further raves for their performances in 45 Years , months after winning acting prizes at Berlinale for their work as a long - married couple whose relationship is put under severe stress .
Andrew Haighâ€ ™ s accomplished follow - up to his gay romance Weekend is too small and subtle to go the distance this awards season , but Rampling , who has yet to score an Oscar nomination , shouldnâ€ ™ t go ignored .
Possible major nominations : Best actress ( Rampling ) .
He Named Me Malala Of the documentaries to premiere at Telluride this year ,
He Named Me Malala was the most high - profile due to its subject , Pakistani Nobel Peace prizewinner Malala Yousafzai , and pedigree ( itâ€ ™ s directed by Davis Guggenheim , Oscar - winner for An Inconvenient Truth ) .
Although audience reaction was strong , reviews were tepid at best , with the Guardianâ€ ™ s Catherine Shoard saying : â€œit is all but impossible for such a study to not stray into hagiography , and Guggenheim doesnâ€ ™ t really put up much of a fight.â€ �
Possible major nomination : Best documentary feature ."
2015-09-15,"It sounds oxymoronic , but forcing staff into chance encounters has become a big thing in office design .
The thinking , taken on by many business leaders â€ “ famously , the Apple CEO Steve Jobs was a fan
â€ “ is that the more employees bump into each other , the better they will collaborate and produce whizzy new ideas .
Now , a firm of architects has come up with software to test how staff will respond to different floorplans and how layouts can be changed to increase the likelihood of accidental meetings .
â€œWe can generate spaces that make people get around and interact , â€ � David Lewis of NBBJ told The Times this week .
â€œThe idea of serendipity is manufactured.â€ �
The position of the bathrooms , for instance , can be used to turn a trip to the loo into a way to maximise interaction .
This idea has long been held by the tech giants .
Appleâ€ ™ s huge new HQ seems to have been designed with Jobsâ€ ™ s fondness , as described in Walter Isaacsonâ€ ™ s biography , for â€œserendipitous and fluid meeting spacesâ€
� , with its central courtyard and wide corridors .
Facebookâ€ ™ s new head office has a giant roof garden with walking trails , â€œsnack kitchensâ€ � and casual meeting areas .
Shutterstock , the stock photo company , has a yoga studio and a wide central staircase which â€œconnects workspaces with the cafe and instigates serendipitous meet - upsâ€ � .
( A spokesperson from the financial media company Bloomberg â€ “ whose HQ design encourages collaboration â€ “ once described these encounters in a more menacing way :
â€œinstitutional eavesdroppingâ€ � . )
But is the value of those serendipitous encounters overhyped ?
â€œIt can be , â€ � says John Weeks , professor of leadership and organisational behaviour at IMD , the leading business school .
â€œWhat the research shows is that things like where you put the bathrooms really do matter in terms of the number of interactions that happen , but it also shows that those interactions arenâ€ ™ t necessarily productive.â€ �
He also warns that too much interaction can backfire .
There have been examples , he says , of people â€œwho now canâ€ ™ t get to their office without running into people .
People are finding back doors in order to get to their office , avoiding that social encounter.â€
�
Weeks and his colleague Anne - Laure Fayard found three things that had to be in place for the kind of productive encounters managers sought .
The first , propinquity , is â€œjust getting people in the same space so they run into each otherâ€ � .
But they also need privacy :
â€œIf thereâ€
™ s no privacy to have a conversation
, the conversation is unlikely to be very meaningful.â€ �
The third thing , just as important as the physical design of buildings , was the cultural attitude at work .
â€œThere is a problem if companies redesign the office but they donâ€ ™ t change the management practices , â€ � says Weeks .
He describes the manager who makes a does - anybody - actually - work - here ?
â€œjokeâ€ � when coming across employees sitting together with a coffee or chatting in the corridor .
A culture where employees are worried that they will be perceived as not working if they are not at their desks means â€œyouâ€ ™ re not going to get meaningful interactions .
Itâ€ ™ s not in 30 secondsâ€ ™ talking to someone from another department that you come up with some great innovation .
There has to be clear permission from leaders in the organisation to do an activity that typically we see as wasting time â€ “ sitting and chatting.â€ �"
2015-09-16,"There is a new genre in Hollywood , the tech origin story , and it comes with its own version of goodies and baddies .
Critically lauded films such as The Social Network , the Steve Jobs biopic Jobs , and even The Imitation Game , all present young , socially abrasive mavericks rallying against unimaginative naysayers who canâ€ ™ t dream of the future .
Itâ€ ™ s a potent formula , so you can see why the BBC is keen to tell the story behind the biggest British success story of modern tech , Grand Theft Auto , one of the best - selling franchises in the history of gaming .
The origins of Grand Theft Auto ( GTA ) can be found in Dundee where a bunch of newbie programmers created an expansive , but slightly shoddy , 2D game in which players drive around a city completing crime missions .
The Gamechangers skips all that , beginning when the franchise has been bought by Rockstar Games and 1 m copies of GTAâ€ ™ s fourth incarnation , Vice City , have already been sold .
The gameâ€ ™ s production is now being run out of New York by English brothers Sam and Dan Houser .
The BBCâ€ ™ s feature - length show centres around battles between Rockstar and Jack Thompson , a conservative Christian lawyer who styles himself on Batman .
Thompson tries to sue Rockstar , first because of the gameâ€ ™ s potentially violent influence on children and later because of a sex scene hidden in the gameâ€ ™ s code .
What follows is a well - paced pitter - patter of courtroom battles , boardroom struggles and personal anguish .
There was plenty of ambition to make this a big - budget , US - style boardroom tech story , with some flashy graphics and an impressive early scene in which a copycat GTA - style police killing is shot in the style of the game .
Big - name actors Daniel Radcliffe and Bill Paxton play the two main adversaries : Paxtonâ€ ™ s moral crusader with anger management issues is particularly convincing .
Itâ€ ™ s impossible not to compare The Gamechangersâ€ ™ desire to ape one genre of Hollywood movies , with Rockstarâ€ ™
s aim to ape another one : the violent action film .
One of the most revolutionary things about GTA is that it shows rather than tells : the story is told through gameplay and dialogue rather than the traditional expositional cut scenes , giving it an immersive film - like quality .
Unfortunately , those games feel more genuine than this rather stilted take on how they were made .
The script feels underdeveloped â€ “ perhaps writers were constrained by the limited source material and the refusal of Rockstar to cooperate in making the show â€ “ but most of the characters talk in unnatural soundbites .
In the opening minutes , it feels as if people are reading their character descriptions aloud : â€œHere she is , the successful wifeâ€ � and â€œCome on little brother , you are the clever funny one.â€
�
The portrayal of the game itself also falls short .
Anything remotely technical is presented in a shoddy , unrealistic style , which , in the age of super - accurate technology TV shows such as Mr Robot and Silicon Valley , seems very old - fashioned .
The scene in which people are furiously tapping away at keyboards and then suddenly watching a fully rendered sex scene seems particularly ridiculous .
But more problematic is that the show is disingenuous about what makes GTA revolutionary .
The game is celebrated because of the detail in the landscapes and gameplay , and the nihilistic freedom with which players can hijack cars and murder prostitutes .
None of that has much of a feelgood factor , so , instead , there is a pretence that the â€œgamechangingâ€ � thing about the new GTA is that the character can buy his own clothes and customise his style and that will affect his personality , something that has never really been at the centre of the game .
In the end , the downfall of Paxtonâ€ ™ s rightwing lawyer , who ends up being disbarred for his handling of the case , suggests a win for freedom of speech against the forces of censorship .
But there are still interesting questions to be asked about how a bunch of posh white guys from Britain made billions creating games that glorify American gang life .
In the show , Sam says that films and music are allowed to be gratuitous whereas games arenâ€ ™ t , but thatâ€ ™ s not true : all media comes under heavy scrutiny , and many films would be frightened to have characters revel in racism and sexism the way GTA does .
Unfortunately , those issues are either glossed over or played for laughs .
At least one thing the biopic got right was Rockstarâ€ ™ s bullish and confrontational press strategy .
As the show was airing , the company tweeted â€œ@BBC
This new Rentaghost isnâ€ ™ t as good as I rememberâ€ � and then later â€œ@BBC Was Basil Brush busy ?
What exactly is this random , made up bollocks?â€ �
Ironically , those two tweets showed more of the companyâ€ ™ s British roots and tetchy character than The Gamechangers did ."
2015-09-17,"Apple CEO Tim Cook has described recent attempts to immortalise the late technology guru Steve Jobs on the big screen as â€œopportunisticâ€ � during a high - profile interview on US television .
Speaking on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert , Cook said he did not recognise what the host described as â€˜unflatteringâ€ ™ portraits of his predecessor in the forthcoming Danny Boyle biopic Steve Jobs , nor the documentary Steve Jobs :
The Man in the Machine , which is due for a limited release in US cinemas this weekend and hit online formats earlier this month .
â€œThe Steve I knew was an amazing human being .
Heâ€
™ s someone that you wanted to do your best work for
, â€ � said Cook .
â€œHe had this uncanny ability to see around the corner and describe the future â€ “ not an evolutionary future but a revolutionary future.â€ �
Cook said he had not seen either movie , but added : â€œHe was a joy to work with and I love him dearly , I miss him every day .
I think that a lot of people are trying to be opportunistic and I hate that , itâ€ ™ s not a great part of our world.â€ � Reviewing The Man in the Machine earlier this year , the Guardianâ€ ™ s
Alex Needham described Alex Gibneyâ€ ™ s film as one which â€œforensically anatomises the contradictions , the ruthlessness , and the pointlessly crappy behaviour that reveal Appleâ€ ™ s ideals to be a sham , even while the products themselves continue to prove almost irresistible ,
â€ � adding that it â€œwill prove extremely displeasing to devoteesâ€ � .
Variety labelled the documentary â€œa coolly absorbing , deeply unflattering portrait of the late Silicon Valley entrepreneurâ€ � .
Meanwhile the Guardianâ€ ™ s Benjamin Lee called Danny Boyleâ€ ™ s Steve Jobs , which stars Michael Fassbender as the Apple co - founder , â€œadmirably unsentimental in its portrayalâ€ � after viewing the film at the Telluride film festival earlier this month .
The Hollywood Reporter suggested the Oscar - tipped biopic , based on a screenplay by The Social Networkâ€ ™ s Aaron Sorkin , presented a vision of a â€œdifficult and withholding man , one famous for abusing his underlings , keeping them guessing about where they stand and rejecting their ideas only to later claim them as his ownâ€ � .
Cookâ€ ™ s position on Steve Jobs stands in marked contrast to that of Apple co - founder Steve Wozniak , who acted as a consultant on the biopic .
â€œMy impression was I was shocked and amazed at how good it was in the sense of professional film - making , â€ � he told the BBC .
â€œI usually go to a movie not looking for â€˜do
I like the storyâ€ ™ as much as :
â€˜What is the quality that came out of the heads of the people that made it?â€ ™ â€ � â€œIn this case the film - makers have done an award - winning job .
The acting was just so realistic .
In some prior movies , I saw [ the actors ] simulating Steve Jobs , but they didnâ€ ™ t really make me feel like I was in his head understanding what was going on inside of him
â€ “ his personality .
This movie absolutely accomplishes that , and itâ€ ™ s due to great acting , which obviously comes from great directing.â€ �"
2015-09-28,"Aaron Sorkin has apologised for mounting a scathing attack on the Apple chief executive Tim Cook after the pair clashed over the forthcoming Oscar - tipped biopic Steve Jobs .
Sorkin , who wrote the screenplay for Danny Boyleâ€ ™ s film about Cookâ€ ™ s predecessor as head of the technology firm , told E !
News :
â€œYou know what , I think that Tim Cook and I probably both went a little too far .
And I apologise to Tim Cook .
I hope when he sees the movie , he enjoys it as much as I enjoy his products.â€ �
The Social Network and West Wing screenwriterâ€

apology came after he was drawn into a war of words with Cook following the latterâ€ ™

During his appearance , the Apple boss described recent attempts to immortalise Jobs on the big screen â€ “ he was referring to both Steve Jobs and the current Alex Gibney documentary Steve Jobs :
The Man in the Machine â€ “ as â€œopportunisticâ€ � , adding : â€œI hate that , itâ€ ™ s not a great part of our world.â€
�
Sorkin hit back at a roundtable junket interview in London last week , suggesting that the film - makers took pay cuts to get Steve Jobs made , and blasting Appleâ€ ™ s own record .
â€œNobody did this movie to get rich , â€ � he said , in comments recorded by the Hollywood Reporter .
â€œSecondly , Tim Cook should really see the movie before he decides what it is .
â€œThird , if youâ€ ™ ve got a factory full of children in China assembling phones for 17 cents an hour
youâ€ ™
ve got a lot of nerve calling someone else opportunistic.â€ �
Steve Jobs stars Michael Fassbender as the late tech guru , with Kate Winslet as original Mac team member Joanna Hoffman and Jeff Daniels as the former Apple chief executive John Sculley .

2015-10-03,"Michael Fassbender plays Apple co - founder Steve Jobs in Danny Boyleâ€
™ s new biopic , but he isnâ€ ™ t the first actor to portray the tech pioneer on screen .
In 2013 , Ashton Kutcher played the man in a critically reviled drama , Jobs .
Fassbender poked fun at Kutcherâ€ ™ s film during a press conference at the New York Film Festival on Saturday , where the film screened as the centerpiece presentation .
Asked how he prepared for the project , Fassbender smirked and said : â€œI studied Ashton Kutcher.â€
�
Unlike the film Jobs , Steve Jobs has been a hit with critics since premiering at the Telluride Film Festival .
Fassbender and the film are considered locks for the awards race this fall .
And unlike the Kutcher drama , which spanned Jobsâ€ ™ entire professional life , Sorkinâ€ ™ s screenplay works with a compressed timeframe , focusing on three iconic product launches and ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac .
Fassbender admitted that he didnâ€ ™ t know much about Jobs before embarking on the project , which was first set to be directed by David Fincher and star Christian Bale in the title role .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not very interested in technology , â€ � Fassbender said .
â€œI use it pretty poorly .
So everything was new to me , to be honest.â€ � Meeting with people who knew Jobs left a deep impression on Fassbender , he said .
Among the people he spoke with were former Apple CEO John Sculley , Jobsâ€ ™ s colleague and friend Joanna Hoffman , computer programmer Steve Wozniak and Andy Hertzfeld , who co - created the original Macintosh computer .
Fassbender said : â€œThe one thing that stuck with me was how much of an impression he made on these people .
â€œObviously when he was alive , but since he passed away , you could see that he was still very much present in their lives .
Even if the relationships were difficult , there was a sadness and a love there for him that I felt was pretty clear.â€ �
Since his casting was announced , many have been quick to criticize how Fassbender does not physically resemble the real - life person .
As it turns out , that factor troubled the actor as well .
â€œObviously I donâ€ ™ t look anything like Steve Jobs , â€ �
he said .
â€œThat was the first thing I said to Danny .
I said : â€˜Christian Bale looks a lot more like Steve Jobs than me.â€ ™ â€œHe wasnâ€ ™ t interested in that â€ “ he wanted to get the energy and essence of the man and go with that.â€ �
Steve Jobs opens 23 October in the US ."
2015-10-07,"The Oscar - winning screenwriter Aaron Sorkin has hit back at claims family and former colleagues of Steve Jobs are fiercely opposing his controversial forthcoming eponymous biopic of the late Apple co - founder .
The Wall Street Journal wrote on 4 October that the tech guruâ€ ™ s
widow Laurene Powell Jobs had repeatedly tried to â€œkillâ€ �
Danny Boyleâ€ ™ s film , which stars Michael Fassbender in the title role .
Current Apple CEO Tim Cook also described recent attempts to immortalise the late Jobs on the big screen as â€œopportunisticâ€ � during an appearance on the Late Show With Stephen Colbert last month .
Speaking on the NBC networkâ€ ™ s Today on Tuesday news programme , Sorkin said he hoped
Cookâ€

â€œTim
Cook â€ “ at the time he made that statement , at the time he took umbrage , he hadnâ€

â€œThe studio since set up a screening for him and he hasnâ€ ™ t said anything since.â€ � Responding to claims that Laurene Powell Jobs had not wanted the film made , Sorkin said : â€œMrs Jobs hasnâ€ ™ t seen the movie .
When she does , if she does , I think sheâ€ ™ ll be pleasantly surprised .
I donâ€

The film - makerâ€ ™ s script for the biopic touches on the former Apple CEOâ€ ™ s initial refusal to recognise his daughter ,
an episode Apple co - founder Steve Wozniak has described as â€œhard on me â€ ¦
when the money didnâ€ ™ t matter , and I can almost cry remembering itâ€ � .
The Social Network screenwriter said he understood why those who cared about Jobs might be concerned .
â€œCertainly with Mrs Jobs â€ “ and yesterday was the anniversary of Steveâ€

death , it was four years â€ “ with Mrs Jobs , with Tim Cook who was such a good friend ,
I donâ€

â€œBut again , they havenâ€ ™ t seen the movie , and I think they will be surprised that itâ€ ™ s not the thing theyâ€ ™ re scared of.â€ �
But Sorkin , who recently described writing â€œantiheroâ€ � characters such as Jobs â€œas
if they are making their case for Godâ€ � , admitted he struggled to find the humanity in his subject during the screenwriting process .
â€œIâ€ ™ ll be honest , with Steve it was tough ,

the father of a daughter .
He denied the paternity of his daughter .

My understanding is , she did call one or two of the actors.â€ � Steve Jobs , which will hit US cinemas on limited release this weekend as it builds anticipation for an expected Oscars run , is debuting in a very different form than might once have been expected .
As well as the shift from Sony to Universal over budget concerns , Boyle eventually replaced David Fincher in the directorâ€ ™ s chair , and Michael Fassbender stars in place of DiCaprio and Bale , both of whom were reported last year to have passed on the role of Jobs for unspecified reasons .
Boyleâ€ ™ s film , based on a screenplay by the Oscar - winning screenwriter of The Social Network , Aaron Sorkin , has drawn positive reviews from critics after debuting at the Telluride film festival last month .
But as well as opposition from Laurene Jobs , it has been criticised by Appleâ€ ™ s current chief executive , Tim Cook , who described the biopic ( and recent documentary The Man in the Machine ) as â€œopportunisticâ€ � during an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert earlier this month .
Boyle presents Jobs as a driven genius who struggled at times with personal relationships .
His refusal , for many years , to recognise his first - born daughter ( Lisa ) from a relationship with high - school girlfriend Chrisann Brennan ( played by Katherine Waterston in the film ) plays a central part in the narrative .
The Hollywood Reporter piece alleges Apple refused to license its famous 1984 commercial for the film , though Boyle was ultimately able to include it via fair use laws .
Meanwhile , Disney refused to allow the use of a clip from its ABC television division , Jobs having once sat on the studioâ€ ™ s board .
The British designer and current chief design officer for Apple , Jony I ve , has accused Boyleâ€ ™ s film of hijacking the tech iconâ€ ™ s legacy .
Speaking at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit in San Francisco , I ve said he had not seen Steve Jobs , but was aware that members of the Apple co - founderâ€ ™ s family had left screenings profoundly distressed at the biopicâ€ ™ s approach .
â€œThere are sons and daughters and widows and very close friends that are completely bemused and completely upset , â€ �
he said , in comments reported by The Verge .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re remembering and celebrating Steve Jobsâ€ ™ s life and at the same time there is this perfectly timed movie and I donâ€
™
t recognise this person.â€
�
I ve admitted Jobs â€œhad his triumphs and his tragedies like us
allâ€ � , but said his former colleague was having his â€œidentity described , defined by a whole bunch of other peopleâ€ � ,
and this was a personal struggle for him .
I ve described Jobs as a man with a keen sense of the â€œcivic responsibility to make something goodâ€ � , who was concerned about making â€œa contribution to humanity and to cultureâ€ � , adding : â€œI just think itâ€ ™ s important to remember that you could have somebody that didnâ€ ™ t ever argue , but you wouldnâ€ ™ t have the phone you have now.â€ �"
2015-10-09,"Former Apple CEO John Sculley has revealed that he thinks Steve Jobs would have been mostly impressed with Danny Boyleâ€ ™ s Oscar - tipped new biopic .
The film , called Steve Jobs , stars Michael Fassbender as the Apple guru and Jeff Daniels as Sculley .
Sculley met with the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin to discuss details of his relationship with Jobs and the inside track on Appleâ€ ™ s history .
â€œ[Sorkinâ€ ™ s ]
a brilliant screenwriter , â€ � Sculley said .
â€œWhile [ the dialogue ] may not have been the exact words that were spoken , it represented the kind of dialogue that said â€˜yes , thatâ€ ™ s that personâ€ ™ .â€ � Sculley was also impressed with his portrayal by Jeff Daniels .
â€œI
couldnâ€ ™ t believe how ... he actually captured how I was feeling going through some of the most intense scenes , â€ � he said .
But while he thinks Jobs would have been a big fan of the finished product , it wouldnâ€ ™ t be a universal rave .
â€œI think Steve would see a lot of things about this film that he would like : first of all , itâ€ ™ s a perfectionist product , â€ � he said .
â€œEverything about it : the acting , the directing , the screenplay .
But , I also think [ he ] would be a little bit hurt because many people who never knew the young Steve Jobs could go away from this movie and think , â€˜well
I know Steve Jobs.â€ ™
Well guess what ?
You donâ€ ™ t .
Because that is not the complete Steve Jobs.â€
�
The film has angered Appleâ€ ™ s current CEO Tim Cook , who has branded the film â€œopportunisticâ€ � , and reports suggest that Jobsâ€ ™ s widow tried to â€œkillâ€ � the movie and begged Leonardo DiCaprio and Christian Bale not to take on the role .
Steve Jobs is being tipped for Oscar success after a set of rave reviews from the festival circuit , with Michael Fassbender and co - stars Kate Winslet and Seth Rogen all praised for their performances ."
2015-10-19,"Aaron Sorkin has claimed his â€œconscience is clearâ€ � over the portrayal of Steve Jobs put forward in the new Oscar - tipped drama about the key moments in the Apple iconâ€ ™ s life .
Speaking at last nightâ€ ™ s European premiere at the London film festival , the screenwriter admitted that a certain manipulation had to occur in order to make the film .
â€œSteve Jobs did not , as far as I know , have confrontations with the same six people 40 minutes before every product launch , â€ �
he said , during a press conference .
â€œThat is plainly a writerâ€ ™ s conceit .
But I do think that the movie gets at some larger truths , some more important truths than what really went on during the 40 minutes before product launches , which I donâ€
™ t think was the stuff of drama .
What you see is a dramatisation of several personal conflicts that he had in his life , and they illustrate something , they give you a picture of something .
Are they fair ?
I do believe theyâ€ ™ re fair .
My conscience is clear.â€ �
The film has been the subject of criticism by some for its portrayal of the Apple co - founder with his ex - wife reportedly seeking to â€œkillâ€ � the project and begging Christian Bale and Leonardo DiCaprio not to take on the role .
Michael Fassbender , tipped for a best actor Oscar , ended up starring .
â€œWhile Mrs Jobs , Laurene Powell , did from the get - go object to the movie being made , [ his daughter ]
Lisa Jobs did not , and sheâ€ ™ s the one portrayed in the movie , â€ �
Sorkin responded .
There has also been support for the film from those who knew Jobs , including former Apple CEO John Sculley , played by Jeff Daniels .
â€œ[Sorkinâ€ ™ s ] a brilliant screenwriter , â€ � Sculley said .
â€œWhile [ the dialogue ] may not have been the exact words that were spoken , it represented the kind of dialogue that said â€˜yes , thatâ€ ™ s that personâ€ ™
.â€ �
The film has already been predicted to be a success at next yearâ€ ™ s
Oscars , with director Danny Boyle , Sorkin , Fassbender and co - star Kate Winslet all in the running for awards ."
2015-10-26,"Universal has had a record - shattering run at the box office this year thanks to the titanic successes of Jurassic World ,
Furious 7 and Minions â€ “ but this weekend somewhat tarnished
the studioâ€ ™ s glow .
The companyâ€ ™ s teen - skewed Jem and the Holograms debuted dismally to one of the worst opening weekends in box office history .
Given the filmâ€ ™ s poor tracking numbers ( potential box office earnings predicted by analysts ) , its performance didnâ€ ™ t shock many .
What did surprise was how Universalâ€ ™ s major awards hope for this year , Steve Jobs , tanked when released across America .
After starting strongly with the yearâ€ ™ s best per - screen average in its opening weekend , the Danny Boyle - directed Aaron Sorkin - scripted drama failed to make an impact nationally , taking a poor $ 7.3 m over the weekend .
To make matters even more embarrassing , the film didnâ€ ™ t do that much better than Jobs , the 2013 critically derided film about the former Apple co - founder with Ashton Kutcher in the lead role , which made a comparable $ 6.7 m in its first weekend .
Tracking figures suggested that Steve Jobsâ€ ™ s opening weekend takings would be as high as $ 19 m , so its failure to net an audience over the weekend must have come as a shock for Universal .
Variety reports that the film isnâ€ ™ t likely to make a profit for the studio : it cost $ 30 m to make and at least as much to market .
So far , domestically , Boyleâ€ ™ s film has only cracked $ 10 m ; it needs to make around $ 120 m to break even .
Studio executives told Variety that theyâ€ ™ re adamant the film can rebound , arguing that it performed well in major markets like New York and San Francisco ( near where Apple is based ) , and positive word of mouth will quickly spread .
Since it first premiered at the Telluride film festival to largely favourable reviews , Steve Jobs has drawn comparisons to The Social Network , another Sorkin - scripted film about the tech industry and one of its most controversial figures .
The film was a big hit , earning $ 22.4 m in its opening weekend in 2010 , leading many to believe Steve Jobs could pull off a similar feat .
In hindsight , that proved unduly optimistic .
The Social Network was timely : it came out just as Facebook was exploding .
The Social Networkâ€ ™ s protagonist , Mark Zuckerberg , was also deemed as an enigma to most at the time of the filmâ€ ™ s release .
David Fincherâ€ ™ s film promised to uncover the man behind the phenomenon .
Boyleâ€ ™ s film on the other hand centers on a figure with whom the world is wholly familiar .
Jobs has already been the subject of a best - selling biography by Walter Isaacson , the Kutcher film , a critically acclaimed documentary from Oscar winner Alex Gibney that opened earlier this year , and countless articles following his death .
Many entertainment trades have blamed the casting of Michael Fassbender in the titular role as the main culprit in the filmâ€ ™ s failure to cross over .
Variety went so far as to say â€œhis casting may have been disastrous from a commercial standpointâ€ � .
Indeed , the German - Irish actor has never established himself as a bankable actor in the league of Leonardo DiCaprio or Christian Bale , who both passed on the project when it was initially with Sony , before Universal swooped in to save the film .
But lack of pulling power wasnâ€ ™ t the only factor behind Steve Jobsâ€ ™ s underperformance .
In the end , the film might have just been too experimental for mainstream audiences to embrace .
Unlike the standard biopic approach he took on The Social Network , Sorkinâ€ ™ s script for Steve Jobs
focuses on three key product launches .
The end result plays like an engrossing three - act play , with barely a moment of silence during its two - hour running time .
Itâ€ ™ s a film that demands a lot on the part of its audience â€ “ and chances are , the prospect of that challenge scared many away .
The filmâ€ ™ s performance calls to mind that of Paul Thomas Andersonâ€ ™ s last film , The Master â€ “ another thought - provoking and unconventional drama that opened amid deafening awards buzz .
In 2012 , the Scientology drama broke the record for the best limited debut of all time after opening in five theaters to astronomical theater averages .
Analysts were sure at the time that its success boded well for its national release .
But as soon as it went wide , The Master flopped with mainstream audiences .
In the end , the film failed to even crack $ 20 m , only netting just over $ 16 m over its entire domestic run , which proved disastrous for Annapurna Pictures and the Weinstein Company , both of whom contributed to its $ 60 m production and marketing costs .
A similar fate looks to have befallen Steve Jobs , another film that proves quality doesnâ€ ™ t always translate into box office figures .
Its awards prospects , however , still look bright ."
2015-10-26,"Ridley Scottâ€ ™ s crowd - pleasing survival drama The Martian went back to the top of the US box office over the weekend while Danny Boyleâ€ ™ s acclaimed Steve Jobs biopic expanded nationwide to disappointing numbers .
Matt Damonâ€ ™ s turn as a wisecracking astronaut who finds himself stranded on Mars
helped The Martian reclaim the top spot in its fourth week of release with a solid $ 15.9 m ( Â£10.3 m ) , which now gives it a total of $ 166.4 m .
The weekend added another $ 30 m globally to the filmâ€ ™ s international tally of $ 384.4 m .
The Martianâ€ ™ s continued success came at a price for the weekâ€ ™ s new releases .
While it had been achieving strong numbers in limited release , a nationwide expansion of Danny Boyleâ€ ™ s Oscar - tipped drama Steve Jobs flopped , with only $ 7.2 m from more than 2,400 cinemas .
This number is heavily swayed towards independent venues in bigger cities and is especially underwhelming when compared with
The Social Networkâ€ ™ s initial bow of $ 22.4 m .
The film , which dramatises key moments in Apple co - founderâ€ ™ s career , stars Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet .
Halloween - tinged genre titles
The Last Witch Hunter and Paranormal Activity :
The Ghost Dimension also failed to inspire audiences .
Vin Dieselâ€ ™ s fantasy horror
The Last Witch Hunter , which also stars Michael Caine and Elijah Wood , made only $ 10.8 m â€ “ worrying news for Lionsgate , given a reported budget of around $ 75 m .
Paranormal Activity films used to be a reliable draw around Halloween ( the third in the series opened with $ 52 m ) , but their popularity has dwindled , so closing the saga was a smart decision .
Paramount used the release to trial a new strategy whereby home audiences are offered films sooner than usual .
This meant many chains refused to show the film and it ended up in only around half the number of cinemas as the last offering .
It made $ 8.2 m , a low for the franchise .
In a busy weekend , there were two casualties that didnâ€ ™ t crack the top 10 , despite being given wide releases in more than 2,000 cinemas each .
Rock the Kasbah , starring Bill Murray , Zooey Deschanel and Bruce Willis , made $ 1.5 m , while a live - action version of the 80s cartoon Jem and the Holograms pulled in $ 1.3 m .

2015-10-28,"Master Chief was first introduced to the world , not by Microsoft , but by Apple .
In 1999 , Steve Jobs paced the Macworld Conference stage proclaiming that the video - game footage he was about to show was the â€œcoolestâ€ � heâ€ ™ d seen .
The lights dimmed and Haloâ€ ™ s melancholic choral refrain sounded in the background .
Chief padded on to the screen behind Jobs , a symbol of Appleâ€ ™ s nascent gaming ambitions .
It was not to be .
Within a year , the space marine , his game and Bungie , the company behind it all , were sold to Microsoft .
Two years later , Halo launched alongside Microsoftâ€ ™ s Xbox console , a piece of hardware that was seen as a folly from a company that had no business in video games beyond flight sims and solitaire .
The game , Microsoft hoped , would legitimise the machine .
It worked .
The company has sold more than 65 m Halo games , and almost as many Xbox consoles on which to play them .
Sixteen years later , Microsoft hopes Master Chief can repeat that trick with Halo 5 .
The Xbox One has lost considerable ground to Sonyâ€ ™ s PlayStation 4 , which is seen by many as the superior , cheaper and , in its vibrant sweep of games , more relevant machine .
Master Chief routinely saves the universe .
Can he save a beleaguered video game system ?
Itâ€ ™ s not the only question Haloâ€ ™ s current developer , 343 Industries ( a company named after one of the seriesâ€ ™ characters and which , until 2012 , had only been allowed to re - master Bungieâ€ ™ s classic work ) has been forced to reckon with .
The console - based first - person shooter ( FPS ) , which Halo both defined and popularised , has become one of the most valuable creative real estate in video games .
Activisionâ€ ™ s annual Call of Duties are among the most expensively marketed entertainment products ever made , and the genre - splicing Destiny is made by Bungie , a studio whose nous and skill neither time nor success have dulled .
The competition is resolute .
The FPS scene is shifting too , with the rise of eSports .
No longer is a 10-hour storyline followed by a breezy multiplayer mode enough .
The blockbuster shooter must have what it takes to become a competitive sport ( or at least a corporate - sponsored simulacrum of one ) .
The $ 100 m Halo 5 now finds itself as the underdog .
Certainly , the game is vibrant and exquisitely rendered ; its vistas vary from humming desert lands to rolling green hills , flecked with purple flowers and wind - beaten crags .
But itâ€ ™ s clear that this is now a series playing catch - up , lifting ideas wholesale from rivals .
Before you battled alongside a loose knit band of US marines â€ “ cheery cannon fodder , really .
Now you roll with three computer - controlled space marines , dressed in similar tin - suits to yours .
They keep the airwaves thick with chatter ( although youâ€ ™ ll be hard pushed to tell the identikit characters apart ) .
More usefully , they are able to revive you if you fall in battle â€
“ providing they make it to you within five or so seconds .
The system comes from Gears of War , where itâ€ ™ s better implemented .
There you are able to crawl toward a comradeâ€ ™ s position in cover .
Here you must weakly call for them to come to you , and hope that they survive the lingering seconds its takes to revive you while under fire .
Your handling has been tweaked .
Master Chiefâ€ ™ s familiar , arcing jumps have been quickened , no doubt to add speed to the competitive portion of the game , which Microsoft hopes will become a fixture on the esports scene .
You can now ground - pound , like Super Mario , and dash forward with a volatile melee attack .
One button is given over to an evas i ve dash ( a little less stylish than Destinyâ€ ™ s equivalent slide , alas ) while , your character can clamber , cat - like , on to ledges in a flowing motion .
Fixed at 60 frames per second , graphical texture and detail has been sacrificed for speed of movement , another example of where the multiplayer portion of the game is , for the first time , leading Haloâ€ ™ s design philosophy .
Combat feels more brittle and Call of Duty - esque â€ “ a feeling heightened in the campaign by sections where control is wrested from the player to allow for a canned animation , or a short , unavoidable sequence when , for example , you are forced to fall from masonry onto a lower platform .
Call of Dutyâ€ ™ s funnelling approach to level design can also be seen here .
Thereâ€ ™ s nothing like the first Haloâ€ ™ s seminal level , The Silent Cartographer , which gave us a rounded island on which to knock about freely .
Only much later in the game do you enter wider spaces .
There are , meanwhile , only a few standout set - pieces ( an unexpected , Uncharted - esque light puzzle , midway through the game hints at an alternative direction ) .
In one , a multidirectional battle on the alien planet of Sanghelios , you fight alongside Halo 2â€ ™ s Arbiter .
In another you must board a gigantic Covenant spider - like contraption , destroy it from the inside and escape before it falls into a ravine .
These highlights call to mind some of Bungieâ€ ™ s best work , but thereâ€ ™ s little here that is truly 343â€ ™ s own .
There is also a great deal of repetition and too often the designers fall back on identikit boss battles .
This suggests that the game , despite its development cost , is still a little undercooked .
In one level you fight successive waves of enemies on a tarrying lift , while the main action , which is taking place elsewhere on the planet , is recounted to you over the radio .
Another of the 15 story missions provides some welcome , arrhythmic downtime in a Covenant outpost ( you can now , in fact , talk to the monsters ) .
A second stop off in the same location , ambitiously described as a â€œmissionâ€ � , is perhaps one too many .
The action switches between two perspectives : that of Spartan Jameson Locke and his unit , Fireteam Osiris ( with whom you spend the majority of the game ) , and Master Chief and his three companions in Blue Team .
Both groups are chasing Cortana , the anthropomorphised AI woman who has accompanied Master Chief through the series as his advisor .
Cortana , delightfully voiced by Jen Taylor , has been the motivating McGuffin in the last two Halo titles now ( previously Master Chief needed to save her from rampancy , an AIâ€ ™ s version of Alzheimerâ€ ™ s ; in Halo 5 she is , seemingly , the adversary ) .
Cortana is the go - to character for the seriesâ€ ™ scriptwriters for good reason .
She is the only character of memorable spirit .
By contrast , youâ€ ™ d be hard pushed to tell the eight members of Osiris and Blue Team apart .
Aside from the tint in their armour they are indistinguishable in motivation and personality .
They are , instead , ciphers , for the squad - based game design .
The much - touted conflict between the two protagonists is , in fact , a limp quarrel .
Compared to , say Halo ODSTâ€ ™ s clever , affecting tale , there is no fire in Halo 5â€ ™ s narrative heart .
If the campaign feels like a competent if slightly dated expression of the blockbuster first - person shooter , the gameâ€ ™ s multiplayer modes work much harder to disrupt the status quo .
Arena Mode is the closest to the classic Halo multiplayer , with familiar modes such as Slayer , Team Slayer , Capture the Flag , and Swat played across a variety of maps ( including futuristic , Tron - like locations ) .
You take two weapons into battle and new , more powerful guns spawn in the environment , dynamically creating scuffle hotspots .
Warzone , by contrast , is a marked departure , influenced in part by MOBA mechanics , threading together player v environment and player v player elements .
You can choose to attack enemy players or computer - controlled bosses .
Both approaches contribute points to your teamâ€ ™ s total ; there is no single way to win a match .
ATM - like pods can be found in these matches , where you can cash in so - called Requisition cards to , say , request a certain weapon or vehicle .
These cards are won in packs from reaching various milestones in the game ( or can be purchased with real money ) .
Each card has an attached in - match cost ; you can not simply request the most powerful gun at the start of a match â€ “ rather , you must wait until later in the game when you can afford this cost , a smart natural balancing mechanic .
Warzone is a revelation in a competitive shooting game scene that has become rote and ordinary .
With so much at stake , Halo 5 needed to be a new perfection of old triumphs , or a landscape - altering revolution .
In terms of its campaign it falls short of both of these ideals .
Online , however , 343 has taken more significant risks , of the sort that first convinced Apple and Microsoft to place bets on the series .
Warzone , in particular , is a kind of bold design that we almost never see in expensive FPS game - making any more .
The next 12 months will reveal whether or not the wager will pay off .

2015-10-29,"Just over 14 years ago , Steve Jobs unveiled a cigarette pack - sized product that didnâ€ ™ t impress many onlookers .
The iPod looked like just another music player â€ “ not a product that could transform Appleâ€ ™ s fortunes , then a computer maker struggling with generating profit .
On Tuesday Apple announced the largest - ever annual profit in corporate history â€ “ $ 53.3bn ( Â£34.7bn ) over the previous 12 months .
In the July - September period , sales of iPhones grew almost a quarter compared to the same period in 2014 , even as rivals such as Samsung and LG saw slower sales .
The transformation looks complete .
But analysts still wonder : have we hit peak Apple ?
Is it all , finally , downhill from here , ending a ramp that began with the iPod in 2001 , and turned stratospheric with the iPhone in 2007 ?
At least for now , the answer is no ; the three months to December are always Appleâ€ ™ s best , and it is forecasting revenues of about $ 76.5bn , a slight rise on the year before , and profits could even outdo last yearâ€ ™ s $ 18bn .
There are , however , signs of concern : slowing smartphone sales worldwide , a shift towards areas such as artificial intelligence where Apple lags behind rivals such as Google , and the prospect of a giant bet on a self - driving car in a few yearsâ€ ™ time .
The key challenge for a company looking for the next big thing is that â€œthe smartphone is the most important consumer product ever , â€ � according to Andy Hargreaves , a financial analyst at Pacific Crest .
Itâ€ ™ s the most widely distributed consumer gadget in history , with about 2.4bn in use , viewed as essential by everyone from Wall Street bankers to refugees trying to navigate a foreign land .
And about 400 m of them are iPhones .
â€œApple will continue to be the victim of its own success , â€ � says Geoff Blaber , vice - president of US research at industry analysts CCS Insight .
â€œThe iPhone sells for vastly more than its competitors , but itâ€ ™ s unlikely there will be another product that can match that for price and volume.â€ �
For now though the numbers around Apple are stunning .
In the past 12 months , its sales grew by $ 51bn â€ “ more than the sales of nearly 90 % of the Fortune 500 .
Some forecast that Jobsâ€ ™ s death in October 2011 would inevitably see it stumble and fall , and its profits in 2013 did drop compared to 2012 .
Now it is growing again .
Yet there are subtle signs of weakness .
Apple can be viewed as two companies : one selling iPhones , and one selling everything else â€ “ iPads , iPods , Apple Watch , iTunes downloads , apps , accessories and so on .
Daniel Tello , who follows Appleâ€ ™ s financials closely , points out that over the past 12 months the iPhone business grew by 52 %
â€ “ but everything else , rolled together , shrank by 3 % .
A large part of that contraction is iPad revenue , which has been dropping for nearly two years after three years of meteoric growth from 2010 .
Tim Cook , Jobsâ€ ™ s replacement , and his team are trying to change that picture .
Besides new iPhones , this year Apple has released the Apple Watch , and will have a larger iPad and Apple TV set - top box in shops by Christmas .
Then , 6.5 m customers are paying about $ 10 per month for its Apple Music subscription service , built out from its $ 3.2bn purchase of Beats last year .
But $ 65 m per month subscriptions , or $ 780 m annually , hardly makes a mark .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t think that the firmâ€ ™ s new products and services [ iPad Pro , new Apple TV , iPhone Upgrade Program ] will move the needle very much , â€ � said Brian Colello of Morningstar .
Nor has Apple released sales or revenue figures on the Apple Watch , its wrist - worn smartwatch for messaging , fitness and ( yes ) timekeeping .
Despite being the industryâ€ ™ s top seller , analyst estimates put total sales so far at less than 10 m â€ “ generating a few billion dollars .
Unless that starts growing fast , it wonâ€ ™ t compensate for any slowdown in iPhone sales , though Colello says : â€œWe remain optimistic that the device will take off at some point , especially as customer satisfaction metrics â€ ¦ are encouraging.â€ � Influential technology companies often keep growing for a while after their influence peaks .
Allowing for inflation , Microsoft was worth even more than Apple in 1999 - 2000 ; now its dominance of the PC industry counts for little because smartphones outnumber them .
Similarly , the mobile business of Finlandâ€ ™ s Nokia ruled before the arrival of the iPhone and Googleâ€ ™ s
Android ; now it is a lossmaking rump inside Microsoft .
BlackBerry soared , then sank .
If iPhone sales stall like the iPadâ€ ™ s , Apple will shrink rapidly .
Now with the rise of Google and Facebook , the rules of the game are changing to a software - only focus , and new technologies such as â€œmachine learningâ€ � process huge amounts of data from users .
A gap is opening that the Cupertino - based company is struggling to bridge .
Perhaps the next big thing really is big : a car .
Apple has for months been poaching employees from companies such as electric carmaker Tesla , motorbike maker Mission Motors , and battery maker 123 Systems .
The Guardian has also unearthed documents showing that it is looking to test self - driving cars as part of â€œProject Titanâ€ � .
Sir Jony I ve , the design wizard who has put his imprint on the productâ€ ™ s hardware and software , implied as much in a New Yorker interview in February :
â€œThere are some shocking cars on the road , â€ �
he said .
â€œOne
personâ€ ™ s car is another personâ€ ™ s scenery.â€
�
The car business is commoditised .
The key to making a difference now is the software controlling the system .
Couldnâ€ ™ t Apple do that ?
â€œThere would be a significant risk , â€ � saidBlaber .
â€œThe auto space isnâ€ ™ t one that Apple knows.â€ �
Blaberâ€ ™ s words ring true and echo those of Ed Colligan , then head of the smartphone maker Palm , in November 2006 .
Asked about the possibility of Apple , a PC maker , getting into the market , Colligan scoffed : â€œPC guys are not going to just figure this out .
Theyâ€ ™ re not just going to walk
in.â€ � Two months later , Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone .
Earlier this month , Teslaâ€ ™ s
Elon Musk dismissed Appleâ€
™ s plans.â€œCars are very complex compared to phones of smartwatches , â€ � he said .
â€œYou
canâ€
™ t just go to a supplier like Foxconn [ which assembles the iPhone ] and say : â€˜Build me a car.â€ ™ â€ �
Musk may have tempted history but for now , Apple will have to keep relying on the iPhone ."
2015-11-01,"Silicon Valley billionaires , with their boundless digital dreams , have lately turned their attention to the ultimate challenge : the disruption of death .
They want to live forever .
Peter Thiel , PayPalâ€ ™ s founder , Larry Page of Google and Larry Ellison of Oracle have each poured some of their millions into projects that scour evolutionary history for the secrets of longevity , that aim to improve the DNA they were born with , or that explore ways to copy and save the circuits of a human brain â€ “ notably their own consciousness â€ “ to survive digitally long after their physical shutdown .
Like moguls and megalomaniacs through the ages , they refuse to believe the timing and nature of their ending might be beyond their compass .
Immortality takes many forms , however .
Old - fashioned myth and legend remain an option .
Much of the tragedy of Steve Jobsâ€ ™ s truncated life
â€ “ he died in October 2011 at 56 , eight years after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer
â€ “ lies in the fact that for all his ungrammatical ability to â€œthink differentâ€ � , even he had no answer to the rogue cells that killed him .
Indeed , it seems the Apple co - founderâ€ ™ s stubborn hubris itself helped to dictate his last act .
When he received the initial diagnosis of his cancer , he put off recommended surgery for nine months in his obsessive search for alternative cures on the internet , including contacting a psychic , by which time it was too late .
Jobs was , throughout his life , restless for alternative truths .
Not surprisingly for an advocate of the eternal upgrade , he believed death , natureâ€ ™ s built - in obsolescence , to be â€œlifeâ€ ™ s greatest inventionâ€ � .
He was well aware that his own contribution to the fast - forward evolution of technology would necessarily be superseded by others .
However , although he never specifically embraced the idea of trying to incorporate his own consciousness into a digital circuit , he did the next best thing and made products that seemed to embody his singular philosophy .
Not for nothing after he died did some of the legions of worldwide mourners , real and virtual , with their all - night vigils at Apple stores and to - camera eulogies , reimagine logos that revealed their creatorâ€ ™ s image , or hold aloft iPads picturing candles burning bright .
Jobs was , or seemed to be , the eternal soul of their machines .
â€œSometimes I believe in God , sometimes I donâ€ ™ t , â€ �
Jobs said to his chosen biographer , Walter Isaacson .
â€œI think
itâ€ ™ s 50/50 maybe .
But ever since Iâ€ ™ ve had cancer , Iâ€ ™ ve been thinking about Him more
and I find myself believing a bit more .
Maybe itâ€ ™ s because I want to believe in an afterlife , that when you die , it doesnâ€ ™ t just all disappearâ€
¦ the wisdom
youâ€ ™ ve accumulated , somehow it lives
on.â€
�
Then , Isaacson recalled , Jobs paused for a second and said : â€œYeah , but sometimes I think itâ€ ™ s just like an on / off switch .
Click and youâ€ ™ re gone .
And thatâ€ ™ s why I donâ€ ™ t like putting on / off switches on Apple devices.â€
�
One of the uncanny traits of the intimate machines that Jobs pioneered â€ “ iPods and iPads and iPhones â€ “ is their illusion of vitality .
Like us , they sleep , and then they wake , all systems go , with all their â€ “ and our â€ “ memory intact .
Even those defunct Apple models , the moribund iMacs and chunky MacBooks that went from box - fresh to antique in a few short years and now clutter attics and landfill , could theoretically be tweaked back to life and with them the traces and dreams of users who lived with and through them .
Jobs had plenty of time to think about his own legacy and , inevitably , control freak that he was , he left as little of it as possible to chance .
Nothing he did in life seemed unconnected to his sense of his â€ “ and Appleâ€ ™ s â€ “ brand and death would be no different .
His choice of Isaacson as biographer no doubt was in part due to the fact that the writer had previously published an acclaimed life of Einstein , one of those â€œthink differentâ€ � people with whom Jobs claimed affinity .
( Isaacson had also written a biography of Henry Kissinger , perhaps a more useful apprenticeship for approaching his Machiavellian subject . )
Jobs stage - managed all he could of the life story that would be published in the event of his death
â€ “ giving Isaacson extensive interviews , making those who knew him best available â€ “ right down to choosing the gnomic cover image for the book .
Afterlives are not so easily choreographed , however , and four years on from Jobsâ€ ™ s death two films are about to appear that stray significantly from his prepared brief .
The first , Steve Jobs , a drama directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin ( whose pedigree on The West Wing , and the Zuckerberg biopic
The Social Network could hardly be more apt ) is loosely based on the first half of Isaacsonâ€ ™ s book , up to 1998 and the launch of the iMac , and has Michael Fassbender as its flawed tragic hero .
The second , Steve Jobs : Man in the Machine , a wonderful documentary by Alex Gibney ( who recently got under the skin of that other pervasive cult , Scientology , in Going Clear ) , is a film that seeks to answer a single question : why were people so affected by Steve Jobsâ€ ™ s death ?
Some of the answers to that latter question , one that goes somewhere near the heart of our love affair with digital technology , have been supplied by the initial reactions to the release of the films in the States .
Jobs inspired and demanded fierce loyalty in his friends and acolytes .
Appleâ€ ™ s head of design and Jobsâ€ ™ s close friend , Sir Jonathan
I ve , hadnâ€
™ t seen Sorkinâ€ ™ s film when he spoke to the Wall Street Journal about it , but reports from friends were enough to convince him of his â€œprimal fearâ€ � that it depicted a man â€œI donâ€ ™ t recognise at allâ€ � .
His response mirrored that of John Travolta to Alex Gibneyâ€ ™ s Scientology exposure .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t like it .
I havenâ€ ™ t seen it
and I donâ€ ™ t want
to.â€ �
One of the telling aspects of watching the Jobs films back to back is the possibility of objectively comparing Fassbenderâ€ ™ s portrayal with the reality in the footage assembled in Gibneyâ€ ™ s documentary .
Both films dwell extensively on Jobsâ€ ™ s much - mythologised early years : the emotional scars he carried as a child not only given up for adoption , but rejected in turn by his original adoptive parents , who decided they wanted a girl ; his flirtation with Californiaâ€ ™ s hippy culture that came to something of a halt when he fathered a child with girlfriend Chrisann Brennan , ( a child , Lisa , he both tried for years to disown in the courts and after whom he named one of Appleâ€ ™ s first personal computers ) ; his ability from the start to inspire and discard those close to him with equal ease ; and his ruthless , often impossible , demands for perfection .
Fassbender captures all of the dramatic nuances of the conflicted reality you see in real life in Gibneyâ€ ™ s film .
In neither movie does Jobs come across as a particularly likable young man , but in both you feel the pull of his irresistible charisma .
Responding to suggestions that Jobs appeared to be tyrannical in the films , I ve admitted that Jobs was an uncompromising boss , but said : â€œThat doesnâ€ ™ t mean youâ€ ™ re an a - hole .
You couldâ€ ™ ve had somebody who didnâ€ ™ t ever argue , but you wouldnâ€ ™ t have the phones you haveâ€
¦ There are sons and daughters and widows and very close friends that are completely bemused and completely upset [ by the films ] .
Weâ€ ™ re remembering and celebrating Steve Jobsâ€ ™ s life and at the same time there is this movie and I donâ€
™
t recognise this person.â€
�
Tim Cook not only took over as chief executive of Apple two weeks before Jobs died , he also offered his mentor half of his liver to keep him alive .
In an interview with Stephen Colbert , he described the films as â€œopportunisticâ€ � and again , though he hadnâ€ ™ t seen either , said he â€œhatedâ€ � them because he knew that they misrepresented Jobs , who â€œwas an amazing human beingâ€ ¦ someone that you wanted to do your best work forâ€
� .
Aaron Sorkin , in response to this , suggested that Cook should perhaps see his film before judging it , and noted : â€œIf youâ€ ™ ve got a factory full of children in China assembling phones for 17 cents an hour , youâ€ ™ ve got a lot of nerve calling someone else opportunisticâ€ � , a comment for which he later apologised .
It is a curious world where it is apparently considered off - limits or opportunistic to make a drama or a documentary about a figure as visible and central to our global culture as Jobs , but among more zealous technophiles , that appears to be received wisdom .
Jeff Jarvis , former professor of digital journalism at City University , New York , and creator of the blog BuzzMachine , compared Sorkinâ€ ™ s film in particular to a kind of heresy , an envious piece of work that peddled the myth that new media were not to be trusted .
Jarvisâ€ ™ s most recent book likened Jobs to Johannes Gutenberg , inventor of the printing press , and found both â€œaccomplished greatness through trial and error , vision and determinationâ€ � .
In trashing Sorkinâ€ ™ s films about Zuckerberg and Jobs as acts of spite , he wrote : â€œSorkin is Salieri to their Mozart .
They are greater artists than he will ever be .
They and their impact will be remembered for generations â€ “ and not because of Sorkinâ€ ™ s films about them , which will be soon forgotten .
They have changed the world more than Sorkin or his beloved , imaginary president or journalists could ever hope to .
Yet Sorkin is doomed to make movies about these damned , fucking geeks .
Pity.â€ �
*
*
* It is hard to read such comments or watch either film about Jobs and not think of the parallels in the genesis of Apple with the birth of a religion .
Sorkin structures his script around three product launches , first that of the original Macintosh , second the launch of the ill - fated NeXT computer made by Jobs after he had been kicked out of the company he created and was in the wilderness , and lastly his triumphant return as saviour of Apple in the launch of Iveâ€
™ s colourful iMac .
These launches , as Gibneyâ€ ™ s film also makes clear , were above all acts of evangelism .
By the time the iPad comes along , Jobs has created a singular spectacle by bringing tablets down into the valley and demonstrating their miracles to the faithful .
And of course , from the beginning , as in all cultish movements you either believed and were enlightened or you did not and were not .
As with any long - term Apple user â€ “ Iâ€ ™ ve never had any other PC or phone since I first was enthralled by a Macintosh desktop in 1991 â€ “ these emotions are both familiar and curious .
The simple magic , the intuitive quality of the technology , the sense of rebellion against soulless mainframes and impenetrable software it appeared to represent , was always hard to resist .
You can detect that fact not only in the clips that Gibney has assembled of the # iSad millions weeping for Jobsâ€ ™
s loss â€
“ â€œSteve
Jobs invented everything!â€ � says one young boy â€ “ but also in the technical homage employed by Danny Boyle , who directed Sorkinâ€ ™ s film .
Boyle shoots the first act , the first product launch , on 16 mm film , to give a homemade hacker feeling to Jobsâ€ ™ s early efforts â€ “ based in his parentsâ€ ™ garage with co - founder Steve Wozniak â€ “ to change the world .
He moves on to 35 mm for the second operatic act of wilderness and revenge , and for the final launch shoots in pin - sharp HD digital .
Much is improved in the progression , but something of the original innocent , human - scale ambition seems to have been lost : a metaphor which looks like a useful way to examine the shiny - happy corporate world domination that Apple came to embody .
With some of this in mind , I spoke to Boyle â€ “ and later to Gibney â€ “ about how they had approached the myths around their subject , and how close they felt they got to the truth .
I wondered first of Boyle if he had , despite everything , learned to love Jobs in the months of making his epic ?
â€œI certainly got obsessed with him , â€ �
he said .
â€œOne of the reasons I agreed to do the film was that I felt for him , on an emotional level .
The father and daughter stuff with Lisa , which was at the heart of the script , is something I really recognise .
I hope I wasnâ€ ™ t quite as extreme as him in his relationship with his daughter but Iâ€ ™ m not sure that I am faultless either in my relationship with my kids .
I felt for him in that respect .
But in other respects , he is not someone I would call a hero , no .
What was great about the script was that it didnâ€ ™ t pull any punches .
It wasnâ€ ™ t a glorification of him really , and heâ€ ™ s not particularly likable , but especially in Michaelâ€ ™ s performance you do get drawn to him , to his way of seeing the world .
I think that is how he was .
I mean people remain in orbit around him even four years after his death .
But no , my heroes are people like Woz [ Steve Wozniak ] .
Or people like Tim Berners - Lee , who give all this power away for free .
Cost should not be put upon this knowledge .
Jobs certainly wouldnâ€
™ t agree with thatâ€ ¦ â€
�
In some ways it seems that Boyleâ€ ™ s and Sorkinâ€ ™ s film is the gospel according to Woz , who was in many ways the genius behind Appleâ€ ™ s original revolutionary personal computing concept , and whose hacker mentality Jobs marketed so successfully .
How much , I asked Boyle , did Wozniak help with the film ?
â€œHe was certainly a key source for Sorkin , â€ � he said .
â€œHe came in and talked to the actors .
He has been very complimentary about the film .
Fortunately he really liked it .
If he didnâ€ ™ t he would have been equally clear about that.â€ �
Wozniak is played by Seth Rogen and the pair of them apparently became close .
Wozniak is something of an amateur magician and he and Rogen spent a lot of time bonding at the Magic Castle , a magiciansâ€ ™ club in LA .
Boyle suggests he was the conscience of the movie .
â€œSeth doesnâ€ ™ t look anything like him really , â€ � Boyle says ,
â€œbut there is something about him that is very decent , along with him being a comic genius .
In that his decency and genius are inseparable he is perfect for the role .
As Woz gets to say to Jobs at one point , â€˜Being decent and gifted is not a binary oppositionâ€ ¦ â€ ™
â€ �
Given that the film is a drama , and born out of much disputed territory , in particular Jobsâ€ ™ s perversely cruel treatment of Brennan and his daughter , I wonder how much responsibility Boyle felt to the truth ?
â€œThere are a lot of omissions .
But it felt very truthful , I believed .
It is very difficult to justify it , speaking drily about it .
How can you say it is or is not ?
Everything that is in there is true , we think , but of course it is not the whole story .
We used to say it was a bit like Shakespeare â€
“
you took some key facts and then you explored your own obsessions about him through that.â€ �
In that sense , it seems that Fassbender , who is currently also starring on screen as Macbeth , found a properly Shakespearean tragic hero in Silicon Valley .
A genius undone by his megalomania â€ “ had Boyle come across other men like that in his time ?
â€œYes , â€ � he says , â€œI have come across people like him .
Scott Rudin , the producer , sent this to us .
On set , we used to say that the film was the sound of his mind .
By this of course we meant Jobs
but we also meant Sorkin
and I also meant Rudin ; it becomes the sound of Michael Fassbenderâ€
™ s mind as well , and maybe mine , too .
But yes , I have worked with a couple of people like Jobs .
They just will not compromise , and if they do , beware , because there is something bad hidden behind the compromise that you canâ€ ™ t quite perceive yet .
We always used to say the second part , Jobs in exile as it were , was a subterranean river of intention that no one except him could perceive .
â€ �
I asked Boyle if he had been an Apple user over the years
and of course he said he had :
â€œCreative people have been the gateway for Apple , the Trojan horse , â€ � he said .
â€œJobs had this notion that he worked at the intersection of fine art and technology and we , those of us in the arts , media world , amplified that for him.â€ �
We have all been complicit , I suggest , in the rise of Apple to be worldâ€ ™ s most valuable company , in the journey that Jobs engineered from rebellion to ubiquity and all that it entails .
Did Boyle want the film to comment on that complicity ?
â€œI think so .
Ultimately it is about his character , and a father and a daughter .
But you do want it to try and be part of the big story of our relationship with these giant corporations .
All the companies that were easy to criticise , banks , oil companies , pharmaceutical companies , they have been replaced by tech guys .
And yet the atmosphere around them remains fairly benign .
Governments are not powerful enough any more to resist them and the law is not quick enough .
One of the reasons I wanted to do this is that sense that we have to constantly bring these people to account .
I mean , they have emasculated journalism for one thing .
They have robbed it of its income .
If you want to look at that malignly you certainly could do : they have made it so nobody can afford to write stories about them .
Their tentacles are so far reaching in the way the world is structured that there is a danger they become author and critic at the same time .
Exactly what Jobs used to accuse IBM of.â€ �
And obviously , I suggest , those tentacles go very deep into the film world .
Steve Jobs was originally to be made by Sony Pictures and be directed by David Fincher , who worked with Sorkin on The Social Network .
It was to star either Christian Bale or Leonardo DiCaprio .
In the event , however , of Fincher opting out and financiers , including Megan Ellison , daughter of Larry Ellison , chief executive of computer firm Oracle and Jobsâ€ ™ s old friend , refusing support , Scott Rudin was forced to take the film to Universal .
All of this heated internal drama became public when Sonyâ€ ™ s emails were hacked by North Korean spies ( in protest over Rogenâ€ ™ s film The Interview ) .
Boyle was caught in the fallout of all that .
â€œIt was a tough film to make for many reasons , â€ � Boyle says with a laugh .
â€œAfter Sony pulled out we had a day where we went around Hollywood , literally with hour - long slots to pitch the film to try and find a home for it .
And we were trying to sell it to people who had known Jobs or had been in business with him and were coloured by that .
We eventually got a couple of offers , which was great , and we were delighted to go with Universal .
They have been exemplary in the support that they have given us in difficult circumstances , which I canâ€ ™ t talk too much about right now though I hope to one day .
Letâ€ ™ s just say they have been very supportive.â€
�
The tentacles that Boyle described , which tried to squeeze the life out of the film , were also felt by Gibney , who made his documentary with the support of CNN .
Even for someone who has dealt with the Scientology movement and lived to tell the tale , Gibney admits his experience was â€œextremely hardâ€ � .
His first phone call was to Laurene Powell Jobs , Steveâ€ ™ s widow , and initially he was confident that she would engage with the film .
â€œBut then , â€ � he says , â€œa phone appointment was cancelled and I never heard from her again .
I learned along the way as I began to approach former executives at Apple that she was forbidding everyone to speak to me .
She cast a long shadow .
It was tough .
I was aided in a sense , in that I wasnâ€ ™ t trying to be definitive , I could go on a kind of road trip and try to make sense of it along the way .
I stole that idea from Citizen Kane :
you structure the thing according to who
you find.â€ �
Most of the interviewees Gibney finds are therefore people who were either betrayed by Jobs or escaped from Apple .
He punctuates his film with the impressions of Chrisann Brennan , mother of Lisa , and with the memories of Daniel Kottke , Jobsâ€ ™ s closest friend as a young man , with whom he travelled in India and who was Appleâ€ ™ s first employee ( and to whom he infamously granted zero stock options ) .
Both seemed still bemused by Jobsâ€ ™ s cruelties .
Most telling perhaps , though , is Bob Belleville , who was seduced by Jobs to lead the project team on the first Macintosh and who was subsequently ostracised .
Thirty years on , the gentle - seeming engineer is still traumatised by the events , not only the betrayal , but in the love he still clearly feels for Jobs .
Talking about those years , he begins to sob uncontrollably .
â€œBob Belleville is the heart and soul of the film really ,
â€ � Gibney says .
â€œIt was hard to understand .
I asked him why he was crying and he couldnâ€ ™ t really tell me .
He was so deeply conflicted about Steve , which is what I found to be so interesting , and by the way it was not something I suspected .
I expected to get from him some factual detail about the early Macs .
I knew that Bob had gone to Japan with Steve and Japan was interesting to me , but I had no idea he had this deep well of emotion.â€
�
* * Gibney frames the answer to the question of why consumers were so affected by Jobsâ€ ™ s death in the same contradictory terms .
He dwells in particular on the importance of Jobsâ€ ™ s understanding of Zen Buddhism in the development of Apple .
His journey to billionaire , he had convinced himself , was a spiritual one .
( In the memorial service his family designed to Jobsâ€ ™ s wishes at Stanford University , at which Al Gore spoke and Bono and YoYo Ma played , each of the congregation was given a present in a small brown box that turned out to be the Autobiography of a Yogi , by Paramahansa Yogananda ) .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think Walter Isaacson was very interested in the Zen Buddhist thing ,
â€ � Gibney says .
â€œI think he thought that Steve got some design ideas from it , end of story .
But it was interesting to me .
The fact is he did have this long - term spiritual adviser , Kobun Chino .
That makes him pretty different from Lloyd Blankfein [ boss of Goldman Sachs].â€ �
There is a memorable moment in the film where Gibney has unearthed footage of the Zen monk recalling how Jobs first came to him aged 18 and confessed to him that he felt chosen , enlightened .
Koben Chino asked Jobs for proof of this revelation and he came back with the first Apple circuit board .
In his self - mythology , his veganism , his apparent asceticism channelling Gandhi in his round specs , his devotion to minimal design , to the godhead in a silicon chip , it often seemed that Jobs never lost his aspiration to be a monk .
It was not a humble life , however .
As Gibneyâ€ ™ s film makes clear â€ “ in tracing the tax - avoidance schemes , in dwelling on the terrible working conditions of those low - paid workers in China putting iPhones together , in allowing illegal backdated share options â€ “ Jobs and Apple were always as much about money as spirituality .
â€œThere are a lot of people who said Steve didnâ€ ™ t care about money , â€ � Gibney says ,
â€œand I think in some ways they are probably right in
that he didnâ€ ™ t care about buying himself a lot of fancy things , but he certainly cared about how money allowed you to keep score with other people and it was very much tied up with how he felt appreciated or not appreciated .
It was a way of validating himself emotionally and God knows he got a lot of it .
â€œHe could have given some of it away , but the fact is he hardly gave a dime of it away .
There was a famous story I wasnâ€ ™ t able to get into the film .
When he returned to the company he said , â€˜I want the company to buy me a jet.â€ ™ I donâ€
™ t know how much it was , maybe $ 45 m .
Somebody said , â€˜Look
Steve , if we buy you the jet we will also have to pay the taxes due on it , so
itâ€ ™ s going to cost us almost double .
How about the company buys the jet and you have it for your exclusive use?â€ ™
He said , â€˜No , buy me the jet.â€ ™ â€ �
Along the way in the film Gibney confesses to have been as much in thrall to Apple products as anyone .
Has making the film cured him of that devotion ?
â€œIt has , I think ,
â€ � he says .
â€œI look on my phone just as a tool now .
Steve was extraordinarily clever in suggesting somehow by using an Apple product you were taking on the man .
It was like the elves of Rivendell giving you some ancient elven blade that was good and allowing you to vanquish the orcs .
It was like it was a device born of the counterculture .
That remains a problem in how we understand these companies .
Jobsâ€ ™ s genius was in erasing that boundary between the human being and the tool : if you criticise Apple you are criticising everyone that uses them .
â€˜Hold on
, you are criticising me , I have
my familyâ€ ™ s
photos on this thing!â€ ™ Part of why I made the film was not to do a simple exposÃ © , or say this is good and this is bad so go and boycott this product
, it was to point out these contradiction and to ask these questions.â€ �
And that overarching question , why did so many people care so much when Steve Jobs died , that instant beatification of a billionaire ?
Did Gibney answer that to his satisfaction as well ?
â€œI think it ends up still a question , â€ � he says .
â€œI answered parts of it in my own mind
but if I had the definitive answer I would have put it in at the end instead of superimposing Jobsâ€ ™ s face over my own .
But I think that part of it is : he was Daddy , and I say that knowing all of the issues Steve Jobs had with paternity .
He was there for this journey we have taken with the computer .
He was such a convincing storyteller in persuading us that his machines were really part of us that when he died there was something about us dying at the same time .
He was Daddy.â€ �"
2015-11-09,"Almost as soon as the 33 men trapped in the San JosÃ © mine in Chile were rescued , the disputes and recriminations over potential film adaptations of their extraordinary ordeal began to surface too ; for low - paid men in a normally ignored industry in a marginalised part of the world , unwittingly caught up in a genuinely astonishing feat of derring - do that commandeered the worldâ€ ™ s media for weeks , an unthought - of opportunity had opened up .
The disagreements are still rumbling along in the background , even as the film is unveiled : a modestly budgeted Hollywood production , starring Antonio Banderas and Juliette Binoche , with the Mexican - born director of Girl in Progress , Patricia Riggen , behind the camera .
While the release of The 33 may not have been preceded by a widely seen documentary on the same subject
â€ “ something that befell The Walk and Steve Jobs , and appears to have marred their commercial chances â€ “ the news footage of the ordeal is so familiar that a feature would have to offer up something pretty special to compensate .
Unfortunately , The 33 doesnâ€ ™ t .
Itâ€ ™ s a solid , well - constructed film that gets across the basic story of the mine collapse and the subsequent race to drill down and reach the trapped crew , graced with one or two special - effects sequences to add a bit of punch .
But , hamstrung by the inevitable decision to film in English , thereâ€ ™ s a fundamental disconnect between performer and dialogue : scenes that should be emotional , gritty , or tender , come off as weird , comic , or plain cheesy .
Added to which , thereâ€ ™ s a definite movie - of - the - week sensibility about The 33 , with its heavily signposted plot points and rammed - home character arcs .
Banderas , who has cut quite a dash in non - Spanish roles in the past , can do little with the heavy - footed moves his character â€ “ Mario SepÃºlveda , the so - called â€œSuper Marioâ€ � of the group , who made the daily videotapes that fuelled the media effort â€ “ is required to make .
Some of his lines â€ “ â€œThatâ€ ™ s the heart of the mountain ; and she finally broke!â€ �
â€ “ are properly toe - curling .
Binoche , who came in as a late replacement for Jennifer Lopez , has a less ingratiating role to work with , as the sister of one of the miners who harasses government officials into getting their act together , but again is given some cumbersome situations to negotiate .
Still , the basic story survives intact : a barely credible chronicle of catastrophe , incompetence , heroism , and a full geyserâ€ ™ s - worth of that commodity so prized by film producers : the human spirit .
As an act of topping off the minersâ€ ™ story , the film leaves something to be desired : extracting tears from the same people who sobbed at the real - life drama is a trickier proposition than it perhaps first looked .
In any case , The 33 is unlikely to be the final act .
One day someone might make a film about all the behind - the - scenes action ; though not likely to be attempting to tug at the heartstrings as resolutely as The 33 , it certainly should be more worth watching ."
2015-11-11,"Steve Wozniak is upset .
After being slighted and patronised one too many times , Steve Jobsâ€ ™ s right - hand man , the man with whom he founded Apple , is about to break .
In a theatre scattered with acolytes , all feverishly preparing for one of Jobsâ€ ™ s famed product launches , Wozniak snaps .
Itâ€ ™ s the end of a horribly public spat and he goes for Jobsâ€ ™ s jugular .
â€œYour products are better than you are , brother , â€ � he says .
But Jobs is not offended .
He fixes him in the eye .
â€œThatâ€
™ s the idea , brother , â€ � he replies .
And that , believes Aaron Sorkin , who wrote the scene , is the difference between Jobs and everyone else .
The subject of Danny Boyleâ€ ™ s much - anticipated film biopic Steve Jobs was , its screenwriter says , obsessed with perfection , and comfortable with the cost of collateral damage .
Sorkin hardly cuts corners , either ; his work , beginning with A Few Good Men in 1992 , is always rich with detail .
Whether heâ€ ™ s tackling politics ( The West Wing ) , tech prodigies ( The Social Network ) or media ( The Newsroom ) , he meshes micro with macro , contrasting dense information with recurrent human themes : power , morality , control .
Sorkin is a fieldworker .
The Social Network was adapted from Ben Mezrichâ€ ™ s book The Accidental Billionaires , but thatâ€ ™ s hardly the real story .
Sorkin signed on when the book was just a 14-page proposal ; he researched it himself , meeting many of the main players and studying the lawsuits .
Similarly , while his Steve Jobs film is officially based on Walter Isaacsonâ€ ™ s biography , Sorkin used it as a mere starting point , and it took him a year to interview Jobsâ€ ™ s colleagues , competitors and family .
â€œI spent many months pacing and banging my head against the wall
, â€ � he says on the phone from Los Angeles , describing his efforts to work out what story he wanted to tell .
But meeting those who knew Jobs was the key .
What he learned struck a chord , particularly the stories of Jobsâ€ ™ s unwavering commitment to perfection .
One story Sorkin relates , from an Apple worker he met , involves Jobs wanting a photo of a birthday cake for a two - second slide at a product launch ; she presented him with photos of 38 different cakes until he was happy .
â€œIf you got in the way of his creation of something you could love
, â€ � says Sorkin , â€œif you didnâ€
™ t understand the point of spending more money on rectangles with rounded corners , or spending more money on having a whole bunch of fonts available to you , heâ€ ™ d cut you to ribbons in order to get at that thing he knew was right .
It was also why he wanted control of the products ; he didnâ€ ™ t
want you turning them into something , for lack of a better word , ugly .
I can identify with that feeling .
â€œYears ago , when we started learning that movies were gon na become kind of interactive , that you could take A Few Good Men , put it on your computer and change a scene around , put yourself in a scene with Jack Nicholson , smoke would come out of my ears .
Donâ€ ™ t do that !
I want the user to have the experience that I built.â€ �
Sorkin is famously protective of his dialogue .
Once his scripts are done , they are not to be messed with .
Every comma must be adhered to ; the rhythms of the speech , he says , are as important as the content .
There will be no improvisation .
So , here , he gets Jobs .
But itâ€ ™ s not just the control he relates to .
Much of the film is about Jobsâ€ ™ s initially rocky relationship with his eldest daughter Lisa .
For years , Jobs denied paternity , which was a stumbling block for Sorkin when he began writing it .
â€œBut as a writer you canâ€ ™ t judge that character , â€ � he says now .
â€œYou have to be able to identify with that character , to write that character like theyâ€ ™ re making their case to God why they should be allowed into heaven .
And to do that you have to find the things about that character that are like yourself.â€ � Which brings us back to Sorkinâ€ ™ s Jobs saying , â€œThatâ€ ™ s the idea , brotherâ€ �
â€ “ the desire to have your work , rather than your human foibles , represent you .
â€œI used to believe
, â€ � says Sorkin , â€œbefore
I became a father , that I would be most happy living a life in a room all by myself , slipping script pages out under the door and having somebody just slip me a tray of food back .
That people would like me more if they only knew me through the things I wrote .
If they didnâ€ ™ t know the human , flawed part of me .
Because the characters I write are smarter than I am , quicker than I am , more polished than I am , funnier than I am .
Thatâ€ ™ s what comes when you have time to think of the clever response .
And so I understand the idea of Steve saying : â€˜Thatâ€ ™ s the idea.â€ ™ â€ � Jobsâ€
™ s commitment to his products was , as Sorkinâ€ ™ s screenplay sees it , compensation for his own interpersonal flaws .
The filmâ€ ™ s first act , set at the 1984 launch of the Macintosh , focuses on Jobsâ€ ™ s maniacal insistence that the computer say â€œHelloâ€ � to the audience .
Whereas Sorkinâ€ ™ s Mark Zuckerberg lacked social graces but created a global social network , his Steve Jobs strives to put more humanity into his products than he displays to those around him .
â€œI signed on to do this movie a few weeks after Steve Jobs died , â€ � explains Sorkin .
â€œAnd one of the first things I was curious about was the global outpouring of mourning and eulogising .
I hadnâ€
™ t seen anything like it since John Lennon was killed .
And what that was about was an emotional attachment to the things Jobs made .
He understood that emotional attachment , he stood at the intersection of technology and art .
He had a vision of a device that would be more than useful , it would be something we would love , that we would love looking at , love holding , love owning .
So that emotional attachment is not only important to me in terms of , â€˜Oh , OK , thatâ€ ™ s Steve Jobsâ€ ™ s geniusâ€ ™ , but because this movie hypothesises that the emotional attachment people have to his devices was filling a hole he felt he had .
That he was able to feel love , human connection , by having people love these products.â€ �
Which they do .
Jobs changed the way most of us use technology ; you only have to look at what people are doing in train carriages to see the effect he had .
Sorkin says heâ€ ™ s not an Apple fanboy , yet he owns a Mac , iPhone , iPad and iPod and uses them constantly .
Jobs made us care about these things to the point of inseparability .
In 1984 , he wanted a computer to say â€œHelloâ€ � , and now the relationship is two - way ; having a natter with Siri is commonplace .
Yet Sorkin finds it all a little troubling .
His 14-year - old daughter , he says , lives her life with a screen in front of her face .
â€œAnd as a parent you have to actively get them to put down the screen .
My daughter and all her friends have Instagram accounts .
And they post only pictures of them at the party with the popular kids , doing something cool at the beach , eating a cool dinner , they post only the cleverest quips ; theyâ€ ™ re curating their lives .
So their social media presence becomes more important than their actual presence , which all but ceases to exist .
And that can only be a bad thing.â€
�
So thereâ€ ™ s
Aaron Sorkin , obsessed with perfection in his script about a man obsessed with perfection ,
all the while worried that his daughterâ€ ™ s obsession with his subjectâ€ ™ s products is causing her to cease to exist .
And the loop eats itself .
Steve Jobs is in cinemas on Friday 13 November"
2015-11-12,"For The Social Network , the movie about Facebookâ€ ™ s Mark Zuckerberg , screenwriter Aaron Sorkin created a fast - talking , arrogant , emotionally illiterate genius - innovator obsessed with boardroom betrayal .
For Steve Jobs , on the other hand , heâ€ ™ s created a fast - talking , arrogant , emotionally illiterate genius - innovator obsessed with boardroom betrayal .
The tropes are familiar , but this is still another very exhilarating and exasperating two - hour guitar solo of a movie from Sorkin , an alpha male display of cerebral confrontation and conceit featuring a male diva to whom respect must be paid and with whom arguments are humiliatingly lost .
Sorkinâ€ ™ s writing is a bipolar rush .
For each of his films there must surely be another , unreleased one with all the same characters , who stay in bed all day and stare at the wall .
This film about the great Apple designer Jobs , played by Michael Fassbender , is an intimate and theatrically ingenious piece , adapted from the authorised biography by Walter Isaacson .
It focuses on three private crises : Jobsâ€ ™
s
backstage meltdowns before the product launches of his Apple Mac in 1984 , his ill - fated NeXT computer in 1988 , and the iMac in 1998 , by which time he has fully developed his sartorial style of rimless glasses and black polo - neck tucked Seinfeldishly into laundered Leviâ€ ™ s .
The extraordinary moment at the beginning showing an eccentric approach to foot - washing is neither remarked on nor repeated .
Each event looks like the prelude to a TED talk in hell .
Daniel Pembertonâ€ ™ s musical score jitters each scene to a nerve - jangling climax , and there is an amusing touch of the Downfall spoof about each of Jobsâ€ ™ s trio of tempests .
Maybe one day Sorkin will write about Hitlerâ€ ™ s private behaviour before the invasion of Poland in 1939 , France in 1940 and the Soviet Union in 1941 .
Or perhaps three broodingly intellectual scenes for Col Kurtz before three different cow - slaughtering jungle ceremonies in 1966 , 1967 and 1968 .
There are the classic Sorkinian prose arias , walk - and - talk riffs and high - impact dialogue of the sort really only David Mamet can match .
And of course impossibly smart comebacks .
â€œGod sent his only son on a suicide mission , â€ � says Jobs , â€œbut we like him anyway because he made trees.â€ �
This indoor firework display is smoothly realised by director Danny Boyle who balances and coordinates Michael Fassbenderâ€ ™ s star workload and screentime with that of his supporting cast : long - suffering marketing executive and confidante Joanna Hoffman ( Kate Winslet ) , tricked out in nerdy hair and glasses , designer Andy Hertzfeld ( Michael Stuhlbarg ) , CEO and quasi - dad John Sculley ( Jeff Daniels ) and former Apple compadre ; and quasi - brother Steve Wozniak ( Seth Rogen ) , who feels horribly abandoned and let down .
It is perhaps a drawback of this film , or of Jobsâ€ ™ s own monomaniacally driven existence , that the characters who have the least presence are those who have only a non - professional or purely human connection with Jobs : the troubled mother of his child , Chrisann ( Katherine Waterston ) and his neglected daughter Lisa , finally played in adult life by Perla Haney - Jardine .
Fassbender gives an entirely fluent and commanding performance , although oddly it was poor old Ashton Kutcher in the unloved 2013 biopic Jobs who resembled the great man more , with a more saturnine and quizzical face .
Fassbenderâ€ ™ s performance is harder , fiercer and blanker , understandably as a result of showing him at three of the most unrelaxed times of his life .
This Steve Jobs is a bully and a blowhard who runs on the rocket fuel of pure male self - pity .
He is obsessed with betrayal , that is , other peopleâ€ ™ s betrayal of him â€ “ like the colleague who talked about his private life to Time magazine , and Sculley , who he feels ousted him from Apple in the 1980s .
But he has a tough time understanding that he has betrayed his daughter by not acknowledging her , and has betrayed his old buddy Steve Wozniak by refusing to acknowledge the work done by Wozniakâ€ ™ s team on the earlier product , the now uncool and obsolete Apple II .
With icy ruthlessness , he is concerned only with the future , and maybe the film is even hinting at the import of Wozniakâ€ ™ s
nickname â€œWozâ€
�
â€ “ a hint of â€œwasâ€ � .
Jobs is concerned only with what will be .
The final scenes are , arguably , contrived and emollient .
Yet we are still left with a drama that is genuinely concerned with thinking and ideas relevant to the way we live now .
If Boyle and Sorkin want to go on to make a movie about a glamorous innovative genius who was not a man , I suggest Hedy Lamarr , the Hollywood star who patented communication technology that made mobile phones possible ."
2015-11-12,"An advertising exec gave a revealing account of the first time his firm pitched Appleâ€ ™ s Think Different campaign to Steve Jobs , in 1997 .
They waited apprehensively as Jobs viewed the now - famous ad , where the voiceover intones , â€œHereâ€ ™ s to the crazy ones .
The misfits .
The rebels .
The troublemakers â€ ¦ â€ � over a montage of portraits of great innovators : Albert Einstein , Bob Dylan , Martin Luther King , Mahatma Gandhi , er , Richard Branson .
When it finished , Jobs said he loved it
but they couldnâ€ ™ t go with it .
â€œPeople already think Iâ€ ™ m an egotist , and putting the Apple logo up there with all these geniuses will get me skewered by the press.â€ �
After a few secondsâ€ ™ pause , Jobs then said : â€œWhat am I doing ?
Screw it .
Itâ€ ™ s the right thing .
Itâ€ ™ s great.â€ �
As well as being possibly the longest recorded period of self - doubt in Jobsâ€ ™ career , the anecdote brings home just how much Apple and its figurehead were one and the same , and how closely Jobs controlled the image of both .
Before the Think Different campaign , there had already been the notorious 1984 Macintosh ad , directed by Ridley Scott , which also cast Apple as the rebels and the troublemakers , bringing down some grey , Orwellian dystopia .
Long after Apple had gone from sticking it to The Man to basically being The Man , it somehow held on to those countercultural credentials .
As did Jobs himself , who refined his own west coast hippie image down to a monkish brand identity : black polo neck ; faded , beltless Levis ; white trainers ; round glasses .
Meanwhile , Jobsâ€ ™ product launches , broadcast directly to the tech - hungry faithful , were as eagerly anticipated and rapturously received as any movie .
Jobs controlled the medium and the message .
That Think Different ad also speaks volumes about the type of company in which Jobs expected history to place him , and so far history has obliged .
Jobsâ€ ™ story has been retold through countless books , TV programmes , documentaries and movies .
There is even a Steve Jobs opera in the works .
But by the time other media got round to mythologising him , Jobs had already done the job â€ “ which makes it difficult to tell his story without making a feature - length Apple ad .
The last attempt , 2013â€ ™ s Jobs , starring Ashton Kutcher , even ends with Jobs reading out the â€œHereâ€ ™ s to the crazy ones
â€ ¦
â€ � speech .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re all partly responsible for that , â€ � says Danny Boyle , whose new movie , Steve Jobs , seeks to tell the story in a different way .
â€œWe
all bought into it , especially in America .
Heâ€ ™ s a businessman really , but in America itâ€ ™ s part of the myth of the frontier : the pioneer .
One man forging ahead , breaking through any barrier .
And what struck me about it is that we â€
“ lots of us in the arts and media world
â€
“
we were his Trojan horse .
We were the ones who said : â€˜Youâ€ ™ re idiots using that PC stuff .
This is much more intuitive and cool.â€ ™
We did all that work for him ,
didnâ€ ™ t
we?â€ �
Steve Jobs the movie is an attempt to unscrew the back of that cultivated persona and show us whatâ€ ™ s inside .
Instead of the public - tech visionary , it gives us Jobs backstage , as he prepares for three of his famous product launches : in 1984 , 1988 and 1997 .
Each time , those preparations are interrupted by a carousel of close colleagues and family members , who combine to reveal Jobs as bullying , pig - headed , control - obsessed , Machiavellian and morally deficient â€ “ especially when it comes to his daughter , Lisa , whom Jobs cruelly refuses to acknowledge .
Aaron Sorkinâ€ ™ s script is based on Walter Isaacsonâ€ ™ s official biography of Jobs , but rather than sticking to the gospel , it reconfigures Jobsâ€ ™ life as a pacy , pithy , formally audacious piece of heightened drama .
You could call it an alt - biopic â€ “ or perhaps an alt - shift - command biopic .
Predictably , the movie has not gone down well with the party faithful , starting with current Apple CEO Tim Cook , who derided it as â€œopportunisticâ€ � .
Sorkinâ€ ™ s script takes considerable factual liberties , such as the way marketing executive Joanna Hoffman , played by Kate Winslet , appears throughout the movie , despite the fact she was no longer with Apple in 1997 .
Boyle is not concerned : â€œHistorians tell you what happened , dramatists tell you what it felt like , â€ � he says .
Sorkin gave us a similar draft of tech history with The Social Network , on Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg , but Zuckerberg was ( and still is ) a relative blank slate ; Jobs is practically a religious leader .
Michael Fassbender , who plays Jobs , is similarly unfazed by the complaints .
â€œPeople say itâ€ ™ s a really harsh representation and heâ€ ™ s a very unlikable person .
These are things that donâ€ ™ t really interest me that much , â€ � he says .
â€œWhat I focused on was somebody who had a vision , and it required an awful lot of energy and focus to achieve that , and that might have brought out a very impatient side to him .
Was he flawed ?
Yeah !
We all are.â€ �
Despite bearing little physical resemblance ( less than Kutcher , anyway ) , Fassbender inhabits the Jobs persona with compelling conviction
â€ “ long before he breaks out the black polo neck .
He and the principal cast members did have the benefit of talking to many of the real - life Jobs affiliates who appear in the film , though .
â€œWhat stuck with me was how much of an influence [ Jobs ] still was on these people , â€ �
Fassbender says .
â€œHow much love was there , and a real sense of sadness that he was no longer here .
The effect the man had on their lives was very palpable.â€ �
Winslet says the real - life Joanna Hoffman told her â€œunrepeatableâ€ � stories that revealed Jobs as almost charmingly naive , but Hoffman also admitted there were times she wanted to â€œstab him in the chestâ€ � .
You can see why Sorkinâ€ ™ s script chose to keep Hoffman around even when she wasnâ€ ™ t supposed to be there .
Smart , tough and demonstrative , she practically functions as Jobsâ€ ™ moral conscience , revealing his fallible humanity â€ “ or perhaps inhumanity .
In real life , Apple employees apparently gave an annual â€œStanding
Up To Steveâ€ � award .
Hoffman won it twice .
â€œThere was nothing enigmatic or even particularly fantastic about Steve to her , â€ � says Winslet .
â€œThere were times when she thought : â€˜Oh God , heâ€ ™ s just wearing what I wear.â€ ™
She was into all these Japanese designers , like Issey Miyake , so she would laugh about how Steve suddenly started wearing all these designers , too , which he got from her .
She had huge affection for Steve , partly because of all those things .
She only ever saw him as just Steve.â€
�
Winslet slips into Hoffmanâ€ ™ s Polish - American accent : â€œLike , itâ€ ™ s not a big deal.â€
�
For better or worse , the movie puts a human face on Jobs , but it also shows how Jobs put a human face on technology .
Literally in the case of the Macintosh , whose design , he explains , resembles a wonky human face .
In the first scene of the movie we see Jobs in crisis because his technicians canâ€ ™ t get the Macintosh to say â€œHelloâ€ � .
It speaks volumes that he called one of his first computers Lisa , after his daughter , even as he was refusing paternity payments for the real Lisa .
Jobs arguably rectified the moviesâ€ ™ technophobia in the process .
Taking their cue from Kubrickâ€ ™ s HAL in 2001 ( whose initials were transposed from IBM ) , the 1980s was full of nightmare scenarios such as War Games , Tron and The Terminator .
â€œComputers were these scary things with sharp edges , dark colours and something foreboding about them , â€ � says Fassbender .
â€œJobs really wanted us to develop a relationship with them , to see them as non - agresssive , non - threatening .
When you look at the first iMacs , theyâ€ ™ re the colour of sweets .
People almost wanted to lick them like lollipops .
Now most people take their phones and laptops to bed with them at night.â€ �
Admittedly , that technophobia could be due for a comeback , as post - Snowden paranoia makes its way into mainstream movies such as Spectre , Furious 7 and Captain America :
Winter Soldier â€ “ but Jobs can not be entirely blamed for that .
Jobs also had a hand in making movie computers friendlier via his involvement with animation pioneers Pixar .
He had no creative input , but Jobs bankrolled Pixar in its early years , and cannily manoeuvred its business dealings to the extent it became a threat to Disney , which then acquired it for $ 7.4 bn â€ “ as a result of which , Jobs suddenly became Disneyâ€ ™ s biggest shareholder .
Appleâ€ ™ s Think Different ad first aired on television during the network premiere of Toy Story .
Talk about controlling the message .
If Jobsâ€ ™ life has been mythologised , it is perhaps as much a product of our own limited narrative templates as his own self - promotion .
Pixar boss John Lasseter once likened Jobsâ€ ™ career to the classic â€œheroâ€ ™ s
journeyâ€
�
: the chosen one who is banished from his kingdom , goes off into the wilderness on adventures , then returns stronger and wiser to reclaim his birthright ( and turn it into the mightiest corporation on the planet ) .
Others have noted the Biblical parallels to Jobsâ€ ™ story : the tech messiah who was crucified by the number - crunchers but then rose again .
He even performed miracles : many who came into contact with him have spoken of Jobsâ€ ™ â€œreality distortion fieldâ€ �
â€ “ a singular ability to bend reality to his will , to achieve , or compel others to achieve , what was considered previously impossible .
The cliches are all readily applicable : the tortured artistic genius whose human failings we forgive , the American dreamer who started in his garage and conquered the world .
Steve Jobs the movie
canâ€ ™ t help but conform to some of these , and there is a certain irony to the fact that it tells the story of a 21st - century innovator in a format that is essentially 19th - century theatre .
But it at least bypasses Jobsâ€ ™ reality distortion field .
The movie has received widespread critical acclaim and is being tipped for awards , and yet its US box - office performance has been surprisingly disappointing .
It was rolled out across 2,400 screens three weekends ago but only took $ 7.1 m .
Boyleâ€ ™ s assessment is that it was â€œtoo
much , too soonâ€ � .
The hope is that the movie will fare better outside the US and keep going until awards season , Boyle explains , with characteristic honesty .
â€œThatâ€
™ s why Iâ€ ™ m here talking to you , rather than at home watching football.â€ �
Not that the project was in any way futile .
Itâ€ ™ s one of the best films of his career , he feels , as does virtually everyone else involved .
â€œOn balance , given his importance , and his own sense of self - promotion and being a public figure , youâ€ ™ ve got to tell stories about these people .
Itâ€ ™ s extraordinary whatâ€ ™ s happening to us , and the velocity of it .
Weâ€ ™ ve got to track these changes .
Weâ€ ™ re only just beginning really.â€ �
Steve Jobs is on general release in the UK"
2015-11-12,"Terms and conditions just got a lot more readable , thanks to comics artist Robert Sikoryak .
The Masterpiece Comics author has turned iTunesâ€ ™ 20,000-word legalese into a 94-page graphic novel and posted most of it on Tumblr .
Sikoryak imitates the work of illustrators from Edward Gorey to Marvel Comics masterminds Stan Lee and Jack Kirby , and includes a turtlenecked Steve Jobs on every page , who articulates his companyâ€ ™ s punishingly long legal contract between the Apple corporation and its music lovers .
To liven things up , cartoon Jobs treks across landscapes familiar to anyone who has read Robert Kirkman and Charlie Adlardâ€ ™ s
The Walking Dead , Jim Sterankoâ€ ™ s Nick Fury :
Agent of SHIELD , or classic
Tintin adventure Cigars of the Pharaoh .
( Sikoryak said he used iTunes itself to find popular comics to parody in the hopes that everyone who reads it would see a few familiar images . )
The artist told the Guardian he had been working on the side project since November 2014 , â€œbecause I thought it would be a funny thing to doâ€ � while he works on a second Masterpiece volume
( â€œI just did a version of the Marquis de Sadeâ€ ™ s Justine in the style of Wonder Womanâ€ � ) and an adaptation of Moby - Dick .
In fact , every one of Sikoryakâ€ ™ s 94 pages
â€ “ 56 are online as of Wednesday , with the rest finished and ready to post soon â€ “ is based
not just on a single artistâ€ ™ s style , but on a specific image from one of his or her works .
That page of Jobs chasing down a pretty young woman , informing her that â€œCertain content , app and book products , and services available via the app and book services may include materials from third partiesâ€ � is based on a series of Kate Beaton cartoons about peasant romance .
The late CEO leaping heroically off an Apple - logoed building , a cape billowing behind him , as captions explains that the cash value of a gift card is one - tenth of one cent ?
Page 34 of Frank Millerâ€ ™ s Batman :
The Dark Knight Returns # 1 .
â€œLots of classic works of literature and lots of books get adapted into comics .
The form of adaptation is really what Iâ€ ™ m responding to , â€ � Sikoryak said in an interview .
Most people feel that they should have read Moby - Dick , but havenâ€ ™ t , and most people havenâ€ ™ t read the iTunes agreement and feel that they should.â€ �
The artist said he hoped it would make the contract accessible in the manner of a movie version of a classic novel : â€œI donâ€ ™ t get to everything I want to read , either.â€ �
Sikoryak said he read the agreement as â€œa literary artifactâ€ � , and while the documentâ€ ™ s artistic merits were a little hard to locate , they were not wholly absent .
â€œItâ€
™
s got some repetition ,
â€ �
he said approvingly .
â€œItâ€
™ s not
Gertrude Stein , but it has some poetic elements .
And I didnâ€ ™ t find anything in it that I find particularly heinous!â€ �
Sikoryak also said he self - published the work in comic book form across two issues , one for parts A and B of the agreement , and a second for parts C and D. â€œIâ€ ™ m not asking them to put in a Part E , but there are a lot of people I left out who could have been in there , and people are asking me â€˜What about Garry Trudeau?â€ ™ â€ �
The cartoonist said he had been coy about the workâ€ ™ s existence until it was finished , putting it up online as quickly as he could in an effort to disseminate it quickly .
He hoped Apple was OK with that .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not done with disrespect , â€ � Sikoryak said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s done with bemusement .
I use their products.â€

2015-11-13,"Danny Boyle has addressed the underwhelming box office performance of his Oscar - tipped tech biopic Steve Jobs in a BBC interview .
The Oscar - winning directorâ€ ™ s latest film has made only $ 16.9 m ( Â£11.m ) to date in the US after three weeks of wide release , and he believes itâ€ ™ s down to a poor release strategy .
â€œItâ€ ™ s very disappointing
that when it was released wide across America it didnâ€ ™ t really work .
So itâ€ ™ s retreated back now to the main cities , â€ � Boyle told BBC Arabic .
â€œItâ€
™ s very easy in hindsight [ to speculate ] , but I think itâ€ ™ s probably that we released it too wide too soon.â€
�
The drama , which stars Michael Fassbender as the Apple entrepreneur , was initially released in just four cinemas in the US and received a strong screen average .
Two weeks later , it was pushed out to 2,493 screens , where it struggled to find an audience .
Two weeks after the expansion , its release was stripped back to a mere 421 screens .
While Boyle said that the filmâ€ ™ s distributor Universal â€œshould have built [ the release ] more slowlyâ€ � , he applauded it for taking on the troubled project after it was dropped by Sony .
â€œUniversal have been exemplary in the way theyâ€ ™ ve stood up for the film , promoted it and supported us throughout the whole process
â€ “
and I think are genuinely very proud of the film .
Sure , you might have done it in a different way
â€
¦
But youâ€ ™ ve got to get on now , â€ � he said , adding that he hopes people will continue to discover the film .
Itâ€ ™ s one of many films to have suffered from a disastrous month at the US box office , with Bradley Cooperâ€ ™ s foodie drama
Burnt , Sandra Bullockâ€ ™ s
political satire
Our Brand Is Crisis and Bill Murrayâ€ ™ s comedy Rock the Kasbah all failing to ignite .
Nevertheless , the biopic has received mostly strong reviews , with many suggesting it remains a contender for next yearâ€ ™ s Oscars ."
2015-11-15,"This weekâ€ ™ s big release , Steve Jobs , opens with black - and - white footage of science fiction writer Arthur C Clarke eerily predicting a future in which compact personal computers are an integral part of our everyday lives .
Danny Boyleâ€ ™ s film could equally well have ended with scenes from Sean Bakerâ€ ™ s Tangerine , a vibrantly colourful feature shot entirely on a modified iPhone 5s .
Itâ€ ™ s not the first phone - footage film ( forerunners include Olive , shot on a Nokia N8 in 2011 ) , but itâ€ ™ s certainly the best looking , using prototype anamorphic lens adapters to capture gorgeous widescreen vistas while shooting on the fly in the streets , burger bars and doughnut joints of LA .
Newcomer Kitana Kiki Rodriguez brings a punchy authenticity to the role of Sin - Dee , a transgender sex worker on a Christmas Eve warpath for her pimp boyfriend , Chester ( James Ransone ) ,
whoâ€ ™ s been cheating on her with a non - trans newcomer while she was in prison .
Enlisting the less - than - enthusiastic help of best friend Alexandra ( Mya Taylor ) , Sin - Dee tears through a string of local haunts , creating smart - mouthed chaos as she searches for the errant lovers while Alexandra attempts to ready herself ( â€œno drama!â€ � ) for an evening singing gig .
Meanwhile , taxi driver Razmik ( Baker regular Karren Karagulian ) divides his time between hoiking vomiting drunks out of his cab and getting paid - for relief in a car wash while maintaining the illusion of â€œrespectableâ€ � family life .
Fired by zesty performances that crackle and burn with energy , Tangerine is a bittersweet affair underpinned by a winning sense of empathy and affection .
Amid the rank artificiality of LA , there is real tenderness and between these characters a camaraderie that takes the harsher edges off their often bleak circumstances .
Rodriguez and Taylor are a terrific double act , their on - screen chemistry providing both laugh - out - loud comedy and moving melancholia .
Baker brings the same nonjudgmental approach that characterised his Independent Spirit awards prize - winner Starlet , while an in - your - face soundtrack pumps up the volume to boisterous effect ."
2015-11-19,"While Appleâ€ ™ s founder Steve Jobs gets the biopic treatment , Microsoft is turning to science fiction , with some of the top names in SF and fantasy lining up for a collection of stories inspired by the technology giantâ€ ™ s current research .
Ann Leckie , Seanan McGuire and Greg Bear are just some of the authors who have contributed to its Future Visions , after the company invited them into its research labs â€œto expose them to what some people might think is science fictionâ€ � .
The anthology , which also includes work from Elizabeth Bear , David Brin and Robert J Sawyer , is pitched as â€œoriginal fiction inspired by Microsoftâ€ � , featuring â€œnew works that predict the near future of technology and examine its complex relationship to our core humanityâ€ � .
Free in ebook , the stories were written following meetings between the authors and Microsoft research scientists who were working on what the company said were its â€œmost cutting edge areas of researchâ€ � , ranging from quantum computing to prediction analytics , virtual teleportation and computing that relates to emotion .
Steve Clayton , who was described as
Microsoftâ€ ™ s â€œchief storytellerâ€ � in the announcement , said that â€œthe idea was to bring authors in to expose them to what some people might think is science fictionâ€ � .
He added : â€œWe didnâ€ ™ t show them a piece of technology and ask them to please write about that .
We showed them technology and introduced them to a group of people , and then asked them , what did it spark in your mind as ideas ?
Where did it inspire you to think the technology may go?â€ � Greg Bearâ€ ™ s The Machine Starts riffs on the consequences of quantum computing , David Brin looks at the science of prediction in The Tell , and Nancy Kress considers machine intelligence in Machine Learning .
Ann Leckieâ€ ™ s story , Another Word for World , is set in the far future and is sparked by her interest in machine translation and communication .
â€œItâ€ ™ s easy to mechanically say this word should always be translated â€˜truckâ€ ™ , but something else to take a phrase and say ,
well actually in this sentence , it ought to be translated this way , or it means this .
And then thereâ€ ™ s the challenge of trying to figure out the emotional context of a sentence .
If you know the speaker is agitated , that provides part of how youâ€ ™ re translating the sentence , â€ � said Leckie .
The novelistâ€ ™ s
award - winning trilogy , which opens with Ancillary Justice , is set in a universe where gender is irrelevant , and where all characters , regardless of gender , are referred to as â€œsheâ€ � .
â€œLanguage really interests me , the different ways it frames how you look at the world and the ways you can talk about different things easily or less easily depending on what your language is set up to do , â€ �
she said in Microsoftâ€ ™ s announcement , adding : â€œScience fiction can be about a lot of things , but one of the many things I like about it is the way it plays with scientific ideas and ideas about technology .

Jennifer Henshaw , a co - editor of the Microsoft anthology and a communications manager with Microsoft Technology and Research , said that the company wanted the book to be â€œmeaningful to the sci - fi community â€ “ not as a piece that was published by Microsoft , but as a piece of science fiction literature that stands on its own .

2015-11-23,"Pixar president Ed Catmull has said that Steve Jobs would be â€œappalledâ€ � with Danny Boyleâ€ ™ s biopic .
In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter , Catmull claims that the film , scripted by Aaron Sorkin , fails to provide an accurate representation of the Apple icon .
â€œI think
heâ€ ™ d be appalled , â€ � he said .
â€œAnd they actually canâ€ ™ t tell the story because the storyâ€ ™ s wrong .
He went through an arc in his life .
There was a time [ when ] the way he worked with people was not good , and I saw that when I first worked with him .
But peoÂ­ple look at that dramatic part , and theyâ€ ™ ll make a movie about that â€ ” and thatâ€ ™ s not the story.â€ � Catmull believes the film missed the â€œaspect of the change of Steveâ€ � , which saw him become â€œan empathetic personâ€ � .
He is the latest in a string of figures who knew and worked with Jobs to express their thoughts on the film .
John Sculley , who was Appleâ€ ™ s CEO and is portrayed in the film by Jeff Daniels , had mixed feelings .
â€œI think Steve would see a lot of things about this film that he would like : first of all , itâ€ ™ s a perfectionist product , â€ � he said .
â€œEverything about it : the acting , the directing , the screenplay .
But , I also think [ he ] would be a little bit hurt , because many people who never knew the young Steve Jobs could go away from this movie and think , â€˜well

2015-12-09,"Biopics Trumbo and Steve Jobs have gained an extra push in the race for next yearâ€ ™ s
Oscars after scoring multiple nominations from the Screen Actors Guild .
The 1940s - set drama
Trumbo , about a blacklisted Hollywood screenwriter , picked up the most with three nods : best ensemble cast , best actor for Bryan Cranston and best supporting actress for Helen Mirren , who also picked up a surprise best actress nomination for the widely panned drama Woman in Gold .
Other unexpected nominees included Sarah Silverman as best actress for her role in the addiction drama I Smile Back , and Michael Shannon as best supporting actor for the thriller 99 Homes .
Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet also scored nominations for their roles in Steve Jobs while journalism drama Spotlight was recognised for best ensemble and Rachel McAdams as best supporting actress .
The transgender drama
The Danish Girl has also picked up added Oscar buzz with nominations for both Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander , while Netflix received two nominations for Beasts of No Nation : best ensemble , and Idris Elba as best supporting actor .
Other nominees included Leonardo DiCaprio for best actor in The Revenant , Johnny Depp as best actor in Black Mass and Cate Blanchett as best actress in Carol .
There was , however , no sign of The Martian , The Hateful Eight , Creed or Joy , all of which had been considered potential nominees , leaving stars Matt Damon , Jennifer Jason Leigh , Sylvester Stallone and Jennifer Lawrence in need of some added buzz to feature in the race .
Last yearâ€ ™ s SAG winners perfectly matched the Oscars , with Eddie Redmayne , Julianne Moore , JK Simmons and Patricia Arquette all taking home awards .

2015-12-11,"Banksy has revealed a new artwork , sprayed on a wall in the Calais refugee camp called â€œthe Jungleâ€ � , intended to address negative attitudes towards the thousands of people living there .
The work depicts the late Steve Jobs , the founder of Apple , with a black bin bag thrown over one shoulder and an original Apple computer in his hand .
The work is a pointed reference to Jobsâ€ ™ s background as the son of a Syrian migrant who went to America after the second world war .
In a rare statement accompanying the work , Banksy said : â€œWeâ€ ™ re often led to believe migration is a drain on the countryâ€ ™ s resources but Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian migrant .
Apple is the worldâ€ ™ s most profitable company , it pays over $ 7bn ( Â£4.6bn ) a year in taxes â€
“ and it only exists because they allowed in a young man from Homs.â€
�
The graffiti is one of a series of works Banksy has created in response to the refugee crisis .
During his trip to Calais , the artist covered several walls across the French port with related graffiti , including a riff on Theodore Gericaultâ€ ™ s
Raft of the Medusa , featuring a luxury yacht .
This summer , his temporary â€œbemusementâ€ � park in Weston - Super - Mare featured an installation of boats filled with bodies .
On the closing night of Dismaland , Banksy also invited Pussy Riot to debut their song criticising the global failure to help the migrants entering Europe .
Since the park closed in September , the artist has been shipping leftover infrastructure from Dismaland to help build emergency housing for the 7,000 migrants , mainly from Syria , Eritrea and Afghanistan , now living on the site of a former rubbish tip in Calais .
The â€œDismal aidâ€ � project has seen site crew from the theme park build accommodation , community buildings and
a childrenâ€ ™ s
play area in the camp ."
2015-12-18,"Inherent Vice star Katherine Waterston will board Ridley Scottâ€ ™ s film Alien : Covenant , according to the Hollywood Reporter .
Waterston will join Michael Fassbender ,
her co - star in Danny Boyleâ€ ™ s Steve Jobs biopic , in the sequel to the poorly received Alien prequel , Prometheus .
Fassbender will return as David , a hyper - intelligent android with a chilly disdain for his human masters .
Waterstonâ€ ™ s role and the filmâ€ ™
s plot are yet to be announced .
Waterston was a regular on HBO TV show Boardwalk Empire and film bit - part player before her role in Inherent Vice , in which she played Shasta Fay Hepworth , a skewed take on the femme fatale ,
opposite Joaquin Phoenix in Paul Thomas Andersonâ€ ™ s stoner detective story .
In Steve Jobs she portrayed Chrisann Brennan , an ex - girlfriend of the Apple co - founder and the mother of his child , Lisa .
Sheâ€ ™ ll soon appear in the 2016 Harry Potter spin - off , Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , which is JK Rowlingâ€ ™ s first screenplay .
Waterston stars as Porpentina Goldstein , a witch living in 1920s New York who teams up with Newt Scamander ( Eddie Redmayne ) in an effort the recapture magical creatures that have escaped into the city .
Alien :
Convenant will be the second prequel to Ridley Scottâ€ ™ s classic 1979 space horror .
Scott , who is a likely contender for a best director Oscar nomination for his work on space survival thriller The Martian , has said that there will be two further films before events catch up with the original film .
â€œI was amazed that in the three that followed [ Alien ] , no one asked the question : â€˜Why the Alien , who made it and why?â€ ™ he said during a November press conference on the set of Alien : Covenant in Sydney .
â€œVery basic questions .
So I came up with the notion of Prometheus 1 , which starts to indicate who might have made it and where it came from â€ ¦ why was this space jockey there and why did he have an Alien inside him ?
And those questions will be answered.â€ �"
2015-12-19,"If youâ€ ™ re looking for themes and narratives from 2015 at the pictures , one word above all others stands out : FLOP .
This yearâ€ ™ s
box - office calamities came in all varieties .
We got good movies that didnâ€ ™ t deserve to fail , like Guillermo del Toroâ€ ™ s gothic Victorian romance Crimson Peak , Robert Zemeckisâ€ ™ s 3D high - wire drama The Walk , and Danny Boyleâ€ ™ s Steve Jobs biopic .
And some that did deserve to fail , such as Ron Howardâ€ ™ s
In The Heart Of The Sea , Michael Mannâ€ ™ s lifeless Blackhat , and the Wachowskisâ€ ™ space opera Jupiter Ascending .
Among the deserving dead were the George Clooney - produced Our Brand
Is Crisis and the repulsive Bill Murray
misfire Rock
The Casbah ( what were they thinking ? ) .
Turkeys were everywhere : Pan , Fantastic Four , Aloha , Tomorrowland , Black Mass , Mortdecai , The Gunman .
Jurassic World and Star Wars :
The Force Awakens aside , this made it a lousy year for Hollywood , capped by the usual compensatory flurry of big , Oscar - worthy releases in the last six weeks of the year , such as the period pieces Carol and Brooklyn .
Quentin Tarantino and Alejandro GonzÃ¡lez IÃ±Ã¡rritu , with competing snowbound symphonies of violence , will be in the thick of it and deservedly so â€ “ though their films The Hateful Eight and The Revenant wonâ€ ™ t come out here until January .
A visionary action - sci - fi masterpiece called Mad Max
: Fury Road was the only contender everyone agreed on .
Its success , however , did nothing to allay oneâ€ ™ s suspicion that Marvel has elsewhere made a superhero monoculture of Hollywood .
When a movie such as Tangerine â€ “
Sean Bakerâ€ ™ s tale of two transgender prostitutes in LA , made for buttons and shot with iPhones â€
“ stands out , you know that the means of production have finally landed in the hands of people who know what they want to make , and how to make it .
The independent movie sector wasnâ€ ™ t the only contender making inroads into Hollywoodâ€ ™ s turf .
There was excellent streaming - digital work like Netflixâ€ ™ s Beasts Of No Nation , and there was , of course , TV itself , circling the movies like a shark these six decades past , and finally ready to feast upon the senior medium .
There was simply too much good , highly cinematic , drama on the small screen ; I got more from certain episodes of Fargo and Mad Men than from entire months at the movies this year .
Away from the screen itself , there was healthy , long - overdue debate about women directing movies ( â€œbecause itâ€ ™ s 2015â€ � ) , even though most established big - name female directors were between projects this year .
The parallel conversation about getting more of an African - American presence onscreen paid early dividends with the aforementioned Tangerine , as well as Spike Leeâ€ ™ s Chi - Raq , a Greek comedy reset in Chicagoâ€ ™ s ganglands , and Ryan Cooglerâ€ ™ s superb re - imagining of the Rocky franchise in Creed ( out next year in the UK ) .
But , for these groups and others , such debates â€ “ which arose out of political realities like the post - Ferguson Black Lives Matter movement and the GOPâ€ ™ s relentless war against womenâ€ ™ s earning power and reproductive rights â€ “ have established an important set of terms for future film - makers to build on .
2015 feels like a transitional period between the old model of mega - budgets , test - marketing and blanket - releasing , and an emerging , hydra - headed film business in which the cinema becomes increasingly irrelevant as an exhibition platform .
The old is slowly dying , but contra Gramsci , 2015 suggests that something new is finally kicking its way out of the womb ."
2015-12-28,"Itâ€ ™ s been quite the year for every council workerâ€
™ s favourite stencil owner .
From his tour of Gaza to bringing Steve Jobs to Calaisâ€ ™ s largest refugee camp , Banksy has highlighted the politics of many of 2015â€ ™ s most troubled regions .
Where he goes next is anyoneâ€ ™ s guess .
Surely it canâ€ ™ t be long until heâ€ ™ s asked to join Geri Halliwell in the hallowed corridors of the UN as a goodwill ambassador .
The year started in earnest with that February tour to Palestine , when Banksy followed up his 2005 paintings on the West Bank barrier wall with a portrait of the weeping goddess Niobe on the door of bombed - out resident Rabie Darduna â€ “ all that was left of his house after it was hit by Israeli munitions last year .
Unfortunately , just a few months later it emerged that Darduna had been duped into selling the door for just 700 shekels â€ “ about Â£120 .
After all , the art market isnâ€ ™ t exactly known for its ethics .
By August , the man with the golden brush was probably too distracted by the opening of his theme park Dismaland to chase up a door .
With 58 handpicked artists , including Damien Hirst and Jenny Holzer , turning a disused lido site into a funny but despair - fuelled mix of art installation and political polemic , Dismaland proved one of the hit art events of the summer .
Which leads us to Calais .
Once Dismaland had been swept away ( and Pussy Riot , De La Soul , Damon Albarn and the rest had performed at the closing concert ) it was time for Banksyâ€ ™ s next mission .
Namely , to break down all its materials and drive them to Calais to be used to build shelters in the large refugee camp known as The Jungle .
This was the birth of Dismal Aid .
The artist even left a small portrait of Steve Jobs â€ “ the son of a Syrian refugee â€ “ on a wall in the camp , which people are now charging Â£3.60 to see .
Because , as the artwork so clearly pointed out , being entrepreneurial is exactly how migrants and refugees survive .
So , what next for your mumâ€ ™ s favourite grafitti artist ?
Where does he go from here ?
Allow me to make a few suggestions : Team up with Murad Subay in Yemen Subay is an artist who has been painting political , critical , often controversial murals across Yemenâ€ ™ s capital , Sanaa , for some years .
Instead of dubbing him â€œthe Banksy of the Middle Eastâ€ � why not send Bristolâ€ ™ s finest over there to give him a hand ?
After all , as Amnesty International has pointed out , itâ€ ™ s the UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia that have fuelled the civil war in Yemen .
A war that , since mid - March , has killed 5,800 people , wounded tens of thousands more and forced 2.5 million to flee their homes .
When our allies are dropping British - made bombs on your country , we bloody
well owe you any help we can give .
Or , you know , they could do a nice mural outside the British embassy .
Whichever .
Give Boris Johnsonâ€ ™ s house a paint job
If one of Banksyâ€ ™ s murals of a girl and an ATM can be protected with a large plastic sheet then , surely , we can call in the street artist to cover the front of the Mayor of Londonâ€ ™ s Islington house until the jabbering , hay - haired , public transport - ruining , offensive mayor has been nailed away for good behind a sheet of clear plastic .
Surely .
Send him to Moscow Since the untimely death of Russian graffiti artist Pasha P183 at just 29 , there is certainly a void into which Banksy could start spraying .
And now that Vladimir Putin is ratcheting up tensions between Russia and Turkey , while simultaneously sliding up to everybodyâ€ ™ s favourite talking merkin Donald Trump , it would be nice to see some form of dissent against the Russian president .
Even if it is painted over the next day .
A mural at Kellingley Colliery Banksy should do a specially commissioned portrait of Margaret Thatcher on the newly closed North Yorkshire deep coal mine .
I canâ€
™ t think of a better way to remember the woman who did so much to destroy British trade unions , industry and working - class culture .
We could charge Thatcher fans Â£100 per person for entry and give all the money to the 450 miners who have just lost their jobs weeks before Christmas .
Paint a Mira Rai mural in Nepal
The story of the young Nepalese woman who has become an internationally acclaimed long - distance runner is one of the precious few good news stories to emerge from Nepal since the devastating earthquake in April 2015 , which killed 9,000 people and injured more than 23,000 .
So why donâ€ ™ t we charge Banksy to pay tribute to an athlete who trained around Kathmandu â€ “ a city so badly hit by that natural disaster ?
It would be doing his bit for feminism and international development â€ “ and make a nice break from selling all those T - shirts on Brick Lane ."
2016-01-11,"Aaron Sorkin is known for his incredibly wordy screenplays , but backstage at the 73rd Golden Globe awards , the best original screenplay winner for Steve Jobs was speechless .
â€œIâ€ ™ m usually better at words , â€ � the writer said , appearing visibly flustered onstage in front of the press .
â€œYou can perform surgery on me .
Iâ€ ™ m so stunned by whatâ€ ™ s happened.â€
�
Part of the shock stems back to the fact that the film has fallen off the radar in recent months , after courting negative press for bombing at the box office following its wide release in the US .
After starting strongly with the yearâ€ ™ s best per - screen average in its opening weekend , the Danny Boyle - directed drama failed to make an impact nationally , taking a poor $ 7.3 m over its opening weekend .
It flatlined in the end , earning only $ 17.7 m domestically since opening in October .
â€œThe title of the movie changed to â€˜Box Office Failure Steve Jobsâ€ ™ after its third week , â€ � Sorkin said .
â€œIt took some of the air out of the pride that we were feeling [ at the time ] .
We didnâ€ ™ t want that to be the epithet of the movie .
This is just very , very nice.â€
�
â€œWe understood it wasnâ€ ™ t going to be for everybody , â€ � he added .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not
The Martian.â€ � Asked to single out his favorite reaction to Steve Jobs from someone close to
the Apple co - founder , Sorkin was quick to cite computer scientist Andy Hertzfeld , whoâ€ ™ s played by Michael Stuhlbarg in the film .
Recalled Sorkin : â€œWhen
we screened it for him , he said : â€˜This is unbelievable â€ “ not all of that happened , but itâ€ ™ s all trueâ€ ™ .â€ �"
2016-01-11,"Kate Winslet revealed backstage at the 73rd Golden Globes that she was so convinced she wasnâ€
™ t winning the best supporting actress honor for her performance in Steve Jobs that she had booked a massage immediately following the show .
Winslet said to the press :
â€œI have this recurring neck problem , as I was about to leave the hotel to the carpet , I realized itâ€ ™ s been hurting all day .
I went and booked a massage for 9 pm , which I think Iâ€ ™ ll need to cancel.â€ � Winslet , who won for playing Jobsâ€ ™ right - hand woman in Danny Boyleâ€ ™ s film , Joanna Hoffman , visibly appeared to still be in shock minutes after accepting her award at at the Beverly Hilton in front of her peers , including her co - star in the film , Michael Fassbender .
â€œI really am so shocked right now , â€ � she said , wide - eyed .
â€œSo shocked !
Iâ€ ™ m never ever going to get used to it .
Iâ€ ™ m standing here , thinking really this is not happening .
I honestly , truthfully did not expect this at all.â€ �
During her speech , Winslet commented on 2015 being a banner year for women in film .
Asked to elaborate , the actor said : â€œA lot of us out there still in the game .
Iâ€ ™ ve been doing this for 23 years , Cate Blanchett probably longer .
Thereâ€ ™ s a real sense of girl power this year.â€
�
Winslet looked back fondly on her career , expressing how grateful she is to still be working .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve had an amazing few years , â€ � said the actor , â€œI think there are amazing scripts out there
â€ “ I can only speak to that of my own experience .
Iâ€ ™ ve been very blessed.â€ �
She admitted to being so flustered onstage that she forgot to thank Hoffman in her speech .
She apologized backstage for her omission , saying : â€œI forgot to mention her in my speech , because I never thought Iâ€ ™ d be making one!â€
�
Winslet said she loved playing Hoffman in Steve Jobs because she â€œlooks nothing like me , and is from a world I know nothing aboutâ€
� .
Said Winslet : â€œI wanted a challenge.â€ �"

2016-01-31,"Bill Gates speaks about his relationship with the late Apple founder Steve Jobs and chooses a song in memory of their work together shaping the technology of the modern age , in an appearance on BBC Radio 4â€ ™ s Desert Island Discs on Sunday .
Describing Jobs , who died in 2011 , as an â€œincredible geniusâ€ � , Gates , 60 , chooses as one of his allotted eight favourite tracks
the Beatlesâ€ ™ s
Two of Us , for its apposite line :
â€œYou and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead.â€ � .
He says : â€œSteve was really into music .
He loved the Beatles and so did I.
And he actually mentioned this song when we were interviewed together .
Only he and I understood how intense [ it was ] and what great memories came out of it.â€ �
The presenter Kirsty Young introduces the Microsoft co - founder as â€œthe richest man in the worldâ€ � , and asks him about the competitive friendship that grew between the rival innovators .
â€œIn the early years , the intensity between us had always been about the project and
so , then , as Steve got sick , it was far more mellow , in terms of talking about our lives and our kids , â€ � Gates says .
Paying tribute to the Apple co - founderâ€ ™ s â€œsingularâ€ � part in the story of the personal computer , and admitting his envy of Jobsâ€ ™ s â€œincredible design
skillsâ€ � , Gates recalls the formative stages of their work together .
â€œFor
some periods we were complete allies , working on the original software for Apple .
Sometimes he would be very tough on you and sometimes he would be very encouraging .
And he got really great work out of people.â€ � Gates , who now spends most of his time running the charitable Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that he set up with his wife in 2007 , defends himself from the charge he was ruthless in building up his multibillion - dollar business .
â€œWell , I was only ruthless if you define having super - low prices as ruthless , â€ � he tells Young .
â€œIn that sense , yes , we were aggressive.â€ �
Gates enthuses about his work to defeat malaria and his aim for it to become the second virulent disease , after smallpox , to be eradicated .
His impulse to give away most of his vast fortune is not that illogical , he argues .
â€œYou donâ€
™ t have that many choices .
You are not going to spend it on yourselves and we think only a small proportion should go to our kids , so they can make their own way in the world , â€ � he says .
Choosing a Willie Nelson track , Blue Skies , to remind him of the night before his wedding to Melinda in 1994 , Gates tells Young how they met : â€œThere was a Microsoft meeting in New York and I was the second to last to come and she was the last and she sat down next to me.â€
�
She turned down his initial offers of a date , he says , although he was the worldâ€ ™ s most eligible bachelor .
â€œNeither of us started out thinking that it would turn into something .
I was still being fanatical , but then we watched The Sound of Music together , which we both loved , and thatâ€ ™ s when it turned serious.â€ �
The track Can Love Survive ? from the Broadway version of the Rogers and Hammerstein musical is another of Gatesâ€ ™ s Desert Island choices .
Its lyrics celebrate the fact that rich people can have a romantic love story too , despite having private planes and international business interests .
As a younger man in charge of Microsoft , Gates once memorised the car number plates of all his employees so he would know who was at work on any day .
Marriage to Melinda has tempered this obsessive focus on work , Gates says .
â€œShe changed that
and I wanted her to change that .
Now we take quite a few vacations .
I am sure myself in my 20s would look at my schedule now and find it very wimpy indeed.â€ �
Selecting Steven Pinkerâ€ ™ s lengthy work
The Better Angels of Our Nature as his book for the island
, the castaway says his only truly guilty pleasure in life is his ability to fly around the world in his own plane ."
2016-02-04,"Protests that fly in the face of popular opinion can not help but benefit from celebrity endorsement .
And this week , one particular group of aggrieved voices attracted much - needed validation from Kate Winslet , who is currently in the US to drum up support for her best supporting actress Oscar nomination for the film Steve Jobs .
Admittedly , the group she got behind has been protesting in online chat rooms rather than in their local high streets or outside town halls .
But donâ€ ™ t let that fool you into thinking that the issue in question is not of vital importance .
The contentious subject concerns the ending of James Cameronâ€ ™ s 1998 movie Titanic , in which Jack ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) sinks to an icy death in the ocean while his sweetheart Rose ( Winslet ) clings to a door bobbing on the waves .
Some fans have long claimed that there was room on that wooden raft for two .
The charge is that Rose effectively sent him to his death â€ “ and turned him into a Jacksicle .
With five simple words , Winslet has now confirmed those fears .
â€œHe could have actually fitted , â€ �
she told the talkshow host Jimmy Kimmel .
The prosecution rests .
This is not the first time this has come up .
Cameron was quizzed on the matter in 2012 by this newspaper .
His response was withering : â€œWait
a minute , Iâ€ ™ m going to call up William Shakespeare and ask why Romeo and Juliet had to die , â€ � he snapped .
My sympathies in this matter lie exclusively with Cameron .
Like him or not , he is a creative force , while fans tend to be destructive in their pedantry .
He is an artist ; they are nit - pickers .
Iâ€ ™ m no admirer of Titanic .
The filmâ€ ™ s
use of a real - life tragedy as an eye - catching backdrop is exploitative at best .
So the idea that Rose might have caused the death of a loved one simply to leave a little more elbow room in the hours before she is rescued makes this anodyne movie mildly interesting at last .
But itâ€ ™ s unlikely to be the case .
Jack had to die because the picture was constructed as a tear - jerker .
Every fictional story needs its own internal logic on which real world plausibility can not trespass .
Objections will inevitably arise that could unravel this fictional fabric , and it is the filmmakersâ€ ™ responsibility to keep those at bay for as long as possible .
Mightier talents than Cameron have seen off challenges to their supremacy .
The accusation is still sometimes heard that Orson Welles slipped up by making the whole of Citizen Kane pivot on the dying word ( â€œRosebudâ€ � ) of an old man , without putting anyone in the same room to overhear him say it .
Not so .
Watch the whole movie and youâ€ ™ ll realise that the butler did it
â€ “ or rather , heard it .
Alfred Hitchcock had a term for niggling problems that are left unresolved in a movie : he called them â€œiceboxâ€ � questions .
Opaqueness is fine ( Vertigo is suffused with it ) but if you skimp explicitly on vital information , the audience will be unforgiving .
Asked why the psychiatrist unpicks every inch of the plot at the end of Psycho , Hitchcock said that not doing so would have upset â€œthe icebox tradeâ€ � .
That is , â€œthe people who get home after seeing a movie , go to the icebox , and take out the cold chicken .
While theyâ€ ™ re chewing on it , they discuss the picture .
In the morning , the wife meets the neighbour next door .
She says to her , â€˜How was the picture?â€ ™ , and the wife says , â€˜It was all right
but we discovered a number of flaws in it.â€ ™ Bang goes your word of mouth!â€ �
The director Jonathan Demme modified both the term and its meaning .
Working with the screenwriter Ted Tally on The Silence of the Lambs , he advised him not to worry unduly over â€œrefrigerator questionsâ€ � .
Demme explained : â€œYou know .
Youâ€ ™ ve just come home from a movie , you had a great time , you go to the refrigerator to get a beer , you open the door , and you say , â€˜Wait
a minute
â€ ¦ â€
™ â€ �
If a film has got the audience until they open the fridge , maintains Demme , then thatâ€ ™ s all that matters .
Given that it has taken almost 20 years for the clamour about the Titanic question to rise above the negligible , itâ€ ™ s fair to say that the movie easily passes the refrigerator test .
An entire generation has been sired since it was first released .
Political regimes have fallen and risen .
I think Cameron can rest easy over his reputation as a storyteller ."
2016-02-05,"Part of the trick of doing a fact - based movie , TV show or miniseries is casting .
Hire the wrong actors â€
“ be they too short , too tall , not attractive enough , too attractive or just incapable of acting â€ “ and it will invariably sink your production .
Would Steve Jobs have been slightly better if they cast someone who looked even remotely like Steve Jobs ?
Probably .
Then again , we knew what Steve Jobs looked like .
We saw his face a lot ; maybe too much .
Every six months , there he was , hocking some new light - up brick gadget that promised to change the way we exist ( until the next device arrives to further advance the human species to the point where weâ€ ™ re just pure energy or that baby from the end of 2001 : A Space Odyssey ) .
He was a constant presence in our lives the same way that Colonel Sanders is now .
Seriously , that KFC commercial is everywhere .
Conversely , in Argo , Ben Affleck did just about nothing to look like CIA operative Tony Mendez .
If you click here , youâ€ ™ ll see that Mendez looks like a Hispanic man from the 70s with a delightful turtleneck and Affleck looks like whatever the opposite of that is .
Was Argo still very , very good ?
Yes , because I had no clue what Mendez looked like until just now , when I searched for â€œWhat does Tony Mendez look likeâ€
� on Ask.com .
Yeah , Ask.com .
You got a problem with that , pal ?
Anyway , that brings me to episode one of The People v OJ Simpson , FXâ€ ™ s noble attempt to make some sense of the ludicrous trial of the former NFL star for the murder of his wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend Ronald Goldman .
Just about every casting decision is spot on .
Sarah Paulson looks enough like DA Marcia Clark that we can relax and enjoy her stunning performance .
Same with Courtney B Vance as Johnnie Cochran , Sterling K Brown as Christopher Darden and David Schwimmer as Robert Kardashian .
They all look enough like the real people that it smooths over any lingering suspension of disbelief .
Even Billy Magnussen is serviceable as Kato Kaelin .
Katoâ€ ™ s such a minor character that as long as heâ€ ™ s blond and looks kinda dumb , itâ€ ™ ll float .
When he shows up to be questioned by police in the first hour of the mini - series , I breathed a sigh of relief that I kept wondering if he was high or not during filming .
They nailed that .
The only true stunt casting in the series so far is John Travolta as defense attorney Robert Shapiro .
Travolta appears to be playing Shapiro as his character from Battlefield Earth â€ “ campy , petulant and paranoid ; with a truly ear - splitting giggle in the place of real , human laughter â€ “
but I give him a pass because I happen to love watching Travolta give a terrible performance .
Presumably , heâ€ ™ s trying here , but what heâ€ ™ s trying to do is anyoneâ€ ™ s guess .
If heâ€ ™ s trying to win a Golden Globe or a Peopleâ€ ™ s Choice Award ,
heâ€ ™ s succeeded .
If heâ€ ™ s trying to act well , then I am terribly sorry to break it to him , but heâ€ ™ s failed miserably .
Still , I canâ€ ™ t help but watch Travolta flail around like an electrocuted cat or George Romero playing The Joker from the 1960s Batman TV show on Molly .
What I canâ€ ™ t abide by is the central performance in this passion play :
Cuba Gooding Jr as OJ Simpson .
When Gooding as Simpson enters the frame for the first time , walking out of his Brentwood estate to meet his driver , Iâ€ ™ m on board .
â€œAt least they cast a black dude
, â€ �
I said to myself .
You might think thatâ€ ™ s some kind of glib sarcasm , but we live in a world where Joseph Fiennes can play Michael Jackson in a TV show .
So , OJ comes out of his house , either right after he murdered Nicole and Ron or right after taking a nice , peaceful nap , depending on your level of belief in Mr Simpson .
Iâ€ ™ m fine until he starts talking .
His whiny , gravely voice sounds absolutely nothing like the real OJ Simpsonâ€ ™ s deep , commanding tones .
Donâ€ ™ t believe me ?
Hereâ€ ™ s what OJ actually sounds like .
Also , OJ was and is a large man .
He was a professional football player , after all .
Cuba Gooding Jr looks like the â€œbeforeâ€ � photo in one of those home fitness infomercials .
The role of OJ is important to the series , but from the first episode , itâ€ ™ s clear that OJ is not the protagonist .
If anything , it looks as though Marcia Clark is the real lead character in this .
Her proactive nature , confidence and drive move the narrative along more than OJ does .
As we spend copious amounts of time gawking at Johnnie Cochranâ€ ™ s closet and worrying about Robert Shapiroâ€ ™ s ego , itâ€ ™ s clear that as charismatic and fascinating as OJ was and is , he will remain an enigma , as he is in his real life ."

2016-02-29,"Alicia Vikander has won the best supporting actress Oscar for her role in Tom Hooperâ€ ™ s transgender drama The Danish Girl .
The 27-year - old star beat favourite Kate Winslet for the award .
The Steve Jobs star was seen as the frontrunner after winning both the Bafta and Golden Globe for her performance .
Vikander had also won the Screen Actors Guild award for her role .
The film , directed by Oscar - winner Tom Hooper , focuses on the first ever recipient of gender reassignment surgery and the effect this has on his marriage .
Vikander stars opposite Eddie Redmayne , who is also nominated for his performance .
It was one of many films last year to star the Swedish actor .
Vikander also appeared in foodie drama
Burnt , period action comedy
The Man From UNCLE , sci - fi thriller
Ex Machina , fantasy adventure Seventh Son , crime thriller Son of a Gun and wartime romance Testament of Youth .

2016-03-02,"The disappointing box - office performance of some recent films , including the Steve Jobs biopic , has hit the distributor Entertainment One hard , sending its shares tumbling .
The Canadian distribution and production company , which owns the Peppa Pig TV franchise , said film sales slid 14 % in the nine months to 31 December .
Box - office takings fell by almost a quarter to $ 174 m ( Â£123 m ) from $ 228 m a year earlier .
The London - listed firm , which sells TV shows including The Walking Dead and Into the Badlands as well as films such as the Twilight and Hunger Games series , blamed a lower number of film releases and the poor performance of some recent titles , including Steve Jobs , which flopped at the box office despite a generally positive critical reception .
The news alarmed investors and sent the shares down more than 13 % to 149.4p , making it the biggest faller on the FTSE-250 index .
The firmâ€ ™ s disappointing trading statement came three days after the Oscar success of Spotlight , to which it owns the international distribution rights .
The fact - based journalism drama beat The Revenant to win best picture as well as the award for best original screenplay at the Academy Awards on Sunday .
Entertainment One is confident film sales will recover this year , thanks to its new partnership with Steven Spielbergâ€ ™ s Amblin .
It pointed to a strong line - up of new releases such as Roald Dahlâ€ ™ s The BFG and the thriller The Girl on the Train , based on the bestselling British novel , as well as David Brent : Life on the Road , written by and starring Ricky Gervais , which is out this summer .
The companyâ€ ™ s chief executive , Darren Throop , said : â€œWhile the film division continues to experience trading challenges , its restructuring and the exciting committed film release slate for the next financial year provide a positive outlook for film.â€ � Group revenues slipped 3 % in the nine - month period as the film slump was largely offset by strong growth in television sales , of 39 % .
The firm said its full - year outlook was unchanged , and insisted that it was on track to double in size by 2020 .
It has built Peppa Pig â€ “ the top pre - school brand in the UK , Spain , Australia and Latin America â€ “ into a $ 1bn global TV and merchandise franchise and hopes to double its sales in five years after taking control in October of the UK producer Astley Baker Davies , which created Peppa .
The deal includes the production of 52 new episodes .
The popular cartoon character is doing particularly well in the US , where the firm estimates a 275 % surge in retail sales for the financial year 2015 .
Production of Mark Gordonâ€ ™ s new US political drama television series , Designated Survivor , starts in March , and American TV shows Criminal Minds , Greyâ€ ™ s Anatomy , Quantico and Ray Donovan continue to pull in viewers , the firm said ."
2016-03-11,"The Apple Pencil is a cursed product , haunted by a single Steve Jobs quote from 2010 : â€œIf you see a stylus , they blew it.â€
�
Jobs thought that the stylus , a pen - like device used to write or draw directly on a digital screen , was a useless appendage .
If you couldnâ€ ™ t operate a device with only your fingertips its design was flawed .
This may be the real reason behind the very literal design of the Apple Pencil .
Apple seems to have deliberately designed its latest accessory to look , feel and function like a creative tool â€ “ and not the technological appendage that Jobs famously hated .
The new Pencil is exclusive to the latest and largest iPad , the iPad Pro , and is intended to let everyone from amateur artists to creative professionals draw on their tablets as freely as if they were putting pencil to paper .
I tested it out and discovered that despite its simple purpose , the Pencil could not be more complex ; in its attempt to harness the effortless beauty of the elementary writing and drawing instrument , Apple has crafted its own magic wand .
In order to mirror the process of illustration , the Pencil has to interpret the hand of the artist for the computer .
Its job is to digitally replicate the act of drawing itself , which depends on a seamless connection between the hand , the instrument , and the page ( or the screen ) .
If Appleâ€ ™ s Pencil , or any stylus , can really convince the user that there is nothing between the tool in your hand and the mark it makes on your screen , it would be something like magic .
I have to admit , even though I drew these illustrations on an iPad , they do look a lot like real pencil drawings .
But it didnâ€ ™ t feel like drawing with a pencil .
It felt a lot like drawing on an iPad , which is sort of like drawing on a sheet of glass with a piece of plastic while having bright light beamed into your eyes .
Itâ€ ™ s not even the best tool for digital illustration â€ “
thatâ€ ™ s
a Wacom tablet , the gold standard used by professional artists and illustrators .
But that doesnâ€ ™ t mean the Pencil is useless .
For many amateur artists , Wacom is out of reach .
Itâ€ ™ s too expensive and intricate .
Appleâ€ ™ s Pencil , in contrast , is accessible , intuitive and easy to use .
Apple need not be ashamed in coming second behind Wacom in the drawing tablet market .
After all , the Wacom Cintiq Companion ( which is its closest product to the iPad Pro and Pencil ) , retails for even more money than the Apple equivalent , and appeals to a much smaller demographic comprised of professional artists .
I use a Wacom for final art , and would very much like to have a Cintiq Companion or something like it to make working digitally more portable , but I wouldnâ€ ™ t use it for sketching .
For that I guess Iâ€ ™
d prefer the Apple Pencil â€
¦
But you know what is really great for sketching ?
A pencil and a piece of paper .
Itâ€ ™ s effortlessly portable , boasts a lag - time of 0 % , and if you spring for the whole HB range , the shading possibilities are virtually limitless .
Appleâ€ ™ s Pencil is very impressive and precise , but at the end of the day , itâ€ ™ s a secondary tool designed to work with the newest incarnation of one of their most profitable products .
Which brings me to my biggest problem with the Apple Pencil , which isnâ€ ™ t the Pencil at all , itâ€ ™ s the gigantic expensive iPad Pro you need in order to use it .
For me , the iPad Pro is the breaking point in an endless parade of incrementally sized rectangles I need to resist buying .
Looking at my iMac , beside my Macbook , beside my iPad mini , beside my iPhone , I can not bear the thought of saving up to add one more step to this ridiculous Russian - doll collection of Apple products .
Not until , once again , they magically convince me that it is absolutely necessary .
The important caveat to all of this is that , yes , I did draw these illustrations with a loaner iPad Pro and Apple Pencil right out of the box , having never touched one before .
If Appleâ€ ™ s new stylus was not at least close to the responsiveness Iâ€ ™ m used to with my Wacom , this assignment would have been a total disaster .
That said , whenever I think of adding a new digital tool to my arsenal Iâ€ ™ m careful to think about what Iâ€ ™ m trying to replace and why .
Iâ€ ™ m not a luddite , and I donâ€ ™ t
believe in any real hierarchy between traditional and digital artwork .
But for what itâ€ ™ s worth , I donâ€
™ t think man has ever made another tool as humanly responsive as the paintbrush , and maybe never will .
Itâ€ ™ s possible Jobs would agree ."
2016-03-21,"There tends to be something unromantic about fastidiousness : itâ€ ™ s hard to have your breath taken away when youâ€ ™ re counting every one .
Thatâ€ ™ s one of many rules subtly broken by Todd Haynesâ€ ™ s suitably gasp - inducing Carol ( Studiocanal , 15 ) , a love story that loses not a flutter of spontaneous feeling for being constructed with such detail - fixated beauty .
In visualising Patricia Highsmithâ€ ™ s novel
The Price of Salt â€ “ with invaluable prompting from Phyllis Nagyâ€ ™
s
elegantly filleted screenplay
â€ “ Haynes may have just given the cinema its quintessential story of gay self - realisation .
As Rooney Maraâ€ ™ s easily awed city shopgirl falls hard and headlong for Cate Blanchettâ€ ™ s suburban society dame in the velvet - lined repression cooker of 1950s New York , itâ€ ™ s not just sexuality that she discovers , but something even more essential : an unprecedented sense of how to be .
â€œComing of ageâ€ � is a term automatically assigned to adolescent stories , yet it applies to Therese and Carolâ€ ™ s romance too : across generations , both women come to reflect each otherâ€ ™ s knowledge and naivety .
Haynes , meanwhile , has designed the misty whirl of their love to the nth degree , from the faded candy hues of Ed Lachmanâ€ ™ s 16 mm photography to the low , swooning strings of Carter Burwellâ€ ™ s score .
Some have called the film over - aestheticised , yet such reckless beauty ideally matches the perspective of one whose world has blushed into life for the first time .
Carol is a film made with uncanny sensual awareness of what falling in love feels , sounds and tastes like , and so it inspires devotion of its own .
A colder streak of passion runs through Steve Jobs ( Universal , 15 ) ,
Danny Boyleâ€ ™ s clinically symphonic study of the Apple genius , in which the urge to invent â€ “ call it a kind of technolust â€ “ trumps all human desire .
Aaron Sorkinâ€ ™
s
clever , contrived script crams
all the manâ€ ™ s professional triumphs and personal failings into a spinning , whirring , three - act structure built on Jobsâ€ ™ s
key product launches :
1984â€ ™ s
Macintosh , 1990â€
™ s NeXTcube and 1998â€ ™
s iMac .
Michael Fassbender plays Jobs with cool reptilian sinuousness , even as Sorkinâ€ ™ s writing â€ “ for all its technical elan â€ “ struggles to say much about Jobs beyond his being a prodigiously gifted arsehole .
Maybe thatâ€ ™ s the simple truth of it , though after two biopics in three years , I remain unconvinced that he was quite fascinating enough to merit such accomplished scrutiny as this .
Whitey Bulger is a tangier biopic subject .
A murderous blue - collar Boston mob boss turned FBI informant , his is the kind of inverted moral downfall that could be pulled from prime American crime cinema .
Indeed , Scott Cooperâ€ ™ s Black Mass ( Warner , 15 ) deftly emulates Scorseseâ€ ™ s heavily salted sense of local colour and Cadillac - wide underworld outlook , but has little attitude ( and even less humour ) of its own .
Hidden behind husky - dog contacts and balding prosthetics , Johnny Depp is in his favoured dress - up mode as Bulger , albeit to more shivery , passive - aggressive effect than usual .
Heâ€ ™ s in good form , but still somehow loses the film to more spontaneous , less constructed performers , as wild , writhing victims of Bulgerâ€ ™ s influence
Peter Sarsgaard and Juno Temple carry the go - for - broke swagger that Cooperâ€ ™ s film only handsomely imitates .
Katniss Everdeen wouldnâ€ ™ t have feared Whitey Bulger .
By the series - closing sprint of The Hunger Games : Mockingjay Part 2 ( Lionsgate , 12 ) â€ “ which delivers the Capitol - tumbling action teased by the previous entryâ€ ™ s dense political strategising â€ “ she fears very little indeed .
That perhaps has an adverse effect on this fourth filmâ€ ™ s dramatic shape , not that needlessly cleaving Suzanne Collinsâ€ ™ s
concluding novel in two helps in that department .
Still , for its occasional clunkiness of form , what a muscular , idea - rich dystopian adventure this has been , and what paradoxically steel - spined humanity Jennifer Lawrence has given its every chapter .
Has any Pixar blockbuster ever been as swiftly forgotten as The Good Dinosaur ( Disney , PG ) ?
While even Cars 2 lived on in merchandise , the animation titansâ€ ™ square , sentimental prehistoric ramble was overshadowed in its own year by the niftier mechanics of Inside Out .
Its tale of interspecies friendship â€ “ neatly reversed to place humanity in the feral position â€ “ never quite took hold in the public imagination , but maybe itâ€ ™ ll find its place in family living rooms .
There are certainly things to love here , beginning with the verdant , dew - splashed photorealism of the visuals .
The character design is more naive , while the story likewise meshes innocent personal stakes with advanced environmental allegory .
Moving on to matters several stratospheres further out there , Mubi.com has a fascinating premiere on its menu from 25-year - old Canadian experimental film - maker Isiah Medina .
In 88:88 , the passions , frustrations and political preoccupations of Medinaâ€ ™ s digitally inclined generation are projected via a caffeinated collage of material in motion : observational video footage , dramatised sketches , poetry , hip - hop excerpts , all as jagged as if tuned with a radio dial .
Late Godard seems a signal influence here , though Medinaâ€ ™ s essay is one of discovery rather than reflection .
Not all 88:88â€ ™ s thoughts are quite as spiky as their presentation , but itâ€ ™ s quite a rush ."
2016-06-13,"Apple has made a landmark change to its 15-year - old desktop and laptop operating system .
OS X has become macOS Sierra .
The change was announced on stage in San Franciscoâ€ ™ s Bill Graham Civic Auditorium by Appleâ€ ™ s Craig Federighi , ditching the naming scheme devised under the watch of founder Steve Jobs on his return to the company in 1997 .
The OS X nomenclature had reached OS X 10.11 with El Capitan , but Appleâ€ ™ s next version will be simply named macOS Sierra , bringing it in line with the naming convention for its mobile and tablet operating system iOS .
Apart from a name change , Apple has overhauled iTunes and Apple music , while macOS will finally gain full Siri integration , after Appleâ€ ™ s voice assistant was first introduced on iOS with the iPhone 4S in October 2011 .
Siri will be tied into macOSâ€ ™ s notification centre and answer questions , perform actions such as advanced file searches and control devices as it can through an iPhone or iPad .
The digital assistant will scan through usersâ€ ™ messages , calendars and other personal information to identify events , travel plans and other pertinent information displaying it in a manner similar to Googleâ€ ™
s Now .
Apple isnâ€ ™ t the first to bake a voice assistant into a computer .
Microsoftâ€ ™ s
Cortana came built into Windows 10 , performing similar personal information juggling as Siri , while Googleâ€ ™ s
Now voice assistant has been available through Google.com or Chromebooks for years .
MacOS will also gain enhanced Continuity and iCloud drive support - Appleâ€ ™ s system that allows apps on iOS to link directly to the Mac versions using iCloud so that users can start something on one device and continue it on another .
The biggest change will be a proximity - based system called Auto Unlock that allows users to unlock their Mac computers using an Apple Watch , without having to enter in their password .
Googleâ€ ™ s Chromebooks have a similar system using an Android phone .
An update to iCloud Drive will also share files stored on the desktop across Macs and iOS devices , while a new feature called Optimised Storage will remove unnecessary files from computers after theyâ€ ™ ve been backed up which should free up space on existing Macs .
Apple also introduced Apple Pay for the web that allows users to authenticate payments on their Mac via their iPhone or Apple Watch .
Developers will be able to download a prerelease version of macOS today , with a public beta in July before a full release to consumers in September .
Apple WWDC keynote :
key points at a glance iOS 10 : bigger emojis , better Siri and facial recognition coming to your iPhone"
2016-07-05,"Apple will give US users the ability to sign up as organ donors on their iPhones as part of its upcoming iOS 10 update .
The chief executive , Tim Cook , says he hopes the easy sign - up button in the Health app will help ease a longstanding donor shortage in the US .
He said that the problem hit home when Apple co - founder Steve Jobs endured an â€œexcruciatingâ€ � wait for a liver transplant in 2009 .
Jobs died of pancreatic cancer in October 2011 , aged 56 .
Apple is adding the option to enroll in the US national donor registry by tapping a button within the iPhoneâ€ ™ s Health app , which can be used to manage a variety of health and fitness data .
The software will come to all US - based iPhones when the company updates its mobile operating system this autumn .
The move follows action by the US government to attempt to reduce long waiting lists for organ transplants , in which someone is added to the list every 10 minutes and 22 people die while waiting for life - saving transplants every day .
One initiative will see greater automation in the donor and matching service , and increased connectivity with transplant centres , which it is hoped will speed up the matching process to get donor organs to more patients in less time .
Almost $ 200 m ( Â£150 m ) has also been allocated for research into next - generation manufacturing techniques for tissue creation and repair , which could result in organ replacement .
Apple is not the only technology company that has pledged to aid in driving organ donor registration .
Facebook , Google and Twitter have also pledged support to develop new tools and public advocacy campaigns ."
2016-07-22,"Before he actually saw one , Steve Jobs was reported by Time magazine to have said the Segway could be â€œas big a deal as the PCâ€ � .
John Doerr , the venture capitalist behind Netscape and Amazon , reckoned they could be â€œbigger than the internetâ€ � .
In the 15 or so years that have elapsed since , neither prediction has quite come true ( and to be fair , Jobs withdrew his almost as soon as it was made , saying on first sight of the two - wheeled , self - balancing personal transporter : â€œI think it sucks.â€ � )
But there is one field where the Segway has now become so popular that it risks getting too big for its own good : the guided city tour .
With groups of tourists trundling invasively and not always competently along crowded city - centre streets from Stockholm to Naples and Kiev to Dublin , the municipal councils of both Prague and Barcelona this month decided enough was enough and slapped partial bans on the gyroscopic scooters .
â€œWe received countless complaints , and decided to satisfy both residents and even some tourists , â€ � said Adriana Krnacova , the mayor of the Czech capital , which was visited by more than 6.6 million holidaymakers last year .
Announcing a complete ban on the battery - powered machines from the historic city centre starting in August , the council said Segways â€ “ permitted until now on both roads and pavements in Prague â€
“ had become so numerous that a serious accident was only a matter of time .
A Segway tour operator , Jaroslav Endrst , has protested in vain that the industry was being â€œbulliedâ€ � , that most tour companies obeyed the law , and that any issues were down to the policeâ€ ™ s â€œinability or unwillingness to enforce itâ€ � .
Three hundred jobs were at stake , he said .
But in Barcelona , the cityâ€ ™ s mobility councillor , Mercedes Vidal , said the Catalan capital â€ “ which welcomes 27 million tourists a year on top of a resident population density three times greater than Londonâ€ ™ s â€ “ was facing similar problems .
â€œBarcelona has too much pressure on its public spaces , â€ �
Vidal said , â€œand technology has advanced more quickly than regulations.â€ �
Faced with seven different companies offering Segway tours , the city has introduced a provisional summer ban on the machines from its most congested area , the waterfront .
According to SegwayGuidedTours , an online directory â€ “ as the name suggests â€ “ of Segway guided tours , 427 cities and other venues in 56 countries around the world now offer a total of 622 Segway tours .
More than half are in the US , where the Segway was first unveiled by its inventor , Dean Kamen , in 2001 , with Florida and California alone offering more than 50 excursions each .
In Europe , enthusiasts have have 44 options in Spain and 18 each in France and Britain .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a great way to see a city , â€ � said Massimo Ferrara , a guide with one of the dozen agencies offering Segway tours
â€ “ typically lasting two to three hours â€ “ in Rome .
â€œItâ€
™
s fun
to ride a Segway anyway , and you see way more than you would on foot .
If you get tired of walking or bored with sights , itâ€ ™ s perfect.â€ � Cities and countries differ in their regulatory approach to the Segway , whose greatest claims to fame thus far have tended to be accidents involving well - known people : when a Segway - riding TV cameraman knocked Usain Bolt off his feet in 2015 , for example ; when George W Bush fell off one in 2003 ; or â€ “ more tragically â€ “ when Jimi Heselden , the Yorkshire businessman who had only recently bought the company , reversed his over a cliff and and died in 2010 .
In some countries , including France , they are treated like pedestrians , so allowed on the pavement .
In others , the law views them as both pedestrians and bicycles , permitting them â€ “ in Italy , for example â€ “ to use bike paths and public streets as well .
Germany allows them on the road in built - up areas , but requires a permit for pavement use .
Visitors looking for a Segway tour in London or any other British city , however , will be disappointed ( although tours of woods and parkland are readily available in several places around the country ) .
Thatâ€ ™ s because it is the view of the Department for Transport that Segways are motor vehicles , and therefore not allowed on pavements under the 1835 Highways Act , which says people can not use the footway to â€œlead or drive any horse , ass , sheep , mule , swine , or cattle or carriage of any descriptionâ€ � .
Unfortunately , since using a motor vehicle on the road requires the user to be licensed and insured , and the vehicle to be road - legal as regards lights , brakes and registration plates , Segways are not permitted on UK highways either , in effect making them off - road vehicles .
In 2011 , a Barnsley man , Philip Coates , was fined Â£75 for riding his Segway on the pavement â€ “ despite the support of the former Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Opik , who arrived at court on a Segway in solidarity .
The prospect of posses of Segway - mounted tourists wobbling down the Mall or across Tower Bridge is , for the time being at least , some way off ."

2016-08-26,"Barbra Streisand has revealed she once called the Apple co - founder , Steve Jobs , to ask him for IT advice for her computer .
The US singer told Good Morning Britain : â€œI couldnâ€ ™ t figure out something on my computer and nobody could figure it out , no IT guy , so I said ; â€˜Can you get Steve Jobs on the phone?â€ ™ â€œSure enough
, I asked him about this problem and he couldnâ€
™ t figure it out .
He gave me his IT guy , who also couldnâ€ ™ t figure out .
That was funny.â€
�
Calling Appleâ€ ™ s CEOs seems to be a regular occurrence for the singer .
This week she revealed she recently called Jobsâ€ ™ successor , Tim Cook , to complain about Siri .
She told him Appleâ€ ™ s personal assistant kept pronouncing her name incorrectly .
Streisand told NPR that Siri â€œpronounces my name wrongâ€ � .
She said , it should be â€œStreisand with a soft s , like sand on the beach .
Iâ€ ™ ve been saying this for my whole career .
â€œAnd
so what did I do ?
I called the head of Apple , Tim Cook , and he delightfully agreed to have Siri change the pronunciation of my name , finally , with the next update on 30 September .
So letâ€ ™ s see if that happens because I will be thrilled.â€ �
Streisand is as famous not only for her singing and acting career but as the creator of the Streisand effect .
Barbra Streisand calls Tim Cook to fix Siriâ€ ™ s mispronunciation of her name"
2016-09-04,"Dan Lyons is the former Forbes magazine senior editor who found online fame as the writer behind the parodic Fake Steve Jobs blog .
When he lost his job at Newsweek in 2013 , he decided to join Boston tech startup HubSpot as a â€œmarketing fellowâ€ � .
It didnâ€ ™ t end well , and Lyons has now written a book about the experience called Disrupted : Ludicrous Misadventures in the Tech Start - Up Bubble .
He has also been a writer on satirical sitcom Silicon Valley .
As a tech journalist , startups werenâ€ ™ t an entirely new world to you .
But were you taken by surprise ?
It was a big revelation .
I had a lot of ideas about what it would be like .
They turned out to be wrong or incomplete .
One big thing , for example : I always thought that when these tech guys go on about changing the world and making it a better place that once us reporters went home and they were on their own they sort of laughed .
That they were cynical and it was bullshit .
I didnâ€
™ t expect that there were people who really believed that stuff .
I was really taken aback by that .
I thought , I can do that fake changing the world shit .
I can do that marketing song and dance , I know the racket .
But I was shocked by that â€ “ that people had really drunk the Kool - Aid .
One point you make in your book is that the financial structure of startups is less about creating new products than shifting money to a few fortunate individuals .
Was that a shock ?
You think Iâ€ ™ d have known that beforehand .
I think Iâ€ ™ d never seen it that clearly .
It was a revelation to me that to some of these guys , the companies were secondary to extracting money .
The companies were just vehicles to achieve that .
Is it a concern in the States that people are able to make hundreds of millions of dollars from unprofitable companies ?
I think it might be in this yearâ€ ™ s presidential election , among the Bernie Sanders crowd .
In Silicon Valley , bringing that up is seen as stupid and naive .
They say I just donâ€ ™ t understand how it works .
Now there is a little bit of reality setting in .
You see companies are trying to demonstrate that they can make a profit , but thereâ€ ™ s still a big part of Silicon Valley that thinks thatâ€ ™ s a stupid idea â€ “ to make money .
I donâ€
™ t think thereâ€ ™ s been a big debate about it .
The word â€œbubbleâ€ � is in your subtitle .
Do you think there is a bubble and that itâ€ ™ s set to burst ?
I do think weâ€ ™ re in a bubble in terms of valuation .
There is this expression on Wall Street : â€œThe market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.â€ �
Itâ€ ™ s been on the edge of popping for so long , now I donâ€ ™ t even know .
If you look at markets they typically revert to a historical mean .
The double meaning of the bubble for me is not just a financial bubble but a psychological bubble .
People in startup - land live inside it .
They see themselves as really good people even when theyâ€ ™ re doing something thatâ€ ™ s very bad .
Thereâ€ ™ s a huge disconnect from reality in the tech world .
Have you any feedback from HubSpot on the book ?
I personally directly havenâ€ ™ t
but they wrote a response to the book called Undisrupted , published the week after the book came out .
It was a long essay about why it was not true or Iâ€ ™ d got things wrong .
I havenâ€
™ t heard anything directly .
I wouldnâ€ ™ t expect to .
One senior HubSpot executive was sacked and another resigned after allegedly trying to get a draft manuscript of your book before publication .
Do you think you were a threat to the companyâ€ ™ s share price ?
I could see that they would worry about that , that it might hurt their share price .
I donâ€
™ t think what they did was the appropriate way to respond to that .
Pretty nasty stuff .
I could see them worrying that it might hurt the share price , but it certainly hasnâ€ ™ t hurt the share price .
I donâ€
™ t think that itâ€ ™ s hurt them at all .
And it wasnâ€ ™ t the intent .
I was trying to write a book about me and personal invention and the craziness of the startup world .
Thereâ€ ™ s a lot of anger in the book .
Was it cathartic writing it ?
I think it was very cathartic .
There was part of me that thought I should just shut up about this and just move on , but I thought it was such a crazy world and someone needs to call bullshit on a lot of this stuff .
It was cathartic to say if Iâ€ ™ m going to do this I might as well say what Iâ€ ™ m thinking .
You examine the question of ageism â€ “ how rare it is for someone to be over 40 in a startup ?
Could it be argued that only younger people understand this new culture ?
Maybe thereâ€ ™ s a tiny bit of legitimacy to it , but I think the real motivation is saving money .
They hire young people because itâ€ ™ s cheap labour , and you throw them out after a couple of years without any equity .
Thatâ€ ™ s the racket .
I wanted to write a book about what itâ€ ™ s like to be 50 and trying to reinvent yourself â€ “ that struggle .
There are all these books and inspirational speakers talking about being a lifelong learner and itâ€ ™ s so great to reinvent yourself , the brand of you .
And I wanted to say , you know , itâ€ ™ s not like that .
Itâ€ ™ s actually really painful .
It takes you to some places youâ€ ™ d rather not go and you confront things about yourself youâ€ ™ d rather not think about or admit to .
It was a really unpleasant experience .
A big part of it is being forced to confront my own mortality .
Iâ€ ™ d never felt old before .
How useful was the experience for your work as a writer on Silicon Valley ?
Well a little bit , but not a huge amount .
My role on Silicon Valley was so small that I didnâ€ ™ t have a lot of influence anyway in the show .
There are four guys who really write that show and run that show and then six or eight hanging out in a room kicking in a few bits .
I kicked in a few things from my experience .
Some of it made its way into the show .
The company in the show isnâ€ ™ t anything like HubSpot .
I keep hoping the show will evolve into being in an office with a kindergarten culture and all .
But I think the guys who run that show are committed to keeping them in the house for ever .
Are you going to continue writing on it ?
No .
I didnâ€
™ t go back this year and Iâ€ ™ m in the midst of trying to develop a comedy based on Disrupted but more about the family .
Itâ€ ™ s very frustrating to be the little guy sitting at the end of the table .
Itâ€ ™ s fun and cool and youâ€ ™ re in Hollywood on a fancy studio lot and all that .
But being a staffer on someoneâ€ ™ s show is less scintillating that you might imagine .
Did you ever think that if startup companies read this book , there were things they could learn from it ?
I was hoping that there would be a corrective and people might say that this age bias is not good and we should think about doing things differently .
I think the issues around diversity of all kinds are really a huge problem in the startup world .
I was hoping that .
At the same time I donâ€ ™ t think any of them listen .
Was there anything you enjoyed about the startup world and think other companies might learn something from ?
Thereâ€ ™ s a lot of energy and a lot of fun .
There is this sense in places like HubSpot that we can do anything .
Thereâ€ ™ s a mindset at old incumbent places where a lot of people are ready to say : â€œThat wonâ€ ™ t work.â€ �
In the world of startups , partly out of being naive , there are people who say â€œletâ€ ™
s try itâ€
�
â€ “
they have openness to new ideas .
Part of that is from hiring young people and giving them responsibility .
The whole idea of having ping - pong tables is kind of cool .
There are definitely things other companies can take from that world .
I just think you need to choose selectively .

2016-09-07,"Apple is about to launch a new iPhone .
I remember when , under Steve Jobs , the arrival of a new iPhone was a breathless and secretive affair , as though Willy Wonka himself was emerging from his factory and making impossible claims of his improbable technology .
And if the iPhone didnâ€ ™ t quite live up â€
“ if it took years to get copying and pasting , or if Siri was basically a party trick â€ “
no one minded so much , because Jobs was the tech universe version of the late Gene Wilder , giving an idiosyncratic performance nobody can explain or match .
How far weâ€ ™ ve fallen .
Iâ€ ™ m writing this the night before the iPhone 7 unveiling , and I know nothing will surprise us .
You heard it here first : the new iPhone will look and act almost exactly like the current iPhone to any normal person .
It will probably be a little faster , come in a new color choice , and be absolutely boring .
This time the big killer feature , apparently , is that thereâ€ ™ s no headphone port .
How fantastic â€ “ I have been looking for an opportunity to throw away all my headphones and buy new ones directly from Apple .
I canâ€
™ t wait to watch Tim Cook ploddingly explain how much better everything will be in the new version .
I love listening to Cook because when you look in his eyes you can tell he knows
heâ€
™ s a second - string community theater actor trying desperately to speak fancy words he learned by rote , following in the footsteps of the man who had the job before he did , Sir Laurence Goddamn Olivier .
This is the new Apple .
Not because Jobs wouldnâ€ ™ t have cut the headphone port if he could â€ “
he loved that move ; he practically invented it .
Itâ€ ™ s just that the only reason Apple knows it can pull it off now is brute force and thuggery .
We are locked into its ecosystem .
What used to take some magic and pizzazz , some dreams of a better future , is now just keeping up appearances .
This new Apple is reflected in the companyâ€ ™ s current tax fiasco , a situation that sounds more like something fly - by - night scam artists would get caught doing than the Apple we think we remember .
Through a scheme literally called the â€œDouble
Irishâ€ � , a company can create two Irish subsidiary companies , and the first Irish company ( usually in the Cayman Islands ) licenses everything to a second Irish company , the upshot being that the mothership is not considered a tax resident anywhere thanks to differences between the US and Irish definitions of residence .
The result of all this is that Apple had a â€œhead officeâ€ � in Ireland with no premises , no employees and no real activities .
But because they had pulled the Double Irish , the European commission has ruled , Apple deprived the EU of $ 14.5bn over the last 10 years .
The EU ordered Apple to pay the taxes with interest at the end of August , a decision whose logic the company refutes .
This is hardly surprising : Apple is a massive multinational , and behaves like one despite its sanitized image .
It has a long track record of looking the other way on suppliersâ€ ™ human rights abuses , documented by the New York Times and other outlets .
And it pays a tax rate lower than that of 99.99 % of the human beings reading this story right now
â€ “
and they clearly work harder at that profit margin and squeezing their supply chain now than they do on their actual technology .
And in the last few years it is beginning to show .
You shouldnâ€ ™ t buy a new iPhone because it wonâ€ ™ t be appreciably better than what youâ€ ™ re using now .
You shouldnâ€ ™ t buy a new iPhone because it wonâ€ ™ t have a headphone port for no user benefit other than to maximize corporate profits .
You shouldnâ€ ™ t buy a new iPhone now because Apple could easily pay the tax judgment they owe , and they refuse to do so .
You shouldnâ€ ™ t buy a new iPhone because Steve Jobs wouldnâ€ ™ t have wanted you to reward mediocrity ."
2016-09-07,"The Apple event that saw the unveiling of the iPhone 7 and AirPods opened with a short film of CEO Tim Cook in a Carpool Karaoke session with Late Late Show host James Corden .
It was just about as awkward as it sounds .
The video of Corden escorting Cook to the event in San Francisco , opens with the pair belting OneRepublicâ€ ™ s I Lived , which includes the lyric : â€œHope when the crowd screams out , theyâ€ ™ re screaming your name.â€ �
Not to read too much into the choice , but is it a stretch to imagine this particular sentiment resonating with Cook , who is not and never will be Steve Jobs ?
I mean , heâ€ ™ s literally about to take the stage at an Apple product launch , and just last year there was an entire film dedicated to scenes of crowds rapturously greeting Steve Jobs as he took the stage at product launches .
After the pair engage in some banter and messing about with Siri , the singer - songwriter - producer Pharrell Williams hops into the backseat , and the trio break into Lynyrd Skynyrdâ€ ™ s 1974 hit Sweet Home Alabama .
Cook hails from Mobile , Alabama , which might explain the song choice â€ “ or could there be another element at work here ?
Lynyrd Skynrd wrote the song as a something between a response to and attack on Neil Young , who in recent years has become more and more devoted to the development of the Pono , a portable digital media and music player that Young would very much like you to believe is a competitor to Appleâ€ ™ s various products .
Is Cook throwing shade ?
The video is the most fun youâ€ ™ ll have watching an ageing CEO strain to appear good - natured all day , assuming that the remainder of your day doesnâ€ ™ t somehow involve finding yourself in Elon Muskâ€ ™ s office as he realizes that someone has moved the blotter on his desk a quarter - inch to the left ."
2016-09-19,"Silicon Valley , with its roots in a counter - culture of dreamy cyber - gurus and anti - establishment hackers , has always thought itself different .
As Steve Jobs put it , they are â€œthe crazy ones , the misfits , the rebels , the troublemakers , the round pegs in square holesâ€ � .
Unlike Wall St , so the press releases said , they did no evil .
For nations looking to replicate the success of the Valley , the question has long been asked : why donâ€ ™ t we have a Google , an Apple or a Facebook .
It was asked again on BBCâ€ ™ s flagship Today programme this morning .
The question is a good one .
To some the answer is money â€ “
thereâ€
™ s a lack of patient , long - term capital in the City â€ “ and entrepreneurial culture , a lack of â€œcrazy onesâ€ � .
Public money , in the form of defence spending and top - class research universities , made Silicon Valley .
The advent of the personal computer as a tool for individual liberation introduced a culture of ethical egotism .
With the arrival of social media , digital technology now considers itself a force for global good .
It helps that science feels like a religion with a priesthood whose canonical texts can not be easily understood by policymakers .
Little wonder information technology has become one of the western worldâ€ ™ s most lightly regulated industries .
The result is ruthless , red - in - tooth - and - claw capitalism .
Many of the tech revolutionaries have simply invented new ways to extract huge profits by unregulated means .
Despite the rhetoric of competition and markets , the ultimate aim of the tech evangelists is often to create monopolies which are the quickest ways to profit .
Free social tools are concentrating wealth in the hands of a few programmers and investors .
In search , thatâ€ ™ s Google ( revenues $ 75bn ) .
In social media , thatâ€ ™ s Facebook ( 1.65 billion users , sales $ 5bn ) .
In online retail itâ€ ™ s Amazon ( last quarter profits of almost $ 900 m ) .
Politicians donâ€ ™ t want to end up defending the past .
But they need to regulate global giants in the national interest .
Last year when Britainâ€ ™ s Conservative - led coalition lifted the restriction on homeowners letting out their property for less than three months , it was supposed to benefit the â€œsharing economyâ€ � .
Instead , the big winner is Airbnb , the room booking app , which appears to be benefiting as flats get taken off the market to cater for high - paying short lets .
This keeps prices high and makes it harder for low- and middle - income residents to live there .
Despite claiming to reinvent travel , the secret behind Uber , the tax - hailing app , is that it circumvents local rules around safety and insurance .
London mayor Sadiq Khanâ€ ™ s plans to regulate the firmâ€ ™ s drivers is a good step to privatise costs the app sought to socialise .
Uberâ€ ™
s
use of customer data is instructive .
It knows a person is more willing to accept higher or â€œsurgeâ€
� prices when their phone is about to run out of battery â€ “ but says it doesnâ€ ™ t use this information to charge higher prices .
We have no way of checking that .
Uber , like other algorithm - driven firms , should be asked to reveal such practices , something that the government could look at during the passage of the digital economy bill .
Today , an algorithm is increasingly likely to be your boss or tell you what to read .
We should not be creating companies that ruthlessly exploit consumers and workers .
Big data that sorts us into piles of â€œworthyâ€ � and â€œunworthyâ€ � needs to be transparent .
We donâ€ ™ t need Silicon Valley ; we need responsible capitalism ."
2016-09-24,"Even on a midweek morning , the line for Alâ€ ™ s Breakfast , a 10-foot - wide , 66-year - old establishment in the Dinkytown neighbourhood of Minneapolis , runs all the way out of the door .
At the back of the queue stands Justin Vernon , sweltering in the heat and sharing his latest preoccupations : the wonder that Apple once sacked Steve Jobs ; the exceptional difficulty of ever pinning James Blake down to a precise meeting time and place ; and the lessons of Idiocracy , Mike Judgeâ€ ™ s uncomfortably prophetic film satire in which celebrity culture and anti - intellectualism are rife and a blustering dunderhead has been elected president .
Twenty minutes later , seated at the counter , Vernon takes a sip of coffee and exhales .
â€œIf I stop doing the music thing , I could see myself doing something like this , man ,
â€ � he says , taking in the room : the 14 seats , the waitresses filling cups , the sound of Fall Out Boy on the stereo .
â€œOpen a small breakfast joint , play the music I want , maybe have shows in it at night ; people could drink whiskey .
That sounds like my dream.â€ �
Itâ€ ™ s a steady , contemplative Vernon I meet today ; a different artist to the one who emerged wide - eyed in 2008 under the guise of Bon Iver to release For Emma , Forever Ago .
It was the album that redefined the breakup record with its sparse , desolate songs and unleashed a hundred cabin - folk falsetto imitators in its wake .
Much has changed in the years since .
There have been the worldwide tours ; the synth- and sax - heavy follow - up album ; the collaborations with Kanye West and James Blake ; the production work with groups such as the Staves ; the Grammy awards ; the side projects ; the Eaux Claires festival he founded two years ago in his hometown of Wisconsin .
And there has been the kind of intense and overwhelming success that means that today the waitress will lean across the counter to tell him , sweetly , how much she and her mother love his music .
But there has also been uncertainty .
This month , he releases his third Bon Iver album , 22 , A Million .
That there should even be a third album at all is something of a surprise : four years ago , Vernon announced that he was walking away from the Bon Iver project for the foreseeable future .
â€œI had mental stuff , stuff I felt needed healing ,
â€ � he explains now .
â€œAnd as morose or self - involved as it is , I felt that the only thing I could do was to go into myself a little bit.â€ �
In fact , even at the start of this year he came close to quitting this album ; it was by his account
â€œa gruelling process to figure outâ€ � .
He was plagued by panic attacks and anxiety , and battling the feeling that â€œI had this huge idea
and I didnâ€ ™ t have the wherewithal to go through with itâ€ � .
Part of Vernonâ€ ™ s discombobulation stemmed from the experience of being in the spotlight .
â€œHaving people asking to get their picture taken when youâ€ ™ re just trying to get eggs and not having a good day , â€ � he says .
â€œThere are times when itâ€ ™ s just a nuisance , and there are times when it makes me panic .
There are people who are straight - up into being famous .
And I donâ€ ™ t like that .
I think thatâ€ ™ s why I had to take a long break.â€
�
The break itself , however , did not go particularly well .
â€œI decided this was the time to go hang out in Europe and travel , â€ � he says .
â€œAnd so I went to [ the Greek island of ] Santorini .
But Iâ€ ™ m a horrible planner
, so I went in off - season and thereâ€ ™ s no restaurants open and
thereâ€ ™ s nobody there .
And so I just feel pulverised : dealing with some unrequited love situation - slash - just knowing that that isnâ€ ™ t even the issue , Iâ€ ™ m the issue , I need to get my shit straight.â€ � Walking around the island for the fifth day in a row , Vernon experienced his first panic attack .
â€œIt was like : â€˜Oh my god , my chest is caving in , what the fuck is going on?â€ ™ â€ � he recalls .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t like talking about it , but I feel itâ€ ™ s important to talk about it , so that other people who experience it donâ€ ™ t feel itâ€ ™ s just happening to them.â€ �
The anxiety continued even after he returned home , saw a doctor , and began treatment for depression .
â€œIt was not good , â€ �
he says simply .
â€œIt was bad , bad , bad and then really bad , for a long time .
Iâ€ ™
d say I was having very bad days for about a year and a half.â€
�
Still , it was during the period he calls â€œthe European horriblenessâ€ � that he began writing this album .
â€œI kept moving hotels because I was , like :
â€˜Well , this is completely depressing , Iâ€ ™ d better go to a different place.â€ ™ â€
�
Then he was hit by a line â€ “ â€œIt might be over soonâ€ � â€ “ that would become the backbone of the opening track , 22 .
â€œI
just kind of hummed that to myself , â€ � he recalls .
â€œI had a little sampler with me , and I got back to this weird hotel room , and I just sat there and chopped it up .
And I had this rare moment of : â€˜This is a good thingâ€ ™ , where you create something.â€
�
It became apparent to Vernon along the way that in his willingness to play shows , promote records , produce and champion other artists , he had somehow neglected his own creative needs .
The person who reminded him of the importance of looking after himself ?
One Mr Kanye West .
â€œKanye speaks of how you have to love yourself .
And believe in yourself , â€ � says Vernon . â€œI heard him say something recently :
â€˜I love myself so other people can love themselves.â€ ™
So they get up in the morning and put on a song and be like â€˜FUCK YEAHâ€ ™ .
And that is what itâ€ ™ s for.â€ �
In 22 , A Million , thereâ€ ™ s also a sense of Kanyeâ€ ™ s willingness to defy expectation and , if necessary , alienate his audience .
For those who still consider Bon Iver to be the sound of a man lovelorn in a Midwestern winter , this album might prove rather confounding .
There are the song names themselves : instantly tattooable jumbles of symbols and words such as 10 d E A T h b R E a s T and 21 Mâ
™ ¦ â ™ ¦ N WATER that read like a mingling of punk logos and EE Cummings poetry .
Then there are the unexpected musical directions : attempts to distill difficult emotions into sound , through distortion and the strange collision of instrumentation and voice , such as the track _ _ _ _ 45 _ _ _ _ _ in which the saxophonist Mike Lewis duets with Vernon on a saxophone vocoder .
It felt , says Vernon , like â€œa conversation , like an instrument that only two people can playâ€ � ; one that explored many of the albumâ€ ™ s
themes : â€œItâ€ ™ s sorrow and pain explaining joy , and family , and fear of death , and love.â€
�
If the isolated , acoustic , woodsman sound of his first record began to shift on his second album , this time it has given way further to digital manipulation : voices slowed down , sped up , words mushed and buried beneath scuffling synths , dolorous sax , the sense that sound is being layered , twisted and contorted , its rhythm frequently more urban than pastoral .
But what it shares with previous Bon Iver records â€ “ indeed with all Vernonâ€ ™ s projects â€ “ is a profound tenderness .
More than anything , 22 , A Million is about Vernon getting lost , both mentally and physically .
He is laying to rest two decades of searching for self - understanding , and letting go of the deep connections to place â€ “ particularly the idea of home and belonging â€ “ he explored on the previous two albums .
â€œAs much as I love that I made it so sacred
, I feel like the places are behind me , â€ �
he says .
â€œI know that the most important thing is you belong to folks.â€
�
Thereâ€ ™ s a line at the end of the final track of the first Bon Iver album that perhaps encapsulates the sentiment best
â€ “ sung , then , about moving on from lost love , it rings just as true for this new phase of his career : â€œThis is not the sound of a new man , or crispy realisation , â€ � he sings .
â€œItâ€ ™ s the sound of the unlocking and the lift away .
We take a drive through one of Minneapolisâ€ ™ s more affluent neighbourhoods near where he owns an apartment , to the Lake of the Isles .
In the driverâ€ ™ s seat Vernon lights up a cigarette , winds the windows down , puts on the Waylon Jennings track
Are You
Sure Hank Done
It This Way .
Itâ€ ™ s an important song for him , as Jennings questioned the way the country music industry had become so in thrall to glitz and celebrity .
Forty years later , Vernon finds himself asking similar questions about the way the music industry operates and heâ€ ™ s started to explore other ways to be a working , touring musician without succumbing to the pressures that sent him so off - kilter .
On the last Bon Iver tour he compiled a dossier of all the things he didnâ€ ™ t want to do again .
He reels some of them off : â€œPlaying a lot of shows , realising that playing shows for Live Nation is just bullshit and fuck that .
I grew up loving bands like the Indigo Girls , and they stood for something , doing benefit shows and talking about shit and changing culture or changing peopleâ€ ™ s mindsets and raising awareness .
Whatâ€ ™ s music for ?
Itâ€ ™ s not about having a bunch of CDs.â€
�
He also decided against doing many interviews , choosing instead to hold a press conference because â€œwhy not have fun with this shit?â€ �
And that there would be absolutely no photoshoots showing Vernonâ€ ™ s face in full .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve played the game enough , and next time I probably wonâ€ ™ t do photos at all , â€ � he says .
â€œThe more years that go by where thereâ€ ™ s no pictures of me , the more that will happen .
Itâ€ ™ s my self - preservation thing.â€
�
Touring will be different this time , too .
He speaks of wanting to capture â€œthe vitalness , the necessity of a performanceâ€ � , of â€œplaying places with a street set - up , a truck with a generator so we can play right
thereâ€
¦
So
itâ€ ™ s not just a money - grabbing exercise.â€

Already there is the week - long 80-artist collaborative residency in Berlin , followed by a two - day festival , which he has co - organised with Ryan Olson of Gayngs and Bryce and Aaron Dessner of the National .
He also has a hankering to go to Roslyn , Washington , where his favourite TV series Northern Exposure was filmed , â€œto go fishing and meet some people who hopefully never heard of us and say â€˜Hey , weâ€ ™ re coming into town and
weâ€ ™ re going to play in the community centre , five bucks , and weâ€ ™ re giving the money to the local shelterâ€ ¦ â€
™ â€ �
The big idea , he says , is to break both artistsâ€ ™ and music fansâ€ ™ expectation of a record release , touring cycle , stadium shows , promotion .
Vernon is not alone in this ambition : consider this yearâ€ ™ s Frank Ocean and BeyoncÃ © albums , sent out into the world without the usual flurry of interviews and polished promotional activity .
Musically , this circumnavigates the media juggernaut and renders the relationship between artist and record - buyer more direct .
Yet simultaneously the artists can become more remote figures .
We know fewer details about their lives , their motivations , the stories behind their songs .
For those artists accustomed to the strange quarantine of megastardom , this transition is perhaps not so challenging .
But in the case of a musician such as Vernon , famed for his emotional depth and authenticity , will fans understand the new sense of detachment ?
â€œHopefully , people will understand that I will come and play for you , I will get to you , eventually , in your city , but when I get there hopefully we will play something more special , we wonâ€ ™ t just play some gig , weâ€ ™ ll have thought about it .
We wonâ€ ™ t
just be â€˜Hello Cleveland - ing!â€ ™ through our lives.â€

This isnâ€ ™ t , he stresses , about ego , nor is it an exercise in rock star worthiness .
Rather , itâ€ ™ s about wanting to halt the idiocracy .
â€œYou can never be self - righteous , but itâ€ ™ s okay to be a little righteous ,
â€ � he says .
â€œYou have to believe in something .
Like , Iâ€ ™ d prefer BeyoncÃ
© didnâ€

Do not take two million dollars from Pepsi and be a role model for young girls .
Do not do that .
That stuff does anger me .
And I feel like I am not afraid to talk about that stuff.â€
�
We need people to speak out , he suggests , or otherwise weâ€ ™ ll find a blustering dunderhead in the White House and an idiocracy in full sail .
â€œIt is the reversal of mental aptitude , â€ � he says .

, A Million is out on Friday ; Bon Iver tours the UK from 10 Feb"
2016-10-05,"It was five years ago today that Steve Jobs , the co - founder and CEO of Apple , died after a long struggle with pancreatic cancer .
His death , at 56 , came a few months after stepping down from his role at the company , handing over the reins to Tim Cook , his collaborator and such a close longtime friend that he offered Jobs a portion of his liver .
Since then , Appleâ€ ™ s value has grown from $ 50bn to more than $ 600bn , if down a little from its peak of $ 775bn in February 2015 .
Despite such enormous growth , it has been hard for Cook to step out of the shadow of the charismatic Apple co - founder . â€œI really want [ Jobsâ€ ™ ] legacy to be with Apple 10 years from now , a hundred years from now , a thousand years from now , â€ �
Cook said at an event in Utah in September .
â€œNot for Apple to be constrained by it .
Weâ€
™ re not thinking , â€˜what would Steve do?â€ ™ Weâ€ ™ re not thinking that .
But weâ€ ™ re very much married to his vision of making the best products.â€ �
That hasnâ€ ™ t stopped every other Tom , Dick or Harry from persistently questioning the companyâ€ ™ s decisions post - Jobs , trying to glean some insights from his management style to apply to their own business or attempting to cash in on his name .
This is Steve Jobsâ€ ™ legacy .
Jobs is still the most interesting tech CEO ( according to Google )
Steve Jobs may be gone but heâ€ ™ s not forgotten .
The mythology around the man is so strong that even five years after his death he still dominates online discussion , more popular than Cook , the Tesla and SpaceX CEO , Elon Musk , Facebookâ€ ™ s CEO , Mark Zuckerberg , and the Microsoft founder , Bill Gatesâ€ “ according to Google Trends .
No matter what Apple does , Steve will be â€˜rolling in his graveâ€ ™ ( according to media )
Itâ€ ™ s a common line in media commentary about Apple that poor old Steve must be spinning in his unmarked Palo Alto burial site .
Some of the things that have contributed to such postmortem rotation include : the acquisition of Beats , the iPad Proâ€ ™ s stylus , the tiny queue at a Danish Apple Store , a tax advert on Apple.com , the launch of Microsoftâ€ ™ s Surface laptop and Donald Trump saying so .
Even though he didnâ€
™ t always make the best decisions Steveâ€ ™ s legacy as a grand visionary is viewed through rose - tinted goggles .
Yes , he launched category - defining products , but he also released a bunch of not so category - defining ones including the Apple Lisa , NeXT , the 2000 Power Mac G4 Cube and The Apple III .
Even some of the great products came with embarrassing flaws .
Letâ€ ™ s not forget that the iPhone 4â€ ™ s signal drop when people held it in a certain way .
Steve Jobsâ€ ™ advice to customers ?
â€œJust avoid holding it in that
way.â€ �
Eventually the company caved and offered free smartphone cases to mitigate the problem .
Jobsâ€ ™ worst decision of all ?
Choosing the now legendary uniform of mom jeans and a black turtleneck was questionable , but publicly denying paternity of his daughter â€ “ as immortalised in Aaron Sorkinâ€ ™ s eponymous film
â€ “ was the lowest point .
Thereâ€ ™ s no end to people promising to help you be like Steve Whether itâ€ ™ s 22 pieces of advice , 12 ways or 3 ways ,
thereâ€ ™ s a lot of people and companies claiming they can help you be more like Steve Jobs .
Nuggets of insight such as â€œbe revolutionaryâ€ � ( no big deal ) , â€œbeware the â€˜corporate antibodiesâ€ ™ â€ � (whatever the hell that means ) and â€œconnect things in new and different waysâ€ � ( why didnâ€ ™ t
I think of that ? )
highlight the long tail of corporate guff that wafts in Jobsâ€ ™ wake .
One thing we can all agree on is this :
Steve Jobs didnâ€
™ t hone his genius by reading listicles .
But that doesnâ€ ™ t stop wannabe tech billionaires obsessing about doing it the Jobsian way .
Creepy Steve Jobs memorabilia lives on â€œI need a VHS tape of Steve Jobsâ€ ™ presentation from Macworld in 1999,â€ � said nobody , ever .
That hasnâ€ ™ t stopped someone from trying to flog one on eBay for a mere $ 999 .
Elsewhere on the auction site , you can pick up a 12-inch Steve Jobs action figure that falls squarely into the Uncanny Valley â€ “ a snip at $ 1,199 .
If a grand doesnâ€ ™ t seem like a colossal enough waste of money , you can pick up a pair of business cards from Apple co - founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak for $ 3,000 .
Then thereâ€ ™ s the â€œartâ€ � , such as portraits made out of 1,000 pieces of chewing gum or 3,750 actual apples .
Or Russian Steve Jobs nesting dolls , featuring the technology pioneer through the ages .
Perhaps the most tenuous link of them all comes in the shape of a T - shirt featuring Jobs as a Minion ( from Despicable Me ) alongside an iPhone 5 with a banana icon on the screen .
Thereâ€ ™ s even a matching colour - changing mug .
Itâ€ ™ s what he would have wanted ."
2016-10-07,"If most of the UKâ€ ™ s startups are being led by people described in the Guardianâ€ ™ s article from an anonymous startup employee , I think thatâ€ ™ s something to be celebrated , rather than criticised .
As Steve Jobs famously said : â€œHereâ€ ™ s to the crazy ones
â€
¦ they push the human race forward.â€
�
Our experience of entrepreneurs certainly doesnâ€ ™ t chime with that of the author .
We deal with new and growing businesses every day , and the founders are overwhelmingly rational , competent and highly experienced .
Sure , this can often go hand in hand with a mindset that others find hard to follow .
Entrepreneurs are not fond of abiding by the rules , but itâ€ ™ s this bravery , creativity and energy that enables them to challenge convention successfully .
And on the whole , this is rooted in the urge to change the world for the better in some way .
Far from being rudderless or narcissistic , most entrepreneurs are driven by a clear vision and solid purpose .
The founders we help to raise finance to grow are more likely to be in their late 30s , rather than 20-something hipsters .
Many come from senior roles in financial services , consultancy or technology , and are equipped with the strategic and leadership skills that are pivotal to success in any industry .
Many already have an expert understanding of the field â€ “
Ajan Reginald of biotech firm Celixir , for example , was previously global head of emerging technologies at healthcare company Roche .
Weâ€ ™ re also seeing more second - time entrepreneurs pitching on our platform , such as Tom Bloomfield who launched challenger bank Monzo after co - founding GoCardless or Alex Zivoder who raised Â£4 m for fintech innovator goHenry , after scaling companies like Expedia , viagogo and Lynda.com .
Startup founders have to be a little bit crazy to see things differently , chuck in a well - paid job and embrace uncertainty and sacrifice .
And itâ€ ™ s a tough position to be in .
Entrepreneurs need courage and determination to take risks , be creative and solve difficult problems
â€ “ and this may sometimes manifest itself in behaviour that could be seen as impulsive or frantic .
But this should be embraced , not knocked .
Itâ€ ™ s hard starting a business , very hard ;
thereâ€ ™ s nowhere to hide
and it takes a special type of person to do it .
If an entrepreneur lacks experience in the industry theyâ€ ™ re launching into , or is a first - time entrepreneur , the best way to channel that energy in an effective way is to surround themselves with an expert team .
Making mistakes is not something that should be seen as a negative â€ “ if youâ€ ™ re not making mistakes , youâ€ ™ re not taking risks , and changing the status quo is impossible without doing that .
Jane Ni Dhulchaointigh , founder of Sugru , developed the mouldable glue she invented with the help of two retired scientists .
She learned advanced chemistry from scratch and took six years and more than 5,000 experiments to perfect the product .
Brave , tenacious and â€ “ Iâ€ ™ m sure she wonâ€ ™ t mind me saying â€ “ wonderfully crazy too .
Moreover , new businesses should be unapologetic about hiring young people .
Many would hire experienced employees if they could afford to , but that often isnâ€ ™ t an option .
Thereâ€ ™ s nothing wrong with nurturing and empowering young people to progress and develop .
As the business matures , this will create the foundation of a strong , diverse leadership culture â€ “ at Crowdcube we have an ex - intern sitting on the management team alongside someone from Google , who joined us later .
Creating a culture in which new enterprise can flourish means not leaving everything to the steady , risk - averse â€œadultsâ€ � .
Entrepreneurs wonâ€ ™ t
get everything right all the time .
But maybe taking a shot , getting it wrong and reacting quickly is better than being ultra - conservative or overly precise .
Perfection is often described as the enemy of progress ; well , entrepreneurs are gloriously imperfect , even the most celebrated ones .
But they undeniably move us forward and change the world we live in .
We should respect those who give it a crack .
Without the creativity they bring and the impact they make , life would be quickly squeezed out of the UKâ€ ™ s business environment .

2016-10-28,"The pages of history are full of great leaders , from Winston Churchill to Nelson Mandela and Steve Jobs .
They all have their own key strengths â€ “ some relied on charm and charisma , some on their skill at strategy and others on belief and strength of will alone .
Whether youâ€ ™ re leading an army , a movement , or a small business , there are lessons to be learned from the leaders that went before .
Follow these and youâ€ ™ ll find youâ€ ™ re leading a happy and motivated team , retaining your best employees and ensure your business goes from strength to strength .
Build relationships Business , at its heart , is all about relationships â€ “ between you and your clients and suppliers , but also between you and your team .
Che Guevara started a revolution after he witnessed the struggles of his countrymen while on a cross - country bike ride and it was his compassion , charisma and communication skills that earned him so many devoted followers .
Fostering good relationships is incredibly important , and communication is key .
How often are you carving out time to step back and make sure theyâ€ ™ re running smoothly ?
Why not take aside each of your employees once every two weeks or once a month for a 30-minute chat ?
Use this time to chat about what theyâ€ ™ re doing at work , what they are enjoying , what they are struggling with and what they would change , given the chance .
Group outings for the whole team can also improve morale and the office culture .
Arrange an extended lunch at a local restaurant , a coffee and cake morning , or after work drinks .
These will all help to get people away from their desks and talking to each other about things other than work .
Be the energy you want to see One of the toughest parts of being a boss is keeping a stiff upper lip when times are tough and youâ€ ™ re worried about how your business is running .
But when youâ€ ™ re responsible for leading and motivating a team , finding the silver lining is essential .
Your glum mood can rub off on those around you .
When youâ€ ™ re worried about work , itâ€ ™ s time to channel Winston Churchill and remember to â€œkeep calm and carry onâ€ � .
If , for example , youâ€ ™ ve just had a negative phone call , try and take some time out to collect your thoughts and composure before you walk back out into the office .
You may not be aware but your anxiety can be detected and have an effect on your team .
Or if thereâ€ ™ s a job coming up that you know will be difficult or unpleasant , make sure you donâ€ ™ t set your teamâ€ ™ s expectations low .
Be honest about the difficulties , but emphasise the good points and have a plan of action for how youâ€ ™ re going to tackle it .
As Napoleon said , â€œA leader is a dealer in hope.â€ �
Have a dream
Martin Luther King was a powerful orator and community leader , and one of the things that made him a great leader was the strength and conviction of his dream â€ “ his ideal vision of the world â€
“ that he was able to describe so eloquently .
Leaders of today can learn from this by clearly setting out what success looks like .
One of the biggest motivators at work is knowing youâ€ ™ re doing a job well .
But to do that , you need to know what great looks like .
Itâ€ ™ s important to set clear and formal goals â€ “ both for your business and your employees .
Make sure the goals you set are SMART : specific , measureable , achievable , realistic and time - bound .
Set these goals and ensure they are reviewed on a regular basis â€ “ the more regular the better but most companies will do this once every six to 12 months .
This can also be used as a way to decide when to offer pay rises and promotions .
Recognise your teamâ€ ™ s strengths Bill Gates said : â€œAs we look ahead into the next century , leaders will be those who empower others , â€ �
and this is true in every business .
The secret of being a great boss is finding that balance between sharing your own wisdom and experience with your team , and allowing them to bring their own unique talents and experiences to the table to add value to your business .
Err too far to one side and you will stifle creativity and expression , and end up micromanaging .
Too far the other way , and your team members may lack direction , support and purpose .
To get the balance right , try following the I LED model â€ “ that is , ideal , locate , explore and do .
When a new task needs to be undertaken , sit down with your team and set out what the ideal outcome would be , so they know what they are working towards .
Then assign team members based on their strengths .
Use this time to also explore what skills and experience might be missing from the team â€
“
this is where you might need to provide coaching to ensure they have all the tools they need to complete the job .
And then step back and let them do it .
Supervise their progress with regular check ins , but make sure youâ€ ™ re not hovering or suffocating the teamâ€ ™ sfreedom to work in the way that best works for them .

2016-11-13,"Steve Jobs once asserted , â€œTrue innovation comes from recognising an unmet need and designing a creative way to fill it.â€
�
While he may not have been specifically referring to human centred design , youâ€ ™ d be forgiven for making the assumption .
After all , the purpose of human centred design is to create innovative products , services and solutions through creative and collaborative practices .
Not surprisingly , there is increasing interest worldwide in this emerging methodology that puts people and their experiences and behaviours at the centre of the entire design process .
Alexis Baum , a consultant designer and educator who has been working in the human centred design space in Australia and the US for more than a decade , says the growing shift towards human centred design is due to its ability to provide a more engaging and successful outcome â€ “ and ultimately a better product .
â€œHuman centred design is about understanding people on their own terms , â€ � Baum says .
â€œIt is a practice with a philosophy of putting people first and involving them in every step of the design process .
As such , it will 100 per cent result in a more meaningful and valuable outcome for the customer .
â€œGlobally , more and more organisations are using human centred design methodologies to bring value to people and improve their lives .
When an organisation includes the customer in the design process and adjusts to fit the needs of that customer â€ “ rather than the other way around â€ “ the product or service holds more value and meaning to the customer , not only because it is more relevant but because they were a part of it coming to fruition.â€
�
Baum says that human centred design helps organisations to have empathy and truly know their customers .
As a result , they are better able to understand customersâ€ ™ wants and needs , and tailor - make solutions and products to fit .
It also opens up a realm of new possibilities .
â€œHuman centred design opens up the potential for new realities and experiences that we may not have previously imagined , â€ �
she says .
â€œAs Henry Ford famously said : â€˜If I had asked people what they wanted , they would have said faster horsesâ€ ™ .
Instead , he created the Model T car .
â€œHuman centred design is about observing , understanding and making .
These methods help to bring future products and services to life from an imagined idea .
Itâ€ ™ s about going into the consumerâ€ ™ s world and understanding their experiences , then taking that and using co - design and collaboration to craft a new world together.â€
�
Indeed , IDEO.org , the not - for - profit arm of global design company IDEO , uses human centred design to solve real world needs â€ “ from finding solutions for clean drinking water to establishing health and education programs .
The challenges IDEO.org faces are immense , and so part of its methodology is to form collaborative partnerships with other not - for - profits , government bodies and community organisations so real and effective solutions can be found and continually implemented .
IDEO.org is considered a world leader in human centred design and has produced its own Field Guide to Human Centred Design , in which it describes human centred design as being â€œuniquely situated to arrive at solutions that are desirable , feasible and viableâ€ � .
â€œEmbracing human centred design means believing that all problems , even the seemingly intractable ones like poverty , gender equality and clean water , are solvable ...
Human centred design offers problem solvers of any stripe a chance to design with communities , to deeply understand the people theyâ€ ™ re looking to serve , to dream up scores of ideas , and to create innovative new solutions rooted in peopleâ€ ™ s actual needs.â€
�
As well as helping to solve real world problems , human centred design is also a viable business strategy , and as our world becomes increasingly digitised , the role of human centred design also becomes increasingly important .
Roy Shiladitya , Head of IT at ING DIRECT Australia , says that customer behaviour and empathy are key factors in the design process of all product development undertaken by ING DIRECT .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a lot of artificial intelligence and robotics coming into products now , so it is imperative that we keep focus of the human element , â€ �
Shiladitya says .
â€œSo we take that true customer behaviour and how they engage with us and build it into the product to make it more conducive and intuitive for them to use .
â€œOrganisations can no longer be prescriptive in their approach .
Itâ€ ™ s about giving the customer control and ownership .
In terms of banking , we donâ€ ™ t say you have to bank with us this way .
Our customers have the control and choice to bank whenever they want , wherever they want and however they want , and we need to make it available to them .
â€œTaking this human - centric approach not only offers more value to the customer but also gives them a much richer sense of belonging .
If we as a company can align to a personâ€ ™ s values rather than just their needs , that is very powerful.â€
�
Another benefit â€ “ and appeal â€ “ of human centred design is the ability to fast - track prototyping .
Shiladitya says ING DIRECT has developed its own human centred design framework called PACE , which allows the organisation to innovate like a start - up , enabling it to get the right services and products to market faster .
â€œPACE is based on design thinking and agile methodologies , â€ � he says .
â€œObviously thereâ€ ™ s a framework , but essentially rather than taking the customer on a journey , you are actually going on the journey with the customer .
Thatâ€ ™ s the big shift .
â€œIt is a much more agile way of working , and todayâ€ ™ s technology allows us to build prototypes more quickly .
So instead of spending six months developing a product , we can know within as little as three weeks the viability of a new product or service .
It is a constant process of iteration , experimentation and feedback to check that the product is providing value.â€ �
By involving the customer throughout the entire design process â€ “ effectively co - creating the product or service in question â€ “ innovation risk is reduced and the chances of engagement and therefore success are increased .
Moving forward , the involvement of consumers in the design process will only continue to grow , with Baum describing human centred design as the â€œnew literacyâ€ � we will all require , if only at a base level .
â€œWhen people moved from the farm to the factory , it was the first time everyone in the company needed to know math ,
â€ � say says .
â€œYou didnâ€ ™ t need to be an expert mathematician but you needed the fundamentals such addition , subtraction , division and multiplication .
We now have math literacy .
â€œJump forward to today , the innovation age , if you will , and thereâ€ ™ s a new literacy , which is design â€ “ human centred design.â€
�
This â€œnew literacyâ€ � of human centred design will not only provide the platform for organisations and social enterprise to be more creative and agile in their approach to finding real solutions , but also help them to innovate by empowering the people within ."
2016-11-22,"Increased spending on high - profile films including The BFG and
Now You See Me 2 have hammered first - half profits at Entertainment One , sending shares in the owner of Peppa Pig tumbling more than 11 % .
Entertainment One â€ “ maker and distributor of films and TV shows including the Steve Jobs biopic , the Hunger Games and Twilight franchises , Greyâ€ ™ s
Anatomy , Rookie Blue and Oscar winner Spotlight â€ “ reported an 80 % year - on - year slump in pre - tax profits to Â£3.7 m in the six months to 30 September .
The company , which rebuffed a Â£1bn offer from ITV in the summer , blamed the profit fall on â€œincreased theatrical investmentâ€ � at its film division which it expects to recoup in the second half of its financial year , with high - profile releases such as sci - fi film Arrival and The Girl on the Train .
Adjusted pre - tax profits came in at Â£24 m , well short of City expectations of Â£37 m to Â£40 m , which sent the companyâ€ ™ s shares down 11 % .
Entertainment One , which is headquartered in Toronto but listed on the London Stock Exchange , increased total revenues by 19 % to Â£401 m .
The companyâ€ ™ s TV division , which includes the Mark Gordon Company , maker of shows such as Ray Donovan and the newly launched Kiefer Sutherland series Designated Survivor , saw revenues rise by 34 % to Â£144.5 m .
Revenues at the family division , which includes the $ 1bn Peppa Pig franchise , rose by 16 % to Â£37.9 m .
â€œWhilst theatrical investment has impacted profitability in the period , we will see the financial benefits of this investment delivered in the second half of the financial year , â€ � said Darren Throop , chief executive of eOne .
â€œThe group remains on track to deliver full - year financial performance in line with management expectations.â€ �

2017-04-19,"As Apple has WWDC and Google has I / O , so Facebook has F8 :
the social networkâ€ ™ s big annual conference has steadily grown , from a way to speak to developers about the upcoming changes to its platform to an event where the whole world hears about the exciting new products coming from the House of Zuckerberg .
Facebookâ€ ™ s chief executive may not quite have Steve Jobsâ€ ™ infamous â€œreality distortion
fieldâ€ �
â€ “
the social networkâ€ ™ s ideal world is more like an artificial reality where none of the outside world penetrates â€ “ but
he can still wow when he wants to .
Hereâ€ ™ s the eight biggest things to take away from the San Jose event .
1 )
Augmented reality is Facebookâ€ ™ s big future bet Facebook wants you to use its camera for more than just taking pictures .
If thereâ€ ™ s one message from this yearâ€ ™ s F8 , itâ€ ™ s that .
Sure , youâ€ ™ ll still be able to snap pics and send them to friends .
But the company also wants to paste more and more detail over the real world to create a second , â€œaugmentedâ€ � layer .
Some of the features of this â€œcamera
platformâ€ �
sound genuinely useful â€ “ or at least , fun .
Facebook wants you to share pics of your run with your pace and time superimposed over the top , for instance , and it dreams of a day when youâ€ ™ ll be able to leave a review of a restaurant by pinning it to the window .
( That one feels like it would have a few kinks to work out in practice , though ) .
Other features seem â€ ¦ less good .
Demonstrating one simpler capability of the new camera , Zuckerberg showed that â€œyou can add a second coffee mugâ€ � to your picture , â€œso
it looks like youâ€ ™ re not having breakfast aloneâ€ � .
Which is surely the bleakest thing ever said in a billion - dollar companyâ€ ™ s presentation .
2 )
Itâ€ ™ s still copying Snapchat One word that wasnâ€ ™ t said on stage , though :
Snapchat .
Which is odd , because weâ€ ™ ve seen a lot of these features before .
The ephemeral messaging app / social network for hip teens in rich countries popularised the idea of the AR camera , steadily upgrading its own offering from something which simply whacked a few location - aware images over the top of a pic to facial recognition - based â€œlensesâ€ � which turn you into a dog .
This is something teens like .
Facebookâ€ ™ s photocopiers have been overheating with the pace at which itâ€ ™ s been replicating Snapchatâ€ ™ s features , so it was probably looking forward to the ability to finally overtake its rival in LA .
But it was not to be : six hours before F8 started , Snapchat released its own AR functionality , which itâ€ ™ s calling World Lenses .
The new lenses are slightly less feature - rich than what Facebook is promising , but unlike the Camera Platform , itâ€ ™ s already on phones now .
Sure , itâ€ ™ s sneaky and underhanded to gazump Facebook like that , but Snapchatâ€ ™ s owed a bit of payback .
Score ?
Snapchat 21 : 0 Facebook .
3 )
Facebook hasnâ€ ™ t given up on VR Facebook hasnâ€ ™ t forgotten about Oculus , the virtual reality company it bought in 2013 for a cool $ 2bn .
It may have quietly lost the companyâ€ ™ s co - founder a few months after it was revealed that he funded a â€œshitposting for Trumpâ€ � political action committee , but the product itself continues to see new support .
Case in point ?
Facebook Spaces , a VR chatroom where you and your friends can hang out and do stuff .
Itâ€ ™ s not much different from a number of apps on Oculus today , like Bigscreen , which let you chill with other people in VR â€ “ except that itâ€ ™ s tied in to Facebook proper , meaning that its going to be a lot easier to integrate with your existing friendship group .
The company is also making efforts to include people who donâ€ ™ t own the expensive hardware necessary to experience true VR , letting simple smartphone users join in via a flat video call .
The developers havenâ€
™ t been forgotten : one of the nerdier announcements was a new coding framework for VR , built on Facebookâ€ ™ s React platform .
It may sound niche , but React is a javascript library , more commonly used for building user interfaces for the web .
If React VR takes off , it could turn virtual reality development from a prohibitively expensive pastime to something that companies can do as easily as knocking up a mobile app .
4 )
Itâ€ ™ s thinking a lot about the money One of the onstage executives presenting alongside Zuckerberg was Deborah Liu , whose day job is the companyâ€ ™ s director of product management for monetisation .
That should be enough of a hint about how Facebook hopes this bold new frontier should work for its bottom line Liuâ€ ™ s past at the company was heading up
the Mobile App Install Ad product â€ “ those adverts on your newsfeed that ask you to install new apps and games â€ “ but
this time , she was talking about all the branding opportunities the Camera Platform offers .
That includes those restaurant reviews that the company imagines people leaving tacked up , discoverable by a phone ; and it also includes the more personal example of a birthday message generated over a pic of her daughter .
â€œI can make her birthday even more meaningful , â€ �
Liu said as she triggered some visual effects .
Itâ€ ™ s not just adverts , though .
The company also hopes to give developers the chance to use its visual tools to make their own AI - powered , AR - realised applications and plugins for the camera , potentially triggering another application boom comparable to the creation of the smartphone in the first place .
5 )
Messenger is becoming more like WeChat Not everything was about Facebook itself .
The companyâ€ ™ s second biggest product , Messenger , also got a raft of features , helping bring it further towards Facebookâ€ ™ s clear inspiration for it :
Chinese messaging app WeChat .
While Messenger has a billion users , itâ€ ™ s not as embedded in their daily lives to the extent that WeChat has achieved in its home nation .
There , the chat app is used to pay bills , book plane tickets and follow celebrities , as well as simple one - to - one communication .
Facebookâ€ ™ s early experiments with chatbots was a step in that direction , and now the company has announced an overhaul of its platform to try and bring more and more of our connected life in to Messenger .
That means simple fun , like turn - by - turn multiplayer games and bots whoâ€ ™ ll play with you if your friends arenâ€ ™ t available ; it means connection with the physical world , thanks to the addition of a new form of QR code that you can scan at events to immediately connect with brands ; and it means new discovery features to let you actually find some of those bots without needing to be told where they are beforehand .

Itâ€ ™ s working with the likes of Apple and Spotify Facebook
canâ€ ™ t
do it alone , though : unifying the world behind Messenger also means the world needs to join in .
So one of the biggest coups for the platform is the fact that itâ€ ™ s managed to convince Apple to build an extension for Apple Music , so that users can browse their music library from within the app to send songs to friends .
Itâ€ ™ s not quite the first time Apple Musicâ€ ™ s made it outside of Appleâ€ ™ s walled garden â€
“ the company broke new ground when it released an Android app for the streaming service â€
“
but it shows that both companies are serious about wider support for their new products .
Apple Musicâ€ ™ s not the only one to join up , though ; Spotify has a similar extension .
And unlike Apple , which could only say that the Music add - on is â€œcoming soonâ€ � , Spotifyâ€ ™ s extension is launching alongside the Messenger platform .
7 ) It wants to crush the workplace chat tool Slack One more thing :
Facebook wants to be in your workplace , wherever that is .
The companyâ€ ™ s already revealed its product for businesses , called Workplace ( made in Britain , for those patriotic firms ) but it was previously pitched at fairly large companies .
With pricing that started at $ 3 per user per month , it wasnâ€ ™ t something that an uncertain corporation would be able to jump onboard with , even though there is a three - month free trial .
Now , Facebookâ€ ™ s taken a lead from indie darling Slack , which sparked the trend for business software being cool in the first place .
By the end of this year , a new â€œstandardâ€ � tier will be free for any company that wants to use it , with businesses only needing to pay if they want more and better admin tools and cloud storage .
Of course , while Facebook is encroaching on Slackâ€ ™ s turf , Slack too is beginning to move on to Facebookâ€ ™ s : the very existence of the free tier of the app means that some users have found extremely non - commercial uses of it , creating Slack groups to discuss everything from podcasts to role playing games .
8) Facebook doesnâ€
™ t yet have any answers to its biggest problems Just hours before Mark Zuckerberg took the stage , Steve Stephens killed himself .
He had sparked a manhunt after posting a video and later a livestream on Facebook , in which he killed a man , and discussed murdering more than a dozen other people .
Zuckerberg addressed the murder directly , expressing his condolences to the family of Robert Godwin Sr , the 74 year old man whose murder was uploaded to the site .
â€œWe have a lot more to do here and are reminded of this this week by the tragedy in Cleveland , â€ � he said .
â€œOur hearts go out to the family and friends of Robert Godwin Sr â€
¦
and we will keep doing all we can to prevent tragedies like this from happening.â€
�
But despite the words , Zuckerberg announced nothing to address the problem .
While a murder in the real world may feel like it isnâ€ ™ t a problem for Facebook to solve , the company has to deal with the fact that there is now a person known in the press as the â€œFacebook Killerâ€ � .
Against that background , discussing the possibility of pinning AR reviews of a cafe without addressing the abuse possibilities , or exploring the potential for VR to bring people together without also addressing the ways it can make harassment more damaging , looks potentially foolhardy ."
2017-05-03,"Ivanka Trumpâ€ ™ s new book , Women Who Work , was launched on Tuesday , giving a dramatic glimpse into the life of the wealthy woman dubbed the â€œfirst daughter of the United Statesâ€ � .
It quotes liberally from a host of professional life coaches , and includes tips from successful business leaders such as Sheryl Sandberg , Bill Gates and Steve Jobs .
But it also includes illuminating pieces of advice from Ivanka herself , generated from a paradoxical lifestyle of enormous privilege combined with a grinding work ethic , and an outlook that simultaneously lifts women up while also guilt - tripping them .
Given her role as a real estate executive in the family firm and leader of a fashion brand , Ivankaâ€ ™ s guide to navigating the workplace may have seemed unremarkable .
But in her new embodiment as a White House adviser to her father , the president , her mission set out in the book appears glaringly at odds with the direction of the Trump administration â€ “ with or without her advice .
Ivanka Trump writes early in the book : â€œInspiring and empowering women who work â€ “ at all aspects of their lives
â€ “ has been my mission throughout my entire career .
Today I have the opportunity to take that work to new heights and advocate for change on a far greater scale than Iâ€ ™
d ever imagined.â€ �
She declares it her
lifeâ€
™ s mission to change societyâ€ ™ s â€œingrained negativityâ€ � about the image of the â€œworking womanâ€ � .
Here are Ivankaâ€ ™ s top 10 life hacks .
Embrace your professional ambition and posh baby breakfasts
Trump writes that she had been â€œgrappling with whether being a young female executive with a baby would undermine my authority in the eyes of my colleagues and peers in a very male - dominated [ real estate ]
industryâ€ � and had refrained from putting home life pictures on social media .
But then : â€œI began to wonder whether I had been doing women who work a disservice by not owning the reality that , because Iâ€ ™ ve got an infant , Iâ€ ™ m in my bathrobe at 7AM and thereâ€ ™ s pureed avocado all over me.â€ � Accept the fact that there is no such thing as work - life balance any more , so look out for the 11 pm
emails â€ “ maybe even on Saturday night When working at her fashion brand and real estate offices in New York before her father became president : â€œI do all the things that must be accomplished face to face between the hours of 8 am and 6 pm .
The rest I leave for later â€ ¦ after the kids have gone to bed
â€
¦
I start making the [ office ] rounds at 5.30pm to check in and announce that Iâ€ ™ m going home as I leave .
My team knows â€ ¦ to expect emails from me at 11 pm
â€ “ and that I donâ€ ™ t expect an answer at that hour , unless they , like me , leave early!â€ � Trump and Kushner observe the Jewish Sabbath .
â€œThe break is what enables me to go back to work , full steam , the following Monday - or , more realistically , Saturday night when I log back on!â€ �
Think big .
Itâ€ ™ s not just about you â€œDesign a life that honors your individual passions and priorities in a way only you can â€
¦
What that looks like and how to achieve it is different for each and every one of us ...
Women like you and me are â€ ¦ owning who we are
â€ ¦
Weâ€ ™ re defining what it means to be a modern woman who works : for ourselves , our families , our companies , the culture at large and the generations to come.â€ � But
donâ€ ™ t forget you , especially when it comes to massage and meditation â€ “ unless your dad is in the thick of running for president â€œDuring the [ election ] campaign , I went into survival mode :
I worked and I was with my family ; I didnâ€ ™ t do much else .
Honestly , I wasnâ€ ™ t treating myself to a massage or making much time for self - care .
I wish I could have awoken early to meditate for twenty minutes and I would have loved to catch up with the friends I hadnâ€ ™ t seen in three months , but there just wasnâ€ ™ t enough time in the day.â€ �
Unlock your creativity but stay grounded , especially by gardening at your country house â€œRead
a book or a magazine , power nap or meditate , listen to music , learn calligraphy , chess , cooking , a language or dancing â€ ¦ Gardening is our [ familyâ€ ™ s ] new thing .
Getting our hands dirty â€ ¦ it connects us with nature , gives me a great way to explain seasons to the kids and encourage healthy eating while having fun in the fresh air .
On the weekends we hang out at our country home in New Jersey.â€
�
If you donâ€ ™ t go back to work within a week of having your first baby ( as Trump did ) , you may enjoy your maternity leave more if you also work at the same time â€œYou can go off the grid completely during maternity leave and be totally within your rights , but staying in the loop and knowing that things are getting done may help you relax and focus on your baby â€
¦
If you plan to be in touch [ with the office ] , choose a day and time thatâ€ ™ s consistently convenient for you ( eg when your mother - in - law is on newborn duty.)â€ � Donâ€ ™ t sleep
too much â€ ¦ especially if you are Ivanka , or work for her â€œI was inspired to create the Women who Work initiative to change the conversation around work and family â€ ¦ Itâ€ ™
s the â€˜whyâ€ ™ behind the initiative and my brand that gets me out of bed at the crack of dawn every morning , and is what deeply motivates my team
... it also means getting back to work once [ the kids ] are asleep and cranking until midnight or later.â€ �
Make lists , many lists , at home , at work , at play .
They may or may not include â€˜must clean the houseâ€ ™ â€œI write a list for connecting with each of my kids .
I put real thought into coming up with ideas for memorable moments
I can create with each of them .
I play cars with Joseph [ the older of her two sons ] , on the floor , for 20 minutes each day .
Arabella [ her daughter and oldest of her three children ] loves books , so I make a note to read at least two per day to her and plan â€˜datesâ€ ™ to the library
â€
¦ I draft a general family list that includes things like how often [ my husband ] Jared [ Kushner , now senior adviser to president Donald Trump ] and I will go on an official date night ( every other week ! )
â€ ¦ Iâ€ ™ ve built an entire system of symbols that denote how timely each item on my to - do list
is.â€
� Relaxing in front of the TV after a busy day is not OK , but not wearing make - up sometimes is OK â€œSometimes I like turning on Real Housewives and sitting in front of the TV eating a giant bowl of pasta with a glass of wine , but if Iâ€ ™ m honest with myself , itâ€ ™ s kind of counterproductive .
It is in these moments especially that we should meditate , soak in the tub , exercise or take a long walk â€ ¦ [ Meanwhile , ] I often hear things like â€˜itâ€ ™ s so inspiring that youâ€ ™ re such a hands - on momâ€ ™ and â€˜So amazing !
Youâ€ ™ re not wearing makeup .
Iâ€ ™ m used to seeing you on The Apprentice in a powerful boardroom setting.â€ ™ â€
�
There should be more women in boardrooms and they should be paid more â€ “
so itâ€
™ s up to them to ask .
And being happy is your responsibility â€œI know lots of people who are outwardly successful and inwardly miserable
â€ “ to me , thatâ€ ™ s not success , but thatâ€ ™ s the path theyâ€ ™ ve chosen , consciously or not ...
You canâ€
™ t change the [ corporate ] culture if you donâ€ ™ t ask â€ “ and youâ€ ™ re not going to get what you want if you arenâ€ ™ t creating high value for your company ...
Too often , for reasons like a lack of flexibility or poor support at home and/or at work , women are talking themselves out of great opportunities ...
One by one we must fight for ourselves , for our rights not just as workers but also as women .
We must prioritize our families and passions , we must serve as role models ...
â€ �
Trump thanks her nannies and her childrenâ€ ™ s nannies and closes out the book with a pledge to use the now - heightened platform that she â€˜never expectedâ€ ™ to â€˜advance an important conversationâ€ ™ in a White House run by a president she swears blind is a good listener â€œI felt it was my duty and obligation to take a stand on issues that contribute to wage inequality , such as our countryâ€ ™ s failure to mandate paid leave for American workers and the lack of safe , affordable high - quality childcare ...
This is not a womenâ€ ™ s issue , although mothers in particular are disproportionately affected ...
It is a family issue that affects men , women , children , and businesses nationwide ...
We need to fight for change.â€ �"
2017-05-16,"Not content with patenting the marvellous invention of a paper bag , Apple decided that ordinary pizza boxes simply werenâ€ ™ t up to the job in its white and shiny world .
Behold the circular , Apple - approved pizza box to end all pizza boxes .
Published in 2012 â€ “ with one box apparently signed as a mark of respect on the death of the Apple founder , Steve Jobs â€ “
the patent says that the new and improved circular pizza receptacleâ€ ™ s invention is credited to Appleâ€ ™ s head of food services , Francesco Longoni .
It was intended for use in the companyâ€ ™ s CaffÃ¨ Macs and the new Apple Park cafe .
The patent describes a â€œcontainer that is structurally stable enough for containing an item in a variety of applications and is also environmentally friendlyâ€ � .
It has holes in the top to allow moisture to escape , apparently to keep pizzas from getting soggy so workers could take them back to their pods .
The concentric rings , the patent says , support the base of the pizza while providing an air gap between it and the base of the box .
The lid clips into the bottom , and the side wall integrity keeps the whole thing from getting crushed under the weight of hungry eyes as you trundle back to your desk .
How silly will Dominoâ€ ™ s and other pizzerias look , continuing to use basic square boxes that have barely changed since the second world war , when moulded fibre revolutions like this are available in the world ?
Whatâ€ ™ s next on the list of Apple packaging greatness ?
Kebab boxes are pretty heinous .
Apple patents bold new innovation â€ “ a paper bag"
