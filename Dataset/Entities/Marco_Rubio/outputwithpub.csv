2005-09-27,"Suddenly , about the Bushes , it all becomes clear .
The whole family is under the baleful influence of a chap called Chang .
Here is Governor Jeb Bush in a speech last week , naming Marco Rubio as Florida Speaker . ""
Chang is a mystical warrior .
Chang is somebody who believes in conservative principles , believes in entrepreneurial capitalism , believes in moral values that underpin a free society .
I rely on Chang with great regularity in my public life .
He has been by my side and sometimes I let him down .
But Chang , this mystical warrior , has never let me down . ""
Jeb then unsheathed a golden sword , which he gave to Rubio .
It 's not the first time Chang has made an outing .
In a Washington Post article of 1989 , Jeb 's father , George Bush Sr , is described using him to intimidate opponents in White House tennis games , enquiring at key points in the match , "" Should I unleash Chang ?
"" It 's the kind of story that goes through the net like Ebola . ""
We 're totally stealing that , "" says Wonkette.com , one of the largest US political blogs .
And so she does , with a list of Chang catchphrases .
Is that a gun in your pocket or are you just unleashing Chang for me ?
Now do n't make me pull this car over and unleash Chang .
Five o'clock - time to unleash Chang !
Could Chang actually be Chiang Kai - shek , Mao 's opponent ?
Yes , says the inestimable Youaredumb.net . ""
Chiang Kai - shek is pretty much your poster boy for cold war conservatism .
He was a bastard .
Repressive , bit of a military dictator , but he was Fighting communism , and since communism is the worstest thing ever , nothing Chiang did could be bad ...
The example set by Chiang repeated itself over and over again - the Contras and the Taliban being two primo examples . '
Unleash Chang ' was , apparently , a freakish cold warrior rallying cry , symbolically referring to rooting out the commies and the leftists . ""
A 1999 issue of the Stanford Reporter confirms the theory , with a tale involving the journalist George Plimpton . ""
President George Bush
[ Sr ] ... invited Plimpton to play horseshoes at the White House .
Prior to throwing each ringer , Plimpton said , Bush would whisper , ' Unleash Chiang , ' apparently in reference to freeing Chiang Kai - shek , or ' Remember Iowa ' , referring to the primary where he 'd been soundly defeated by Bob Dole . ""
Jeb 's aides now tell us Chang is an arbitrating figure , but we know the truth , Jeb , even if you do n't .
If Chang really was a reconciler of conflict , your brother would have employed him in Iraq .
Oh , he did , did he ? ·
Tony Blair so much loves us being there ( Iraq ) he has created a special Green Zone at the Labour party conference .
One unintended consequence on Sunday evening was that a fringe meeting inside this security zone - of the Core Cities group of regional powerhouses such as Bristol , Leeds , Nottingham - had to forgo its main speaker , Sir Robert Kerslake .
This senior public - sector figure - chief executive of Sheffield city council - was denied access as he did not have the right pass .
Having driven all the way down to Brighton from South Yorkshire , he was left stranded outside the cordon .
The meeting went on none the less , albeit in curious fashion .
John Healey , financial secretary to the Treasury , gamely padded out his 10 minutes of prepared remarks to 30 minutes , adding plenty of regional - investment data to leaven the dough .
The recently sacked minister for the regions , Nick Raynsford , asked a few barbed questions of his former ministerial colleague , then left abruptly . ·
In his conference speech Gordon Brown paid tribute to public servants ' responses to the July 7 bombs - "" treating the wounded , comforting the bereaved , never asking what was the creed or colour or religion of those they helped "" .
Was this a veiled reference to the US response to Katrina , which certainly appeared to have a racial inflection ?
Of course , racism is not the reason Chang was left unleashed .
It was just an economic issue that saw black people in the water , whites long gone already .

2010-03-28,"It 's come to this : a nationally televised debate between the two wings of the Republican party .
In the red corner is Florida 's incumbant governor Charlie Crist , a moderate .
In the even redder corner is handsome Marco Rubio , a Florida state politician and the darling of the Tea Party movement .
The immediate prize is the Republican party nomination for a US senate seat â€ “ but what 's really at stake is the face of the modern Republican party .
Crist , a moderate , was on the shortlist as vice presidential candidate for John McCain 's 2008 campaign ( and we all know how that turned out ) .
Rubio , 39-years - young and handsome with Latino roots , is spoken off as the Republican party 's Barack Obama .
Rubio is the rising star of the conservative movement .
Crist in February 2009 committed the cardinal sin of embracing Barack Obama 's stimulus package .
But he is also an established politician in the state who has twice won state - wide elections .
On top of all that , the primary is getting nasty .
These two do n't like each other .
In other words : debate - fight ! { pagebreak }
The immense interest in the debate is shown by the fact that Fox is carrying the whole thing live â€ “ not on Fox News but on its national network , which is a bigger deal .
Here 's what happened :
9.0am : Here we go ...
Fox 's Chris Wallace is moderating .
Rubio is way ahead in the polls and the tussle is getting nasty : Fox shows some attack ads , with one by Crist calling Rubio "" the Republican Obama , "" which is a bit of knock in a Republican primary , let 's face it .
9.03am :
And Charlie Crist comes out swinging from the get - go : "" There is a clear , stark distinction between myself and Speaker Rubio ...
Speaker Rubio views public service as a way to enhance his personal enrichment . ""
Ouch !
Crist goes on to call Rubio 's fundraising committees a "" slush fund "" that gave payments to members of his family , describing it as "" Rubio Inc "" .
Here 's some of the background to Crist 's attacks : Marco Rubio was barely solvent as a young lawmaker climbing his way to the top post in the Florida House , but special interest donations and political perks allowed him to spend big money with little scrutiny .
9.04am :
What Crist is talking about is a big story that broke recently about Rubio misusing party credit cards : US Senate candidate Marco Rubio charged grocery bills , repairs to the family minivan and purchases from a wine store less than a mile from his West Miami home to the Republican Party of Florida while he was speaker of the Florida House , according to records obtained by the St. Petersburg Times / Miami Herald .
"" You just do n't get it governor , "" says Rubio , quickly trying to change the subject .
"" Everyone knows you wo n't stand up to the Obama agenda . ""
And : "" In 2006 , governor , I voted for you .
Because I trusted you when you said you 'd be a Jeb Bush Republican .
You 're record was something very different . ""
Crist is back on the attack , picking out some details of Rubio 's credit card bills .
Nasty .
9.07am :
Man I wish I had three hands
so I could keep taking down the mud these two are throwing at each other .
Now we 're onto the "" hug "" that Crist gave Obama when the president visited Florida campaigning for the stimulus programme .
This brings us back onto the economy , and the Florida economy is in deep trouble because of the collapse of the housing market which is worse in Florida than most parts of the US .
Talking about this helps Rubio because as the sitting governor , Crist gets the rap .
Fox plays a clip of former Florida governor Jeb Bush slagging off Crist over the stimulus .
( Only in the Republican Florida primaries would a Bush be taken seriously but no matter . )
"" As governor I had to take tough decisions , "" responds Crist .
"" If we had taken [ Rubio 's ] approach , we would have had 87,000 more people unemployed on top of those that we have today . ""
9.13am :
Are n't you just a partisan hack , asks Chris Wallace of Rubio .
Oh I 'm against gridlock , says Rubio , so long as the Obama administration does everything I want them to do .
Ah ha .
9.16am :
Charlie Crist , you love John McCain and he 's a loser , asks Wallace .
Better than being an ideological weirdo like ... let 's see ...
my opponent , says Crist .
And did you know he misused credit cards to pay for his haircuts ?
"" Those are outrageous accusations , "" says Rubio and starts talking about the US borrowing money from China .
9.20am :
Healthcare !
Is it evil , hmm , what say you Charlie Crist ?
Would you repeal it Marco Rubio ?
Fox then shows a clip of Rubio saying that health insurance should be like car insurance -
yes , that 's what America needs .
Vibrancy and competition is what individual insurance would bring , says Rubio .
Oh yes , that 's worked so well up till now .
9.23am :
Immigration , a totally uncontroversial subject in Florida . ""
Is Rubio tougher on immigration , "" wonders moderator .
No , says Charlie Crist , in a moderate responsible way .
Why did n't you do something about it , Marco Rubio ?
Nice sidestep again by Rubio there , who swiftly moves on to the national level .
"" As far as amnesty , the governor and I disagree , "" says Rubio .
And AMNESTY is a Republican red - meat buzzword , so win there for Rubio .
9.28am :
Why is no - one being asked about "" back wax - gate "" , the allegation that Rubio spent $ 134 on getting his back man - waxed in a salon ?
Crist aired that one a couple of weeks ago : "" He 's trying to pawn himself off as a fiscal conservative "" , Crist told FNC anchor Greta Van Susteren . ""
And yet just in recent weeks , two weeks ago it has come out in news accounts
he had a Republican Party of Florida credit card that he charged $ 130 haircut , or maybe it was a back wax
- we are not sure what all he got at that place . ""
Charlie Crist pays $ 11 for his haircut and he certainly would never go into a "" men 's salon "" .
( I hesitate to mention the long - running rumours that Crist is gay , which seems to be based solely on the evidence that he has a tan - as if that 's unusual in Florida . )
9.32am :
Tax and social security : being the Republican party it 's time for the traditional fight about which candidate is utterly opposed to taxes the most .
And guess what ?
They both hate taxes so much that even saying the word requires a grimace .
But it seems Crist raised taxes on cigarettes !
And Rubio had some sales tax raising plan .
"" In all due respect to the Speaker , you 've got to tell the truth to people , "" says Crist , getting in a nice jab in some complex semantics about taxes - schmaxes , "" If trust and confidence are n't relevant I do n't know what is .
""
The West Miami City Commission gets a mention !
Apparently , when Rubio was like 12 years old he voted to raise tax something when he was on the hugely significant West Miami City Commission , which for some reason has never been mentioned on national US television before .
Anyway , it is hugely important because of Rubio 's claim that he 's never , ever voted to raise taxes , ever .
9.37am :
Some emails are read out from Tea Party people , and it seems not all of the Tea Party spectrum likes Rubio that much , because he wo n't sacrifice an annointed calf or something .
9.38am :
Crist is asked : "" There are persistent rumours ... ""
oh now what 's this question ? "" ....
that you will run as an independent "" .
Oh that 's not the persistent rumour some people were thinking of .
Crist says he 's a Republican and he 's running as a Republican and blah blah blah ,
exactly what you 'd expect him to say .
( Unless you really expected him to say , "" Oh hey ,
yeah
maybe I will split the party and run as an independent if I get sunk in this primary . "" )
This is important because of the Republican fear of a Joe Lieberman - style indy run by Crist .
Lieberman was knocked out of the Democratic primary by an anti - war liberal , but then turned round and ran as an independent and won .
Somehow Rubio manages to mention Reagan in a very strange way : "" I do n't recall Ronald Reagan ever being asked if he would run as an independent . ""
As if Marco Rubio is even old enough to remember Reagan , let alone remember anything anyone asked him .
( Seriously : Rubio would have been nine years old when Reagan was elected president . )
Crist shoots back : "" Ronald Reagan was a Democrat before he was a Republican if you want to talk about Ronald Reagan . ""
But that does n't stop Rubio blathering on Reagan 's line about being better off than you were four years ago , etc etc .
9.44am :
Final statements , and Crist returns to the attack with all guns blazing .
What about the $ 300,000 Rubio earned as a lobbyist ?
Hmm ?
Why has n't he published his tax returns like Crist has ?
"" Is it because you are doctoring the books ? "" asks Crist .
Ka - pow .
Rubio for the first time briefly splutters in response and repeats exactly the same formulation of words from Crist 's first attacks : "" These are outrageous allegations , "" he repeats , and then reprises exactly the same wording along the lines of "" You do n't get it "" and "" we have n't heard a single significant public proposal from Governor Crist "" .
Which was kind of robotic , to repeat word for word a response .
It 's like that scene in Terminator 1 where Arnie 's character scrolls through the responses in his computer - brain .
Wrap - up : As predicted it was fireworks from the beginning , with both candidates going after each other .
Crist stuck to being the moderate candidate , especially when he said he would have voted for the stimulus bill and defended his taking stimulus funds , for the good of Florida .
Rubio was on the attack on taxes , the economy and that voters could n't trust Crist to "" stand up to the Obama agenda "" in Washington .
Crist also barred no holds , hitting Rubio hard over various fundraising and expenses transgressions .
He 's been doing this for a couple of weeks now and it does n't seem to be making much impression on the polls .
If he can make "" trust "" a bigger issue then it might work but it 's not looking good for Crist .
On the other hand he 's a canny politician who has been through some tough fights before , so Crist may yet come back â€
“ although he 's got a long way to go and Rubio did n't give him anything much to work with today .
Overall though , since Rubio is the front - runner ( with caveats about how hard it is to poll single - party primaries in non - presidential election years ) he probably managed the debate better .
He 's cool and calm , can debate pretty well and comes across as reasonable on television .
This is n't some Tea Party ranter like JD Hayworth in Arizona .
Only at the end when he repeated his response to Crist 's attacks almost word for word did Rubio look vulnerable , but even then he stuttered rather than damaged himself .
Crist on the other hand â€ “ given the high profile of this debate â€ “ may have helped himself by airing the Rubio credit card expenses in a wider forum .
Crist , when asked if he would run as an independent , gave the standard response , but nothing in these contexts ever rules out changing ones mind .
He did position himself to run as an centre - right independent , and that may yet happen .
Had he tacked to the right then going back to the centre would have been harder : he did n't so he 's leaving a door open , perhaps .
For those who have never seen Rubio in action before , he confirmed that he 's a smooth , media - savvy operator who makes a strong candidate .
And yes , you can see why the "" Republican Obama "" tag sits lightly on his shoulders , as opposed to poor old Bobby Jindal , the previous holder of that double - edged title ."
2010-04-28,"The St Petersburg Times in Florida is certain that Charlie Crist , the state 's governor , will tomorrow announce that he is leaving the Republican party and running as an independent for Florida 's vacant senate seat in November .
The paper 's politics blog reports : "" Gov Charlie Crist expected to announce Thursday in St Petersburg that he will run as an independent candidate for Florida 's open US Senate seat "" .
It explains : Crist 's nonpartisan bid would allow him to forego an anticipated thrashing by former House Speaker Marco Rubio in the GOP primary and pave the way for a potentially competitive three - way contest against Rubio as the likely GOP nominee and US Rep Kendrick Meek of Miami as the likely Democrat .
That means Florida 's next senator could be elected November 2 with as little as 34 % of the vote , upending the usual quest for mass appeal in an increasingly diverse state of 11 million voters .
Quite what this means for Florida and the Republican party remains to be seen .
Just under two years ago Crist was mentioned as a possible vice presidential running mate for John McCain .
Now he 's out of the party .
It 's a Republican version of Joe Lieberman ."
2010-04-30,"As widely forecast , Florida 's governor Charlie Crist has abandoned the Republican party and decided to run for his state 's vacant US Senate seat as an independent .
And while he was trailing his rival Marco Rubio according to polls in the Republican primary , by running as independent Crist still has a chance of winning the Senate seat come 6 November on as little as 34 % of the vote .
Despite that , Crist still has a long way to go to win the seat , against two powerful party organisations in Florida .
As governor Crist has high name recognition and he has proved in the past to be a tough campaigner .
We can expect to see a brutal fight between Crist and Rubio , starting almost immediately .
Rubio was out campaigning when Crist made his decision public , and responded : "" When I got in this race I knew I was running against people that supported the Obama agenda .
I just did n't realize I would have to run against both of them at the same time . ""
For the Republicans nationwide this puts the spotlight on the party 's shift to the right .
In Florida , for example , Rubio has been heavily supported by members of the Tea Party , who excoriated Crist as a moderate – in much the same way that Connecticut senator Joe Lieberman was reviled by Democrats .
In 2006 Lieberman lost his primary battle against Ned Lamont but turned around and retained his seat running as an independent .
In several other states – Kentucky , Utah and possibly California – more mainstream Republican candidates face being outflanked on the right by angrier voices .
And it explains why the likes of John McCain have had to tilt their campaigns towards the right to win difficult primaries .
Because of Florida 's size and importance to presidential politics , Crist 's run has national implications for the 2012 elections .
Unlike Lieberman , who faced hardly any Republican opposition , Crist 's campaign has to deal with a sizable Democratic vote .
And the Republicans are prepared to put extra resources into Florida to aid Rubio .
One weakness for Rubio , however , is that he is the subject of an inquiry by tax authorities into alleged misuse of his state Republican party credit card .
The combination means that a three - way split in the vote is possible , as the New York Times reports : In a six - minute speech in which he was accompanied by his family and about 250 supporters , Mr Crist acknowledged that he was in "" unchartered territory , "" but even the most experienced strategists here are uncertain about what to expect .
Perhaps never before , they say , has there been a three - way Senate race in a major swing state , with each candidate well financed , and so much at stake in terms of the balance of power in Washington .
There 's some excellent analysis of the mountain that Crist faces from – believe it or not – the Rubio campaign , in a strategy memo it put out yesterday : Despite all of its recent problems , the Republican party of Florida remains quite good at a very key thing : targeting and turning out voters on Election Day .
In fact , Florida 's county GOP offices are some of the most organized and sophisticated in the country and will provide the backbone of any GOP turnout operation .
In addition , Crist will be starting from scratch to recruit , organize and mobilize volunteers for his campaign , whereas both Marco and [ likely Democratic candidate Kendrick ]
Meek will have built - in volunteer networks to draw from .
Florida 's Republicans were quick to pour scorn on Crist 's decision .
There was a nice line of attack from Florida 's House majority leader Adam Hasner : "" Charlie Crist left the Republican party a long time ago – today he finally had the courage to make it official . ""
Hats off to state representative David Rivera of Miami , who managed to get Crist 's change of party into its proper perspective , according to the Miami Herald 's Naked Politics blog :
"" This is one of the biggest betrayals in American history since Benedict Arnold , "" Rivera told reporters Thursday , before gleefully repeating the sound bite for a TV cameraman : "" the biggest betrayal since Benedict Arnold . """
2010-11-03,"The Tea Party movement last night wielded a huge impact on the American political process that will ensure its influence for years to come , though it also suffered setbacks to its wilder fringes .
The two big victories of the night , Marco Rubio in Florida and Rand Paul in Kentucky , confirmed that the Tea Parties are not a fly - by - night affair but a real seismic shift in the political landscape that can put fear in the hearts of Republican and Democratic leaders alike .
Both victors unseated establishment Republican candidates with the help of populist Tea Party backing , signifying a general push towards the right within US conservatism .
But there were also signs that the leaders of the movement â€ “ to the extent that the amorphous , bottom - up Tea Parties have leaders â€ “ will have to think carefully about how they chose their candidates after two major figures , Christine O'Donnell in Delaware and and Carl Paladino in New York state , went down to embarrassing defeats .
John Boehner , the likely Speaker of the House of Representatives after the Republicans swept into the majority , gave a clear indication of the sway the Tea Parties now hold over his party 's leadership .
He had a conference telephone call with Tea Party activists in his district of Ohio and told them : "" I will never let you down . ""
Across the board , exit polls suggested that more than one in 10 voters identified themselves as members of the Tea Party movement .
In another important gain for the movement , Nikki Haley , an Asian American , won the governor 's race in South Carolina for the Republicans .
Her victory is not only a boon for the Tea Parties but also for Sarah Palin , who endorsed Haley early on .
In New York state , Carl Paladino crashed out against his Democratic opponent Andrew Cuomo .
Paladino was initially enthusiastically backed by the Tea Parties but then became embroiled in a series of damaging revelations , including details of racist and sexist emails he circulated among friends .
He also had a contretemps with a journalist . ""
Any of my missteps were just me .
It 's just being human .
How can you not misstep in an election process like this ?
"" he said .
Christine O'Donnell , who became the unacceptable face of the Tea Parties , also lost heavily in Delaware .
She struggled against media coverage of her youthful dabbling with witchcraft and her maverick views on anything from masturbation to creationism .
Tea Party leaders have insisted they have no regrets about choosing unconventional candidates who signal that this is a change from "" politics as usual "" .
But as the movement shifts from being a mere channel of rightwing anger to being a real political force , it is likely to come under pressure to contain its more extreme edges .
It now has a new generation of leaders who will carry considerable clout in the shaping of the movement in future .
Rubio in particular has the potential to go far within the Senate .
The son of Cuban exiles , he is respected by both rightwing and moderate camps of the Republican party .
Rand Paul is a more divisive figure , with more rigid anti - government beliefs .
But he has a strong following within the Tea Party movement and will also wield considerable influence in the new - look Senate ."
2010-11-03,"The Democrats taking heavy losses , relinquishing the House of Representatives .
The Republican party resurgent , falling short of its ambition to win control of both chambers of Congress , but registering some figurehead Tea Party - backed winners with the likes of Rand Paul and Marco Rubio entering the Senate .
What a jaw - dropping change from two Novembers ago .
That election night , American liberals were over the moon in rapture , and American voters had proven that they could elect a black man to their highest office and put their nation 's great original sin of race behind them .
This election night , American liberals , sternum - deep in their miry slough of despond , are as depressed as they 've been since the Florida debacle back in 2000 , and Americans may be proving themselves capable of electing to high office , variously : a man who acknowledges he 'd likely have opposed the landmark 1964 civil rights act ( Paul , who walked the Senate race in Kentucky ) ; another who hired a private , brown - shirt - ish goon squad that "" arrested "" a working journalist ( Alaska 's Joe Miller , dropping in recent polls but still in the hunt as of deadline time ) ; and a phalanx of candidates who hope to do away with public state pensions and any remotely meaningful limits on corporate power .
Americans have , however , stopped short of electing their first witch .
All right , Christine O'Donnell , the losing Republican senatorial candidate from Delaware , is not a real witch .
But the other things are true , and a lot more besides them .
The expected Republican recapture of the House of Representatives not only shifts the power of agenda - setting in that body , but changes its ideological character markedly .
Roughly half a dozen candidates will enter the US Senate , and perhaps 40 or so the House of Representatives next year , whose radical - conservative political views would have left them mocked and isolated within their own party a dozen or so years ago .
How did this sea - change in American politics happen ?
The Republicans moved to the right during the Bush years .
But more important , conservative rhetoric became increasingly intolerant , strident , extreme and unhinged ; a 2008 book that un - ironically promoted Adolf Hitler as a "" man of the left "" vaulted up the bestseller charts , its lessons now taken as gospel by millions of conservatives .
Long - ago Democratic president Woodrow Wilson , meanwhile , known to most of us as a modestly progressive idealist , is in the right - wing canon America 's first fascist ruler .
Throw in a terrible economy , with a high unemployment rate ( 9.6 % ) , which has n't gone down in a year .
Add a president whose background lends itself to , shall we say , exotic conspiratorial fabrication .
Mix in policies that were effortlessly painted as socialist ( the bailouts ) or as relief for "" the undeserving "" ( mortgage assistance ) .
Result : the toxic brand of tea of which Americans voters have decided to partake this November .
Obama is culpable here , as well â€ “ and the Democrats generally .
From the president down , they never â€ “ against the right - populist onslaught
â€ “ defended their idea of what society should look like .
Split between their centrist and liberal wings , they saw the lightning on the horizon and ran for cover .
They flailed around for different messages this fall like a bad singer searching for the right key .
Their signal achievement , the healthcare overhaul , was both a historical triumph and a political albatross , and now Republicans will try â€ “ whether whole- or half - heartedly is not yet known â€ “ to repeal it .
The big question in Washington now is how Barack Obama handles this adversity .
He first needs to tell Americans that he heard what they had to say Tuesday .
But next on the agenda will be a major test : an upcoming lame - duck session of the outgoing Congress will convene to consider whether to extend Bush - era tax cuts on the wealthiest households ( earning more than $ 250,000 a year ) .
Obama has opposed it .
Republicans , with the wind now at their backs , are gung - ho for it .
It will be a tense showdown .
Come next year , Obama will need to do two opposite things simultaneously .
He will have to move to the middle on some issues .
Independents , who backed him in 2008 , left his party in massive numbers this year .
If he ca n't get a big chunk of them back , he will not be re - elected in 2012 .
But he also has to fight .
Republicans will pick fights , and they 'll think they can roll him .
And they will hold a constant parade of hearings investigating the administration , trying to snare some big administration fish ( maybe Obama himself ? ) in a perjury or obstruction of justice trap .
Republicans play for keeps .
And now , Obama is going to have to , too .
It 's a long and grim way from 2008 ."
2011-01-04,"I see via Sully that Rich Lowry , editor of The National Review , wrote the following on New Year 's Eve : When the likes of Marco Rubio , the new Republican senator from Florida , say this is the greatest country ever , sophisticated opinion - makers cluck and roll their eyes .
What a noxious tea - party nostrum .
How chauvinistic .
What hubris .
Lowry did n't name any sophisticated opinion - makers who so clucked or rolled .
Probably because none did .
Or maybe one or two did .
But I doubt they 're really either sophisticated or opinion - makers .
I agree with Rubio .
Most liberals do .
Leftists are another matter .
But I have little doubt that every one of my close friends , ( American ) liberals almost all , would vote for the US as the greatest country on earth .
But why does a column like Lowry 's still seem ridiculous and kind of offensive to me ?
Andrew takes a whack ( link above ) :
Imagine that once a month or so , Michael Jordan called a press conference , confidently listed his achievements as a basketball player , and insisted , "" My greatness is simply a fact . ""
He 'd be correct : he was a spectacular basketball player , arguably the best in history .
Same with Tiger Woods .
Or Stephen Hawking .
On the other hand , we 're put off when people announce their own greatness â€ “ experience has taught that they 're usually doing so because they 're a braggart , or a narcissist , or a bully .
( In Rich Lowry 's case , it 's intellectual bullying - wielding the collective club of nationalism against genuine worries about America 's fiscal bankruptcy , academic decline , and economic stagnation ) .
That 's all true .
In addition , I have a somewhat different set of reasons for why I think the US is great .
Here 's Lowry : We had the advantage of jumping off from the achievement of the British .
We founded our nation upon self - evident truths about the rights of man , even if our conduct has n't always matched them ...
So far , I agree .
Then : We got constitutional government to work on a scale no one had thought possible ; made ourselves a haven of liberty for the world 's peoples ; and created a fluid , open society .
We amassed unbelievable wealth , and spread it widely .
Internationally , we wielded our overwhelming military and industrial power as a benevolent hegemon .
We led the coalitions against the ideological empires of the 20th century and protected the global commons .
We remain the world 's sole superpower , looked to by most of the world as a leader distinctly better than any of the alternatives .
Well , benevolent hegemon a lot of the time , but most definitely not all the time .
But let 's set that aside .
I think some things that made the US the greatest country in the world are Social Security , labor unions , integration ( vociferously opposed by , say , the magazine Lowry edits ) , and the high taxation that helped us spread that amassed wealth so widely .
Millions of other Americans agree with me .
Even plenty of rich ones .
We worry that we 're on our way to being a not - very - great and definitely - not - very - nice country , which is what we think we 'll be if the conservatives have their way .
So as I see it , Rubio - and , it must be said , Lowry himself , while a nice guy in my limited personal experience - are out to destroy that which makes America great .
So you could say I think Rubio and Lowry hate America .
But see , I do n't usually talk like that , cuz they have their take , and I have mine , and on the world spins , and I do n't actually think they hate America .
I just think they 're wrong about almost everything .
But conservatives do talk like that , ceaselessly , and they do it to score cheap points , and that 's why liberals are bored by chest - thumpery of the Rubio or Lowry varieties ."
2012-01-28,"Senior Republicans including the brother of the former president George Bush have warned the party to avoid using "" harsh , intolerable and inexcusable "" language about illegal immigration or risk alienating Latino voters .
The Florida senator , Marco Rubio , and the state 's former governor Jeb Bush made their appeal before Tuesday 's primary , being contested by Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney .
The Republican frontrunners clashed over illegal immigration in a debate earlier this week .
The issue is emotive in Florida , which has the third largest Latino population in America .
Latinos make up 13 % of Florida 's 11.2 million registered voters , according to data from the Florida Division of Elections , compiled by the Pew Hispanic Center .
"" We must admit there are those among us that have used rhetoric that is harsh and intolerable and inexcusable , "" Rubio said in a speech at the Hispanic Leadership Network in Miami on Friday . ""
And we must admit , myself included , that sometimes we 've been too slow to condemn that language for what it is . ""
Both Gingrich and Romney have courted the Latino community in Florida and aired commercials in Spanish , but many Floridian voters are upset by hardline measures proposed by Republicans to curb immigration in other states such as Arizona and Texas .
The US is home to an estimated 14 million illegal immigrants , but many US citizens have been "" illegal "" at some point in their lives .
Some Republican leaders have introduced legislation to prevent the provision of services to illegal immigrants , the majority of whom are Hispanic .
Bush also urged Republicans to temper their comments .
"" Hispanic people hear these debates and I think you turn them off .
It 's not a good thing , "" he said .
Romney and Gingrich exchanged remarks about illegal immigration during their televised debate in Jacksonville on Thursday .
The exchanges centred on an ad Gingrich put out which described Romney as "" anti - immigrant "" .
Gingrich withdrew the ad on Wednesday after leading Latino Republican politicians described it as offensive , but stood by it in the debate .
Romney called on Gingrich to apologise , describing the ad as "" inexcusable and inflammatory and inappropriate "" â€ “ unusual language for the normally buttoned - up candidate .
He said it was "" simply the kind of over - the - top rhetoric that has characterised American politics for too long "" .
Gingrich , who has proposed a humane approach to illegal immigrants , stood his ground , insisting Romney was the most anti - immigrant of the four candidates fighting for the Republican nomination .
Nearly one - third of eligible Hispanic voters in Florida are of Cuban descent , while 28 % are of Puerto Rican origin .
Mexican Americans , who account for nearly 60 % of Hispanic eligible voters nationwide , represent 9 % of Florida voters .
In 2008 , Barack Obama won more than half of Florida 's Hispanic vote , although polls suggest Hispanic voters have become disillusioned with the president ."
2012-03-29,"Republican presidential frontrunner Mitt Romney 's bandwagon is gaining speed , with Florida senator Marco Rubio , one of the most sought - after endorsements , announcing on Wednesday night he will back him .
Rubio is one of the rising stars of the party and seen as a future presidential candidate .
He is popular with the Tea party and , as a Cuban - American , might win over some of the Latino voters being lost as a result of the party 's immigration policy .
He is frequently mentioned at the top of lists speculating on whom Romney might pick as his running mate .
It comes on top of former president George H Bush 's endorsement of Romney in Houston , Texas , and the endorsement last week of Jeb Bush , the former Florida governor .
Interviewed on Fox on Wednesday night , Rubio said : "" Well , I am endorsing Mitt Romney and the reason why is not only is he going to be the Republican nominee
but he offers at this point such a stark contrast to the president 's record . ""
Rubio added to the pressure on the other candidates to quit the race .
"" All the candidates in this race have a lot to be proud of .
They have offered a lot to the debate .
But I just ca n't buy into this idea that by their own admission , they are saying the only way they can win this race is by having a floor fight in Tampa in August .
I think that 's a recipe to deliver four more years to Barack Obama and our country . ""
The endorsement of George Bush Sr comes in spite of his wife , Barbara , recently dismissing the 2012 campaign as "" the worst campaign I 've ever seen in my life "" .
Although Bush months ago signalled his support for Romney , it is helpful publicity for Romney in a quiet week without any primaries or caucuses for the two to be pictured together .
The senior Bush 's presidency turned sour at the end , with Republicans unhappy over a U - turn on raising taxes , but his reputation has improved in recent years .
His decision after the Gulf war not to push on to Baghdad is now lauded as wise in some quarters after the debacle of the 2003 Iraq invasion .
Former president George W Bush has said he will not be endorsing any candidate .
Although his former boss is holding back , a senior member of the younger Bush 's administration , John Bolton , is to campaign for Romney in Baltimore on Sunday ahead of Maryland 's primary .
Bolton , a foreign policy hawk and former US ambassador to the UN , announced in January he was endorsing Romney .
In recent days , Romney has picked up endorsements from : Mike Lee , a Utah senator who was elected with the support of the Tea party ; Kevin McCarthy , the majority whip and the third most senior Republican in the House ; and Al Cardenas , head of the American Conservative Union .
They called on the party to unite behind Romney and for the three remaining candidates to quit the race .
Romney has 104 major endorsements : 13 governors , 18 senators - including Rubio - and 73 members of the House .
The governors range across the Republican spectrum : the rightwinger Jan Brewer of Arizona ; moderate Chris Christie from New Jersey ; former Tea party favourite Nikki Haley of South Carolina ; and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana .
Senators include the 2008 White House candidate John McCain .
On top of this , Romney has the backing of hundreds of Republicans from state legislatures , party officials and newspapers across the country .
Competitor Rick Santorum , by contrast , has only a modest collection of endorsements .
In spite of having served in the Senate , no senators are backing him , and he has just six supporters in the House .
The Alabama governor , Robert Bentley , said he voted for Santorum in the state 's primary this month .
Newt Gingrich has the support of two governors and 11 House members .
Ron Paul has a senator â€ ” his son Rand â€ ” and three House members ."
2012-04-11,"Florida senator Marco Rubio and Virginia governor Bob McDonnell have participated in the long - established ritual of ruling themselves out as running - mates for Mitt Romney , who on Wednesday enjoyed his first full day as undisputed Republican presidential candidate .
Rubio and McDonnell join a growing queue of Republicans who insist they do not want to be the Republican vice - presidential candidate â€ “
but they have to say that , concerned they would end up looking foolish if they express an interest and Romney fails to pick them .
McDonnell , interviewed on CBS on Wednesday , said he was happy being governor of Virginia .
"" I got the job held by Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry â€ “ governor of Virginia .
Does n't get any better than that , "" McDonnell said .
With Rick Santorum 's departure from the race on Tuesday , speculation began in earnest over the last big vacancy of the 2012 campaign to be filled , even though Romney is unlikely to announce his choice for months .
Learning from the mistakes of John McCain 's team in 2008 , Romney 's team will ensure their choice , unlike Sarah Palin , will be thoroughly vetted .
Santorum has expressed interest in the post but his harsh criticism of Romney would be exploited by Democrats , repeatedly replayed in ads.""I think Santorum probably is not going to be in line for the VP spot because it 's just been too nasty and contentious , "" Bradley Blakeman , a politics professor at Georgetown University , told Newsmax .
"" I think that he certainly can serve in a Romney administration if they find the right place for him where he can be helpful . ""
Rubio is repeatedly cited as among the frontrunners because he is a Latino , a demographic group that Romney and other Republicans have alienated , and because he represents Florida , a swing state that could determine the outcome of the White House race .
"" I 'm not going to be the vice - president , "" Rubio said , a line he has been repeating since last summer .
But if offered the post , it would be hard to resist a platform from which to launch a bid of his own for the presidency in 2016 or 2020 .
Susana Martinez , the governor of New Mexico , is another prospective vice - presidential candidate , with the advantage of not only being from a Latino background but a woman , a demographic group with which Romney struggles compared with Obama .
Martinez , like Rubio , has ruled out the job .
"" It 's humbling but I 'm not interested , "" she told the Associated Press .
Much of the speculation focuses on issues such as gender , geography or ethnic background , working on the assumption that these will help bring in voters on the margin .
But recent political history shows that presidential candidates have tended to buck this received wisdom , spectacularly so in the case of McCain in picking a running - mate from Alaska , which has almost no impact on the presidential race , and a woman who alienated women in droves .
Conservative commentator George Will , writing in the Washington Post , noted that since the second world war , 10 presidential candidates have failed to win the home state of their vice - presidential running mates .
He argued instead in favour of two candidates experienced in budgetary issues and adminstration , Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal or Paul Ryan , chairman of the House budget committee . ""
So Romney 's running - mate should have intellectual firepower , born of immersion in policy complexities , sufficient to refute Obama 's meretricious claims and derelictions of duty .
Here are two excellent choices , "" Will writes .
Both Jindal and Ryan have ruled out being Romney 's running - mate , as have New Jersey governor Chris Christie , former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty , South Carolina governor Nikki Haley , and Ohio senator Rob Portman .
One of the few Republicans to publicly express an interest in the job is Herman Cain .
Part of the reason may be that he , unlike others , have opted to say he would consider it is because he is a long shot , having been forced out of the Republican presidential race late last year amid allegations of sexual harassment .
Asked by Fox how he would react if approached by Romney 's campaign team about the job , he said : "" I would say ' Let 's talk ' .
It 's not a slam - dunk . """
2012-04-23,"Speculation over Mitt Romney 's choice of vice - presidential running mate intensified on Monday as the presumptive Republican nominee appeared at an event in Philadelphia accompanied by Florida senator Marco Rubio .
Rubio , the Tea Party darling of Cuban descent who was elected in 2010 , could shore up Romney 's perceived weakness with conservatives , as well as helping him among Hispanic voters .
Romney has faced repeated questions about the vice - presidency .
But on Monday , at Romney 's first press conference since mid - March , both men sidestepped questions about a possible partnership .
"" The process for selecting a vice - presidential running mate is just beginning , "" said Romney .
"" We really have n't had a discussion yet of putting together a list or evaluating various candidates .
"" Romney was asked whether Rubio , now two years into his first term as senator , had enough experience to be vice - president .
Romney declined to refer to Rubio directly .
"" I do n't think I have any comments on qualifications for individuals to serve in various positions in government at this stage , "" he said .
Rubio added : "" I 'm not talking about that process any more . ""
Rubio has been questioned repeatedly about the joining the Romney ticket .
"" I do n't want to be the vice - president right now , or maybe ever "" he said last Wednesday .
But Rubio 's comments a day later may have been more telling .
He referred to his current job as "" vice - president "" instead of senator . ""
If in four to five years , if I do a good job as vice - president â€
”
I 'm sorry , as senator â€ ” I 'll have the chance to do all sorts of things , "" Rubio said in an interview with the National Review .
There is no shortage of horses in the race .
Current favorites to serve as Romney 's running mate include Ohio senator Rob Portman , a seasoned campaigner and a director of the office of the management of the Budget under George Bush ; Indiana governor Mitch Daniels , a pragmatist straight - shooter with a reputation for budget hawkishness ; and South Carolina governor Nikki Haley , another Tea Party favourite who breaks the white male mould .
Then there are Virginia 's Bob McDonnell , a former army officer and attorney general ; and Jeb Bush , George W 's brother and a former governor of Florida .
If Romney was elusive in his responses to the running mate question , he was expansive when it came to a topic that has proven tricky for presidential candidates in the past : France .
A French reporter asked the candidate about his memories of the country , where he served as a Mormon missionary .
The question elicited a veritable flood of reminiscences from the politician who last held a news conference five weeks ago , although he spoke not of his missionary work in the 1960s but of more recent visits .
"" I have a lot of memories of France , "" Romney said .
"" I think the best memories were with my wife on vacations from time to time in France .
The last vacation we had there , walking around Paris , and walking not just on the Champs Ã‰lysÃ © es but also over to the Jardin of Luxembourg and around the city â€
“
it 's one of the most magnificent cities in the world , and I look forward to occasional vacations again in such a beautiful place . ""
Highlighting his love of France is a risky move in US politics .
When France refused to back the American war in Iraq , House Republicans voted to rename the sauteed potatoes served in the cafeteria "" freedom fries "" .
Bush 's commerce secretary , Don Evans , said then - presidential candidate John Kerry "" looks French . ""
And a Newt Gingrich ad from the 2012 election cycle , called The French Connection , goes after Romney with the line "" â€ ¦ and just like John Kerry , he speaks French , too . ""
â€¢ This article was amended on 24 April 2012 .
The original referred to Mitch Daniels as an Indiana senator .
This has been corrected ."
2012-06-19,"Florida senator Marco Rubio is the clear favourite to become Mitt Romney 's vice - presidential running - mate , according to associate professor Jody Baumgartner who runs a model to help predict vice - presidential picks .
Baumgartner 's forecast comes as ABC reported that Rubio is not yet on the list of candidates being vetted by the Romney campaign team .
More than 20 names have been mentioned so far as possible running - mates for Romney .
But Baumgartner noted that Romney in July mentioned three names for this shortlist : Rubio , New Jersey governor Chris Christie and Virginia governor Bob McDonnell .
Based on that , he ran their details through his model , which crunched statistical data on 20 previous vice - presidential picks dating back to 1960 .
On that basis , he predicted "" Rubio would get the nod "" .
According to Baumgartner , associate professor of politics at East Carolina University and author of books that include The American Vice - Presidency Reconsidered , his model would have correctly picked 13 of the 20 nominees dating back to 1960 and five of the seven since 1992 :
Al Gore , Jack Kemp , Dick Cheney , John Edwards and Joe Biden .
The model would not have predicted Joe Lieberman and Sarah Palin .
Baumgartner fed into his model details of Rubio , Christie and McDonnell , including the size of the candidate 's home state , regional and ideological balance , years in public office , military experience and age .
Baumgartner said the results of his analysis "" suggest that the probabilities of each of the individuals being selected are : Chris Christie 14 % ; Bob McDonnell 9 % and Marco Rubio 76 % .
His findings come as a separate study of Facebook performance by potential VP candidates concluded that Rubio would be the "" best and smartest "" choice for Romney .
Rubio is frequently mentioned as a potential vice - presidential pick , based on his Latino background his popularity with the Tea Party movement .
But against him are his short time in the Senate and the baggage from an earlier political job in Florida .
As well as Rubio , McDonnell and Christie , other names in the frame include the Republican senator from Ohio Rob Portman .
ABC 's Jonathan Karl reported Tuesday morning that knowledgeable Republican sources said Rubio was not being vetted by Romney 's team responsible for choosing a vice - presidential candidate .
The team is headed by Romney 's long - term adviser Beth Myers .
According to Karl , Rubio has not been asked to complete any questionnaires or been asked to turn over any financial documents .
The reporter adds a caution , saying that Rubio might yet been vetted .
Rubio has a high public profile at present , partly because he is making a lot of television appearances promoting his autobiography , published Tuesday , and partly because he had been working on immigration reform plans .
He says these have been rendered obsolete by Barack Obama 's announcement Friday suspending deportations of up to 800,000 young undocumented migrants and offering them two - year work permits .
Rubio has the support of former Florida governor Jeb Bush and South Carolina senator Jim DeMint , the godfather of the Tea Party movement .
The Republican consultant Ana Navarro played down Karl 's report Tuesday morning during an appearance on ABC .
She said : "" You better believe if he was n't already being vetted he 's going to get a call this week . ""
She was sceptical that Romney had leaked the report .
She added : "" Either we 're being punked and he is being vetted and they are trying to create the element of surprise , or someone has an axe to grind with him , or he 's not being vetted and someone wants him to be . """
2012-06-24,"Mitt Romney 's choice for a White House running mate appeared to narrow on Sunday with one potential pick politely suggesting he look elsewhere and another declining to be coaxed on the issue .
Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty told CBS ' Face the Nation that he "" encouraged "" the Republican presidential candidate 's campaign to "" look at other prospects "" .
Meanwhile on NBC 's Meet The Press , Florida senator Marco Rubio refused point - blank to say if he was up for the job , event when confronted with his own earlier "" no "" in regards to the vacant VP slot .
Last week , it was reported that Rubio was n't even being vetted by the Romney camp for the role .
This was hastily followed by denials by the presidential candidate himself , who said the rising Republican star was very much in the mix .
In an attempt to get Rubio to play his hand , NBC host David Gregory showed him a video of a May interview in which he appeared to rule himself out .
The tactic did n't work .
"" I 'm not discussing the vice - presidential process anymore , "" Rubio said .
All he would say was that he was "" confident , based on his life - long record of making good decisions , that Mitt Romney will make a great selection for vice - president "" .
Rubio , one of the US 's most high - profile Hispanic politicians , also attempted to square the Republican 's position on immigration during Sunday 's interview .
Romney was forced onto the back - foot on the issue after President Barack Obama 's recent announcement of a stay on deportations for young undocumented immigrants .
The Florida senator defended Arizona 's controversially strict immigration policy â€ “ a ruling on which is due from the supreme court this week - but added that it should not be taken as a national model .
He also attacked the White House - backed Dream Act â€ “ which would offer a road to citizenship for many young illegal migrants â€ “ as "" too broad "" ."
2012-07-09,"A few months ago , I looked at who Mitt Romney might select as his vice - presidential pick .
The "" insiders "" agree that the now No 1 or 2 most likely candidate Tim Pawlenty is someone who did n't appear anywhere on my list .
My pick Rob Portman is still at the top of most lists , but the former strong favorite , Marco Rubio , has fallen in most "" insider "" polls .
What gives with these changing tides ?
Well , it turns out that none of these insiders ( and certainly not I ) are actually Mitt Romney or among his inner circle .
Some reporters have better sources than others , but Romney and his team have done a great job keeping his shortlist pretty secretive .
Moreover , this veep guessing game is nothing new .
There have been more twists and turns in vice - presidential selections over the years than you might think .
Candidates who were on no one 's radar slipped in at No 2 .
Candidates who were sure picks ended up getting the "" thanks , but no thanks "" .
Here are five of the more surprising moments in vice - presidential selections since 1980 .
1980
: Ronald Reagan cruised to the Republican nomination after failing to unseat Gerald Ford four years earlier .
Reagan 's choice for vice - president was â€ ¦ Gerald Ford ?
It may seem shocking today , but Reagan wanted Ford to be his No 2 to provide foreign policy prowess and regional balance .
Ford was willing to accept in exchange for greater vice - presidential powers and input on policy and cabinet position selections .
Reagan , it seemed , was actually going to give Ford what he wanted .
The media rumors reached new heights when Ford gave an interview on the third day of the Republican National Convention with CBS 's Walter Cronkite that strongly hinted that the wild idea might actually come to fruition .
The snag was that Reagan 's people realized any benefit they might have received from a seasoned hand was greatly outweighed by the fact that Reagan would have to give up too much power .
The idea died shortly after Ford gave the interview , and Reagan decided to go with his primary rival George HW Bush .
1988 : It was now George HW Bush 's turn to select a vice - president .
Early speculation centered around well - known brands such as Lamar Alexander , Kit Bond , George Deukmejian , Tom Kean , Sandra Day O'Connor , and Alan Simpson among others .
Those did n't strike Bush either as game - changing choices or as plausible .
In the lead - up to the Republican National Convention , Bush still had not made a selection .
Dan Quayle had begun to appear on shortlists , but the reasons not to pick him seemed many .
He did n't come from a swing state ; he was relatively inexperienced and unknown ; and there were many heavy - hitters already on the roster .
But Bush was behind in the polls and adviser Roger Ailes ( now head of Fox TV ) wanted to take a risk to close the gap .
On that basis , Quayle was selected .
Bush would eventually win the election â€ “ but , in fact , it was no thanks to Quayle , who got creamed in a vice - presidential debate with Democrat Lloyd Bentsen and would go on to misspell potato .
1992 : Bill Clinton struggled through a hard - fought Democratic primary fight for the right to take on incumbent Bush .
Clinton was a southern governor and many thought he would try to balance the ticket with a northern senator .
The conventional wisdom is best summed up by the ultimate Washington beltway panel on the McLaughlin Group : in the frame , they had Bill Bradley , Tom Harkin , Bob Kerrey , George Mitchell , Jay Rockefeller , Paul Tsongas â€
¦
You notice anyone who was not on their shortlist ?
The eventual pick : Al Gore .
Gore was seen a young southern moderate like Clinton , so he provided no age or geographical diversity .
He also had openly declared hostility towards the job of vice - president just four years earlier .
Yet , Clinton felt an immediate mutual rapport with Gore .
Clinton would go on to win the young and the old , and in the north and midwest , as well as taking a host of southern states including Georgia , Louisiana , and Gore 's home state of Tennessee .
2000
: George W Bush easily won the Republican nomination , but the matter of a running - mate remained .
He hired former HW Bush Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to head up the vice - presidential vetting process .
That would have made Cheney an unlikely pick , right ?
It became apparent in the weeks leading up to the Cheney selection that he himself was one of the frontrunners .
He had set off major sirens when he switched his voter registration from Texas to Wyoming , as a president and vice - president can not be residents of the same state .
Yet , Cheney remained Bush 's confidant on the vice - presidential selection process .
At the last minute , it seemed like Missouri 's John Danforth , a man who had previously ruled himself out of consideration , might end up as Bush 's choice .
You got that ?
The vice - presidential selection came down to a man who said he was n't interested and another put in charge of selecting the vice - president .
Bush chose the latter , and Cheney would go on to become the ultimate enemy of the left .
2008 :
I 'm not sure anyone needs much of a rehasher on this one .
John McCain wanted to make a "" maverick "" pick .
He floated the idea of going with former Democrat , turned independent Joe Lieberman , but that did not fly with the party faithful .
McCain 's pollsters told him he had problems with women voters , so he told them to find a woman .
The problem was that there are very few Republican female office holders .
Many of the better known brands either lacked charisma or were pro - choice .
Alaska Governor Sarah Palin appeared only on a few "" expert "" lists , and she had n't been vetted as of two weeks before the Republican convention .
Palin only became a serious contender in the week leading up to the convention .
She went through a quick vetting and her selection was kept under wraps .
Palin burst onto the scene at the convention , but her poor interview with ABC 's Charlie Gibson and disastrous one with CBS anchor Katie Couric made her a teachable case of what an unprepared candidate looks like .
Conclusion :
I believe Mitt Romney will likely go with an expected , "" safe "" choice , but consider these history lessons , along with the recent ascent of Pawlenty and downfall of Rubio , as reminders that we really wo n't know who the veep pick is until Romney tells us ."
2012-07-10,"With Mitt Romney close to making a final decision on his vice president running mate â€ “ with Romney saying "" I have an idea in mind "" â€ “ speculation focuses on the first critical decision of the 2012 election campaign : will it be Marco Rubio or Tim Pawlenty ?
Kelly Ayotte or Rob Portman ?
Hovering over it all like a wasp at a picnic is a reminder that vice presidential picks can come with a sting : Sarah Palin , the running mate in 2008 who became more than a nuisance to John McCain 's campaign .
Will the desire to avoid a Palinesque meltdown of an untested candidate cause Romney to make a safe choice in his own technocratic image , such as Pawlenty or Bobby Jindal ?
Or will Romney feel the need to balance his staid persona with a more gregarious character such as Chris Christie or Rubio ?
Alternatively , Romney could fill blanks in his own resume by choosing Condoleezza Rice for her foreign policy expertise , or Portman for his background in trade and budgets .
Here are the leading â€ “ and some not - so - leading â€ “ candidates to be Mitt Romney 's vice presidential candidate and running mate , come the Republican National Convention in Tampa . ""
Intrade chances "" listed below taken from Intrade 's predictions market based on bets by participants .
The figures were correct at time of writing .
Latest figures can be found here .
Kelly Ayotte Born : 27 June 1968 Place of birth :
Nashua , New Hampshire Married , two children Career : Lawyer , 1994 - 1998 ; New Hampshire attorney general 's office , 1998 - 2003 ; New Hampshire deputy attorney general , 2003 - 2004 ; New Hampshire attorney general , 2004 - 09 ; US Senator , 2011-present .
Pros : Relatively young at 44 and articulate , the former New Hampshire attorney general could boost Mitt Romney 's appeal to moderate independent female voters .
Ayotte has been a prominent and aggressive surrogate for Romney on the campaign trail , and her background as a prosecutor has given her experience of high profile public advocacy , having argued before the supreme court .
Cons : Only elected to the US Senate in 2010 , Ayotte 's exposure on the national stage is relatively slim , while New Hampshire politics is hardly a real preparation for a pressure - cooker presidential campaign .
Her brief political career raises the specter of Sarah Palin as a warning of an unprepared candidate thrust into the limelight .
Intrade chances : 2.3 % Chris Christie Born : 6 September 1962 Place of birth : Newark , New Jersey Married , four children Career :
Local councillor , 1994 - 98 ; Lobbyist 1998 - 2000 ; US Attorney for the district of New Jersey , 2002 - 08 ; Governor of New Jersey , 2009-present Pros : A huge favourite among the Republican party base for his robust battles with public sector unions and cost cutting in New Jersey ,
Christie also has a crime - fighting background as a US district attorney .
A pugnacious debater , Christie would be an effective attack dog for the Romney campaign .
His down - to - earth manner would be an antidote to the more wooden Romney .
Christie was an early high - profile backer of Romney for the presidential nomination and a regular campaigner on his behalf .
Cons :
Another relatively moderate east coast governor , Christie 's political profile is similar to Romney 's .
With just two years as New Jersey governor his accomplishments are still thin , in contrast to his girth , which is substantial .
May be too much of a loose cannon for the tight - lipped Romney team , although Christie is said to be aggressively courting the nomination .
Intrade chances : 2.8 % Mary Fallin Born : 9 December 1954 Place of birth : Warrensburg , Missouri Married , two children Career : Member , Oklahoma House of Representatives , 1990 - 95 ; Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma , 1995 - 2007 ; Member of the US House of Representatives , 2007 - 11 ; Governor of Oklahoma , 2011-present
Pros : Her record as a tax - cutting governor from a state enjoying rapid economic and employment growth , Fallin could provide Romney with balance on the ticket with Frontier Strip and southern roots â€ “ and a woman as well .
Cons :
Her low profile in a low profile state makes her an unfashionable choice , and a messy divorce from her first husband might not fit Romney 's wholesome image .
Intrade chances : n / a Bobby Jindal Born : 10 June 1971 Place of birth : Baton Rouge , Louisiana Married , three children Career :
Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals , 1996 - 98 ; President of the University of Louisiana System , 1999 - 2001 ; Assistant secretary of Department of Health and Human Services , 2001 - 03 ; Member of the US House of Representatives , 2005 - 08 ; Governor of Louisiana , 2008-present Pros : A Rhodes Scholar and former management consultant at McKinsey , Bobby Jindal is a technocratic version of Romney , with an accomplished background in public service for a 41-year - old .
Of south Asian descent â€ “ his parents emigrated from India â€ “
Jindal offers Romney an unusual package of ethnic diversity and meritocratic accomplishment .
Popular with conservatives despite his sometimes moderate views , Jindal is another potential future presidential candidate .
Cons :
Jindal probably did more damage to his national political career with one speech than some politicians manage in a career , through his unhappy response to President 's State of the Union address in 2009 , which was widely panned .
His boyish looks and flat Louisiana cadence are untelegenic , while his earnest public speaking can sound more like a professorial lecture .
Intrade chances : 6.7 % Susana Martinez Born : 14 July 1959 Place of birth : El Paso , Texas Married , one child Career : Assistant District attorney , Southern New Mexico , 1986 - 92 ; District attorney , Southern New Mexico , 1997 - 2011 ; Governor of New Mexico , 2011-present Pros :
As the first Hispanic woman governor in US history , Martinez 's advantages speak for themselves with two demographic groups that the Republicans need help winning over .
As a district attorney she fought high profile child abuse and child murder cases .
For bipartisan appeal , Martinez ran as a Democrat until 1995 , when she switched parties .
Cons :
As with Kelly Ayotte , the specter of Sarah Palin hangs over a relatively unknown governor .
More importantly , Martinez has repeatedly denied any interest in serving as vice president , citing the needs of her developmentally disabled sister and father with Alzheimer 's disease , as well as her commitment to serve a full term as New Mexico governor .
Intrade chances :
1 % Bob McDonnell Born : 15 June 1954 Place of birth :
Philadelphia , Pennsylvania Married , five children
Career : US Army , 1976 - 81 ; Member of Virginia House of Delegates , 1993 - 2006 ; Attorney General of Virginia , 2006 - 09 ; Governor of Virginia , 2010-present .
Pros : TV news anchor handsome and a former lieutenant - colonel in the US Army , McDonnell would look the part .
His daughter Jeanine served with the US Army in Iraq .
McDonnell is popular with conservatives for his actions as governor , including his efforts to restrict abortion rights and loosen gun carrying regulations .
Virginia is a swing state that Republicans are eager to retake in 2012 .
Cons : McDonnell 's active military service was as a medical supply officer posted to Germany and the US .
His advocacy of anti - abortion positions , including requiring a vaginal ultrasound examination before an abortion , is unlikely to improve Romney 's support among women .
An underwhelming speaker , McDonnell mirrors Romney 's weaknesses as a campaigner .
Intrade chances :
2.7 % Tim Pawlenty Born :
27 November 1960 Place of birth :
St Paul , Minnesota Married , two children Career : Lawyer , software company executive .
Minnesota House of Representatives , 1992 - 2002 , House majority leader 1999 - 2002 .
Governor of Minnesota , 2003 - 11 .
Pros : A candidate for the 2012 GOP nomination himself , Pawlenty dropped out before voting started and endorsed Romney , making him an early high - profile supporter .
Solid and reliable , Pawlenty is better liked by the Republican grassroots .
Similar in mold to Romney as a technocratic Republican governing a largely Democratic state , a Romney - Pawlenty ticket would be close to the Clinton - Gore ticket in 1992 .
Cons :
Like Romney , Pawlenty is hardly an inspiring speaker or burdened by excess charisma .
His name recognition is low outside of Republican circles , and he failed to make much impact during his abortive presidential run .
A Romney - Pawlenty ticket is unlikely to fire up the GOP 's grassroots .
Intrade chances : 17.6 % Rob Portman Born : 19 December 1955 Place of birth : Cincinnati , Ohio Married , three children Career : White House lawyer , 1989 - 91 ; Member of the US House of Representatives , 1993 - 2005 ; US Trade Representative 2005 - 06 ; Director of the Office of Management and Budget 2006 - 07 ; US Senator , 2011-present Pros :
A budget policy wonk , Portman could reinforce Romney 's determination to make federal spending an issue .
Personable and relatively moderate , Portman fits close to Romney 's mold , with a family background in business .
Portman campaigned for Romney in Ohio 's Republican primary , with Ohio another important swing state in 2012 .
A favourite of many GOP insiders .
Cons : Low profile and a safe rather than sexy choice , Portman brings little glamour to a ticket that could do with some .
His previous post as OMB director under George Bush could be a minus , given the Bush administration 's dismal fiscal record .
Intrade chances :
32 % Condoleezza Rice Born :
14 November 1954 Place of birth :
Birmingham , Alabama Single Career :
Provost of Stanford University , 1993 - 99 ; National Security Advisor 2001 - 05 ; US Secretary of State 2005 - 09 ; Professor , Stanford University 2009-present Pros : Her long list of foreign policy credentials would supply an important facet that Romney sorely lacks .
As a senior member of the Bush administration she would also help bring on board a section of the GOP that has been sceptical of Romney .
And as an African - American woman , Rice would instantly balance Romney 's ticket .
Cons : Memories of the Bush administration , particularly Iraq , may not endear her to swing voters and offer an easy line of attack from the Obama campaign .
Her past statements on abortion suggest she is mildly pro - choice , which will be unpopular with sections of the GOP base .
Despite her years in the White House , Rice has never held elected office , making her an inexperienced campaigner .
Intrade chances :
4.1 % Marco Rubio Born :
28 May 1971 Place of birth : Miami , Florida Married , four children Career : West Miami City Commission 1998 - 2000 ; Member of the Florida House of Representatives 2000 - 08 ; US Senator
2011-present Pros : The son of Cuban immigrants , Rubio would give substance to Republican outreach to Hispanic voters .
A native of Florida , a key swing state in 2012 , Rubio is also beloved by the Tea Party , which helped him defeat moderate Republican Charlie Crist in Florida 's 2010 Senate primary .
Handsome and articulate .
Cons :
Young , aged 40 , with little experience outside of government and relatively untested on the national stage , having been a US senator for little over a year , Rubio may also be hurt by "" Palin syndrome "" .
His overt support for immigration reform may not endear him to the GOP base .
Intrade chances : 9.2 % Paul Ryan Born : 29 January 1970 Place of birth : Janesville , Wisconsin Married , three children Career : Congressional aide and speechwriter , 1990 - 98 ; Member of the US House of Representatives , 1999-present .
Chairman of the House Budget committee , 2011-present .
Pros : A fresh - faced budgetary wonk , Ryan was catapulted into GOP stardom with his 2011 authorship of budget - slashing programme The Path to Prosperity , often called the Ryan Plan , the Republican response to the Obama administration 's budget proposals .
Since then Ryan has been the party 's face of spending cuts , endearing him to fiscal hawks and Tea Party supporters .
Cons :
Ryan adds little to a Romney ticket other than a commitment to budget cuts that scares sections of the electorate , especially those affected by his proposals to radically transform Medicare .
Despite his deficit - reducing rhetoric , Ryan voted for budget - busting measures including the Troubled Asset Relief Program , the government support for GM and Chrysler , and the costly Medicare Part D expansion .
His entire career has been spent around government in Washington DC , which cuts against Romney 's outsider - business pitch .
Intrade chances :
4.1 % Scott Walker Born :
2 November 1967 Place of birth : Colorado Springs , Colorado Married , two children Career : Member of Wisconsin state assembly , 1993 - 2002 ; Milwaukee County Executive , 2002 - 2010 ; Governor of Wisconsin , 2011-present Pros :
If one VP choice could electrify the GOP base for Romney it would be this : the hugely controversial Walker , who successfully fought a high - profile recall election in Wisconsin after his combination of tax cuts for businesses , assaults on pensions , budget cuts and public sector union busting .
All of which has made him a hero in Republican circles and a future presidential contender .
Cons :
Electrifying the Republican base would also jolt the Democratic base into life , and could transform the election into the sort of bitter ideological fights seen around the State Capitol in Madison last year .
That is at odds with Romney 's "" safe pair of hands "" image .
Intrade chances : 0.2 %"
2012-07-28,"With Mitt Romney overseas on a gaffe - ridden jaunt , his would - be deputies are taking up the campaigning slack back at home , jockeying for position as they press the flesh on the campaign trail .
Tim Pawlenty , Rob Portman , Bobby Jindal and Marco Rubio â€ “ all mentioned to a greater or lesser degree as potential vice - presidential picks â€ “ are all in swing states over the weekend , participating in events designed to bolster support for the Republican ticket .
But with the presidential candidate himself winging it to Israel for a reception he hopes will be better than the one he received in London , the coast is clear for one of the would be running - mates to start , well , making the running .
Of the crop being touted , Ohio senator Rob Portman is the man that the clever money appears to be settling on .
His stock rose on Friday with the intervention of leading Republican congressman John Boehner .
In an interview with Fox News , the House speaker vouched for his long - standing friend and fellow state politico .
"" I 'm partial to Rob Portman , "" Boehner told Fox 's Greta Van Susteren , adding : "" I think he 'd be a great asset for Governor Romney .
While Portman campaigns in Ohio , his potential rivals for the vacant post of Romney 's running - mate are doing likewise across the country .
Louisiana governor Jindal is set to headline an event in Coral Springs , Florida , with Pawlenty , a former Minnesota governor , heads to North Carolina .
Meanwhile Rubio will be holding a Romney "" victory rally "" in Las Vegas .
The Florida senator is one of the most high - profile Hispanic members of the Republican Party and is thought , by a few , to represent a savvy outside punt for the vacant VP spot .
On Friday , former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani said he thought Rubio to be "" the most exciting "" candidate being talked about .
He added in an interview with Tampa 's News Channel 8 : "" [ Rubio ] is of a different generation .
He makes outreach much more possible to a younger people
â€ “ people in their 30s where the Republican Party has a little bit of a deficit . ""
But the man himself has previously ruled himself out .
Likewise , Pawlenty â€ “ who fits the mould of a safe , if a little dull , right - hand man â€ “ has said the job is not for him .
But "" no "" does n't necessarily mean "" no "" when it comes to answering the VP call .
In addition to the quartet of Jindal , Pawlenty , Portman and Rubio , Republican senator John Thune , Rep Paul Ryan and Governor Nikki Haley are all out and about over the weekend .
It makes for a crowded field of potential picks vying for attention while Romney is away .
The Republican candidate has yet to announce a shortlist .
But in a tweet on Friday , Romney aide Beth Myers perhaps provided a clues .
Amongst a list of Tweeters she suggested people follow were Pawlenty , Jindal , Rubio , Ryan , Portman and Thune .
She also threw in the names of New Jersey governor Chris Christie , former House speaker Newt Gingrich , and ex - secretary of state Condoleezza Rice in the "" follow Friday "" message .
As the weekend progresses , eyes will be on who appears to be performing best during Romney 's absence . ""
Absolutely this is an audition , "" explained Republican pollster Dan Judy .
"" They have been auditioning for the last few month .
But I think how they do on the campaign trail with Romney out of the country will definitely matter when it comes down to making a choice . ""
He added : "" Portman is widely viewed as a smart , competent person .
He may not be the most exciting person in the world but he would be a good choice . ""
"" I think you would get even odds on Portman , and Pawlenty will probably be in the final two .
Rubio and Jindal are longer shots , "" Judy said ."
2012-08-11,"The announcement by Mitt Romney of Paul Ryan as his running mate is both controversial and surprising .
US pundits had been predicting a more widely appealing figure in the shape of Marco Rubio or Chris Christie , both of whom , recent polls have suggested , would make Romney a stronger candidate .
Instead , Republicans have the 42-year - old chairman of the House Budget Committee , who has credited the beginning of his interest in the "" economics thing "" with the novels of Ayn Rand .
If Ryan has been unusual among many Republicans in this campaign cycle it is because he has been prepared , in his role on the Budget Committee , to provide a detailed budget for growth and deficit reduction that he claims will avoid "" European ""- style austerity .
Part of a new generation of Republicans determined to rid their party of a reputation for profligacy , it is precisely the detail Ryan has supplied that makes him such a risky pick .
Although Ryan 's headline , on paper at least , seems to echo Obama â€ “ growth over austerity â€ “ those who have crunched his numbers and policies doubt whether his proposals are any different from what economist Paul Krugman has called the "" confidence fairy "" , the notion that the economy can be spurred into growth by relentless cutting .
Indeed , according to some analysts , including the Economic Policy Institute , far from reducing the deficit , his proposals might actually add to US debt and risk the net loss of 4.1 million jobs over two years .
Most controversial of all , and an easy target for Democrats , is his plan to scrap Medicare and replace it with a voucher system .
Which leaves Americans with a stark choice on the economy : between Obama 's proposal for gradual deficit reduction tied to policies for modest growth against Ryan 's desire to slash Â£6tn from government spending .
Seen from the UK , where a rigid cuts programme has delivered zero growth , Ryan will have a lot of work to do to explain why his plan wo n't deliver precisely the same result ."
2012-09-08,"Both of them have a Spanish - sounding surname .
Both have a moving story of poor parents coming to America for a better life .
And both recently spoke to the American people from a primetime slot at their party 's national convention .
But San Antonio mayor JuliÃ¡n Castro and Florida senator Marco Rubio are far from being on the same side .
Instead they symbolise the almighty battle for the Hispanic vote between Republicans and Democrats in the 2012 election .
Each has been selected as a sort of party champion , sallying forth to do battle for the support of America 's 50â€‰â€‰million Latinos , whose votes could decide whether former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney wins the Oval Office or President Barack Obama secures a second term .
The contest has pitted two of the youngest rising stars in American politics against each other .
Castro is just 37 , yet already has a major national profile , prompting comparisons with Obama 's own path to the White House .
Meanwhile Rubio , 41 , is a Tea Party favourite often touted as a future Republican leader who was even widely rumoured to have been considered for Romney 's vice - presidential shortlist this year .
Both men are the children of immigrants â€ “ from Mexico and Cuba respectively â€ “ and both gave widely praised speeches that wowed their fans .
Yet , mirroring the many splits in American Hispanics ' own communities , that is where the similarities end .
Rubio is a darling of the right wing of the Republican party and beats the drum for slashing government spending .
He is staunchly anti - abortion and has said that gay marriage goes against his Christian faith .
Castro , meanwhile , has served as the grand marshal in his city 's gay rights parade , praises the role of government in society and is the child of a leftist civil - rights - campaigning single mother .
Each man therefore represents a radically different vision of what his party thinks will appeal to Hispanic voters .
"" Both parties need to show that they are open and attractive to Hispanic voters , but they are not at all a unified bloc , "" said Professor Scott McLean , a political scientist at Quinnipiac University .
So far it is a battle that Castro and the Democrats have been winning .
In 2008 , Latino voters went for Obama by almost 70 % and current polling â€ “ though showing a drop in support â€ “ still has the Democrat ahead of Romney by 63 % to 28 % .
In the recent Charlotte party convention , Castro was given the all - important keynote address â€ “ the first Hispanic to fill that spot â€ “ but other Latino party bigwigs were given prominence too .
Much was made of Obama 's appointment of the first Hispanic woman to the Supreme Court in Sonia Sotomayor , and the president was also lauded for recent moves to lift the threat of deportation from millions of young illegal immigrants brought to the US as children .
It is that thorny issue of illegal immigration that is the Democrats ' real strength .
Though Obama is hardly liberal on the issue , the Republican party has moved far to the right , embracing controversial measures against illegal immigration in states such as Arizona .
Yet one study has estimated that some 9.5 million people â€ “ the vast majority of them likely to be Latino â€ “ live in "" mixed "" households where at least one person is illegal .
In such homes , harsh Republican rhetoric on immigration is always going to be offputting .
"" That is the wedge issue that keeps Latinos from the Republican party , "" said Professor Gabriel Sanchez , an expert in Latino politics at the University of New Mexico .
Yet Republican strategists believe they have an ace up their sleeves in the party 's embrace of conservative social values that are often shared by many Hispanics , who are often deeply Roman Catholic and family - oriented .
Rubio and other leading Republicans , such as Texan Senate candidate Ted Cruz and New Mexico governor Susana Martinez , frequently tout their social values .
But it has not been a winner overall , because Latino social conservatism often goes hand - in - hand with a belief in government welfare programmes as a way out of poverty for a demographic often much poorer than its white equivalent .
This is especially true as the economic aftershocks of the Great Recession are still being felt while Republicans tout massive cuts to healthcare , education grants and food stamps .
"" Who cares about two guys getting married when you want a job ? "" said Professor Stephen NuÃ±o , a political scientist at Northern Arizona University .
"" In the end , a voter is not going to forget Republican hostility and that the party wants to deport their uncle . ""
Many experts believe the Republican party faces disaster in the future as Hispanics became an ever more vital part of the electorate .
In 2008 , some 10.2 million voted , a whopping 25 % increase on 2004 ( in the early 1990s , only 2 % of the electorate was Hispanic ) .
It is a number certain to leap again in 2012 .
Recent surveys have shown that Hispanics represent more than half of all US population growth over the past decade .
Due to a youthful population profile , they already represent one in four Americans under the age of 18 . ""
The numbers are compelling , "" said Sanchez .
So , too , is the geography .
One of the fastest areas of Latino population growth is the Republican heartland of the south .
If the Republican party does not in some way attract Hispanics , it will face a withering of support even in the reddest of red states .
The battle is already on for Texas â€ “ a solidly Republican state that is home to both Castro and Cruz .
It is noticeable that Texas 's Republican governor , Rick Perry , is already softer on aspects of illegal immigration policy than the Republican mainstream .
But if the Republicans are to compete nationally as the voice of Hispanics , if Marco Rubio is to best Julian Castro on the national stage , then the Republican party itself will have to change .
"" It has to .
But I do n't see that that is going to happen for a very long time , "" said NuÃ±o ."
2012-09-10,"Good for the Republicans trying to mix it up , color - wise .
Speakers at their convention last month included South Carolina Governor Nimrata "" Nikki "" Haley , whose parents emigrated from the Punjab , and Mia Love , a Haitian - American Mormon running for congress in Utah .
They reached out to Latinos with New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez and Florida Senator Marco Rubio , and to African Americans with former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
Craig Romney , the nominee 's youngest son , even gave a speech in Spanish .
But a few sprinkles of chocolate and caramel do n't change the overall flavour : Republicans are still vanilla .
A recent NBC / Wall Street Journal poll showed that among African Americans , Mitt Romney polls at 0 % .
Yes , zero .
That does n't mean absolutely no black people will vote for him : former presidential candidate and pizza king Herman Cain says he will .
So do Representative Allen "" Democrats are Communists "" West , of Florida , and Texas Congresswoman Stefani Carter , who has just been named to Romney 's "" Black Leadership Council . ""
But the poll data mean that very , very few African Americans , fewer than the poll 's 3 % margin of error , support Romney .
He does better with Latinos : between 25 % and 30 % ( pick your poll ) claim they 're willing to give the ticket a whirl .
Nevertheless , if the Republicans are to win in November , they will have to do it with white voters .
Romney 's own campaign numbers gurus say he needs at least 61 % of them .
That might work â€ “ this year .
But it will probably never work again .
White America is shrinking .
In 2012 , for the first time in modern history , the majority of babies born in the US belonged to some kind of "" ethnic minority "" .
According to the Census Bureau , in 25 to 30 years , non - Hispanic whites will no longer make up a majority of the US population .
If the Republican party continues to cling to plutocracy , misogyny , homophobia , and racial division , it will be , as President George HW Bush ( surely the whitest of white men ever to occupy the White House ) would say , "" in deep doo - doo "" .
South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham , one of the GOP 's brighter bulbs , worries that they 're "" losing the demographic race "" .
He told the Washington Post : "" We 're not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term . ""
Ed Rollins , a senior strategist , agrees , calling his party "" a bunch of old white guys "" , who are ignoring the way the country is heading : "" We need to basically broaden the base , we need to have more women , we need to have more Latinos , we need to have more African - Americans . ""
Good luck , gents .
Most American women are pretty keen on getting equal pay for equal work , now made easier by the 2009 Lilly Ledbetter Act .
Paul Ryan , along with most Republicans in the House of Representatives , voted against it .
Women also want to be in charge of their , you know , lady - parts .
Yet Republican - controlled state legislatures have tripped over themselves to introduce laws forcing women seeking an abortion to undergo transvaginal ultrasounds to get , as one pious supporter called it , "" a window into her womb "" .
This year 's Republican platform document declares that since "" life "" begins at the nanosecond of conception , abortion is verboten â€
“ even if the woman has been raped ,
even if carrying a pregnancy to term would jeopardise her health .
Zygotes : good .
Women wielding vaginas : bad .
Republicans wonder why "" family values ""- loving Latinos favor godless , gay - marriage - promoting Democrats over them .
Surely , it ca n't just be because conservatives loudly disparage Latino language and culture , denounce the Dream Act , defend the indefensible Sheriff Joe "" Mexicans are dirty "" Arpaio , and see nothing wrong with a little racial profiling ( in 2010 , a California congressman confidently asserted that he could identify the undocumented by their shoes ) is no reason not to sign up .
And why are black folks so perversely resistant to joining the party of Abraham Lincoln ?
Could it be because it 's also the party of Richard Nixon , whose "" Southern Strategy "" exploited fear of integration to transform the Republicans from a socially progressive ( if fiscally conservative ) party into a paranoid , racist - dogwhistling bunch of pro - gun , anti - science , anti - government fundamentalists whose political base is circling the wagons in the Old Confederacy ?
Could it be those Romney campaign ads with all the industrious white folks which state , wrongly , that Obama waived the work requirement for welfare ?
Or could it be the way even the so - called adults of the Republican party have tolerated and sometimes encouraged the constant birtherism of their Tea Party - infused co - religionists ?
Donald Trump 's absurd assurances that Barack Obama 's birth certificate is fake , Mitt Romney 's birth certificate "" joke "" , the bullfrog chorus of Republicans from John Sununu to Sarah Palin repeatedly croaking that Obama is a socialist / radical / elitist hell - bent on transforming America into France
all sound like code for "" Oh God !
He 's a Negro ! ""
CNN presenter Soledad O'Brien put this to a Tea Party leader who dismissed it .
She simply "" does n't believe that he loves America the way that we do "" .
Every time Republicans seem to be making at least cosmetic progress toward inclusiveness , some old white guy shows up and tears off the mask of tolerance : Clint Eastwood talking to an imaginary ( though angry and profane ) black man in front of millions of people ; an apparently - mummified Chuck Norris and his pale wife warning that if Obama is re - elected , your children face "" 1,000 years of darkness "" .
This is what happens when you wrap yourself in the flag so tightly that oxygen ca n't get to your brain .
This is what happens when you want to "" take America back "" .
Back to when ?"
2012-11-18,"Just when you thought it was all over , with Barack Obama still savouring victory , the game starts anew .
Marco Rubio has seemingly kicked off the 2016 presidential race .
The Republican senator dashed onto the field with a trip to the caucus state of Iowa on Saturday in the apparent belief that with over 1,450 days till the next election there was no time to lose .
Rubio went ostensibly to celebrate the birthday of the governor , Terry Branstad , but used the fundraising bash for a campaign - style speech and thinly veiled declaration of intent to seek the GOP nomination .
"" We need to do a better job of going out and convincing our fellow Americans who perhaps do n't see things the way we do , "" Rubio said .
Bobby Jindal , the equally ambitious Republican governor of Louisiana , warmed up on the sidelines with interviews staking out his claim to lead the GOP away from Mitt Romney and out of the wilderness .
"" We as a Republican party have to campaign for every single vote , "" he told Fox News on Sunday .
"" We do n't start winning majoritiesâ€
¦ by insulting our voters .
"" Political junkies may relish the prospect of a 38-month campaign until the next presidential election but others may have hoped for a respite .
The bunting for 2012 has barely been taken down , it is not yet Thanksgiving and Obama has yet to begin his second term . ""
Now that the 2012 election cycle is done , let 's look at 2016 shall we ?
( collective groan ) , "" wrote one Iowa - base conservative blogger , only half - defensively .
Rubio , 41 , may have set a record for campaign precociousness with his visit to Iowa , which holds the first caucus in presidential primaries .
Asked why he had come , the Florida senator grinned and replied : "" For governor Branstad 's birthday , his 66th . ""
He expressed mock surprise that "" people so far from Florida even care what I have to say "" .
As a young , media - savvy Latino with impeccable conservative credentials , many Republicans tip Rubio as the sort of candidate who can appeal to ethnic minorities and dig the party out of its ageing , white demographic trap .
"" I 've been sensing a lot of folks are just trying to figure out what this all means in this new era , with this election having passed , "" he told reporters .
"" I think we 're all going to move on and move forward . ""
Rubio said the GOP could attract Hispanics , who helped swing key states for Obama , with an enlightened immigration policy .
"" People understand that we need to do something to address those issues and they want to do that in a reasonable and responsible way . ""
Branstad introduced his guest by saying the party needed to "" turn the page "" on the Romney candidacy and praising Rubio as the "" kind of inspirational leader that 's going to help point us in the right direction "" .
The Cuban American senator seized the opportunity with a 24-minute speech asserting conservative values and bashing Obama 's plan to increase taxes on those making more than $ 250,000 per year . ""
The way to turn our economy around is not by making rich people poorer , it 's by making poor people richer . ""
Jockeying so soon after an election is not unusual .
It was around this day four years ago , AP noted , that Romney asserted his ambitions in a New York Times op - ed titled Let Detroit Go Bankrupt .
Not , in hindsight , a shrewd play for Ohio but it put him in the game .
Rubio 's trip to Iowa is a bolder gambit which will put pressure on potential rivals like Jindal and New Jersey governor Chris Christie to signal their own intentions .
Birthday parties in other caucus states like New Hampshire and South Carolina may be about to get crowded ."
2012-11-19,"Marco Rubio 's transition from Tea Party upstart to Reaganesque presidential heavyweight is still a work in progress , judging by the Florida senator 's otherworldly responses to an interview published in GQ .
Aside from the rituals of politics that are dispensed with in the interview , Rubio has unusually strong views on the history and nature of hip - hop for a Republican senator .
One ca n't imagine his caucus colleague Chuck Grassley , the 79-year - old senator from Iowa , responding as Rubio did :
GQ :
Did you have a favourite Afrika Bambaataa song ?
Rubio : All the normal ones .
People forget how dominant Public Enemy became in the mid ' 80s .
No one talks about how transformative they were .
Then again , Rubio is n't likely to have tweeted , as Grassley did : "" Assume deer dead , "" after reporting a collision on the back roads of Iowa .
But having paid homage to his family , his upbringing and the need for the Republican party to make a better connection with voters â€ “ "" We have not done a good enough job of communicating to people what conservatism is , "" Rubio says , blandly , to GQ 's Michael Hainey â€ “ Rubio then inadvertently offered a preview of the harsh realities of winning a presidential primary campaign among Republican grassroots .
The first hint that Rubio has his eyes on the 2016 prize comes in his answer to an innocuous question : "" How old do you think the earth is ? ""
And here , in full , is Rubio 's answer :
I 'm not a scientist , man .
I can tell you what recorded history says , I can tell you what the Bible says , but I think that 's a dispute amongst theologians and I think it has nothing to do with the gross domestic product or economic growth of the United States .
I think the age of the universe has zero to do with how our economy is going to grow .
I 'm not a scientist .
I do n't think I 'm qualified to answer a question like that .
At the end of the day , I think there are multiple theories out there on how the universe was created and I think this is a country where people should have the opportunity to teach them all .
I think parents should be able to teach their kids what their faith says , what science says .
Whether the earth was created in seven days , or seven actual eras , I 'm not sure we 'll ever be able to answer that .
It 's one of the great mysteries .
Rubio 's first response , "" I 'm not a scientist , man , "" threatens to become a career - defining meme , if such a thing still exists in the millisecond - attention span of the internet .
But his second take â€ “ ""
I think that 's a dispute among theologians "" â€ “ raises questions about his comprehension .
For all the hilarity over Rubio 's risible remarks , there are one thing to be borne in mind : Rubio is answering with a wink towards the Christian conservative bloc that remains a formidable bedrock of the modern Republican party â€ “ and whose members vote in significant numbers in GOP primaries as well as believing that the earth is about 6,000 years old , despite all the evidence to the contrary .
The "" I 'm not a scientist , man , "" response is not even the most nakedly political answer that Rubio gives here .
After throwing up his hands at any dispute that the earth might not have been created as the Bible lays out , Rubio fails to cope with an even more innocent question : "" Who 's your best friend ? ""
Rubio 's first answer is a politician 's equivalent of a bunt : "" My wife , "" he says , adding somewhat mechanically : "" We talk every day , "" as if that needed saying â€ “ although perhaps it does in the post - Petraeus era .
But when pressed for a best friend besides his wife , Rubio ca n't keep 2016 out of his thoughts : [ South Carolina Senator ] Jim DeMint .
He 's a great source of wisdom as a person who 's had to make decisions that have made him unpopular in his own party .
Jeb Bush is another guy I admire for his ability to analyze issues and call them for what they are .
So there we are : Marco Rubio 's best friends are his wife and the hard - nosed conservative folk hero Jim DeMint , grand - daddy of the Tea Party and senator from the great state of South Carolina , which , coincidentally , holds the first big Republican party primary , followed by a popular former governor of Florida and possible 2016 rival .
At this rate , Jeanette Rubio will be lucky to make her husband 's "" BFF "" list in a year 's time .
And as for Marco Rubio 's presidential ambitions â€ “ as a transformative hip - hop group once said : "" Do n't believe the hype . """
2012-12-20,"It 's what passes for vision in today 's Republican party : recognizing a new political reality and not closing your eyes in denial .
Bobby Jindal and Marco Rubio showed they have it when they called for a more inclusive party following Mitt Romney 's defeat .
Romney showed he does n't have it when he blamed that defeat on "" gifts "" the president handed out to his base .
Another guy who has it : Newt Gingrich , who is now encouraging Republicans to rethink their position on gay marriage .
"" I think that [ same - sex marriage ] will be much more difficult than immigration for conservatism to come to grips with , "" Gingrich told the Huffington Post .
"" It is in every family .
It is in every community .
The momentum is clearly now in the direction in finding some way to ... accommodate and deal with reality .
"" What 's charming about Gingrich is that he did not try to dress up this analysis as a change of heart .
His argument , instead , is explicitly political : The public has moved â€
“
let 's chase them .
"" The reality is going to be that in a number of American states â€ “
and it will be more after 2014 â€ “ gay relationships will be legal , period , "" Gingrich said .
Ballot measures legalizing same - sex marriage passed last month in Maryland , Washington and Maine .
It was the first time gay marriage had passed in a statewide referendum , as opposed to being instituted through a court decision .
Gingrich came to power as a purported budget hawk and has never been a hero to the social issues ideologues in the GOP .
He has shared the sanctity of marriage with three partners so far .
During the recent presidential campaign he showed himself willing to totter plenty far out on the limb of anti - gay bigotry , at one point calling same - sex marriage "" pagan behavior "" â€ “ and meaning it in a bad way .
The underlying sense , however , is that Gingrich does n't care deeply about the issue , except for how it plays on the hustings .
He has shown similarly sensitive antennae on the question of immigration , taking the kind of moderate position during the Republican primary debates that Romney could beat the stuffing out of .
Romney did , and won the primary , and then lost the general against the very argument Gingrich already owned .
As for Romney 's belief that President Obama had used gifts to win reelection , Gingrich had the same reaction as Jindal and Rubio â€ “ except Gingrich , for once , was more succinct .
ABC News asked him about Romney 's remark last month .
"" I just think it 's nuts , "" Gingrich said ."
2013-01-30,"In 2008 , Barack Obama sailed into the presidency on a wave of promises â€ “ most of which he did n't keep .
One was to reform immigration in a nod to the growing US Latino and Asian populations .
To date , there have n't been any significant steps toward immigration reform from President Obama .
Sure , he told the masses on Inauguration Day that this term would be the term for immigration reform , but that sounded a lot like what he said in the first term .
Unfortunately for Obama , Senator Marco Rubio ( Republican , Florida ) is beating him to the punch .
A favorite among conservatives , Senator Rubio is no longer dodging this hot potato issue and is tackling immigration reform head - on .
On Monday , he released a concrete plan for immigration reform with a bipartisan group of seven other senators .
Instead of rolling out an innovative solution of his own on immigration , the president 's speech this week can be summed us as , "" What Rubio said .
"" Now , we will truly see if the Obama administration intends to act .
The problem with immigration reform is two - fold .
First , Democrats do n't want to reform immigration .
If they did , they would have done so already .
The party that pushed through the Affordable Care Act could have pushed immigration as well .
Instead , liberals use it as an issue to dangle in front of Latino and Asian voters .
Second , Republicans are pointing to the rule of law , worrying that legalization would eventually lead to citizenship for those here illegally , which could be political suicide for the GOP .
It 's a valid concern given that about 70 % of Latinos and Asians voted Democrat in 2012 .
However , Republicans needs to realize that deportation is n't a viable solution for the estimated 12 million in the US illegally .
Neither is ignoring the issue .
Republicans correctly want to secure the border first and foremost .
Senator Rubio stated that he will not be part of a plan that does not secure the border â€ “ vital for national sovereignty and security .
He also believes that those who broke the law should have to wait behind those legally in line , and pay fines and back taxes .
These principles were woven into the "" Gang of Eight "" proposal .
Rubio is on the right track , and the GOP would do well to let him lead on this issue .
Immigration is not a bad thing in itself , and it can improve a country 's competitive advantage if looked at , and tackled , from a free - market perspective .
If immigration is reformed wisely , it could go a long way toward helping the struggling US economy .
Across the country , crops continue to go unpicked due to a farm labor shortage .
A temporary worker program with a path to legal status for those who show self - reliance would solve this problem and boost the agricultural industry .
This would legalize and legitimize the relationship between the private sector and immigrant labor .
Once immigrants are here legally , they can contribute to a stronger economy , as they have in the past .
According to the Partnership for a New American Economy , immigrants or their children founded more than 40 % of the Fortune 500 companies in 2010 .
That translates to more American jobs for American workers .
Taking into account that 23 million Americans are currently out of work , this should be a selling - point for immigration reform .
Everyone should agree that the current system needs improvement , so that it becomes more efficient and promotes legal immigration .
The number of visas available to those in the fields of science , technology , engineering , and mathematics should be raised .
If Americans want the US to remain competitive in the global market , they should encourage skilled immigrants to come to America .
Conservatives can do well with this issue if they hammer home the economic benefits of immigration reform â€ “ and do so with engaging and understanding rhetoric .
No one wants to argue against putting food on the tables of American families or expanding the private sector , because it 's a losing argument .
Liberty , independence , and prosperity are what conservatives want for everyone .
That is what drew me to conservatism in the first place .
Those values and principles are also what draw immigrants to America ( as opposed to other countries ) .
If conservatives learn how to communicate their principles to Latinos and other immigrant groups , it would go a long way toward reducing the hold Democrats have on those demographic groups .
Leading on immigration reform is a chance to do just that .
This is the Republicans ' issue to tackle .
They can soften their often misattributed "" nativist "" image while promoting market - driven solutions that would lead to a better and stronger America .
Immigration ca n't be ignored , nor can the wavering economy : immigration reform is a way to address both ."
2013-02-06,"Florida senator Marco Rubio will deliver the Republican reply to the president 's state of the union address on 12 February , party leaders announced Wednesday .
The opposition reply follows the annual address in which the president brags about the past year 's accomplishments and delivers a terminally dull list of goals for the year ahead .
Anyone still awake afterward , and up for more politics , can catch Rubio this year .
The Rubio pick was widely anticipated .
The Florida senator is a 2016 presidential prospect whom the GOP is keen to get in the national spotlight .
As a Cuban - American , Rubio embodies the party 's post - election commitment to inclusiveness .
Also he 's a dynamic , forceful speaker and seems unlikely to deliver the kind of anticlimactic reply that won Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal ridicule four years ago .
( N.B. :
President Obama 's speech that year , a month after his election , was not technically a "" state of the union "" . )
"" I 'm honored to have this opportunity to discuss how limited government and free enterprise
have helped make my family 's dreams come true in America , "" Rubio said in a statement .
"" I look forward to laying out the Republican case of how our ideas can help people close the gap between their dreams and the opportunities to realize them . ""
The Rubio pick is not only good per se ; it also make sense for the dearth of alternatives .
Fellow 2016 presidential prospect Chris Christie , the governor of New Jersey , is at odds with the national party because he ca n't stop bad - mouthing them .
Paul Ryan has already delivered the reply ( 2011 ) .
Same with former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell ( 2010 ) .
( The last time the Republicans called on a repeat speaker to deliver the reply was Bob Dole in 1996 . )
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush is called Bush , a liability .
Former veep hopeful Sarah Palin 's brand is so diminished that not even Fox News wants her on .
Rubio 's national profile has been growing steadily since he joined the Senate in 2011 .
He has emerged as the Republicans ' front man on immigration reform .
He fearlessly joins debates over foreign policy , as when he told John Kerry at his confirmation hearing last month that "" a couple weeks "" more of bombing in Libya would have stabilized the country .
Rubio 's name was bandied last year as a potential Mitt Romney running mate .
The senator 's name recognition is sure to expand with this speech .
Tens of millions of people watch the state of the union address ; 38 m watched last year , and 62 m tuned in for George W Bush 's 2003 fairy tale about Saddam Hussein 's WMDs .
The reply speech is sometimes thought to be a stepping stone to the presidency , and indeed that has been the case for three of the last seven presidents : Gerald Ford , George HW Bush and Bill Clinton .
Far more numerous , however , are the rising political talents who saw their stars fade after answering the call to rebut ."
2013-02-11,"Every once in a while , there is a political leader who comes along as a saviour for his or her party .
Names like Abraham Lincoln , Franklin D Roosevelt , and Ronald Reagan are examples of politicians who marked the beginning of new political eras .
Many have pointed to Marco Rubio as one who may follow in these men 's footsteps â€ “ and lead his party to victory in the 2016 presidential election .
Rubio is said by some to be the candidate who could reverse the Republicans ' very poor electoral showing with the growing proportion of the electorate that is Latino .
He has emerged as the leading GOP figure among the "" gang of eight "" senators proposing bipartisan reform of the nation 's immigration law â€ “ as a Tea Party favorite , he has even made strides in winning round opinion among strongly conservative talk radio audiences on this policy .
And finally , he has been anointed to deliver the Republican party 's response to President Obama 's state of the union address on Tuesday night : the gift of a national stage to a rising star .
But at this point , I just do n't see the 2016 saviour scenario happening for the senator from Florida .
Why not ?
1 .
Republicans like to choose the next in line Since 1960 , it 's been fairly easy to predict who would be the Republican nominee .
Every candidate except for Barry Goldwater has either run for national office previously or been the son of someone who has .
Mitt Romney ran in 2008 , before winning the nomination in 2012 .
John McCain took on George W Bush in 2000 , before clinching the nomination in 2008 .
Bob Dole ran as a vice - presidential nominee in 1976 and a presidential candidate in 1980 and 1988 , until he finally broke through in 1996 .
The list goes on and on .
The best example is Ronald Reagan .
He was someone who supposedly took on the Republican old guard , who thought he was too conservative and distrusted his "" voodoo economics "" .
The fact is that Reagan had actually first run in 1968 as a conservative outsider and lost .
He was more successful in his challenge to Gerald Ford in 1976 , but still came up short .
It was n't until he was well - established and entered 1980 as a front - runner that he took the nomination .
Marco Rubio has never run for president , nor appeared on a national ticket .
That 's not to say this rule is ironclad , by any means , but Rick Perry , Rick Santorum , and most importantly , Paul Ryan are all in better position per this criterion .
2 .
Republicans choose the candidate backed by the establishment One could argue that rule 1 is a manifestation of rule 2 , but the fact is that Democrats and Republicans tend to pick the candidate with establishment support .
That 's the thesis of the book The Party Decides .
The idea is that the candidate who has the most party backing almost always wins .
Thus George W Bush in 2000 , who had never run for national office before , won lots of endorsements from the party bigwigs .
And we saw how elected officials carried Romney to victory by coming out and bashing Newt Gingrich in 2012 , at the moment when he threatened Romney 's lead in the primaries .
Marco Rubio is , at this point , almost the antithesis of the Republican establishment .
He won his Senate seat in 2010 by challenging the party pick Charlie Crist .
Once in Washington , Rubio has continued his anti - establishment ways .
His second - dimension "" DW - Nominate "" score , which has been a pretty good measurer of establishment activity , is negative .
From the debt ceiling to the fiscal cliff , Rubio has consistently voted against legislation that the leadership voted for .
3 .
Rubio is likely too conservative People may be being fooled , currently , into thinking that Rubio is a middle - of - the - road politician .
After all , he 's from the swing state of Florida and is sponsoring immigration reform .
Rubio was , in fact , the seventh most conservative senator in the 112th Congress .
His voting record puts him sandwiched between arch - conservatives Jim Inhofe and Ron Johnson .
Very conservative nominees can win a party 's nomination , as did Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan .
The issue for Rubio , though , is that these folks became nominees when the party had just recently been in the White House .
When the party has been out for two terms or more , the nominees tend to be a lot more moderate â€ “ because the party wants to win and wants a centrist pick .
The most conservative nominee after the party had been out of office for more than two terms was George W Bush , the "" compassionate conservative "" who , at the time , was not seen nearly as rightwing as he later was .
Rubio running from the right does n't make too much sense , especially considering that , these days , somewhat conservative and moderate voters hold a 2:1 advantage over very conservative voters in Republican presidential primaries .
4 .
Rubio is largely an unknown How much do we really know about Marco Rubio , and how he 'd perform on the big stage ?
I mean , besides making a Time Magazine cover story , Rubio is quite untested .
With relatively little media scrutiny , he had to fight through a credit card expenses scandal ( an Ethics Commission ultimately threw out the case ) ; he has also been exposed as having embellished his family history about his parents ' flight from Fidel Castro 's Cuba .
The fact is that we are almost always surprised by what candidates look like once they are under the spotlight .
We found out that Rick Perry could n't debate to save his life .
Newt Gingrich 's outsider status was severely compromised by his lobbying activity when he was out of office .
Gary Hart had , in fact , been involved in a sexual affair .
If past experience holds , there are bound to be more awkward questions for Rubio than he has hitherto faced .
5 .
A Rubio run would face a competitive GOP field This one is , perhaps , the most obvious : there are potentially a lot of very plausible Republican nominees .
Jeb Bush , Chris Christie , Mike Huckabee , Bobby Jindal , Rand Paul , Rick Perry , and Paul Ryan are all not so far - fetched names for a run in 2016 .
Half of these candidates are more impressive than the Republicans that ran in 2012 .
Even if Rubio leads a very , very early field , the other candidates combined total 80 % .
The probability of one of these other hypothetical candidates winning is far greater than Rubio 's chance of taking the pie .
Conclusion If Rubio takes the plunge for 2016 , I would bet against him .
Given the hurdles a Rubio candidacy would face , I honestly would n't be surprised if he never runs at all ."
2013-02-12,"The US Senate voted overwhelmingly to pass legislation reauthorising the Violence Against Women Act on Tuesday , despite the efforts of a group of Republican men who tried to block it .
Florida senator Marco Rubio , who will deliver the official GOP response to the state of the union address on Tuesday night , led a group of 22 male Republicans who voted against the bill , which established a system for helping women in danger from domestic violence .
No women or Democrats opposed the bill and it passed 78 - 22 .
It will now head to the House , where Republican leaders are resisting some of its provisions .
Republicans had threatened to block VAWA , which is generally renewed every five years , over new amendments which would introduce protections for undocumented immigrants , LGBT people and those living on Native American reservations .
House Republicans proposed a weaker version of the law last year but the House and Senate were unable to agree on an acceptable version and it was allowed to expire .
It had previously been renewed in 2000 and 2005 .
Before the vote , the bill 's main sponsor , Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont , questioned why anyone would vote against a bill that just expands protections to vulnerable groups .
"" It is difficult to understand why people would come in here and try to limit which victims could be helped by this legislation , "" Leahy said , according to the Huffington Post .
"" If you 're the victim , you do n't want to think that a lot of us who have never faced this kind of problem , sat here in this body and said , ' Well , we have to differentiate which victims America will protect . '
"" The bill was first introduced in 1994 to strengthen services for victims of domestic violence , dating violence and stalking , introduce stiffer penalties for perpetrators and guarantee women access to civil proceedings if prosecutions do not go ahead .
It introduced the National Domestic Violence Hotline , made stalking illegal , and helped reduce the number of murders by partners .
In a statement released on Tuesday , Rubio said that though he continues to support programmes "" to combat domestic violence , sexual assault , dating violence , and stalking "" , he did not support all elements of the expanded bill .
He objected to programmes that would divert funding from domestic violence to sexual assault programmes .
Women 's groups were scathing about Rubio 's attempts to derail the bill and said that it would cause problems for the Republican party among women voters , a key demographic that deserted them in the last election .
Susan Scanlan , chair of the National Council of Women 's Organizations , which has 12 million members , said : "" Can you believe it ?
Sixty - two co - sponsors .
It passes overwhelmingly .
Domestic violence and violence against women is a scourge , especially in Florida .
He voted against a bill that has been a bipartisan effort since 1994 .
What is he thinking ? ""
She added : "" This is an across - the - board issue .
They have got it in for women again .
Why pick a fight over something which is so important to families ? ""
Scanlan dismissed Rubio 's comments that he objected to elements of the bill .
"" It seems to me that he is squibbling .
It is terribly disappointing , I certainly think it will cause the Republican party more problems with the 53 % of the nation that are women . ""
Terry O'Neill , president of the National Organization for Women , described his comments as disingenuous .
O'Neill said : "" Rubio 's excuse is that it would divert funding .
Well , where 's his amendment to improve the funding overall ?
Clearly he is disingenuous . ""
O'Neill said that VAWA is a highly cost - effective way of reducing violence by providing services to victims and to hold perpetrators accountable for their crimes . ""
Marco Rubio has national aspirations , "" she said .
"" His vote against the bill is a demonstration that the Republican party at the highest level is in the grip of a radical fringe .
He has altered his stance on immigration since the 2012 election .
It 's very striking that the same gentleman does not understand that the Republican party has the same problem with women voters and in the 2012 election , the Republican party also had a problem with women over rape . ""
Two Republican senators , Chuck Grassley of Iowa and John Cornyn of Texas , attempted to build amendments to VAWAl that would rid it of the protections offered to Native Americans , undocumented immigrants and LGBT victims
but they were voted down .
ThinkProgress published a picture of all 22 senators who opposed the vote .
Cecile Richards , president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America , said in a statement : "" We applaud the Senate for taking action to pass a long overdue reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act and urge the House of Representatives to follow suit .
There are few pieces of legislation that have delivered as greatly on their promise as the Violence Against Women Act .
Any additional delay of its passage is deeply out of touch with the needs of women across the country . """
2013-02-12,"Young Hispanic leaders are planning to reactivate the nationwide campaign they launched in 2012 against the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney , focusing their energies this time against one of the most prominent Latino conservatives , Marco Rubio .
The senator for Florida will deliver the Republican party 's official rebuttal to President Obama 's state of the nation address on Tuesday , taking to the air on a succession of TV channels to give the opposition response in both Spanish and English .
Leaders of the "" Dreamer "" movement of young Latinos brought to the US as children and now battling to find a way to citizenship have singled Rubio out as a key target for their renewed struggle .
Cesar Vargas of the Dream Action Coalition said the powerful network of Hispanic activists that was put together during last year 's presidential election to oppose Romney 's controversial policy of "" self deportation "" would now be revived .
They have chosen to focus on Rubio because he is fast becoming a crucial voice within the Republican party on immigration reform .
Dreamers regard the Florida senator with suspicion .
Although he has joined the so - called "" gang of eight "" â€ “ an alliance of eight US senators working to achieve comprehensive immigration reform
â€ “ Rubio has said he would make a pathway to citizenship for America 's 11 million undocumented immigrants "" contingent "" on the US border with Mexico being secured .
Rubio , 41 , has also spoken in vague terms about setting up a border commission controlled by south - western states that would have the power to delay the granting of citizenship until the border had been sealed to its satisfaction .
Many Latino leaders see this as a ruse to stave off granting immigrants their rights indefinitely .
"" We intend to remind Rubio and other Republicans that the Latino community will not accept conditions and contingencies on their citizenship .
We will urge our community to hold senator Rubio to account , "" Vargas said .
Rubio is a Cuban American from Miami .
He became a favourite of the Florida Tea Party when he ran in 2010 for a senate seat , beating the incumbent Republican governor of Florida , Charlie Crist , in the process .
Pamela Gomez of Dream Action Florida said Latino volunteers were being sent district by district to drum up community support for the new focus on Rubio .
"" We have created a state - wide strategy to make sure senator Rubio knows where we stand , "" she said .
Gomez came to Florida undocumented as a child from the Dominican Republic , only achieving US citizenship in 2011 .
She said five or six of her immediate family members were still without immigration papers .
Dreamer groups across the country have pledged to join the new campaign , including those in key swing states that Rubio would need to court were he to make a presidential run in 2016 , as many anticipate .
Nick Torres of Dream Activist Ohio pointed out that Obama won his state with the overwhelming support of 82 % of local Latinos . ""
Ohio is not traditionally considered a state with a large immigrant population , but we are seeing huge growth in the Ohio Latino community , "" Torres said ."
2013-02-13,"Let me begin by congratulating President Obama on the start of his second term .
Tonight I have the honour of responding to his state of the union address on behalf of my fellow Republicans .
And I am especially honoured to be addressing our brave men and women serving in the armed forces and in diplomatic posts around the world .
You may be thousands of miles away
but you are always in our prayers .
The state of the union address is always a reminder of how unique America is .
For much of human history most people were trapped in stagnant societies , where a tiny minority always stayed on top , and no one else even had a chance .
But America is exceptional because we believe that every life , at every stage , is precious , and that everyone everywhere has a God - given right to go as far as their talents and hard work will take them .
Like most Americans , for me this ideal is personal .
My parents immigrated here in pursuit of the opportunity to improve their life and give their children the chance at an even better one .
They made it to the middle class , my dad working as a bartender and my mother as a cashier and a maid .
I did n't inherit any money from them .
But I inherited something far better â€ “ the real opportunity to accomplish my dreams .
This opportunity â€ “ to make it to the middle class or beyond no matter where you start out in life â€ “
it is n't bestowed on us from Washington .
It comes from a vibrant free economy where people can risk their own money to open a business .
And when they succeed , they hire more people , who in turn invest or spend the money they make , helping others start a business and create jobs .
Presidents in both parties â€ “ from John F Kennedy to Ronald Reagan â€ “ have known that our free enterprise economy is the source of our middle class prosperity .
But President Obama ?
He believes it 's the cause of our problems .
That the economic downturn happened because our government did n't tax enough , spend enough and control enough .
And , therefore , as you heard tonight , his solution to virtually every problem we face is for Washington to tax more , borrow more and spend more .
This idea
â€ “ that our problems were caused by a government that was too small â€
“
it 's just not true .
In fact a major cause of our recent downturn was a housing crisis created by reckless government policies .
And the idea that more taxes and more government spending is the best way to help hardworking middle class taxpayers
â€ “
that 's an old idea that 's failed every time it 's been tried .
More government is n't going to help you get ahead .
It 's going to hold you back .
More government is n't going to create more opportunities .
It 's going to limit them .
And more government is n't going to inspire new ideas , new businesses and new private sector jobs .
It 's going to create uncertainty .
Because more government breeds complicated rules and laws that a small business ca n't afford to follow .
Because more government raises taxes on employers who then pass the costs on to their employees through fewer hours , lower pay and even layoffs .
And because many government programs that claim to help the middle class , often end up hurting them instead .
For example Obamacare was supposed to help middle class Americans afford health insurance .
But now some people are losing the health insurance they were happy with .
And because Obamacare created expensive requirements for companies with more than 50 employees , now many of these businesses are n't hiring .
Not only that ; they 're being forced to lay people off and switch from full - time employees to part - time workers .
Now does this mean there 's no role for government ?
Of course not .
It plays a crucial part in keeping us safe , enforcing rules and providing some security against the risks of modern life .
But government 's role is wisely limited by the constitution .
And it ca n't play its essential role when it ignores those limits .
There are valid reasons to be concerned about the president 's plan to grow our government .
But any time anyone opposes the president 's agenda he and his allies usually respond by falsely attacking their motives .
When we point out that no matter how many job - killing laws we pass , our government ca n't control the weather
â€ “ he accuses us of wanting dirty water and dirty air .
When we suggest we strengthen our safety net programs by giving states more flexibility to manage them â€ “ he accuses us of wanting to leave the elderly and disabled to fend for themselves .
And tonight he even criticised us for refusing to raise taxes to delay military cuts â€ “ cuts that were his idea in the first place .
But his favourite attack of all is that those who do n't agree with him
â€ “
they only care about rich people .
Mr President I still live in the same working class neighbourhood I grew up in .
My neighbours are n't millionaires .
They 're retirees who depend on social security and Medicare .
They 're workers who have to get up early tomorrow morning and go to work to pay the bills .
They 're immigrants who came here because they were stuck in poverty in countries where the government dominated the economy .
The tax increases and the deficit spending you propose will hurt middle class families .
It will cost them their raises .
It will cost them their benefits .
It may even cost some of them their jobs .
And it will hurt seniors because it does nothing to save Medicare and social security .
So Mr President , I do n't oppose your plans because I want to protect the rich .
I oppose your plans because I want to protect my neighbours .
Hard - working middle class Americans who do n't need us to come up with a plan to grow the government .
They want a plan to grow the middle class .
Economic growth is the best way to help the middle class .
Unfortunately our economy actually shrank during the last three months of 2012 .
But if we can get the economy to grow at just 4 % a year it would create millions of middle class jobs .
And it could reduce our deficits by almost $ 4tn over the next decade .
Tax increases ca n't do this .
Raising taxes wo n't create private sector jobs .
And there 's no realistic tax increase that could lower our deficits by almost $ 4tn .
That 's why I hope the president will abandon his obsession with raising taxes and instead work with us to achieve real growth in our economy .
One of the best ways to encourage growth is through our energy industry .
Of course solar and wind energy should be a part of our energy portfolio .
But God also blessed America with abundant coal , oil and natural gas .
Instead of wasting more taxpayer money on so - called "" clean energy "" companies like Solyndra , let 's open up more federal lands for safe and responsible exploration .
And let 's reform our energy regulations so that they 're reasonable and based on common sense .
If we can grow our energy industry it will make us energy independent , it will create middle class jobs and it will help bring manufacturing back from places like China .
Simplifying our tax code will also help the middle class because it will make it easier for small businesses to hire and grow .
And we agree with the president that we should lower our corporate tax rate , which is one of the highest in the world , so that companies will start bringing their money and their jobs back here from overseas .
We can also help our economy grow if we have a legal immigration system that allows us to attract and assimilate the world 's best and brightest .
We need a responsible , permanent solution to the problem of those who are here illegally .
But first we must follow through on the broken promises of the past to secure our borders and enforce our laws .
Helping the middle class grow will also require an education system that gives people the skills today 's jobs entail and the knowledge that tomorrow 's world will require .
We need to incentivise local school districts to offer more advanced placement courses and more vocational and career training .
We need to give all parents , especially the parents of children with special needs , the opportunity to send their children to the school of their choice .
And because tuition costs have grown so fast we need to change the way we pay for higher education .
I believe in federal financial aid .
I could n't have gone to college without it .
But it 's not just about spending more money on these programs ; it 's also about strengthening and modernising them .
A 21st century workforce should not be forced to accept 20th century education solutions .
Today 's students are n't only 18-year - olds .
They 're returning veterans .
They 're single parents who decide to get the education they need to earn a decent wage .
And they 're workers who have lost jobs that are never coming back and need to be retrained .
We need student aid that does not discriminate against programs that non - traditional students rely on â€ “ like online courses , or degree programs that give you credit for work experience .
When I finished school I owed over $ 100,000 in student loans , a debt I paid off just a few months ago .
Today many graduates face massive student debt .
We must give students more information on the costs and benefits of the student loans they 're taking out .
All these measures are key to helping the economy grow .
But we wo n't be able to sustain a vibrant middle class unless we solve our debt problem .
Every dollar our government borrows is money that is n't being invested to create jobs .
And the uncertainty created by the debt is one reason why many businesses are n't hiring .
The president loves to blame the debt on President Bush .
But President Obama created more debt in four years than his predecessor did in eight .
The real cause of our debt is that our government has been spending $ 1tn more than it takes in every year .
That 's why we need a balanced budget amendment .
The biggest obstacles to balancing the budget are programmes where spending is already locked in .
One of these programs , Medicare , is especially important to me .
It provided my father the care he needed to battle cancer and ultimately die with dignity .
And it pays for the care my mother receives now .
I would never support any changes to Medicare that would hurt seniors like my mother .
But anyone who is in favour of leaving Medicare exactly the way it is right now is in favour of bankrupting it .
Republicans have offered a detailed and credible plan that helps save Medicare without hurting today 's retirees .
Instead of playing politics with Medicare , when is the President going to offer his plan to save it ?
Tonight would have been a good time for him to do it .
Of course we face other challenges as well .
We were all heartbroken by the recent tragedy in Connecticut .
We must effectively deal with the rise of violence in our country .
But unconstitutionally undermining the 2nd Amendment rights of law - abiding Americans is not the way to do it .
On foreign policy America continues to be indispensable to the goal of global liberty , prosperity and safeguarding human rights .
The world is a better place when America is the strongest nation on earth .
But we ca n't remain powerful if we do n't have an economy that can afford it .
In the short time I 've been here in Washington nothing has frustrated me more than false choices like the ones the president laid out tonight .
The choice is n't just between big government or big business .
What we need is an accountable , efficient and effective government that allows small and new businesses to create middle class jobs .
We do n't have to raise taxes to avoid the president 's devastating cuts to our military .
Republicans have passed a plan that replaces these cuts with responsible spending reforms .
In order to balance our budget the choice does n't have to be either higher taxes or dramatic benefit cuts for those in need .
Instead we should grow our economy so that we create new taxpayers , not new taxes , and so our government can afford to help those who truly can not help themselves .
And the truth is every problem ca n't be solved by government .
Many are caused by the moral breakdown in our society .
And the answers to those challenges lie primarily in our families and our faiths , not our politicians .
Despite our differences I know that both Republicans and Democrats love America .
I pray we can come together to solve our problems because the choices before us could not be more important .
If we can get our economy healthy again our children will be the most prosperous Americans ever .
And if we do not we will forever be known as the generation responsible for America 's decline .
At a time when one showdown after another ends in short - term deals that do little or nothing about our real problems , some are starting to believe that our government leaders just ca n't or wo n't make the right choices anymore .
But our strength has never come from the White House or the Capitol .
It 's always come from our people .
A people united by the American idea that , if you have a dream and you are willing to work hard , nothing should be impossible .
Americans have always celebrated and been inspired by those who succeed .
But it 's the dreams of those who are still trying to make it that sets our nation apart .
Tonight , all across this land , parents will hold their newborn children in their arms for the first time .
For many of these parents life has not gone the way they had planned .
Maybe they were born into circumstances they 've found difficult to escape .
Maybe they 've made some mistakes along the way .
Maybe they 're young mothers , all alone , the father of their child long gone .
But tonight , when they look into the eyes of their child for the first time , their lives will change forever .
Because in those eyes , they will see what my parents saw in me , and what your parents saw in you .
They will see all the hopes and dreams they once had for themselves .
This dream â€ “ of a better life for their children
â€ “
it 's the hope of parents everywhere .
Politicians here and throughout the world have long promised that more government can make those dreams come true .
But we Americans have always known better .
From our earliest days , we embraced economic liberty instead .
And because we did , America remains one of the few places on earth where dreams like these even have a chance .
Each time our nation has faced great challenges , what has kept us together was our shared hope for a better life .
Now , let that hope bring us together again .
To solve the challenges of our time and write the next chapter in the amazing story of the greatest nation man has ever known .
Thank you for listening .
May God bless all of you .
May God bless our president .
And may God continue to bless the United States of America ."

2013-03-15,"I have good news and bad news for Marco Rubio fans : he received an enthusiastic response in the main hall of the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) .
The bad news is that is probably where his popularity peaked .
Sure , the audience appreciated Rubio 's jokes about being thirsty .
Every sip got a laugh .
( Will these continue in 2016 ?
It may not be possible for water to go bad , but surely that bottle has passed its sell - by date ? )
And his ineffable but oft - cited proximity to the last Republican ticket gives weight to the argument that CPAC is still relevant , still a box every GOP hopeful needs to check on their way to the convention .
But institutional legitimacy can cut both ways here : as much as the attendees want to believe that they 're helping to shape the GOP 's future , they have an ambivalent attitude towards its present .
The idea that Rubio is a rising star is itself a truism .
And as he continues to play the scavenger hunt that is the party nomination process ( collecting "" CPAC speech "" , "" hot - button bipartisan legislation "" ) , it has become increasingly clear that he has become a rising star partly because he does not threaten to dislodge any of the dwindling "" red giants "" already lodged in the Republican firmament .
Rubio argued explicitly for the old - wine - new - bottled approach to the issue almost every speaker here has dealt with at least tangentially : why are n't we winning ?
It 's been said that the GOP 's unpopularity and sound defeat of 2012 will provide an opportunity for necessary soul - searching , but if that 's so , count on Rubio to conduct that operation gently , in flattering light .
We do n't need a new idea .
There is an idea .
The idea is called America , and it still works .
So said Rubio , spouting patriotic - sounding nothingness like an old pro .
There 's nothing wrong with the Republican party , he insisted , it 's just misunderstood .
Working people "" see "" the party as "" fighting for the people who have made it "" , and maybe the party is n't even in that much trouble !
So it 's "" foolish "" to think there is some kind of division among its members .
That would be news to those in the ballroom venue at CPAC , whose equally enthusiastic reception for Rand Paul â€ “ who followed immediately after Rubio â€ “ by itself suggests a party in the throes of either an identity crisis or a simple mitosis .
Rand was as brashly critical of the GOP as Rubio had been deferential , as casual as Rubio was disciplined .
Contrast Rubio 's painfully choreographed water schtick to Paul 's easy fielding of a friendly heckle :
Do n't drone me , bro !
The cheers for Rubio came because these ideas are familiar , even cherished , but they are not going anywhere .
You might even say they 're "" stale and moss - covered "" , as Paul described the GOP .
Paul was savvy in how he proposed to roll that stone , but he did n't necessarily offer his own muscle .
Instead , a good chunk of his closing was a flattering portrait of his audience ( all politicians can go soft - focus when the moment calls for it )
â€ “ as distinct from the GOP itself .
You guys , he said , you guys are the smart ones here !
In his own words : "" The Facebook generation can detect falseness and hypocrisy from a mile away .
I know .
I have kids .
They are the core of the leave - me - alone - coalition . ""
Rand Paul is not really a libertarian â€ “ just ask any of the actual libertarians here â€ “
but he smartly positioned himself as a grown - up who understands that the next generation of voters mostly likely are .
It 's amazing how Marco Rubio can be so close to the age of the majority of CPAC attendees , and yet fail to speak to them .
Rand Paul is ten years older than Rubio , but speaks fluent Generation Y.
There 's no question that the Republican party could benefit from a bilingual candidate , but which languages should he speak ?

This article was updated with an additional quote from Marco Rubio at 7.30am ET on 15 March"
2013-04-14,"Florida senator Marco Rubio doubled - down on his criticism of Jay - Z and BeyoncÃ © on Sunday , describing the couple as "" hypocritical "" for visiting Cuba , which is still under US embargo .
Rubio , a Republican being tipped as a potential 2016 presidential candidate , said Jay - Z should have made the effort to become better informed about Cuba 's political past before the trip â€ “ and in particular the rapper 's hero , Che Guevara .
He also missed an opportunity by not attempting to engage with cultural figures being oppressed by the government , Rubio said .
His rebuke came after Jay - Z rapped an open letter to critics such as Rubio .
In Open Letter , Jay - Z who went to Cuba on his wedding anniversary , sang : "" Politicians never did shit for me except lie to me , distort history â€
¦
They wanna give me jail time and a fine . ""
Although the embargo imposed after the Cuban missile crisis remains in place , it has been gradually eroded , particularly during the Obama administration .
Relatives , journalists , researchers and other categories can visit .
The US Treasury Department gave permission for Jay - Z and BeyoncÃ © to go .
There is debate inside the US between those â€ “ especially the older generation of Cuban immigrants â€ “ who regard the embargo as essential to bringing down the Communist government , and a younger generation of Cubans who either do not care or welcome the chance to visit relatives on the island .
Some opposed to the embargo argue it has been counterproductive and that regular exchanges and trade would have done more to undermine the Cuban government .
Rubio , who is of Cuban descent , declined during an interview to rap a response to the open letter . ""
Well , I wo n't rap it , but I 'll say , I mean , first of all , I think Jay - Z needs to get informed , "" Rubio said .
"" One of his heroes is Che Guevara .
Che Guevara was a racist .
Che Guevara was a racist that wrote extensively about the superiority of white Europeans over people of African descent , so he should inform himself on the guy that he 's propping up . ""
Secondly , I think if Jay - Z was truly interested in the true state of affairs in Cuba , he would have met people that are being oppressed , including a hip - hop artist in Cuba who is right now being oppressed and persecuted and is undergoing a hunger strike because of his political lyrics .
And I think he missed an opportunity .
But that 's Jay - Z 's issue .
"" If the visit did not violate the embargo rules , it showed the ridiculousness of the laws , Rubio said .
"" The travel policies need to be tightened because they are being abused .
These are tourist trips , and they are â€ “ what they 're doing is providing hard currency and funding so that a tyrannical regime can maintain its grip on the island of Cuba , and I think that 's wrong , "" he said .
Rubio was asked about the visit on two Sunday talk shows , where he had been booked primarily to discuss immigration reform .
He suggested Jay - Z and BeyoncÃ © should have reached out to fellow artists who are being persecuted . ""
And quite frankly , I think it 's hypocritical of the people who took that trip because they did n't go down there and meet with some of the people that are actually in trouble today , "" Rubio told CNN .
"" If they really wanted to know what was going on in Cuba , they should have met with some of the people that are suffering there , not simply smoke cigars and take a stroll down the street , "" Rubio said ."
2013-04-14,"Marco Rubio , one of the perceived favourites for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 , threw his weight fully behind immigration reform on Sunday , two days before a draft bill is due to be published .
The support of Florida senator increases the chance of immigration reform finally making it into legislation .
"" I 'm very optimistic about it , "" Rubio said , on a morning blitz of the Sunday talk shows .
Rubio is part of the so - called Gang of Eight that drafted the bill .
He appeared to cool on reform over the Easter break .
His Republican colleague John McCain , also part of the Gang of Eight , chided him last weekend for his reticence .
Rubio confirmed the broad outlines of the bill , which he said will propose the estimated 11 million undocumented workers in America be given "" temporary status "" .
During this period , they will have to pay an application fee and fine , show they are in employment and pay taxes .
They will not be eligible for benefits .
Only after ten years or more would they be able to apply for a green card .
CNN reported a Senate aide on Saturday saying the cut - off would be December 2011 , meaning undocumented workers who arrived after that date would not be able to apply .
Another member of the Gang of Eight , the Democratic senator Chuck Schumer , said agreement had been reached on Friday on the last remaining problem , agricultural workers .
"" I expect we will â€ “ the eight of us
â€ “ will introduce a bill on Tuesday , "" he said .
Although the Republicans need to win over Latinos to boost election chances , there is strong resistance in conservative circles who see the reform as a form of amnesty , or a reward for breaking the law .
"" This is not amnesty .
Amnesty is the forgiveness of something .
Amnesty is anything that says ' do it illegally , it 'll be cheaper and easier , ' "" Rubio told Fox News Sunday .
He argued that it would be cheaper for undocumented workers to go back to their own countries and apply .
Some conservatives , after hearing Rubio , remained unconvinced .
Republican senator Jeff Sessions said : "" They have produced legislation , it appears â€ ¦ that will give amnesty now , legalise everyone that 's here effectively today
and then there 's a promise of enforcement in the future . ""
Sessions also questioned the impact on jobs and wages , with a danger of lowering wages .
During the round on the television studios , Rubio disclosed the basic shape of the draft bill , which is expected to run to about 1,500 pages .
After publication , there will be a one - day hearing on Wednesday into immigration reform .
"" You have to pay an application fee and a fine , and you are going to have to stay in that status while you pay taxes and prove that you are not a public charge .
And you do n't qualify for any federal benefits .
And after some period of time , over 10 years that 's elapsed , the only thing you will get â€ “ assuming that the border is secure , that e - verify ( a check on employers taking on undocumented workers ) is in place , that an entry exit system is in place for tracking visas , then the only thing you get is the chance to apply for a green card , like everybody else does , "" Rubio said .
"" The only thing you are earning here is an opportunity to apply for temporary status , and ultimately potentially to apply for a green card , the way everybody else does .
And that 's the process that we are outlining .
"" Tens of thousands took part in demonstrations in Washington DC and elsewhere across the country on Saturday in support of reform .
Rubio refused to say whether he is planning to run for the White House .
He insisted he had not even considered it .
As a Latino , a conservative , popular with the Tea Party , and an easy , confident speaker , he is capable of mounting a serious challenge for the Republican nomination .
Asked on CNN if his support for immigration reform risked alienating some conservatives , he said : "" You know , I have n't even thought about it in that way . ""
His comment was greeted with incredulity by the interviewer .
Rubio , in reply , said : "" I really have n't .
I have a job .
My belief has always been that if I do my job and I do my job well , I 'll have options and opportunities in the future to do things , whether it 's run for re - election , run for something else or give someone else a chance at public service .
And that 's how I view this issue . """
2013-04-15,"Florida Senator Marco Rubio appeared on seven national news television shows Sunday to make his case for immigration legislation .
Rubio is part of a bipartisan group of US senators , also known as the "" Gang of Eight "" , that is expected to reveal their draft legislation as early as Tuesday .
The Republican darling of the Tea Party is starting to sound more and more moderate in making his case for for Congress to act on immigration legislation .
"" Right now nobody benefits from the status quo , "" Rubio told Univision 's Jorge Ramos in an interview in Spanish . ""
The only people who benefit right now are the criminals abusing the people who cross [ the border ] and the employers who abuse their workers by paying their workers less . ""
Rubio is right
but he has to make a stronger case .
He should explain that immigrants are not a drain but a net benefit for the United States , if there is a pathway to green cards and citizenship for the 11 million undocumented living in the United States .
What Rubio did n't detail is how the undocumented contribute to the economy by paying taxes .
If they are given legal residency and citizenship , they will be able to contribute more over time .
According to the Immigration Policy Center , households headed by undocumented immigrants paid a combined $ 11.2bn in state and local taxes in 2010 .
The undocumented also pay billions into social security .
According to the Social Security Administration , paid as much as $ 12bn in 2007 .
Raul Hinojosa - Ojeda of the University of California , Los Angeles , estimated that within three years , the increased earning power of newly legalized workers would result in net personal income of $ 30 - 36bn , which would generate $ 4.5 - 5.4bn in additional net tax revenue .
That additional consumer spending could create as many as 900,000 new jobs , he found .
Legal status also brings immigrants out of poverty , as they are able to achieve their educational goals and seek employment .
In 1990 , 27 % of those aged 16 to 24 who benefitted from legalization under President Ronald Reagan lived in poverty ; but by 2006 , only 15 % lived in poverty , according to a study by Rob Paral and Associates .
Also , in 1990 , 26 % of those aged 25 to 34 who applied for legalization owned homes , but by 2006 , 67 % owned homes , Paral found .
What is not explained in this debate is why people come to the United States without papers at all .
Why do n't they get in line ?
For many immigrants , especially Mexicans , who account for around 60 % of the undocumented in the United States , there is no line .
For example , US immigration laws would grant a relative of Rubio 's from Cuba legal status within a year because of our anti - Castro policies .
However , a sibling of a legal immigrant from Mexico would have to wait for as many as 15 to 20 years , due to quotas .
In the United States , the undocumented parents of US citizen children also face deportation .
One of the best - known cases was of Elvira Arellano who took refuge in a Chicago church to avoid deportation , but was sent back to Mexico in 2007 .
But almost weekly , immigration activists post on Facebook and Twitter news of parents facing separation from their children .
Under President Barack Obama , more than 1.5 million undocumented have been deported â€ “ more than under any president in modern history .
It 's not yet clear how the proposed legislation would help some of those parents reunite with their families .
Rubio told Ramos that the legislation will cover those immigrants who came to the United States before 31 December 2011 .
But it could take more than a decade for them to get a green card , and longer still to become US citizens ; and they will have to pay around $ 2,000 in fees .
This will anger immigrant rights activists who argue that the fees are too high and the waiting period to citizenship is too long .
Meanwhile , Rubio may have a hard time convincing staunch conservatives on his own side , who will label any path towards legalization a form of amnesty .
The right will call for even more border security than what will be proposed .
But under President Obama , the number of border patrol agents has grown , and it has doubled since 2004 .
The legislation also is expected to include a guest worker program , and an E - Verify program that would check all workers ' legal status when applying for a job .
It is not expected to cover gay partners .
So , the legislation wo n't completely satisfy those on the right or the left .
But what is the alternative ?
Rubio said in an interview with CNN 's Candy Crowley said it was not workable that the 11 million undocumented be rounded up and deported .
He is right on that point .
We ca n't keep the status quo , and it 's impossible to send everybody back .
This immigration legislation will generate debate , but there needs to be compromise so that we can bring the 11 million undocumented out of the shadows .
It will take more than a few television interviews to enact that change ."
2013-04-15,"Under a new Senate plan for immigration reform , it would take undocumented workers more than 10 years to earn a green card .
Florida senator Marco Rubio seems willing to talk the whole time , if that 's what 's required to bring Republicans on board .
Rubio went on seven Sunday morning talk shows , including two Spanish - language programs , to flog a developing immigration deal , speaking at filibuster length to a carousel of hosts from a studio in Miami .
It was unclear which interviews were pre - recorded .
He acquitted himself admirably , hammering like a woodpecker from one angle after another , depending on his audience .
On Fox News Sunday he spoke passionately about the importance of improving border security .
On NBC 's Meet the Press he explained his optimism that Republicans would support the reform effort .
On Univision 's Al Punto he immediately invoked dreamers , immigrants who do n't have the pertinent papers despite living in the United States since childhood , and said the plan would help them .
Rubio became the first person ever to appear on seven Sunday shows in a single day .
The feat of appearing on all five principal English - language shows ( ABC , NBC , CBS , CNN and Fox ) has been known as "" the full Ginsberg "" , after the late William H Ginsburg , who in 1998 appeared on all five in his capacity as Monica Lewinsky 's lawyer .
It is unclear whether "" the full Marco "" will catch on as an exploit for America 's talking heads , or whether the challenge is simply too daunting for anyone else to seriously consider .
Rubio , the son of Cuban immigrants , has emerged as the Republican point man on immigration reform .
He is part of a group of eight senators crafting a bipartisan deal that is expected to emerge as draft legislation as early as this week .
A couple of his lines suffered wear from repetition â€ “ at least , for any masochist who taxed his or her TiVo in order to catch all of his appearances .
"" I 'm a senator , "" Rubio said , again and again .
"" I get paid not just to give speeches , I get paid to solve problems . ""
"" This is not amnesty , "" Rubio said , again and again . ""
Amnesty is the forgiveness of something .
We 're not forgiving anything . ""
"" [ Recipients of work permits ] will not qualify for any federal benefits of any kind , including Obamacare , "" Rubio said , again and again . ""
No federal benefits .
No food stamps , no welfare , no Obamacare . ""
As with aging rock musicians , it 's crucial for politicians to be able to make the same sounds over and over without betraying fatigue or boredom .
On Sunday Rubio turned in a performance worthy of Mick Jagger grinding away at Jumpin ' Jack Flash .
On NBC , he faced off with an under - the - weather David Gregory , whose laryngitis made him sound like he 'd just gargled gravel .
Gregory threw up a poll showing Rubio trailing Hillary Clinton among Hispanics in a prospective 2016 presidential contest .
"" Is n't that a sign of just how big the hole is even among Hispanics in this country , between you and top - tier Democrats ? ""
Gregory croaked .
"" This is not about improving anyone 's poll numbers , "" Rubio said .
"" This is very simple .
I 'm a senator .
I get paid not just to give speeches , I get paid to solve problems . """
2013-05-06,"The US Senate on Monday passed a bill aimed at ending tax - free shopping on the internet but the move looks set to face fierce opposition before it becomes law .
The Marketplace Fairness Act , which has cross - party supporter and the backing of powerful retailers , would give states the power to require retailers with sales over $ 1 m to collect state and local sales taxes for online purchases .
The bill has the support of president Barack Obama the majority of senators including Republican John McCain but Marco Rubio , seen a potential Republican presidential hopeful , and Rand Paul both voted against the bill .
The bill passed the Senate by 70 votes to 24 but faces a second test in the House of Representatives where internet retailers and conservatives are already lobbying against the tax .
House leaders have yet to schedule hearings or votes on their version of the measure .
The legislation would overturn a 1992 supreme court ruling that said a state could not force a retailer to collect sales tax unless the retailer had a physical presence in the state .
The bill has aligned unlikely parties .
Amazon , the largest online retailer , has joined its bricks - and - mortar rivals including Walmart to support the act .
Amazon was once a staunch critic of the tax
but as it has built more distribution centers it has become liable for sales tax in more states and is now a backer .
The largest online opponent is eBay , which has campaigned against the bill and organised a mass protest by its sellers .
Other opponents include numerous conservative and antitax groups including Americans for Tax Reform , FreedomWorks and Heritage Action .
Ahead of the vote the National Retail Federation called for Congress to "" level the playing field "" and tax online retailers . ""
The Marketplace Fairness Act is a commonsense piece of legislation necessary to modernize and streamline our federal and state understanding of sales tax laws so that they can keep current with real world change in the marketplace , "" said NRF senior vice president David French .
"" As the retail industry evolves and digital commerce becomes a more prominent portion of total retail sales , it is critical that the tax laws not discriminate between businesses based on how their products are distributed , "" French said .
"" This collection disparity has tilted the competitive landscape against local stores , creating a crisis for brick - and - mortar retailers around the country and in your state , "" French said ."
2013-06-18,"On Monday , Politico reported that "" With immigration , Marco Rubio risks DC insider label . ""
Rubio , of course , has put a lot of chips on the table in trying to push for immigration reform for undocumented immigrants .
And I 've got one piece of advice for Senator Marco Rubio on this issue : run to the establishment .
Run to it as much as you can .
I have not been particularly on board the "" Marco Rubio for president , 2016 "" train .
In fact , I wrote a whole article devoted to the five reasons why I would n't bet on him .
Two of those reasons , however , look a whole lot less applicable in the wake of Rubio 's leadership on the immigration issue .
Previously , I had worried that Rubio would not appeal to the establishment wing of his party .
Rubio had won his Senate seat in 2010 by challenging the establishment candidate , and he has run up an anti - establishment record as a senator .
This was perhaps my main worry about a possible run by him for the presidency : see , contrary sometimes to appearances , the grassroots is not where the power is in Republican politics .
Cohen , Karol et al 's The Party Decides tells us that the presidential candidate with the most establishment backing almost always wins the nomination in the modern era .
Jerry Ford won over Ronald Reagan in 1976 ; Reagan over George HW Bush in 1980 ; Bush over Bob Dole and Jack Kemp in 1988 ; Dole over all in 1996 ; and George W Bush over John McCain in 2000 .
All of these winners had clear support from the party establishment .
Mitt Romney followed that tradition in 2012 .
He had by far the most endorsements from party leaders in the lead - up to and during the primary season .
That 's why I was fairly certain he was going to win the nomination , even as he faced challenges from the "" very conservative "" wing in his party .
The only Republican candidate who has won the nomination in the past 40 years without clear party support was McCain in 2008 .
In that year , however , there was no favorite , and McCain clearly tried to make good with the GOP grandees , after his 2000 bid .
In the end , it worked .
After the first two primaries , McCain became the establishment candidate .
Rubio 's push on immigration reform is going to get him some insider credit .
Faith and Freedom Coalition President Ralph Reed looks favorably upon Rubio 's push .
Most donors like Rubio 's new role .
He 's also bound to win plaudits from the GOP establishment in the Senate , which is pushing for immigration reform .
Overall , this is definitely the correct move for a person who might otherwise be seen as too "" outsidery "" .
Immigration reform has the additional advantage of being seen as a moderating force .
It 's backed by most Americans and is generally supported by the party establishment because it 's seen ( rightly or wrongly ) as an electoral winner .
Rubio 's Senate record paints him as one of the most conservative senators .
He was the seventh most conservative senator in the 112th Congress , sandwiched between Jim Inhofe and Ron Johnson .
As I wrote before , it 's unlikely the Republican party will nominate a very conservative candidate in 2016 .
When it liked Barry Goldwater in 1964 , and Ronald Reagan in 1980 , the party had recently controlled the presidency .
But when the party has n't been in the White House for eight years or more , it goes for a more centrist pick in order to win .
This is n't to say that Rubio should become a moderate .
Far from it .
It 's neither the moderate nor the very conservative vote that dictates who wins Republican primaries for president .
Rubio 's key is to win the "" somewhat conservative "" vote that tends to take into account what the establishment says , as well as wanting to pick the most electable .
By the Buckley rule , the "" somewhat conservative "" bloc chooses the most electable conservative .
That 's the reason that McCain was able to win in 2008 when he lost in 2000 .
He lost the very conservative vote and won the moderate vote in both years .
The switch was among the voters who considered themselves "" somewhat conservative "" .
These are the voters that Rubio must win , if he wants the nomination .
So , I think Rubio is making a smart political play by supporting immigration reform so openly .
It 's the type of issue that will garner him plaudits from the party establishment â€ “ which generally gets to pick Republican nominees .
It 'll help to reassure Republicans that he can win , which will likely be a chief concern for primary voters in 2016 , as it was in 2012 .
At the same time , Rubio can point to other issues where he is an outsider conservative , such as the debt ceiling .
Rubio is proving , perhaps , that he knows how to balance the wings of his party correctly ."
2013-09-25,"Texan Republican Ted Cruz talked through the night in a marathon speech against Obamacare , in a show of congressional theatrics devoid anything other than symbolic consequence .
Reading from children 's books to keep going , a tired - looking Cruz was joined in shifts by fellow conservatives Marco Rubio , Rand Paul and Pat Roberts in a stand against Barack Obama 's plan to extend health insurance in the US .
Cruz 's speech was not technically a filibuster , as it he was merely speaking during a permitted time slot .
Nevertheless he gave one of the longest Senate performances ever , stopping after 21 hours 19 minutes , with occasional remarks by other conservative senators .
The speech was ostensibly intended to hold up the passage of what is known as a continuing resolution : a motion to maintain funding for the federal government .
The resolution passed the House of Representatives on Friday , but is the subject of controversy because Republicans tacked on a provision that would defund the non - mandatory elements of the Affordable Care Act .
But there was never a chance that the resolution would be delayed : Cruz always knew that he would have to give way to a procedural vote .
Indeed , after sitting down , he joined every other senator in allowing debate on the resolution to continue .
Some Republicans have disavowed Cruz 's tactics .
A number are fearful that they will be blamed for the consequences of a government shutdown and , others complain of the difficulty of explaining Cruz 's position : attempting to block a measure that he supports .
But Cruz 's tactics did at least ensure proceedings went at the slowest possible pace .
If his pseudo - filibuster had lasted until 3 pm Wednesday , Cruz would have broken the record for the longest - ever Senate speech set by Strom Thurmond in 1957 in an attempt to prevent passage of the Civil Rights Act .
Cruz began speaking out against Obamacare at 2.40pm on Tuesday and vowed to keep going until he was "" no longer able to stand "" .
Republican leaders , who have disavowed Cruz and his fellow hardliners , had hoped that they might be able to ensure a swift Senate vote so that they had time to avoid a government shutdown when the legislation is passed back to the House of Representatives for a final showdown before Monday night 's deadline .
But Cruz has dismissed this as defeatism and is calling for Senate Republicans to block passage of the whole budget bill when they vote on Friday or Saturday so as to stop Democrats from stripping out language that would defund Obamacare .
Comparing the Senate procedures to a "" rigged wrestling contest "" , he declared : "" Most Americans could not give a flying flip about a bunch of politicians in Washington .
Who cares ?
Almost all of us are in cheap suits with bad haircuts !
Who cares ? ""
Cruz 's own suit remained unruffled throughout , although at one stage Kansas senator Pat Roberts appeared with his tie hanging at half mast .
The Texan first - term senator also revealed that he had swapped his usual ostrich - skin "" argument boots "" for a pair of black tennis shoes after taking advice from Rand Paul , who staged a shorter filibuster last year against US drone strikes .
Invoking the second world war , civil war , war of independence and space race in his favour , Cruz rarely skipped a beat as the night wore on , but his eyelids were visibly drooping by dawn .
At an early stage , he read the Dr Seuss children 's classic Green Eggs and Ham , which he billed as a bedtime story to his daughters .
While the tactic had charm , some commentators pointed out that the book may not have been the best choice : "" The narrator keeps insisting that he hates green eggs and ham , but he 's never had green eggs and ham , "" wrote Matt Iglesias at Slate .
"" When he finally tries them â€ “ he likes them !
The Democrats ' bet on the Affordable Care Act is that it 's like green eggs and ham â€
“ they 're convinced the public will like it when they try it .
Nevertheless , Cruz ploughed on .
Citing sources as varied as actor Ashton Kutcher and the Denny 's restaurant chain , he also deployed the fiery rhetoric that has made him a 2016 presidential favourite among Tea Party conservatives .
"" We need to make DC listen , "" he said .
"" Make them listen to the single mom working in the diner , struggling to feed her kids who has just been told she has to take a cut in hours due to Obamacare . ""
Cruz took breaks of up to an hour while yielding to questions from supportive Republicans but was also challenged by Democrat Tim Kaine who defended Obama 's plan to extend health insurance to low - wage Americans .
At one stage , senator Marco Rubio recited a story about Venezuelan toilet paper factories .
Hours before the speech started , Republican Senate leaders Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn refused to back a Cruz plan to block the resolution , opening the way for Democrat majority leader Harry Reid to schedule the first in a series of procedural votes starting on Wednesday afternoon . ""
Senator McConnell supports the House Republicans ' bill and will not vote to block it , since it defunds Obamacare and funds the government without increasing spending by a penny , "" a spokesman for McConnell said in a statement .
Senate majority leader Reid was also adamant that Cruz would not be allowed to frustrate passage of the bill any further .
"" I want to make sure everyone understands : There is no filibuster today , "" declared Reid at the outset of Tuesday 's session .
Cruz also appeared to acknowledge that he had lost Republican support in the Senate , complaining that lawmakers on both sides were preparing to give away their filibuster rights by allowing Democrats to hold a simple majority vote on future amendments .
"" Our leaders , in both parties , are asking us to vote on a bill without knowing what is in it , "" he said .
Reid will bring a so - called motion to proceed vote on Wednesday followed by a cloture vote to end debate on Friday or Saturday .
This requires 60 votes to pass , but without the support of Republican leaders , Cruz and Lee are unlikely to stop it going through .
After that , Reid is free to introduce an amendment on Sunday to the original budget resolution which strips out the threat to defund Obamacare and only requires 51 votes to pass .
This would mean a so - called "" clean "" budget resolution will be sent back to the House on Monday with only hours to go until the government funding authorisation expires .
Republicans may still choose to force a government shut down at this point , but speaker John Boehner is increasingly expected to allow a vote that would pass the budget resolution with help from Democrats and a minority of House Republicans ."
2013-11-14,"Senator Marco Rubio , the Florida Republican seen as a viable presidential candidate in 2016 , is to be the headline speaker at a conference organised by prominent anti - gay activists this weekend , in a move that will burnish his conservative credentials at a time of fierce debate about the partyâ€ ™ s future direction .
Rubio will speak on Saturday at the Florida Family Policy Councilâ€ ™ s ( FFPC ) annual awards dinner , â€œmaking headlines and news with a major policy speech you will not want to miss , â€ � according to the councilâ€ ™ s description of the event .
The FFPC is led by John Stemberger , an anti - gay activist who has campaigned vociferously against LGBT children being allowed to join the Boy Scouts of America .
He said gay members were a threat to the â€œsafety and security of our childrenâ€ � .
The fundraiser will also honor another prominent anti - gay activist , lawyer Mat Staver .
Staver is head of the Liberty Counsel , an evangelical legal group .
Staver recently sued New Jersey governor Chris Christie , another presidential contender and a man who has urged the Republican party to take less dogmatic approach to gay rights , in an attempt to overturn the stateâ€ ™ s ban on gay conversion therapy .
Staver has called the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act ( Doma ) â€œcontrary to the natural created order of God almighty "" , and said teaching children about historical LGBT figures was equal to â€œsexual assault on children.â€ �
Staver will be receiving the FFPCâ€ ™ s lifetime achievement award .
Larry Sabato , a professor of politics at the University of Virginia , said Rubio was appealing to the Republican base .
â€œThe Republican electorate hasnâ€ ™ t changed one iota .
They are just as conservative as ever .
Rubio has been seen as moderate on immigration so he has to be seen as conservative in other areas , â€ � he said .
Rubio publicly objected to the supreme
courtâ€ ™ s decision to overturn Doma after the landmark ruling last June .
â€œMy hope is that those of us who believe in the sanctity and uniqueness of traditional marriage will continue to argue for its protection in a way that is respectful to the millions of American sons and daughters who are gay , â€ � he said .
â€œIt is also my hope that those who argue for the redefinition of marriage to include same - sex marriage will refrain from assailing the millions of Americans who disagree with them as bigots.â€ �
Gay rights groups in Florida said Rubioâ€ ™ s decision to speak at Saturdayâ€ ™ s event further cemented his position .
The director of Equality Florida , Nadine Smith , said : â€œRubio has displayed his contempt for the LGBT community on numerous occasions but this is probably the biggest slap in the face to date .
He is taking this decision at a time when others in his party are seeing the disastrous consequences of embracing extremists and bigots.â€ � Smith
said Rubio was in for â€œa rude awakening .
The generation he thinks is with him is not with him at all.â€ � Florida Family Policy Council is one of 38 state - based organisations associated with Focus on the Family , the conservative pressure group that has campaigned against marriage equality for same - sex couples .
Stemberger has been president of the FFPC since 2004 , and led a successful campaign to amend Floridaâ€ ™ s constitution to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman , adopted by 61.9 % of Florida voters in 2008 .
He also opposed an anti - discrimination act in Florida that would have have outlawed discrimination based on â€œgender identity or expression.â€ �
Stemberger said the bill was â€œan infringement upon religious liberties , the constitution , and rights of association.â€ � â€œSame - sex attraction has always been with us since the beginning of time .
Thatâ€ ™ s
nothing new â€ ¦
What is new , and what is dangerous and what we oppose , is this artificial , social construct called gay , â€ �
Stemberger told a hearing on the bill .
â€œItâ€ ™ s in your face ; itâ€ ™ s shoving down your throat ; and itâ€ ™ s intimidation .
Itâ€ ™ s not just , â€˜letâ€ ™ s be left alone and letâ€ ™ s just have rights.â€ ™ Itâ€ ™ s now forcing everyone else to agree â€“by
the force of law and lawsuits with money damages .

2014-01-04,"Senior Republican senators including Mitch McConnell , Marco Rubio and Rand Paul represent some of the states most affected by the controversial cancellation of long - term unemployment benefits , according to a Guardian analysis of data released this week .
Democrats , with strong backing from the White House , are orchestrating a major push to restore the benefits , which mostly apply to people who have been searching for work for more than six months .
Around 1.3 million people lost unemployment insurance benefits last week , after a bipartisan budget deal on federal spending failed to include a reauthorisation of the program .
A further 72,000 job - seekers are expected lose their benefits from Saturday , a rolling tally that will continue through the year .
Figures released this week by the Department of Labor , and analysed by House Democrats , provided the first state - by - state breakdown of the first tranche of American job - seekers whose benefits were cut off .
The knock - on impact has been estimated to be costing the US economy up to a billion dollars a week .
Until now , Democrats have been putting pressure on Republicans from states with the highest overall rate of unemployment .
However , Guardian analysis shows that states with the highest flat rates of unemployment have not necessarily been hit the hardest by the benefits cuts .
The variable impact can be explained by differences in regional labour markets and ratios of long - term , as opposed to short - term , unemployed , as well as variations in the way states administer the federal benefits program .
The result is differences across the country in the proportion of job - seekers who have seen their benefits cut over the last week .
Of the 25 worst affected states , most are represented by Democratic senators .
However , in addition to the 34 Democratic senators feeling the most pain as a result of of the benefits cuts , there are 16 Republicans .
They include high - profile figures such as Rubio , who represents Florida , where 73,000 job - seekers have lost , on average , $ 231 a week .
Four in every 1,000 people lost benefits in Kentucky , which has an 8.2 % unemployment rate and is represented by McConnell , the Senate minority leader , and Paul , who like Rubio is considered a potential presidential candidate for 2016 .
The data is particularly embarrassing for Paul , who in recent weeks has been one of the most visible defenders of the decision to cut the extended jobless benefit programme .
For decades , Republican and Democratic administrations have authorised the extended insurance for job - seekers during times of exceptionally high unemployment .
The unemployment rate has fallen in recent months , but at 7 % it remains higher than average .
Betsey Stevenson , a member of the White House 's council of economic advisers , told reporters on Friday that the figures mask an exceptionally high rate of unemployment along long - term job - seekers who have been out of work for six months or more .
That rate currently stands at 2.6 % .
"" To put that in perspective , [ during ] average or normal times we 'd expect to see a [ long - term ] unemployment rate that was below 1 % , "" Stevenson said .
On Saturday , President Barack Obama used his weekly address to urge Congress to reinstate jobless benefits
â€ “ specifically drawing attention to Republicans with high unemployment rates in their states .
"" Republicans in Congress went home for the holidays and let that lifeline expire , "" the president said .
"" And for many of their constituents who are unemployed through no fault of their own , that decision will leave them with no income at all . ""
A Senate vote on a bipartisan bill to reintroduce the benefits is expected early next week , possibly as soon as Monday .
The bill has been authored by Democrat Jack Reed and Republican Dean Heller , who represent the two states â€
“ Rhode Island and Nevada respectively â€
“ with the highest overall unemployment rates , both at 9 % .
Their bill reintroduces the benefits for three months , allowing Congress time to find a more permanent fix .
The vote is expected to be tight .
If a measure to expedite the bill is to receive the necessary 60 votes , at least four Republican senators , in addition to Heller , will probably need to vote for it .
The Guardian analysis provides insight into which Republican senators are likely to face most pressure from their constituents to support Reed - Heller bill .
In addition to Heller , Republican senators from the states feeling the most pain since the benefits were cut off are Mark Kirk ( Illinois ) , Lisa Murkowski ( Alaska ) , Patrick Toomey ( Pennsylvania ) and Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson ( both Georgia ) .
Of those , Murkowski and Isakson are perhaps most likely to be targeted by lobbyists seeking to persuade Republicans to reintroduce the benefits .
That is because both were among the nine Republicans who broke with their party last month to vote with Democrats on the bipartisan budget deal .
Congressional sources have told the Guardian that Republicans who showed a willingness to cross the aisle to endorse the budget deal last month are on a shortlist of those being targeted by Democrats .
Also on the list are GOP senators whose states have suffered particularly badly since the extended benefits program expired seven days ago .
Other Republicans who fall into both of those categories , making them them prime targets for supporters of the Reed - Heller bill , are Ron Johnson , whose state of Wisconsin is the fifteenth worst - affected state , and Rob Portman of Ohio , where 39,100 jobseekers lost benefits last week .
The battle over unemployment benefits is expected to dominate Capitol Hill when both houses return next week .
On Tuesday , Obama will host several long - term job - seekers who lost their benefits in the East Room of the White House .
In his remarks on Saturday , Obama said he he would sign the Reed - Heller bill if it passed . ""
When Congress comes back to work this week , their first order of business should be making this right , "" he said .
He added : "" For decades , Republicans and Democrats put partisanship and ideology aside to offer some security for job - seekers , even when the unemployment rate was lower than it is today .
Instead of punishing families who can least afford it , Republicans should make it their New Year 's resolution to do the right thing , and restore this vital economic security for their constituents right now . """
2014-01-09,"Senator Marco Rubio 's office hyped his speech Wednesday as an "" Address on the 50th Anniversary of the ' War on Poverty ' "" , a rather grand billing given its familiar proposals .
Rubio has slipped in and out of a few different presidential wrappers since he appeared in the US Capitol .
He used to be "" The Republicans ' Obama "" .
His proposals suggest that now he is the Latino Rick Santorum .
In 2012 , Santorum outlined the exact same three - point anti - poverty plan : promote marriage , eliminate federal poverty programs in favor of block grants to states , and "" something something America hope - dream - optimism something "" .
Of these three ideas , I 'm probably most sympathetic to the first : sociological studies do show an enduring link between intact families and upward mobility .
I 'm not sure what the government 's role in promoting marriage should be , though I guess it might include allowing any two people who love each other to commit to it .
Both Rubio and Santorum stop short of endorsing that level of promotion .
There 's also a problem of causation .
Rubio calls marriage "" the greatest tool "" we have to lift families out of poverty .
In doing so , he reiterates the thinking of a generation of politicians who 've turned what they think is a lever into a hammer .
The welfare reform of the 1990s , wistfully recalled by Rubio more than once in his address yesterday , sought to use welfare to incentivize marriage ; just this week a study by The Ohio State University reported that single mothers who marry young and later divorce are worse off , economically , than single mothers who never marry .
Researchers speculated that 's because the "" pool of potential partners "" available to young women in poverty "" does not include many men with good prospects "" , and suggested that programs encouraging women to delay childbirth and prevent unwanted pregnancies would be a better use of government resources .
Rubio spent a fair amount of time lauding the ability of local governments to figure out the most effective solutions to poverty , but one place he and his Republican colleagues are dead - set against allowing state and local lawmakers free rein is when it comes to spending government money to delay childbirth and prevent unwanted pregnancies .
It 's the "" shift all the money to the states "" part of Rubio 's speech that will probably get the most attention , even if it 's not quite the bombshell he 'd like you to believe .
Rubio hawked the idea with an entirely unselfconscious reference to how that approach "" worked "" in the 90s
â€
“
it was that structural shift that "" ended welfare as we know it "" .
There is nothing inherently wrong with federal block grants .
Perhaps Rubio 's proposal ( he says he 's working on actual legislation ) will reveal innovations that are impossible at the federal level .
That structural shift does n't bother me so much as Rubio 's contention that it "" worked "" .
It "" worked "" only in the sense that it got Clinton re - elected and saddled Democrats with the idea that being "" tough on entitlements "" was a hallmark of moderation .
In doing so , it set the stage to make today 's GOP proposals seem more palatable , though they come limned in subtle condemnations of the underserving poor .
So , yes , I guess by Rubio 's logic , welfare reform can be said to have worked .
By the judgment of millions of poor families , not so much .
Since the federal program "" Aid to Families with Dependent Children "" became the block - granted "" Temporary Assistance to Needy Families "" ( Tanf ) in 1996 , extreme poverty in the US has gotten worse : it rose more than 13 % between 1996 and 2009 , from 2.7 million to 3 million people .
The Tanf "" caseload "" has gotten a lot lighter ( by 60 % , in fact ) , but not because there are fewer families living in poverty ; it 's because families that live in poverty either cycle out of Tanf ( benefits are capped at five years ) or are n't eligible for it , often due to "" sanctions "" for not adhering to program requirements .
Those families legislated out of Tanf are often the most vulnerable : those with undiagnosed or untreated disabilities , physical or mental , those enduring domestic abuse or struggling with a learning disability .
Sold under the guise of giving states freedom to tailor welfare programs â€ “ as Rubio proposes â€ “
Tanf actually attached all kinds of strings to welfare , restrictions that stemmed from moral judgments more than an understanding of poverty .
What 's more , the supposed freedom from oversight the law granted states quickly became neglect .
Spending on Tanf benefits have not kept up with inflation .
To put that another way , 99 % of today 's Tanf recipients have purchasing power below 1996 levels .
In every state , Tanf pay - outs would put a family of three with no other income below 50 % of the federal poverty line .
Rubio 's third policy proposal â€ “ the "" America !
Heck
yeah ! ""
plank â€
“ is difficult to argue .
As a nation , we do have remarkable reserves of endurance and will .
We are a nation of incredible optimism , matched by amazing personal generosity .
If we 're lucky , those traits wind up serving the country as a whole .
If we 're not lucky , people expend those reserves just trying to get by .
Right now , there are far too many people who are n't that lucky .
Rubio 's policies would extend that pool ."
2014-01-09,"Fifty years after Democratic president Lyndon Johnson declared a "" war on poverty , Republican leaders sought to recapture the political territory for themselves on Wednesday with a concerted attack on the idea that federal spending is the best weapon .
Florida senator Marco Rubio , a child of Cuban immigrants tipped for his own presidential run , led the charge with a proposal to take most of an estimated 77 separate federal poverty programmes away from Washington and give the money to states to spend on tailored local initiatives instead .
â€œA vicious cycle of intergenerational poverty with complex and overlapping causes will not be solved by continuing with the same stale Washington ideas , â€ �
he said in a speech in the Senate 's ornate Lyndon Johnson room .
â€œThey help people deal with poverty but they do n't help people emerge from poverty .
A nation as large and diverse as the US should have a menu of state and local approaches that are just as diverse.â€
�
The party is trying to counter a perception that it is not interested in the fate of America 's poor after recent Congressional attacks on unemployment insurance and food stamp programmes , but a separate press conference hosted by House Republicans showed it is determined to turn LBJ 's ' war on poverty ' against the Democrats rather than soften its message .
Steve Southerland , another Florida Republican who chairs the party 's Anti - Poverty Initiative , told reporters : â€œWhile this war may have been launched with the best of intentions , it is clear we are now engaged in a war of attrition .
Despite spending $ 15tn to fight this war , big government ideas of the past are not working .
We have a moral obligation to break to the mold.â€ �
Announcing his proposal for ' revenue - neutral flex fund ' to move programmes like food stamps under state control , Cruz was equally scathing of federal approaches .
â€œFor
50 years now we have tried big government and still too many people remain trapped in despair , â€ � he said .
Both Cruz and Southerland called for more emphasis on job creation policies instead and said remaining safety nets like food stamps or unemployment insurance should include requirements for recipients to work , train or volunteer .
But both House and Senate leaders also dropped hints of concessions , as Democrats continue to make political capital from the GOP 's perceived elitism and indifference to widening inequality .
Congressman Dave Camp , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , suggested the party may be prepared to accept compromise legislation that would replace proposed cuts to food stamps with reforms attaching more conditions to their use .
A similar climbdown over the vexed issue of extending unemployment insurance looks increasingly likely after House speaker John Boehner called on Democrats to include reforms and funding proposals in their extension bill .
â€œThe programme as is should not continue , â€ � added Camp .
â€œIt needs reform.â€
�
Cruz also acknowledged that a social safety net would always be necessary , especially for the elderly and disabled , and struck a softer tone : drawing on the personal experience of his working class parents as inspiration for a conservative version of the American dream addressing the causes of poverty rather than its consequences .
â€œWe often hear that this issue is a burden but people are not a liability ; human beings are an asset , â€ � he said .
â€œImagine
how much greater we would be if the dreams and talents of 40 million human beings were unleashed.â€ �
Stagnating social mobility is expected to be the central message of Obama 's state of the union address later this month and defining issue of the 2014 mid - term elections .
On Thursday the White House will also flesh out proposals first announced today to establish five new ' promise zones ' to revitalise struggling areas of San Antonio , Philadelphia , Los Angeles , south - eastern Kentucky and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma .
Whereas Democrats have used the anniversary of LBJ 's speech to reinforce their calls for further measures such as increases in the federal minimum wage , the Republican party is seeking a whole - scale rejection of the notion that Washington should be fighting a ' war on poverty ' .
But independent poverty experts questioned some of the assumptions and empirical claims made by Rubio and Southerland on Tuesday Margaret Simms , director of the low - income working families project at the Urban Institute , which was set up to study poverty after LBJ 's 1964 speech , said it was misleading of Rubio to claim for example that marriage was the â€œgreatest weapon against povertyâ€ � .
While he is right that married couples are much less likely to be poor , said Simms , the causation is often the opposite way around : as unemployed men have worse marriage prospects .
She also said that while Rubio was right to credit states with greater policy innovation
â€ “ citing successes in Wisconsin , California and Massachusetts â€ “ there can also be huge variation in their willingness to tackle poverty at all .
â€œIt is a fair question to ask what has been achieved in the 50 years since the speech , but we have to remember how much America has changed in that time , â€ � added Simms .
â€œMany of these programmes evolved over time in response to changing society.â€ �"
2014-05-12,"Last week , senator Marco Rubio , by many counts a rising star in conservative political circles in the US , answered simple questions put to him on climate change .
His comments are particularly striking in that they follow a major report put out by the US administration and respected scientists on the observations we are already making of climate change .
That report , the National Climate Assessment , points to increases in floods , more severe droughts , heavier precipitation , rising sea levels , and other markers of climate change .
The report also highlights the tremendous economic costs of climate change , costs that will get worse if we fail to act .
It is also striking because his own state , Florida , is a state that is particularly threatened by climate change .
Try saving Miami as sea level rises .
So what did Rubio say ?
First he said that he does n’t believe the scientists when they say there are actions we can take today that would have an impact on solving the problem .
This statement flies in the face of facts .
It is a fact that if we reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases , we will lessen the degree and thereby the impact of climate change .
This fact has been reported in numerous separate studies as well as in synthesis reports .
Rubio then continues by saying that the climate is always changing but that scientists take a handful of decades of research and say that this is now evidence of a longer term trend that is directly and almost solely attributable to manmade activity
The fail here is huge .
First , scientists do n’t look at just a “ few decades ” .
There is a whole branch of study called paleoclimatology .
This branch of science goes back hundreds of thousands to millions of years in order to assess the relationship between our atmosphere and the climate .
In fact , I published a paper on this topic recently hoping to improve paleoclimate studies .
And do n’t forget the scientists who , in the 1800s , warned of changes to the climate as we emit greenhouse gases .
Was that just a few decades ago ?
But notice that Rubio tries to be careful with his choice of words .
He says “ directly ” and “ almost solely attributable ” to manmade activity .
Was he careful enough ?
Not quite .
We scientists know that humans are directly responsible for the majority of climate change in the past few decades .
Furthermore , the longer term trend is almost solely attributable to humans .
Sure , there are temperature fluctuations year - to - year , just as we have weather fluctuations .
But the trend is us .
We have overwhelmed the natural climatic cycles .
Rubio also stated that he does not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way that scientists are portraying it
This statement flies in the face of actual real - world evidence we have been collecting over the past decade .
These may be his opinions , but they are unsupported by fact .
I have said this before but it is worth repeating .
How we handle climate change should not be a political issue .
The climate change we are seeing , and will see , affects us all .
I do n’t know a single conservative or progress politician who wants to harm the climate .
I know many conservatives that take our treatment of the Earth ’s natural system seriously .
I also know conservatives who recognise that doing nothing about climate change is a choice .
It is a choice with tremendous economic consequences .
When we look back on this issue , at the legacies that are being created right now , conservatives will regret making climate obstructionism a litmus test for their politicians ."
2014-12-16,"Is there anyone who can beat Hillary Clinton ?
Thereâ€ ™ s a whole slate of Republicans lining up to try , as the New York Times detailed over the weekend , by calling her unlikeable
( New Jersey Governor Chris â€œSit Down And Shut Upâ€ � Christie ) , old ( Marco Rubio , the apparent math genius who refers to Clinton â€ “ who won her first election in the year 2000 â€ “ as a â€œ20th century politicianâ€ � ) and unpopular ( Rick Perry , who based his assessment on her book sales â€ “ which outsold his by 5-to-1 in the first month ) .
All of them , according to polls , would fall to flavor of the week Jeb Bush in a Republican primary and to Clinton in a general election .
And on the Democratic side of the 2016 presidential race , there is Senator Elizabeth Warren â€ “ who is â€œnot running for presidentâ€
� , she says , and barely polls above 10 % in a potential primary match - up with Clinton anyway .
( It is worth noting that it is still the year 2014 , but whoâ€ ™ s counting ? )
Warren , who was a Harvard law professor specializing in bankruptcy law when Senator Harry Reid tapped her in 2008 to chair the financial bailoutâ€ ™ s congressional oversight panel , is both quite good at math and clear - eyed about her chances in a face - off against Clinton .
So , all of her recent press- and liberal - friendly broadsides against Wall Street aside , Warren says she is still â€œnot running for presidentâ€
� .
But !
Some professional pundits would very much like to debate what the meaning of the word â€œisâ€ � is .
Because , apparently , while it is still only 2014 , â€œ[p]eople are fatigued alreadyâ€ � with Clinton â€ “ or , at least , theyâ€ ™ re sick of her supposedly not being liberal enough .
We already know that people who cover politics love a good , extended , endless , painful , expensive primary fight â€ “ and that , for them , Clinton v the wacky Republican sideshow isnâ€ ™ t entertaining enough .
But some people who actually work in politics â€ “ in the left wing of the Democratic party
â€ “ are actively hoping Warren throws her hat in the ring against Clinton ... and , they hope , publicly nudging her enough to do just that .
Sane Democrats arenâ€ ™ t pushing â€œRun , Liz , run!â€ � because they think sheâ€ ™ ll win ; theyâ€ ™ re just hoping to push Clinton to her own left while they still have a chance .
Though Clinton has , of late , mostly been hitting all the right notes on the economic populism for which Warren is better known , Warrenites ( or should we call them Fivers ? )
arenâ€
™ t convinced that Clinton will run â€ “ let along govern â€ “ as more of a liberal than she was in 2008 , or than Warren is acting like now .
But if the last six years should have taught liberals anything , itâ€ ™ s that a Democrat in the White House is no guarantee of being able to enact a liberal agenda â€ “ even a Democrat who was broadly labeled a Kenyan socialist dictator by Republicans in 2008 .
And if liberal activists think that Warren can push Clinton left â€ “ or lead the party left herself as its 2016 nominee â€ “ theyâ€ ™ ll learn something over the next two years looking upon the lame duck who currently resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and wondering if itâ€ ™ s just as likely that someone like Warren will actually get driven ... to the center .
Besides which , Warrenâ€ ™ s own biography strongly indicates sheâ€ ™ s not keen to be an insider , anyway â€ “ as have her recent speeches taking the Obama administration to task for its chumminess with Wall Street types .
And while sheâ€ ™ s hardly the only senatorial critic to Obamaâ€ ™ s left â€ “ Senators Ron Wyden , Sherrod Brown and Bernie Sanders being perhaps the most vocal â€ “
she is the only one for whom soon - to - be minority leader Harry Reid carved out a new leadership role within the Senate .
Warrenâ€ ™ s official 2015 role in the party may have been created for her to carry Reidâ€ ™ s water for ( or to ) recalcitrant liberals who love her and distrust him .
But itâ€ ™ s just as likely that sheâ€ ™ ll be carrying their message to him
â€ “ and that , the minute she tries to mount a primary challenge to Clinton , he wonâ€ ™ t be listening .
A primary challenge , especially an unwinnable one , wonâ€ ™ t exactly endear Warren to Clintonâ€ ™ s
many allies among Senate Democrats .
( Nor , one assumes , to their shared donors , most of whom would probably stick with the supposedly sure thing in Clinton . )
A primary loss would essentially ensure her marginalization on the very policy issues about which she cares .
( Just ask John Kerry or John McCain , neither of whom returned , beaten , to the Senate and found themselves in ascendence . )
The lesson Warren might have learned from Washingtonâ€ ™ s so - called â€œcromnibusâ€ � fight over the last week is that thereâ€ ™ s not only a role for liberal dissent even among Democrats , but that it can be prominent ... and it has the potential to actually change the debate and , occasionally , the results .
Not every political road has to â€ “ or can â€ “ lead to the White House .
But not every king - maker ( or gang of eight member ) needs to be a centrist .
The powerful Senators are the ones who play the long game , not the ones who quickly try to use it as a stepping stone to higher office and then fail .
Elizabeth Warren is plenty powerful right where she is on the left of the Democratic party , and sheâ€ ™ ll only get more so if she stays there ."
2015-01-13,"Florida Senator Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s latest book
, American Dreams is a curious work .
What do you do with a â€œbig ideasâ€ � launch for a campaign that is already doomed ?
It wasnâ€ ™ t supposed to be like this for Rubio .
Handsome , young , ethnic and severely conservative in a swing state , he could have done nothing and always had an important role as a party leader , if for nothing more than all those moments when they needed a face and name that said No , weâ€ ™ re not racist .
But then he bungled it all by writing a sincere immigration reform bill .
Worse , he combined a goofy water bottle moment with a State of the Union response speech of tireless weepy vacuity that exposed his lightweight status .
Now â€œIâ€ ™ m
Not A Real Jebâ€ �
Bush has begun using Rubioâ€ ™ s 2016 campaign talking points , eating into whatever perceived centrism Rubio had and stealing his Florida fundraising base .
Meanwhile , Ted Cruz has devoured both Rubioâ€ ™ s Tea Party credentials and Hispanic GOP uniqueness .
Whatâ€ ™ s left is American Dreams .
Itâ€ ™ s tempting to call Rubioâ€ ™ s book a stillbirth of the American regeneration , since it seems unlikely that it will ultimately be put to any campaign use .
But this is something else â€ “ an unfocused creation of conservative leftovers , an accident of thoughts that have aged over decades into afterthoughts .
Like Paul Ryanâ€ ™ s book , it is liberally seasoned with right - wing buzzwords : liberty , freedom , jobs , competition , values .
â€œInnovateâ€ � is used so many times that one wonders why such an educated thinkfluencer couldnâ€ ™ t brainstorm any alternatives .
Rubio , to his credit , resists the temptation to immediately create mental applause lines by fatuously misrepresenting all of liberalism with the decontextualized Obama quote , â€œIf youâ€ ™ ve got a business , you didnâ€ ™ t build that : it first appears on page two , not one .
In the next line , he admits , â€œGovernment can play a role in our success , of course .
The rule of law , infrastructure , access to quality education ...
â€ � â€ “ all factors cited in the full Obama quote .
Okay .
Sure , man .
Whatever .
Thereâ€ ™ s no point worrying about this sad spark
when paragraphs later heâ€ ™ s
burning straw man after straw man about liberalsâ€ ™ belief that the government safety net is a â€œpermanent way of life.â€ � American Dreamsâ€ ™ â€œbig
ideasâ€ � chapters hardly fare better .
Rubio titles Chapter Two â€œMAKING AMERICA SAFE FOR UBERâ€ � , even though the company appears for the first two pages of the chapter and then essentially disappears ; its only value seems to come from being something young people , like the students in his class , have heard of .
He dedicates much of the remainder of the chapter to a moderately incoherent mess of other , unrelated things : â€œThe Tankchairâ€ � ; the Affordable Care Act ; corporate tax rates ; the Keystone pipeline ; deregulating the broadband spectrum ; Vladimir Putin and the Ukraine ; and his proposal for a â€œNational Regulatory Budgetâ€ � that would place â€œan absolute dollar limit on what federal regulations could cost the economy in any given yearâ€ � .
The latter is an intriguing vision , a trojan horse of massive deregulation of some of everything â€ “ a clown balloon horse , with rainbow polka dots and a jackass smile .
Rubio might as well submit a law saying that government regulation can â€œdo 100 things next year .
And no stuff.â€ � And itâ€ ™ s all a little weird , considering chapter two is nominally about Uber .
They donâ€ ™ t even operate in the Ukraine .
Rubio will likely be hammered for the immigration section , mostly for its existence .
He calls for securing the border for â€œhumanitarianâ€ � and â€œnational securityâ€ � reasons , while tracking visa overstays and mandating that employers use E - Verify .
For the 12 m immigrants already in this country , he proposes a three - step plan : come forward to register and possibly be deported ; those who arenâ€ ™ t deported will get to pay fines and application fees ; and , if those that arenâ€ ™ t deported and are registered donâ€ ™ t commit a crime , they can apply for permanent residency in 10 years .
But Rubio doesnâ€ ™ t want to end his immigration reform plan by just fixing the problem of undocumented immigrants ; he wants to eliminate the current legal immigration lottery system and â€œ[make ]
our legal immigration system a merit - based system that encourages innovators.â€ �
That is the sort of classist approach that should play well to Republican moderates looking for a system with a strong whiff of fairness masking the â€œIâ€ ™ m not a scientistâ€ � of social darwinism .
Neither of Rubioâ€ ™ s own parents
â€ “ â€œa bartender in hotels and ... a maid , cashier and retail
clerkâ€ �
â€ “ would have qualified under his proposed standards , but apparently times have changed , and the economy is different .
So there you go .
Rubioâ€ ™ s answer to the War on Poverty is no more thoughtful : he proposes creating a â€œFlex Fundâ€ � to â€œ[distribute ] a lump sum payment to the states to use to support or create innovative and multifaceted state and local antipoverty programs.â€ �
Oh , innovative programs !
Thatâ€ ™ ll fix everything , flexibly .
The new , innovative nature of the Flex Fund is that states must spend the money on antipoverty programs
â€œconsistent with the purposes of the federal programs they are replacing , â€ � but â€œif poverty goes down , the state would be allowed to keep the extra money , no strings attached.â€
�
This will work , because state governments have always possessed the magical Tablet of Antipoverty , on which the Secrets of Entrepreneurship were written in ancient runes by Jesus and Adam Smith â€
“ only the federal government wouldnâ€ ™ t let them use it .
Rubioâ€ ™ s not done innovating .
Instead of taxing an investor class to create subsidized college education for all , Rubio wants to combat rising college costs by allowing teenagers to â€œapply for a â€˜Student Investment Planâ€ ™ from a private investment group .
These investment groups would pay your $ 10,000 tuition in return for a predetermined percentage of your income for a set period of time after graduation â€ “ maybe 4 percent of your income a year for ten years.â€ � Rubio stops here , but why should he ?
Why not slice the risk â€ “ your education and financial future â€ “ into tranches and give them grades ?
A really good risk could be graded â€œAAA , â€
�
and then it could be traded on the bond market !
Maybe you could even bundle your own MBA debt atop a pile of crap , sell it to a school pension fund and then bankrupt dozens of retired art teachers .
Rubio eventually works his way around to truly presidential - level hedging on same sex marriage not seen since the hoary days of 2008 .
After celebrating that marriage is based on â€œthousands of years of human historyâ€ � , he punts the whole issue to the states , allowing only that â€œI continue to believe marriage should be defined as one man and one woman .
It is neither my place nor my intention to dictate to anyone who they are allowed to love or live with.â€ �
Good news , same sex couples : adopting is out , but cohabitation is in .
Still , other families are important to Rubio , who cites a â€œlandmark studyâ€ �
that found that , â€œMore than racial segregation , more than education , more than inequality , the number of single parents in a community is most determinative of upward mobility.â€ �
He contrasts the single - parent homes and economic mobility in those two otherwise sister cities Atlanta ( bad ! ) and Salt Lake City ( good ! ) .
Rubio performs some real mental contortions to determine that single parenthood above all hinders economic success , instead of the multiple cultural and economic factors that might instead contribute to single parenthood and a host of other conditions â€ “ and that Obama is personally to blame for liberalismâ€ ™ s failures to address the single - parent household issue .
Rubio writers , â€œThis is a man â€ “ himself the child of a single mother â€ “ with a unique ability to reach the poor and minority communities most affected by the breakdown of the family .
That he has chosen not to address this crisis is a tragically wasted opportunity.â€
�
Now , never mind that one of Obamaâ€ ™ s jobs since running for office
has been Black Community Scold - in - Chief ; one of the things the president also did was lament the absence of his father in his life and express his urge to â€œbreak the cycle where a father is not at homeâ€ � â€ “ at the historically black Morehouse College .
In Atlanta .
Still , you have to give Rubio style points ; he closes the chapter and the book by utterly annihilating the idea that there is a Republican â€œwar on womenâ€ � because Republicans are the only ones trying to help single mothers not be single â€ “ not through Sean Hannityâ€ ™ s dating service , but through being â€œeager to reform our poverty programs , our tax code and our moral sensibility to support work and familyâ€ � .
Of course , a really good way to prevent a supposedly tragic outbreak of single mothers might be to allow women the right to choose not to be mothers , rather than reforming the tax code , and the Republican enthusiasm to strip women of those choices might just be what liberals are talking about when they talk about the â€œwar on womenâ€ � , but nah , itâ€ ™ s probably the tax code .
Only , Christ : thereâ€ ™ s an entire 16-page afterword that might as well be titled , â€œForeign Policy Things
That Happened While My Staff Was Writing Thisâ€
� that includes Hamas
, China continuing â€œits provocations in the South China Sea , â€ � Venezuela , â€œa corrupt United Nationsâ€ � , a shout - out to Ronald Reagan and George Washington ( Americaâ€ ™ s first Ronald Reagan ) and the Barbary pirates , something about Ebola and
, you guessed it , Benghazi .
Itâ€ ™ s like a game of Fox News Foreign Policy Bingo .
Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s book is a work of surpassing laziness , possessed of the aimless , discursive prose of someone remembering what his original point was after concluding a digression he suddenly remembered he wanted to make .
Its appeals and concessions to fact and its airy handwaving rationalizations of them read like the weightless ad - libs of someone reaching for anything to win an argument on a subject about which he studied little .
It is the equivalent of someone taking his seminar class improvisations from all those mornings when professors called on him after he didnâ€ ™ t do the reading , then converting them to one massive , incoherent year - end term paper for all his classes .
Rubio will pass , just so his professors can be rid of him .
But he will not be class president ."
2015-01-23,"Two competing wings of the Republican party squared up for future control of the White House on Friday , as conservative presidential hopefuls gathered for a suddenly even more dramatic meeting in Iowa â€ “ and as Florida senator Marco Rubio was reported to be the latest mainstream candidate preparing to seek the 2016 nomination .
Rubio , who is said to be meeting potential donors on Friday and Saturday in Miami to crystallise his plans for a run , would join former governor and long - time mentor Jeb Bush in an unusually crowded offering from one state alone .
Following Bushâ€ ™ s announcement of a fundraising committee this month , his young protegeâ€ ™ s apparent decision to explore the presidency highlights a growing challenge for more business - friendly establishment candidates to cut through an increasingly crowded field with early but unofficial declarations to tie up key donors .
Rubio is competing for many of the same corporate backers as Bush and the returning 2012 nominee Mitt Romney , who got together in Utah on Thursday for a long - prepared meeting to discuss â€œthe futureâ€ � .
The Florida senator plans to miss a busy upcoming week in the Senate by taking his fundraising tour to Beverly Hills , Texas and Chicago , according to a report from ABC News .
Rubioâ€ ™ s cross - country swing will be followed by a book tour starting in Des Moines , Iowa , on 13 February and taking in other key primary states such as New Hampshire , South Carolina , Florida and Nevada , an aide told ABC .
But neither Rubio , Bush nor Romney will be present in Iowa this weekend for what is shaping up to the defining moment in the less well - advanced fight
â€ “ more than 21 months ahead of election day
â€ “ for support on the right of the party .
Iowa congressman Steve King is hosting 10 top Republicans for a long - running event called the Freedom Summit , with support from Citizens United , the conservative lobbying group that succeeded in diluting US campaign finance limits in the supreme court five years ago this week .
Guests include governors and former governors with their own 2016 aspirations such as Rick Perry of Texas , Scott Walker of Wisconsin , Mike Huckabee of Arkansas as well as Texas senator Ted Cruz and former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum , who are all expected to burnish their conservative credentials with speeches to potential Iowa primary voters and other national activists .
Most attention , however , will be on the New Jersey governor , Chris Christie , who has much less support from conservatives but is attending in the hope of rehabilitating his reputation following last yearâ€ ™ s scandal involving the closure of a bridge that was intended to punish political opponents .
Despite that major setback , Christie has positioned himself as an establishment candidate who can still reach floating voters in Democratic states like New Jersey and work with liberals in Washington .
But White House watchers maintain that it is crucial for Christie to shore up support on the right side of the Republican party if he is to progress in next yearâ€ ™ s primary race .
Nevertheless , appearing in Iowa alongside outspoken conservatives such as King carries its own political risk for national politicians .
The congressman fiercely opposes the immigration reforms that many still see as important for Republicans to address if they are to appeal to non - white voters in future national elections .
He sparked controversy again this week by criticising Michelle Obama for bringing a â€œdeportableâ€ � to the State of the Union address , a disparaging reference to a 20-year - old student who came to the US when she was one year old .
Democrats are planning to highlight what they see as the Republican partyâ€ ™ s unpalatable views on immigration over the weekend , sending â€œtrackersâ€ � to monitor the event in search of further gaffes from potential candidates ."
2015-02-03,"Republican donors in the UK are lobbying the presidential hopefuls visiting London in search of foreign policy credentials and wealthy corporate allies to abandon President Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s aggressive pursuit of overseas residents for US taxes .
British - based Americans , who ploughed millions of dollars into Republican coffers during the last presidential election , are among contributors whose backing is up for grabs after Mitt Romney , the 2012 nominee , announced that he would not run for the White House again .
As potential candidates such as Chris Christie , Scott Walker , Bobby Jindal and Marco Rubio pass through the British capital , they are checking off talks at Downing Street , policy speeches in Westminster and even photo opportunities at Arsenal Football Club .
But behind the scenes , contributors who gave thousands of dollars to Romney from London â€ “ and may give again to the right Republican candidate for 2016
â€ “ are pleading with them to overhaul a law implemented by Obama that was aimed at tackling offshore tax evaders .
â€œWe have an issue with expatriate Americans , and how we are treated under the tax code , â€ � said Tom Grant , who co - chaired a $ 75,000-a - plate private dinner with Romney in London in July 2012 , and has given tens of thousands to Republicans .
â€œPeople are concerned.â€ � â€œAll of us Americans that come in touch with [ the potential candidates ] are looking for ways to talk to them about it , â€ � said Colleen Graffy , a former senior State Department official who co - chaired a separate $ 2,500-per - head event with Romney in London and gave thousands to his election effort .
Christie , the governor of New Jersey , met George Osborne , the UK chancellor , on Tuesday after talks with David Cameron on Monday evening .
The meetings were the pinnacle of a three - day trip that has also taken in a visit to a US life science firmâ€ ™ s Cambridge laboratories and an Arsenal football match .
Christieâ€ ™ s tour followed swings through the British capital by Jindal , the governor of Louisiana , and Rubio , the junior senator for Florida .
Walker , the governor of Wisconsin , is scheduled to head to England for his own official visit next week .
All four men have signalled that they are likely contenders for the Republican presidential nomination next year .
Republicans in the UK said they were seeking a candidate to tackle the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ( Fatca ) , which came into force last year and expanded Americaâ€ ™ s unusual tax policy for citizens overseas .
American expatriates must continue completing US tax returns and pay top - ups to the US Treasury if their local tax rate is lower than they would pay at home .
The new law , which was primarily intended to catch people sheltering large sums offshore , requires foreign banks to report the financial information of any Americans on their books , prompting outcry from some expatriates .
Institutions failing to comply face financial penalties on their US business .
Opponents claim that the law was behind a 220 % increase in the number of Americans renouncing their citizenship in 2013 .
Graffy said the law was punishing ordinary overseas professionals who were key to â€œexplaining America , American culture and American valuesâ€ � .
She said : â€œAmericans are even having difficulty opening bank accounts , because they cause too much regulation .
Theyâ€ ™ re being told by financial institutions â€˜We no longer want your business.â€ ™ â€ �
Boris Johnson , the London mayor , described the rules as â€œoutrageousâ€ � after he faced a US capital gains tax bill for the sale of his London house because he was born in New York .
Unlike the UK , American authorities levy the tax on sales of primary homes .
Johnson was reported last month to have settled his US tax bill before an official visit .
Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky , another likely Republican presidential contender , has proposed legislation to repeal Fatca , calling it a â€œviolation of Americansâ€ ™ constitutional protectionsâ€ � .
The Republican party last year made repeal part of its official platform .
Graffy said that Jindal in particular â€œsounded very sympathetic and very concernedâ€
� when she and other Americans complained about the tax system following a speech at parliament .
â€œMost US politicians are unaware of it , â€ � said Graffy .
â€œWe are really trying to get it on the agenda.â€
�
Representatives of Jindal did not return a request for comment .
The governorsâ€ ™ visits are officially trade missions to encourage investment into their states .
Yet Christie has said he sees himself as a national advocate as well .
â€œOne of the main objectives of this trip is to focus on the opportunities that exist between the UK and New Jersey and our country as a whole , â€ �
he told reporters on a conference call before his visit .
And for a would - be commander in chief , being photographed at 10 Downing Street is a handy shortcut to an appearance of authority on foreign affairs â€ “ a portfolio that is typically out of reach to those sitting in statehouses while rivals in the US Senate are able to embark on fact - finding missions overseas for their committees .
â€œThere are a lot of people looking at 2016 , and the fact that if youâ€ ™ re a governor , you need to be able to think outside of your own state , and build relationships , â€ � said a source familiar with the thinking behind Walkerâ€ ™ s visit , who was not authorised to speak about it publicly .
â€œAnd the UK , particularly on the Republican side , is seen as the key partner.â€
�
A British diplomat formerly involved in US political visits said candidates did see them as genuinely educational .
â€œThey are an important way of reinforcing their view on these things before they have to start talking about them on the campaign trail , â€ � said the diplomat .
â€œIt burnishes your credentials to have had conversations with Americaâ€ ™ s key international partners about the big issues of the day , â€ � said the diplomat .
â€œAnd if you are a governor of a state then your exposure to those sort of issues , such as Greece or Syria , is limited.â€ �
Leaders using state funds to pay for their trips face restrictions on political activity .
However , people with experience of such visits said they were often used to carefully lay the early groundwork for overseas fundraising networks .
â€œFriend - making will hopefully later lead on to the money making , â€ � said Graffy .
Romney took in an estimated $ 2 m at a pair of London fundraisers at the Mandarin Oriental hotel , adding to hundreds of thousands of dollars already raised from expatriates by his campaign and the Republican National Committee .
Senior executives from financial giants such as Goldman Sachs , Credit Suisse and JP Morgan were among the dozens of guests , who were asked to bring their US passports to prove they were entitled to donate .
The 2012 events followed a $ 2,300-a - plate fundraising lunch held by his predecessor as Republican presidential nominee , Senator John McCain , at Londonâ€ ™ s Spencer House , in April 2008 .
London - based conservatives said they expected the 2016 nominee to follow suit .
â€œThere is a big American community in London who are very engaged professionally and politically , â€ � said Grant , who is also a Cambridge University law lecturer and former chairman of the UK branch of Republicans Overseas .
â€œLondon appears to have become a place where you go to meet Americans who might want to contribute to your campaign .
That seems to have become an expectation.â€ �"
2015-02-27,"Florida senator Marco Rubio was grilled on his support for immigration reform on Friday , at a conference for conservative activists that underlined the uphill battle he will face if he runs for the Republican nomination for president in 2016 .
As Congress moves toward a possible shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security , in protest at Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s executive action on immigration , the co - author of a Senate bill that shared many of the presidentâ€
™ s objectives was always going to have a rough ride at the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) .
Rubio tried to put distance between himself and the White House by stressing that it was not so much what Obama was trying to do , but how he was trying to do it â€ “ without legislation â€ “ that should anger Republicans .
â€œThis is not a policy issue , per se .
It is a constitutional issue ,
â€ � he told a subdued CPAC audience .
But although warmly introduced as a Tea Party champion , the freshman senator was forced on the defensive by the Fox News anchor Sean Hannity , who asked him during a challenging question and answer session if he regretted proposing similar reforms as part of a comprehensive immigration bill that passed the Senate in 2013 but stalled in the House .
Rubio stressed that parts of the Senate bill â€ “ such a tougher border controls â€ “ were still desperately needed but acknowledged that critics who warned that such things would be neglected in the rush to relax deportation rules had been â€œproven to be trueâ€ � by the actions of the president .
Rubioâ€ ™ s background as the son of Cuban immigrants is also one of his strongest political assets , however .
â€œIn every other country in human history , your future was decided by what your parents did before you , â€ � Rubio told Hannity when asked whether he believed in American exceptionalism .
â€œThe fact that the son of a bartender and housekeeper is standing on stage with you today â€ “
thatâ€
™ s what makes America great.â€ �
Earlier , during a short speech , he tried to focus instead on international affairs , where he is seen as stronger than the crowd of other rumoured candidates for the 2016 nomination .
He sharply criticised Obama for a â€œforeign policy that treats the Ayatollah of Iran with more respect than the prime minister of Israelâ€ � .
â€œI am glad to be here on the eve of the most important election in my lifetime , â€ � said Rubio .
â€œThe bad news is our nation is on the road to decline , â€ � he added .
â€œThe good news is we are one election away from triggering another American century.â€ �
But the senatorâ€ ™ s
relative lack of experience compared with potential rivals such as former state governor Jeb Bush is also a weakness that Hannity probed , asking whether he would run for Congress again if he failed in his likely bid to seek the 2016 Republican nomination for president .
â€œThe truth is , I donâ€ ™ t want to be in politics my whole life , â€ � Rubio admitted ."
2015-03-30,"In a slip - up of speech on Fox News on Monday , Senator Marco Rubio of Florida nearly raised the specter of a â€œnuclear strikeâ€ � on Iran , before correcting himself .
Rubio went on Foxâ€ ™ s
The Five to attack President Barack Obama for â€œaggressively seeking a deal with Iranâ€ � , as negotiators in Switzerland raced to reach a framework agreement on the countryâ€ ™ s nuclear program in advance of a deadline Tuesday .
â€œWe should never , ever take off the table the notion that it may be necessary to conduct some sort of nucle â€ “ uh , military strike against their nuclear ambition , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not cheering for that .
Iâ€ ™ m not asking for that today .
But I am saying that is a real option , because that is how serious the Iranian nuclear threat
is.â€ � Rubio has signalled strong interest in joining the 2016 presidential race , based in part on his purported foreign policy expertise .
He has promised a major announcement about his future to be made on 13 April .
On Fox News , Rubio said that President Obama had failed to impose a sufficiently strong ultimatum on the Iran negotiations .
â€œThe sanctions are important and must continue , â€ � Rubio said , adding that the president must confront Iran with â€œthe fundamental choice : you can have an economy or you can have a nuclear weapon , but you canâ€
™ t have bothâ€ � .
Rubio also defended the Iraq war , saying that â€œhindsight is always 20/20â€ � .
He said if the US had not invaded Iraq , there may have been an arms race between Iraq and Iran , suggesting a nuclear arms race .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t know what the world would look like if Saddam Hussein were still there , but I doubt it would look better , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œIt would be worse , or it would be just as bad for different reasons.â€ �"
2015-03-30,"The dinner invitations that dropped into the inboxes of political donors last week proudly boasted a list of guests whose names have already become very familiar in the crowded race for the Republican presidential nomination .
Jeb Bush , Scott Walker and Rick Santorum are among nine confirmed speakers for the Iowa Republican partyâ€ ™ s annual Lincoln dinner in Des Moines .
Rand Paul , Chris Christie and Marco Rubio have also been invited to an event that bills itself as a â€œstar - studdedâ€ � chance to meet the â€œtop presidential candidatesâ€ � .
â€œThis dinner is an opportunity for our distinguished guests to set themselves apart and announce to Iowa and the country why they should be the next president of the United States , â€ � wrote the stateâ€ ™ s party chairman , Jeff Kaufmann .
By the time the dinner rolls around in May , many , if not all , of these names are indeed likely to have declared themselves either to be candidates or at least formally â€œtesting the watersâ€ � for a run at the White House .
Once they do , they are bound by strict rules governing how they can raise funds and what they must declare .
But at the time of mailing , only one of the invited speakers â€ “
Texas senator Ted Cruz â€ “ had triggered the start of his campaign by making such a legal declaration .
Though many of the rest are poised to formally enter the race within a matter of days , there is mounting scrutiny of behaviour that some claim looks suspiciously like that of candidates but without the requisite checks and balances .
To much of Washingtonâ€ ™ s political and media class , the ambiguity is merely part of the game : something to tip - toe through carefully with the help of highly paid lawyers .
Nearly all of the widely accepted list of politicians thought to be running in 2016 have formed some sort of fundraising organisation â€ “ a leadership PAC , a super PAC or even politically active nonprofits .
While simultaneously denying the existence of a presidential bid â€ “ or even a consideration of a bid â€ “ these non - candidates are traveling the country , raising cash and setting up field operations in early primary states .
All of those things are exactly the type of activity that is usually disclosed publicly to regulators but which remains off the books for now .
Yet anger is building among transparency campaigners , some of whom are expected to soon launch a legal challenge with the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) , arguing that some of the biggest names in American politics have been actively flouting the rules .
â€œThe big issue , and the one that is repeatedly being misreported in the press , is the question of when the candidate contribution limits kick in , â€ � said Paul S Ryan , senior counsel at the Campaign Legal Center , a nonprofit advocacy group founded by former John McCain lawyer Trevor Potter .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve seen a lot of incorrect reporting saying that theyâ€ ™ re all saying theyâ€ ™ re not candidates , because that way they donâ€ ™ t have to comply with contribution limits , â€ � Ryan explained .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s not true .
Contribution limits kick in as soon as you start raising and spending any money to start â€˜testing the waterâ€ ™ to determine if youâ€ ™ ll run .
â€œThe simple denial â€ “ â€˜Oh , Iâ€ ™ m not a candidateâ€ ™ â€ “ that doesnâ€ ™ t get you out of the contribution limits .
The only way to get out of the contribution limits is to say â€˜Iâ€ ™ m not even testing the watersâ€ ™
.â€ �
Freudian slips â€ “ or a laughing matter ?
A joint analysis by the Guardian and the Center for Responsive Politics has found multiple instances where politicians do appear to have sailed dangerously close to the definitions used by regulators .
Whether these are certain breaches of the rules about declaring a candidacy is open to debate , but there is plenty of nervous legal backpedaling .
â€œIâ€ ™ m
the only candidate who thinks that the NSA program on bulk collection of your phone records should be shut down , â€ � boasted Kentucky senator Rand Paul during a recent session at the South
By Southwest technology conference in Austin , Texas .
After the reference to his candidacy was questioned online , a follow - up tweet hastily said Paul was talking about his status as a candidate for Kentucky senate election â€ “ though without explaining why he was campaigning for this race hundreds of miles away in Texas .
Others try to laugh off any such Freudian slips .
â€œI remember the last campaign , â€ � reminisced Rick Santorum , who also ran in 2012 , during one of several recent trips to Iowa .
â€œWell , not that weâ€ ™ re in a campaign , â€ � he added quickly , according to the Des Moines Register , which reported that the audience laughed as Santorum quipped : â€œThe FEC is watching!â€ �
This nodding and winking with the audience is a particularly commonplace feature of Jeb Bushâ€ ™ s many appearances on the national stage and in early - voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire .
The former Florida governor rather cryptically declared last December that he had â€œdecided to actively explore the possibility of running for President of the United Statesâ€ � .
By the time he appeared at the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) in Washington in February , he was happy to explain why .
â€œIf
I go beyond the consideration of the possibility of running , which is the legal terminology that many of the people here coming to CPAC are probably using to not trigger a campaign â€ ¦ â€ � Bush began .
During a recent session with business leaders in New Hampshire , he acknowledged : â€œI get really nervous about not triggering a campaign with all of these people around.â€ � â€œIâ€
™ m considering the possibility of running , â€ � he corrected a questioner who suggested he already was .
â€˜A lot of verbal gymnasticsâ€ ™
Under FEC rules , what other people â€ “ even party chairmen in Iowa â€
“ chose to call candidates is less relevant than how they refer to themselves and how they actually behave .
But sometimes it is the circumstantial evidence that seems most damning .
Wisconsin governor Scott Walker also came to CPAC , claiming : â€œIf we can do it in Wisconsin , there is no doubt we can do it across America.â€
�
In New Hampshire more recently , the Associated Press even reported that he said his sons were preparing to skip college this autumn to join him on the campaign trail .
â€œThey twisted our arms to figure out a way to maybe take part of a semester off next year , next fall , to come to New Hampshire , to come around the country and talk to young people like themselves , â€ � admitted Walker .
To those on the inside , these are mere slips of the tongue , rather than anything that meaningfully clashes with carefully planned timetables for declaring later in the year .
â€œThe governor is not a candidate at this time , â€ � Walkerâ€ ™ s spokeswoman , AshLee Strong , flatly told the Guardian when asked about his sons skipping school to campaign for him .
â€œThrough Our American Revival , the governor is talking about his issues platform based on the big , bold reforms he was able to achieve in Wisconsin as model for the rest of the country , â€ � Strong added .
â€œHe will continue to advocate for these types of reforms as he travels throughout the country.â€ �
Others , including spokespeople for Paul , Bush and Santorum , did not respond to requests for comment â€ “ a silence that critics claim is designed to avoid spelling out exactly what their status is .
â€œWe see a lot of verbal gymnastics by these candidates at public events , â€ � said Paul S Ryan at the Campaign Legal Center .
â€œYes , they often mention that their lawyers make them say theyâ€ ™ re thinking about being candidates , but the simple fact that your lawyers made you say something and you say it doesnâ€ ™ t immunise
it.â€
�
For the purists , any evidence that you have made your mind up to run should be enough to trigger the disclosure requirements .
â€œThe fact that they are willing to lie or joke about it in public doesnâ€ ™ t change what the law is , â€ � Ryan added .
â€œYou can not get around legal candidates status by lying .
If you have decided to be a candidate , making a joke out of it doesnâ€
™ t mean you havenâ€
™ t decided.â€
�
Raising money or raising visibility ?
The verbal clues to a candidacy are compounded by dozens of trips made by the frontrunners to Iowa and New Hampshire , something that critics believe goes way beyond simply helping candidates make up their mind .
Local political experts , however , take a more sympathetic view of such trips , arguing that it does not matter to voters if all their high - profile visitors are not officially candidates just yet .
Dante Scala of the University of New Hampshire said such visits were less about raising money than about raising visibility among the party activists who will decide who gets a shot at the real primary .
â€œYes , there are some donors in New Hampshire , but they donâ€
™ t hold a candle to places like New York or California , â€ � Scala said .
â€œSo this is all about votes and winning and getting that early boost of momentum and so forth .
â€œSure , activists are interested in how much the candidate can raise , but not how much they can raise here.â€
�
Even the politiciansâ€ ™ harshest critics concede there is little chance of being able to inflict meaningful punishment on phoney primary candidates , preferring instead to see any FEC appeal as a symbolic attempt to draw attention to how broken the system is .
â€œThey can make it because the FEC is such a feckless enforcement agency , â€ � said Ryan .
â€œNo one fears it .
They know that even if the FEC does something , it will come along well after the election and it will amount to a slap on the wrist .
â€œSo the question becomes : would you rather be a president , and two or three years after the fact be asked by the FEC â€ “ not told , asked â€ “ to pay some fairly trivial fine , or not be a president ever ?
Thatâ€ ™ s the calculation.â€ �

2015-04-13,"Barely 24 hours after Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s relatively low - key entrance into the 2016 presidential race , Republican Marco Rubio has declared his own intention to run for president , telling donors he feels â€œuniquely qualifiedâ€ � to to pitch his party as one that will defend the American Dream ..
The first - term Republican from Florida told his biggest backers on a conference call on Monday that he saw the coming presidential campaign as a choice between the past and the future .
In a swipe at Democratic rival Hillary Rodham Clinton , Rubio said the former first lady â€œis a leader from yesterdayâ€ � .
Rubio said he had always felt the United States was about tomorrow .
Rubio spoke on a conference call with donors before a flashy political rally set for Monday night in Miami , stage - managed for maximum exposure .
Floridaâ€ ™ s
junior senator has chosen to make his official announcement at Miamiâ€ ™ s Freedom Tower , where hundreds of thousands of fleeing Cubans were processed for immigration in the years following Fidel Castroâ€ ™ s 1959 revolution , in an act of deep symbolism .
Rubio , who is the son of Cuban exile parents and an outspoken critic of Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s conciliatory new approach to Havana , is widely popular with the cityâ€ ™ s large and influential population of hardline expatriates .
But the 43-year - old father of four received an early indication of the strong headwinds that lie in his path with the upstaging of his â€œbig announcementâ€ � by Clintonâ€ ™ s declaration on Sunday .
Rather than focusing on the upcoming Rubio campaign in interviews , spokesman Alex Conant instead found himself answering questions about being overshadowed , insisting that Mondayâ€ ™ s Miami event would still be â€œground zeroâ€ � .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ll give Hillary Clinton this afternoon and tomorrow morning , â€ � Conant said .
â€œTomorrow afternoon weâ€ ™ re going to turn the page and allow Marco Rubio to make his big announcement and talk about the future .
Weâ€ ™ re going to talk about the challenges facing America in the 21st century and weâ€ ™ re going to offer new ideas for how to make this a new American century.â€ �
If Clinton stole Rubioâ€ ™ s thunder over the weekend , a far greater shadow looms in the form of likely GOP contender Jeb Bush , the former Florida governor and Rubioâ€ ™ s friend and political mentor who remains the clear favourite for the nomination among the swing stateâ€ ™ s Republican voters .
A Quinnipiac poll earlier this month saw Rubio languishing in third place behind Bush and Wisconsin governor Scott Walker .
Bush is expected to declare his intention to run soon , having announced in December that he was forming an exploratory political action committee ( Pac ) .
It has since raised millions of dollars .
Bush , who reportedly set a $ 100 m target for the yearâ€ ™ s first quarter alone , is expected to vacuum up the bulk of Republican donations .
But Rubioâ€ ™ s Pac , Reclaim America , hopes to benefit from wealthy individual donors including the Miami car dealer Norman Braman , the former owner of the Philadelphia Eagles , who is believed to have pledged at least $ 10 m .
â€œOther candidates will have more money and bigger operations than Marco Rubio will , but heâ€ ™ s going to have the best message in the race , â€ � Conant said .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re facing very different challenges in 2016 , and he has new ideas how to solve them and wants to talk to as many people as possible.â€ �
The Associated Press contributed to this report ."
2015-04-13,"Marco Rubio officially entered the race for the White House on Monday , declaring that â€œyesterday is overâ€ � and that the 2016 US presidential campaign would pose â€œa generational choiceâ€ � â€ “ ostensibly toward what the Florida senator called â€œa new American futureâ€ � but also between himself , Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush .
One day after Clinton cast a looming shadow over the entire election , Rubio , the son of Cuban immigrant parents , announced his intention to seek the Republican nomination at Miamiâ€ ™ s Freedom Tower â€ “ the â€œEllis Island of the southâ€ � where thousands of families fleeing Fidel Castroâ€ ™ s 1959 revolution were processed .
â€œYesterday , a leader from yesterday began a campaign for president by promising to take us back to yesterday , â€ �
he said .
â€œBut yesterday is over , and we are never going back.â€ �
Attacking the policies of Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s administration , in which Clinton served as secretary of state , Rubio said the time had come to look ahead with the same determination once shown by the waves of Cuban immigrants trying to build a new life in an unfamiliar country .
Those exiles , he said , were a part of â€œthe larger story of the American miracleâ€ � .
Before an appreciative audience of more than a thousand supporters , campaign workers and media inside the tower , plus thousands more watching on a giant screen outside and a largely approving political class beyond that , Rubio declared that the United States was still the same land of opportunity the migrants had discovered it to be .
â€œUnited by a common faith in their God - given right to go as far as their talent and work would take them , a collection of immigrants and exiles , former slaves and refugees , became one people , and together built the freest and most prosperous nation ever ,
â€ � he said .
â€œMy parents achieved what came to be known as the American dream .
But now , too many Americans are starting to doubt whether achieving that dream is still possible .
The time has come for our generation to lead the way towards a new American century.â€ �
Rubio , the third Republican in the 2016 race following the earlier declarations of Ted Cruz and Rand Paul , and the fourth overall following Democratic frontrunner Clintonâ€ ™ s Sunday announcement , touched on a need to replace Obamaâ€ ™ s signature healthcare law , what he deemed outdated immigration laws , the need for tax reforms and tighter controls on federal spending .
He also accused the Obama administration of â€œdangerous concessionsâ€ � to Iran and hostility toward Israel .
But some of the loudest cheers came when Rubio returned to the theme of Cuba and the struggles of his father , a bar tender , and his mother , a retail worker , in the early years after their arrival in Miami from Cuba in the 1950s .
â€œI regret my father did not live to see this day .
He used to tell me all the time :
â€˜En este pais , ustedes van a poder lograr todas las cosas que nosotros
no pudimosâ€ ™ â€ “ in this country
, you will achieve all the things we never could , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œThat journey , from behind that bar to behind this podium , is the essence of the American dream .
Whether or not we remain a special country will depend on whether that journey is still possible for those trying to make it now.â€ �
Rubio , 43 , born in Miami and the father of four young children , said he would be campaigning for Americaâ€ ™ s working classes , â€œthe workers in our hotel kitchens , the landscaping crews in our neighborhoods , the late - night janitorial staff that clean our offices and the bartenders who tonight are standing in the back of a room somewhere.â€ � â€œIf their American dreams become impossible , we will have become just another country ,
â€ � he said .
â€œBut if they succeed , the 21st century will be another American century .
This will be the message of my campaign and the purpose of my presidency.â€ �
A skyrocketing star , with setbacks Since his election as a young city commissioner in the small south Florida city of West Miami in 1998 ,
Rubioâ€ ™ s rise through the Republican ranks has been remarkable .
He was on the job for just a year before his first run at state office , winning a seat in the Florida House and becoming its majority leader four years later .
In 2006 , he became House speaker , a role in which he attracted the attention of senior national Republicans .
Rubio had his own sights set on higher office by the time his spell in Tallahassee came to an end in 2009 .
Given little chance against the former Florida governor Charlie Crist in the 2010 race for the retiring Mel Martinezâ€ ™ s US Senate seat , he rode the Tea Partyâ€ ™ s wave of national popularity to a huge upset .
A skyrocketing star in Washington , Rubio served has served on the commerce , science and transportation and foreign relations committees , and was shortlisted , but ultimately passed over for another Republican starlet , Paul Ryan , to be Mitt Romneyâ€ ™ s running mate in his ill - fated 2012 presidential campaign .
It has not , however , been all smooth sailing for Rubio , who was forced to concede that his parents were not forced out of Cuba during Fidel Castroâ€ ™ s 1959 revolution , but instead came to the United States several years before as de facto economic refugees .
Rubio also suffered a Republican backlash for his role as one of the so - called Gang of Eight bipartisan Washington politicians who crafted immigration reform legislation that would have opened a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 m undocumented immigrants living in the US illegally .
Once a staunch advocate of such a policy , he was forced to backtrack in the face of strong opposition from Republican hardliners .
His revised stance is that American borders must be secured before any further discussion on the issue can take place , a position derided by many immigrant advocacy groups who had hopes that Rubio might be the politician to carry through Obamaâ€ ™ s vision on meaningful immigration reform .
Dozens of activists rallied outside the Freedom Tower on Monday to protest against his views .
Rubio , however , is seen by many as one of the nationâ€ ™ s most gifted political orators , with an ability to convey his opinions with confidence and authority .
Even when he was widely derided for an uncomfortable moment in his televised response to Obamaâ€ ™ s 2013 state of the union speech , when he broke off to make an awkward lunge for a water bottle , he was able to laugh off the incident and turn what could have been a public relations disaster into his advantage .
In Bushâ€ ™ s shadow , â€˜the JFK of his generationâ€ ™
Perhaps the biggest problem facing Rubio in the 2016 campaign is the likely presence of his friend and political mentor Jeb Bush , Floridaâ€ ™ s former governor and brother to the last Republican president George W Bush , as a rival for his partyâ€ ™ s nomination .
Bush has yet to formally declare , but reports say he already has a war chest approaching $ 100 m .
Rubio , his aides concede , can not hope to match Bushâ€ ™ s financial clout , but he is not concerned .
â€œOther candidates will have more money and bigger operations than Marco Rubio will , but heâ€ ™ s going to have the best message in the race , â€ �
Rubio press spokesman Alex Conant said ahead of Mondayâ€ ™ s announcement .
Rubio will need to quickly catch up to the poll ratings of his closest rivals if he is to take a deep run at the Republican nomination .
A Quinnipiac University poll this month showed Rubio trailing behind Bush and Wisconsin governor Scott Walker , both yet to announce their intentions , in his home state .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve heard some suggest that I should step aside and wait my turn , â€ �
Rubio said in his speech on Monday , â€œbut
I cannot.â€
�
Many of the supporters at Rubioâ€ ™ s Freedom Tower event , too , were unfazed by his apparent lack of support from within Florida .
â€œRubio is about making America respected again throughout the world , building a strong military , â€ � said John Nelson , chairman of the Highlands County Tea Party Republicans , who led a delegation of five group members at the rally .
â€œHe has strong American values , more than any other candidate .
Iâ€ ™ m not here for myself , Iâ€ ™ m here for my granddaughter .
Itâ€ ™ s not about me and now , itâ€ ™ s about my granddaughter and her future .
Itâ€ ™ s about building a strong future for America .
I believe only Marco Rubio can do that , not Jeb Bush or any of the others.â€
�
Gina Sosa , treasurer of the Log Cabin Republicans of Miami , which describes itself as an all - inclusive advocacy group with many LBGT members , wanted to hear Rubio preach a message of equality .
She said she was not worried by Rubioâ€ ™ s one - time position on his immigration bill , later retracted , that he could not support reform if it included citizenship for gay couples .
â€œHe has accomplished a lot as a young man and he brings experience to the campaign .
Iâ€ ™ m excited and proud to support him .
Our job is to fight discrimination and support inclusion and I believe
thatâ€ ™ s what Marco Rubio brings to the table ,
â€ � she said .
For Shane Pagano , of Log Cabinâ€ ™ s Orlando chapter , the choice for the nomination is simple : â€œI believe Marco Rubio is the JFK of his generation , a once in a generation politician , â€ � he said ."
2015-04-13,
2015-04-14,"Itâ€ ™ s impossible to settle on how to sell Marco Rubio , the â€œon the other hand ...
â€ � candidate whose every strength has some immediate counterweight .
Heâ€ ™ s telegenic until he stumbles .
Heâ€ ™ s passionate until youâ€ ™
ve heard the delivery more than a few times , and then it sounds put - on .
Heâ€ ™ s young , but he has the same â€œnewâ€ � ideas as the old guys in the race .
Even his ethnicity takes away as much as it adds : heâ€ ™ s the Latino candidate so many Latinos can ( and likely will ) vote against .
Still , in a speech on Monday at Miamiâ€ ™ s Freedom Tower â€ “ an Ellis Island for Cuban - Americans , with symbolism no less forced than Jesus Avenger Ted Cruzâ€
™ s announcement at Liberty University , or Rand Paulâ€ ™ s speech at a hotel named â€œGaltâ€
�
â€ “ he announced the official end to the polite fiction
thatâ€ ™ s endured since he delivered his State of the Union response in 2013 : he is running for president .
It was hard not to have mixed feelings .
It was a good speech ... kind of : he sounded compassionate , urgent , even emotionally pained .
You can see why he sounds moving to people .
On the other hand , those moving tones were just as moving during his 2013 speech , and itâ€ ™ s going to be very tough to watch Marco Rubio hold back tears for 18 months .
Rubio depicted himself as a young alternative , warning us against â€œthe leaders and ideas of the pastâ€ � , even as he parroted many of them .
( â€œAll life deserves protection!â€ �
Okay , on that note ... â€œRepeal and replace Obamacare!â€
�
With what ? )
It doesnâ€ ™ t hurt the Republican party to run young candidates to combat the vibe of peevish old men constantly irritated by the fact that not all chairs are burgundy and wing - backed .
Then again , Rubio is a first - term Senator , with a similar legislative record and similar lack of executive experience as Barack Obama had in 2008 .
That wouldnâ€
™ t matter so much if the old men in Rubioâ€ ™ s party hadnâ€ ™ t spent the last six years blaming everything wrong with this country on Obamaâ€ ™ s inexperience .
The use of his ethnic identity is also equivocal and often cynical .
On the one hand , heâ€ ™ s a Cuban - American representing a party often viewed as hostile to Latinos and rarely even on speaking terms with them .
On the other , when that party does speak to minority groups , it calls on them to look past identity politics and , instead , at policies that bring them the greatest benefits .
Rubio , sticking to type , drafted immigration reform legislation , then abandoned it when the white , nativist base of the Republican Party howled .
He is proud to be the child of immigrants , but his latest immigration reform plan would have disqualified his parents .
He peppered his speech with references to â€œworkers in our hotel kitchens , the landscaping crews in our neighborhoods , the late - night janitorial staff that clean our officesâ€ �
â€ “ meant both to evoke images of Latinos and to echo the new Republican populism â€ “ then immediately hugged a billionaire after its end .
He mentioned human - rights abuses in â€œCuba , Venezuela , Nicaraguaâ€ � , but younger generations of Cubans are less interested in maintaining the hatred of Castro nurtured by their parents and grandparents , and 66 % of them support Obamaâ€ ™ s efforts to normalize relations with the island nation .
And though politicos and pollsters have a tendency to flatten Latino immigrant groups into a singular bloc , Cuban - Americans are only about 3.6 % of the US Latino population .
Many non - Cuban Latinos have looked on resentfully for years at the way Cuban immigrants have been granted citizenship â€œas
exilesâ€ � while other Latino immigrants have been demonized .
Rubio probably canâ€ ™ t even reach all these Hispanic voters : over two - thirds of them watch Univision , a channel whose editorial board heâ€ ™ d nearly totally alienated by 2012 .
Rubioâ€ ™ s unwillingness to be convinced by the science on climate change also works against him : polls show that â€œnine out of 10 Latinos in the US â€ “ including 68 percent of Republican Latinos â€ “ want the US to take action against climate change.â€ �
These are desires tied to real - world needs to maintain the sustainability of homes , jobs and agriculture .
Rubio doesnâ€ ™ t even need to leave home to witness that : he lives in South Florida , where sea - level rises , more intense storms and ocean acidity have an immediacy he should understand , even if refusing to acknowledge the self - evident is an official Florida policy .
For a candidate running on new ideas that older candidates wouldnâ€ ™ t consider , hewing to the party line on climate change even when its effects are visible in his home state smells unsurprisingly like politics as usual .
The constant counterbalance effect continues on matters of policy .
Rubio sits on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee , where his experience has given him the hands - on knowledge to sound like the rest of the non - Rand Republican field .
His speech called on America to [ accept ] the mantle of global leadership , by abandoning this administrationâ€ ™ s dangerous concessions to Iran , and its hostility to Israel ; by reversing the hollowing out of our military ; by giving our men and women in uniform the resources , care and gratitude they deserve ; by no longer being passive in the face of Chinese and Russian aggression ; and by ending the near total disregard for the erosion of democracy and human rights around the world
The global human rights stuff is all chaff â€ “ he wonâ€ ™ t mention Palestine or Saudi Arabia , after all â€ “ but the rest is interesting .
Between the South China Sea and Ukraine , heâ€ ™ s calling for the United States to get chippy on two fronts against a combined 1.5bn people , before even worrying about the Middle East .
A practical solution to thorny problems it is not .
This is the inevitable problem with being a minority in a party which both craves your visibility ( to prove they donâ€ ™ t have a problem with minorities ) and yet eschews any real acknowledgement in policy of the effects of being a minority in America : you can only survive if you compartmentalize .
Perhaps itâ€ ™ s no wonder that Rubioâ€ ™ s delivery was still thick and dry - mouthed , or that , later on Hannity , sweat visibly dripped down his cheek .
Not that this should matter , but thatâ€ ™ s the paradox of modern politics : people want you to seem wholly stirred by the passion of your beliefs and weight of your experiences ; they also donâ€ ™ t want to see them affect you ."
2015-04-14,"For months , Marco Rubio has positioned himself as the defense hawk rising from the Republican rubble â€ “ a John McCain for the millennial set .
The junior senator from Florida has taken his position on the powerful Foreign Relations Committee to remind the world that he would re - open the prison at GuantÃ¡namo Bay , defend the NSAâ€ ™ s dragnet surveillance and â€œstand upâ€ � against North Korea .
Rubio has adopted the â€œObama - Clinton foreign policyâ€ � line used by Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz and raised them an Ayatollah .
Anything less than the â€œRubio doctrineâ€ � , he says , would be â€œchaosâ€ � .
The highly public ramp - up of his borderless credentials has built to this moment : a self - made politician is now , at 43 years old , attempting a long - shot bid to secure his partyâ€ ™ s nomination for president as a veteran of global affairs .
But foreign policy experts warn that if Rubioâ€ ™ s ultimate campaign plan is to simply serve up scathing critiques of Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s failures â€ “ and by proxy those of Hillary Clinton , whom he calls â€œthe architectâ€ � â€ “ heâ€ ™ ll have to do a better sales job if he wants to stand a chance against a former secretary of state . â€œToo many of our leaders and their ideas are stuck in the 20th century , â€ �
Rubio said in a clear dig at Clinton on Monday , announcing his candidacy in Miami the day after she entered the race with a decidedly domestic pitch .
â€œThey have forgotten that when America fails to lead , global chaos inevitably follows , so they appease our enemies , betray our allies and weaken our military.â€ �
After laying the groundwork on Sunday talk shows and the Senate floor , the Miami unveil served as the first openly presidential platform for Rubio to lay out a vision for Americaâ€ ™ s role on the world stage that is at once openly interventionist and politically confrontational : likening Clinton to â€œa leader from yesterdayâ€ � , Rubio soaked up major applause lines while criticizing a nuclear deal with Iran , the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s souring relationship with Israel and renewed US ties with Cuba .
Just donâ€ ™ t try to call him inexperienced .
â€œPresident Obamaâ€ ™ s been a failure not because he was only in the Senate for four years
â€ “ heâ€
™ s been a failure because his ideas are bad , â€ �
Rubio said in an interview on Fox News after his announcement .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t care if he had been in the Senate for 50 years ; if he had done what heâ€ ™ s done now , he would have failed , too .
His ideas donâ€ ™ t work.â€ �
Rubio has been espousing his foreign policy ideas on the airwaves since about a year ago , when he burst back onto the scene with an impassioned speech on the Senate floor against human and civil rights abuses in Cuba and Venezuela .
Rubio has since emerged â€ “ especially amidst the thaw with Havana â€ “ as one of the most vocal skeptics of Obamaâ€ ™ s foreign policy , dubbing the president â€œthe worst negotiatorâ€ � since Jimmy Carter .
Along with his fellow Republican presidential contenders who think they can go hawk - to - hawk against Clinton in a general election , Rubio has extended the attacks on Obamaâ€ ™ s global legacy directly to the former secretary of state .
â€œIn many respects I think
itâ€ ™ s going to be a continuation , â€ � he told Fox News on Monday .
â€œYou have to assume sheâ€ ™ s going to continue his trajectory in terms of foreign policy positions.â€
�
While Obamaâ€ ™ s foreign policy may barely pass muster in the polls , experts said even relatively inexperienced Republicans â€ “ governors and junior senators alike â€ “ need to pass certain tests themselves .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not enough to criticize what has been done or what the other person proposes to do â€ “
you have to have a credible case of your own , â€ �
Christopher Preble , vice - president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute , told the Guardian .
â€œWhat do you believe are the criteria for the use of force , and under what circumstances should the US military be involved in other conflicts?â€ �
For Rubio , that test often means using his position on the Senate foreign relations and intelligence committees to oppose the actions of the Obama administration .
Most recently , he co - sponsored a bill that would allow Congress to reject a nuclear deal with Iran .
He has also floated an amendment that would force Iran to recognize Israelâ€ ™ s right to exist as part of any agreement .
Rubio has been vehemently opposed to the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s decision to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba , citing his personal background as the son of Cuban immigrants .
He supported arming Syrian rebels but voted against a Senate resolution proposing US military intervention in 2013 , and has tied Obamaâ€ ™ s response to the civil war to the rise of the Islamic State .
The views are largely consistent with most members of the growing 2016 Republican field , save for the libertarian - leaning Rand Paul , who has advocated for a more isolationist approach .
But Rubio and his advisers have said his foreign policy experience tops that of prospective opponents from within his own party .
Elliott Abrams , a former adviser to George W Bush and Ronald Reagan who has also advised Rubio on foreign policy , told the Guardian that Rubioâ€ ™ s presence on the two Senate committees had allowed him to better understand not just the specific issues facing the country but also how to craft policy in response .
â€œRepublicans have a choice to make between people who have been governors â€ “ like Rick Perry , Jeb Bush and Scott Walker , and therefore have executive experience â€ “ and people like Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio who have much more foreign policy experience , â€ �
Abrams said .
â€œIf itâ€ ™ s a governor whoâ€ ™ s never served in a foreign policy position , theyâ€ ™ re going to have to make the argument that they do have relevant experience â€ “ and more relevant experience for being president than Hillary Clinton does.â€ �
Most polling indicates an uphill battle for Rubio against the likes of Bush , Walker and Paul .
But top GOP aides believe he is the most gifted orator in the race , and many have privately said Rubio is the partyâ€ ™ s second choice for the nomination â€ “ leaving room for him to rise should Bush or other early front - runners stumble .
â€œI am prepared to debate foreign policy with anyone else running on this race , â€ � he said on Fox .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t just have speeches â€ “
we can tell you specifically what laws we would pass or repeal on each one of these issues .
I think thatâ€ ™ s what distinguishes us.â€
�
If he did survive a primary , Rubio would have to contend with just how many of his foreign policy views are out of step with the broader American electorate .
The majority of the US public remains war - weary after decade - long missions in Iraq and Afghanistan , unless there is a compelling national security interest .
Millennials are especially opposed to military intervention , a factor that has made Paul the leading Republican contender among a younger cohort of voters
â€ “ even though Rubio is the youngest candidate in the race and has cast himself as part of a new generation of leadership .
Clinton , of course , is perceived by Democrats as just as hawkish as some Republicans and was defeated by Obama in 2008 in part for holding what voters saw at the time as an outdated approach to foreign policy , plus a vote for the Iraq war .
This time around , she could be dragged down by Obama again for the opposite reason â€ “ being linked to his policies as a former member of his administration .
â€œSheâ€ ™ s not merely in his party but executing , and in some cases crafting , the foreign policy of his administration , â€ � Preble said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s going to be hard for her to shift the blame
elsewhere.â€ � Americans continue to disapprove of Obamaâ€ ™ s efforts to defeat the Islamic State and his foreign policy overall .
For Rubio , the challenge will be to prove to the American people that Clinton is equally to blame for their frustration , while making the case his are the answers theyâ€ ™ ve been waiting for â€ “ or else .
â€œA Rubio doctrine would be that the United States is the indispensable power on the planet ,
â€ �
the senator told Fox News host Sean Hannity .
â€œIn the absence of American leadership , the result is a vacuum .
That vacuum is filled by chaos.â€ �"
2015-04-14,"You got ta hand it to the Republican Party .
When one of their own makes history in the diversity game â€ “ say , Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court , Sarah Palin as a vice president nominee , or Ronald Reagan becoming our nationâ€ ™ s first actor president â€ “ that trailblazer is so noxious that their origin group largely disowns them , leaving the party to lick its affirmative - action wounds .
Thatâ€ ™ s exactly whatâ€ ™ s going to happen to Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio , the first - ever Latino Republicans to seriously campaign for their partyâ€ ™ s presidential nomination ( sorry , Ben Fernandez ) .
SÃ­ , letâ€ ™ s pause and marvel at the progress of Latinos in this country , that they can become also - ran presidential candidates as vacuous and bloviating as gringos !
But now that our moment of respect is done , letâ€ ™ s get real .
Not only do Cruz or Rubio have little chance of becoming the GOPâ€ ™ s sacrificial lamb against Hillary Clinton in 2016 , they are by far the worst candidates that Republicans could pick to recruit the very constituency that they so desperately need to stay relevant in a changing country : Latinos .
Itâ€ ™ s not that Latino voters donâ€
™ t respect the stories of Cruz and Rubio , whose parents came from working - class roots to achieve the American dream .
Nor is it necessarily Latinosâ€ ™ supposed hatred of Cubans , as some pundits try to paint it : go to Dodger Stadium , and see how the Chicano crowds cheer on outfielder Yasiel Puig , or go to any fiesta and hear Perez Prado , Celia Cruz , and Beny
MorÃ
© draw people to the dance floor .
Rather , many Latinos donâ€
™ t like that Cruz and Rubio represent the politics of Cuban immigration to los Estados Unidos , a saga far different from that of virtually every other Latino group .
Blame the White Houseâ€ ™ s
Cold War game for the divide between Cuban Americans and other Latinos in America , not traditional Latin American rivalries .
While Latinos who escaped sometimes - unfathomable violence in their countries â€ “ Central Americans during the 1980s , South Americans during their dirty wars , or Mexicans during this decadeâ€ ™ s narcoterrorism â€ “ were rarely granted refugee status because American allies inflicted the violence theyâ€ ™ d fled , Cubans famously received the red carpet treatment when fleeing Castroâ€ ™ s Cuba in the 1960s and beyond .
Latinos who came to el Norte illegally for economic reasons had to evade la migra ; Cubans who arrived after the initial wave were subjected to Americaâ€ ™ s infamously simple Cuban immigration policy : make it to land , and you can stay .
( Haitians certainly didnâ€ ™ t have it so easy . )
Because of the double standard , many Latinos have long cast Cubans as entitled recipients of a hand - up that the rest of us never got .
And , Cuban - Americansâ€ ™ embrace of the Republicans who welcomed them while demonizing all other Latinos also created a political rift in the Latino community that any Cuban - American politician running outside of Florida and New Jersey must confront .
That chasm , undeserved or not , wouldâ€ ™ ve already weighed down Cruz and Rubio before they even tried to court Latino voters .
Then we get to their actual politics .
Cruz is a blip in Latino popular culture , both because of his alignment with the evangelical fringe of the GOP and because his Spanish is virtually non - existent .
The latter isnâ€ ™ t a fair knock , and Cruz did have a great comeback in 2010 when explaining why he wouldnâ€ ™ t do a debate on UnivisiÃ³n : his Spanish wasnâ€ ™ t great and â€œThatâ€ ™ s the world in which I grew up , and thatâ€ ™ s a world in which a lot of second - generation immigrants find themselvesâ€ � .
But refusing to speak Spanish will draw snickers all along the campaign trail , especially when Jeb Bush can speak better Spanish than most Democratic Latino politicians .
Rubio , on the other hand , would seem to be a Latino dream candidate : young , fluent in Spanish , directly tied to the immigrant experience and even self - deprecating .
His advisors are even whispering about how his pop culture fluency will particularly appeal to young Latinos .
But Latino millennials are the exact group that Rubio has antagonized the most , because on immigration , Rubio went from being somewhat sympathetic to the plight of undocumented youth to blabbering about closing borders before anything else .
His new hard - line approach brought the scorn of young immigration reform activists , who seem to take glee in rattling him .
On this issue , the supposed Latino hive mentality comes to bite Rubio in the nalgas : you ainâ€ ™ t exactly going to win the Latino vote when you suggest that a generation of them ought to be deported for the simple act of living in this country without papers .
That the Republicans think Rubio â€ “ and Cruz , to a lesser extent â€ “ is their Great Brown Hope instead of a Great Brown Nope despite all his negatives with Latinos ( he even introduced Mitt Romney during the 2012 Republican convention ) shows , once again , how much work the Reeps need to do to attract non - Cuban Latinos to their party .
Rubio , at least , has long known this divide was going to be an issue for him and tried to stave it off : in 2012 , he told a crowd , â€œDividing Cubans against the rest of the Hispanic community is not only absurd , itâ€ ™ s offensive.â€ � ( Note to Rubio : telling undocumented students that they â€œdonâ€ ™ t have a right to illegally immigrate into the United Statesâ€ � when your own abuelito was ordered to be deported
didnâ€
™ t help your case . )
But the real offensive thing is how out - of - touch Rubio and Cruz are with non - Cuban Latinos .
You know youâ€ ™ re bad when a gringo like Jeb is more attuned to Latino issues than the two of them combined â€ “ and Jeb is a pinche Bush , for Chrissakes !
( He is not , however , actually Latino , all voter registration forms to the contrary . )"
2015-04-15,"Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio says he has noticed the climate is changing dramatically but says he canâ€ ™ t explain why because heâ€ ™ s â€œnot
a scientistâ€ � .
He has concluded , however , that humans do not have anything to do with it .
Taking large - scale action will destroy the economy , the Florida senator says .
But in his home state , the effects of climate change are set to be among the most alarming in the US .
Florida state officials might not be allowed to talk about it , but scientists in the state have been warning politicians for years that human - fueled climate change is here and , without action , its advance is going to be catastrophic for the state .
â€œAdmitting you are ignorant is no excuse , â€ � Peter Harlem , a geoscientist at Florida International Universityâ€
™ s south - eastern environmental research center , told the Guardian .
Here are the five threats to Florida from climate change that might force Marco Rubio to take action .
1
The threat Miami drowns .
And itâ€ ™ ll take the Florida Keys , the Everglades and Cape Canaveral with it .
The evidence In parts of Florida , rising ocean levels already mean that streets built high and dry 50 years ago now flood with seawater every month , Harlem said .
â€œI can drive Senator Rubio to a spot on Biscayne Bay under a full moon and he can watch the high tide come in over the road.â€ � Expensive pumping systems ( for example in Miami Beach ) and sea walls are futile in the long term .
Climate change is forecast to push sea levels in southern Florida three to six feet higher this century , perhaps more .
Some 5.5 million people in Miami live just six feet above sea level .
2
The threat Extreme heat and more diseases .
Rising temperatures and the spread of tropical illnesses hit older people hard â€ “ that puts Floridaâ€ ™ s large retiree population at great risk .
The evidence Dengue fever is being kept at bay in the Florida Keys only by the sustained efforts of health officials .
It re - established itself around 2009 after being eliminated decades ago .
Warming temperatures boost mosquito populations and increase the incidence of West Nile virus and chikungunya , while bringing the threat of malaria ever closer to the Florida swamps .
The Natural Resources Defense Council predicts Florida will suffer the most dramatic increase in the summer heat index ( temperature plus humidity ) in the country .
That may prove deadly .
3
The threat Coral - free reefs , sand - less beaches .
The evidence The magical coral reefs of the Florida Keys have been dying since the 70s due to overfishing and pollution .
But some coral is better than no coral â€ “ which climate change may lead to because of rising sea temperatures â€ “ for the stateâ€ ™ s $ 50bn tourist industry .
And before rising seas inundate the sparkling white beaches , a lot of their sand will be raked away by advancing waves and tidal erosion , already a big problem in the Gulf - facing south - west .
4
The threat Shriveled oranges , rotten tomatoes .
More heat and rain might seem like a boon to Floridaâ€ ™ s fruit bounty , but the longer - term outlook is sour .
The evidence Volatile rainfall patterns and temperature fluctuations wreck fruit yields .
Early growth is followed by destructive frosts , fierce rainstorms by long dry spells .
More heat brings more pests ( and pesticide run - off is already poisoning the water table and ocean ) .
The University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Science warns that global warming is â€œpotentially catastrophicâ€ � to the stateâ€ ™ s farming industry , which provides work for two million and is the stateâ€ ™ s second biggest employer behind tourism .
5
The threat Salt in drinking water , sewage and irrigation .
The evidence Three quarters of Floridaâ€ ™ s population of 14 million lives in a coastal county and they expect fresh water when they turn on the taps , and the toilet to flush nicely every time they go .
And why not , with up to 60 in of rain a year ?
Salt water is already seeping up , however , especially in south Florida where the limestone bedrock is as holey as Swiss cheese .
Higher tides and rising oceans donâ€ ™ t just threaten flooding on the coast but a gradual infiltration into the groundwater for household use , irrigation canals and sewage systems .
And what Floridians donâ€ ™ t need for quenching their thirst , and salt water doesnâ€ ™ t contaminate , the fierce sun is already evaporating from the stateâ€ ™ s lush landscape at a dangerous rate .
Thatâ€ ™ s the bad news for Rubio .
But there is some good news .
Scientists canâ€
™ t agree on whether climate change will lead to more hurricanes , though it is expected to increase the intensity of those that do occur ."
2015-04-15,"Ted Cruz supports a constitutional amendment to allow states to avoid recognizing same sex marriage .
Marco Rubio has supported one to gut Obamacare .
But now Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s jumped on the constitutional amendment bandwagon , only she has a good idea : a proposal that should appeal to the 80 % of Americans who support limits on political donations to candidates .
At a roundtable on Tuesday in Monticello , Iowa , Clinton suggested that action was needed to reverse Citizens United and the other Supreme Court decisions that allow corporations , wealthy individuals and well - funded groups to dominate the political process .
Clinton said : â€œWe need to fix the dysfunctional political system and get unaccountable money out of it once and for all , even if that takes a constitutional amendment.â€ � As a tactic , a constitutional amendment to authorize greater regulation of campaign finance is probably doomed to fail .
But the call for a constitutional amendment may finally build political support for more viable responses to a situation that the majority of Americans think is a problem .
( It could also help Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign . )
Jennifer Jacobs already reported in the Des Moines Register that Republicans have declared Clinton a hypocrite because she plans to raise plenty of money : â€œRepublicans noted that as Clinton spoke , big Democratic donors , including Clinton allies , were convening in California to talk this week about spending millions of dollars on liberal groupsâ€ � .
But thatâ€ ™ s not just self - interested , itâ€ ™ s stupid .
Wanting to change the rules doesnâ€
™ t mean that Clinton is obligated to unilaterally disarm in the meantime .
Thereâ€ ™ s no contradiction in wanting to restrict the role of money in political campaigns while raising money under the existing rules â€ “ and the fact that Clinton is doing the very fundraising that is necessary to seek the presidency in 2016
doesnâ€ ™ t mean she isnâ€
™ t allowed to argue for changing the system .
Thereâ€ ™ s also nothing wrong in principle with initiating greater restrictions on campaign spending and donations .
Most other liberal democracies have had more restrictive campaign finance regimes without instituting widespread regimes of censorship â€ “ and nearly 60 % of Americans donâ€
™ t believe that donation caps violate our right to free speech .
The court - initiated elimination of campaign finance restrictions has allowed wealthy interests to increase their stranglehold on the legislative process , drowning out the voices of ordinary people .
Yet , Clintonâ€ ™ s amendment proposal would be almost impossible to execute in practice .
Under Article V , the most common pathway to an amendment requires two - thirds of both houses of Congress and three quarters of state legislatures .
The Constitution has been amended only 17 times since the Bill of Rights was ratified .
In other words , an amendment would require a large degree of bipartisan consensus .
Given the increasing ideological hostility to campaign finance reform among Republicans , as well as the benefits many incumbents of both parties gain from the current system , getting this degree of consensus would be near to impossible .
But that doesnâ€ ™ t mean that Clintonâ€ ™ s call for an amendment is a bad idea .
Progressives need to mobilize on behalf of campaign finance reform and draw attention to the egregious pro - corporate tilt of the Supreme Court , and advocating for an amendment is one way to do so .
Even while Citizens United and other decisions restricting campaign finance remain in place , progressives should be focusing on the other avenues it leaves open as well .
The Supreme Court has not held that disclosure requirements are unconstitutional , so the proposed Disclose Act â€ “ which was filibustered to death in 2010 â€ “ should be a major priority for the next Democratic Congress .
If the wealthy want to spend money to try to buy politicians , they should at least have to do so openly .
A public finance system robust enough to counteract the new flood of money would be a heavier lift but is worth fighting for .
There is , of course , another way to get rid of Citizens United : have Justice Scalia and/or Kennedy be replaced by a Democratic president .
By the time the next president is inaugurated , those two justices as well as Justice Ginsburg will have celebrated their 80th birthdays .
In itself , this is a powerful rationale for Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s candidacy ."
2015-04-18,"The full - on campaign for US president is barely a week old , but 43-year - old Marco Rubio added a new wrinkle with three words : “ Yesterday is over .
”
In declaring his candidacy the day after Hillary Clinton began the race for the White House in earnest , the Florida senator previewed a key line of attack that Republicans are already using against the 67-year - old Clinton , casting her as a “ leader of yesterday ” .
But in contrasting himself – and what on Friday night he called people “ like myself ” – with the decades - old familiarity of a potential Clinton - Bush redux election that could have symptoms of early - onset voter fatigue , Rubio was also demonstrating a broader argument from Republicans about what they say no star Democrat has right now : youth .
Clinton and other prospective contenders for the 2016 Democratic nomination , such as vice - president Joe Biden , former Virginia senator Jim Webb and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders , are all within a few years of 70 , critics have warned .
Now , as a historically young Republican field shapes up alongside Clinton in New Hampshire this weekend , many voters are wondering not just about who else might run against her but where all the young , rising liberal politicians have gone .
Thirtysomething aides in Washington and political veterans across the country , however , swear the Democrats do n’t have an age problem – the next generation , they say , is simply waiting in the wings .
Indeed , as Clinton ’s confidantes and campaign wranglers try to fend off concerns that the former secretary of state will struggle connecting with young voters , one of the left - wing leaders emerging from Barack Obama ’s administration is already favored in some circles to be her running mate .
“
It ’s a bit of mythology that the Democrats do n’t have a bench , ” a national Democratic operative told the Guardian , insisting that the party ’s candidates - in - waiting are not just young but also diverse .
“
There are folks out there , but there is n’t an opening in the primary in a way that there was even in 2008 .
[ Clinton ] is very popular with primary voters and cleared the field by nature by that .
”
The operative , who requested anonymity to speak freely about national Democratic priorities , added that young voters are “ the ultimate values voters
” – preferring issues over parties .
“
Hillary Clinton is very popular with young voters in poll after poll and it ’s because of where she stands on the issues , plus there is the historic nature about her candidacy that young people gravitate towards as well , ” the operative said .
The historic appeal of a first woman president Neera Tanden , a longtime Clinton adviser and president of the Center for American Progress , honed in on that history – the potential for a first woman president – as a generational change of its own .
“
I ’ve always marveled about how we ’ve talked past Hillary ’s gender –
it ’s also representative of diversity and inclusiveness to have a woman president ,
” Tanden told the Guardian .
“
I do n’t think we should just quickly cast a woman president as not being a fundamental change .
”
Polling shows that voters , particularly those aged between 18 and 29 , are warming up to the historic element of Clinton ’s candidacy – an element many Clinton watchers believe she downplayed to her detriment in the 2008 campaign but that her team has openly embraced this time around .
Clinton also wallops every potential primary opponent for president in most polls , an advantage that has kept many challengers at bay – including younger politicians who have plenty of time to make a run for the White House .
Democratic aides , who strongly dispute the charge that their party lacks younger candidates who might seek the White House or a powerful Senate seat in leading a potential majority comeback in Congress , listed off a host of prolific Democrats under the age of 50 : New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand , New Jersey senator Cory Booker , former San Antonio mayor Julian Castro and his brother , Texas representative Joaquin Castro .
Had Clinton not entered the race on Sunday , they argued , any one of those names could have entered the fray .
The threat of issue - addicted young voters Democrats also pointed out that Republicans have struggled to appeal to so - called millennials because of their positions on women ’s reproductive rights as well as same - sex marriage and immigration .
While the majority of young voters lean Democratic , some political watchers and pollsters have warned that Clinton does n’t necessarily have millennials wrapped up in 2016 after struggling in 2008 with a voting bloc that twice proved critical in boosting Obama .
The more younger voters get to know a candidate , pollsters say , the more susceptible they become to switching allegiances .
And what many know of Clinton is largely drawn from the image projected in the media – less cable news than the Daily Show and Saturday Night Live , which last saw a Clinton impersonator growling in a “ selfie ” video to voters .
Getting out ahead of the skepticism , Clinton kicked off her campaign on a two - day listening tour with voters in the early battleground state of Iowa ; she will head to New Hampshire for similar events next week .
In addition to embracing a more populist rhetoric with echoes of Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren , she has also shifted her stance on same - sex marriage and immigration reform .
In a sign that Clinton herself could be vulnerable to a challenge from the left on those two issues , former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley , perhaps her leading potential Democratic opponent , has now taken his first thinly veiled swipe at Clinton by confronting her shifting positions on them .
“
I ’m glad Secretary Clinton ’s come around to the right positions on these issues , ” O’Malley said on Thursday , in response to a question from the Guardian about Clinton ’s sudden evolution on same - sex marriage as a constitutional right and documentation for illegal immigrants .
“
I believe that we are best as a party when we lead with our principles and not according to the polls .
“ Leadership is about making the right decision , and the best decision before sometimes it becomes entirely popular .
The tomorrow progressive – and a vice - presidential option
Some argue Clinton could go a step further than issue - by - issue messaging by roping in a younger Democratic up - and - comer at the top of her ticket .
Many have already focused on 40-year - old Julian Castro , the former San Antonio mayor who delivered the keynote address at the 2012 Democratic National Convention – the same speech that brought Obama into the national spotlight eight years earlier .
Now the youngest member of the Obama cabinet as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) , Castro is already seen as an early frontrunner for the coveted spot of Clinton ’s running mate .
“
She needs a little tomorrow to offset yesterday .
He provides a perfect complement if she needs one , ” Evan Smith , who has known Castro for over a decade and serves as the editor - in - chief of the Texas Tribune , told the Guardian .
“
He presents a fresh face to counter what many perceive as an unfresh face .
”
While Clinton must contend with her image as a creature of Washington , Castro has a compelling personal story – similar to the one that endeared Obama to voters in 2008 .
Castro and his brother were raised by a single mother who was a prominent activist in San Antonio .
It represents “ a compelling narrative with regard to his ability to represent a new generation , ” said Walter Wilson , associate professor at the Department of Political Science and Geography at the University of Texas - San Antonio .
“
That ’s part of what people see in him , in addition to the fact that he ’s simply well - spoken and attractive as a candidate .
”
Castro has already emerged as a favorite in Democratic circles for his record on issues such as poverty , education , healthcare and workforce development .
At HUD , he has focused on extending housing vouchers to domestic abuse victims and ending veteran homelessness .
“
People who view Secretary Clinton as too captive of the center might actually like to have Julian Castro on the ticket –
he ’s a progressive , ” said Smith .
Castro has deflected questions on his political ambitions , but many have viewed his move out of Texas and directly into the Obama administration as a hop - step introduction to national politics .
“
I ’m trying to do a great job as HUD secretary .
If you do a great job , that opens up opportunities , sometimes opportunities you do n’t even see in the future , ” he told the Daily Beast last month .
The risk of over - thinking age While Democratic aides uniformly sang Castro ’s praises , one operative cautioned that “ a younger running mate just for the sake of having a younger running mate is n’t good for either party ” .
“
People see through optical moves , ” the aide , who works on down - ballot elections , told the Guardian .
“
It ’s the shifting of [ Clinton ’s ] stance on certain issues – like economic populism – that is going to bring her more in line with the kids these days , if you will , more so than having a 40-year - old running mate .
”
Rubio ’s own decision to emphasize age could backfire , as some of his prospective Republican opponents question whether he has the experience to take on the role of commander - in - chief .
Former Texas governor Rick Perry , who may make his own second bid for president , drew a comparison between the likes of Rubio , 44-year - old Ted Cruz and 52-year - old Rand Paul to another “ young , inexperienced senator ” : Barack Obama .
“
Do you want to take a chance on someone who does n’t have an executive track record of being an executive ?
When you walk off the Senate floor , you walk off the Senate floor ,
” Perry said at the Republican Leadership Summit on Thursday in Nashua , New Hampshire .
“
You do n’t walk away from things when you ’re governor .
You have to deal with things .
”
For his part , Rubio knows how to count .
“
I was asked whether 43 is old enough to be elected president , ” Rubio said on Thursday night at the event .
“
I said I was n’t sure , but I know 44 is .
”
The candidate turns 44 next month ."
2015-04-19,"Marco Rubio , the Florida senator who this week declared his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 , on Sunday said he did not â€œbelieve same - sex marriage is a constitutional rightâ€ � .
Rubio said instead that the issue should be decided at the state level , although he did concede that â€œsexual preference is something that people are born withâ€
� .
Same - sex marriage is now legal in 37 US states â€ “ including Florida â€ “ and the District of Columbia , a situation reached after the supreme court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act ( Doma ) in 2013 .
The issue remains contentious in many southern states , but a final supreme court decision on its constitutionality is expected this month .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not that Iâ€ ™ m against gay marriage , â€ �
Rubio said in a CBS interview taped in New Hampshire , the early voting state to which Republican candidates flocked this weekend .
â€œI believe the definition of the institution of marriage should be between one man and one woman .
â€œStates have always regulated marriage .
And if a state wants to have a different definition , you should petition the state legislature and have a political debate .
I donâ€
™ t think courts should be making that decision.â€ � â€œI donâ€ ™ t believe same - sex marriage is a constitutional right .
I also donâ€
™ t believe that your sexual preferences are a choice for the vast and enormous majority of people .
In fact â€ ¦ I believe that sexual preference is something that people are born with.â€ � Before and after his declaration of his presidential candidacy , Rubioâ€ ™ s views on a number of nationally contested issues have come under close scrutiny .
Though he acknowledges the existence of climate change â€ “ in contrast to many other prominent Republicans â€ “ he has said that he does not believe it is caused by humans .
The son of Cuban immigrants was also asked about immigration , another issue on which Republican feelings run high .
In 2013 he was one of the sponsors of a comprehensive reform bill .
Many critics have suggested he dropped the issue after the billâ€ ™ s failure to pass through Congress .
Rubio told CBS host Bob Schieffer he no longer believed such an approach could work , and instead outlined a number of steps he said would have to be taken â€ “ on issues such as border security â€ “ before undocumented immigrants in the US could achieve citizenship .
â€œWe understand that we have to deal with 12 million human beings that are in this country , that have been here for longer than a decade ,
â€ � he said .
â€œWe know we have to deal with this .
We are not prepared to deal with it until first you can prove to us this will never happen again.â€
�
Asked about his position in a crowded Republican field â€ “ potentially featuring as many as 19 candidates for the nomination
â€ “ Rubio said he was uniquely qualified having served at local , state and national levels .
Repeating familiar attack lines heard across the field in Nashua , New Hampshire , on Friday and Saturday , he also said Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton would offer the country â€œanother four years of Barack Obamaâ€ � , and her record on foreign policy had been â€œa disaster for Americaâ€ � .
At his campaign launch on Tuesday , Rubio played heavily on his youth as compared with Clintonâ€ ™ s age , which is 67 .
In response to scepticism surrounding his experience , as he runs for the White House after less than one full term on Capitol Hill , the 43-year - old told CBS : â€œThe presidencyâ€ ™ s a big job and Iâ€ ™ m prepared for that.â€ �"
2015-04-29,"A bill that would allow Congress to review the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s nuclear deal with Iran has fallen victim to presidential politics , as a trio of Republican senators seeking the White House have seized on the debate as a messaging opportunity for their foreign policy agendas .
The Florida senator Marco Rubio , who launched his presidential campaign earlier this month , is leading the pack with seven amendments to the Iran sanctions bill .
The most contentious would force Iran to recognize Israelâ€ ™ s right to exist , a measure that the Iran billâ€ ™
s proponents have warned could scuttle both the compromise in the Senate and the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s broader negotiations .
But Rubio , who has cast himself as the GOPâ€ ™ s most hawkish candidate in 2016 , showed no signs of backing down on Wednesday in a fiery speech demanding a vote on his amendments .
Rubio strongly disputed that his amendment related to Israelâ€ ™ s right to exist would unravel a historic nuclear deal with Iran .
â€œSomehow Iâ€ ™ ve been told that this is going to box the White House in .
If it does , it boxes them in with their own words , â€ � said Rubio , who sits on the Senate foreign relations committee and voted last week in favor of advancing the bill outside of the panel .
The Iran bill , a carefully crafted bipartisan agreement , would provide Congress with the ability to review the nuclear accord and give lawmakers 30 days to pass a resolution of disapproval of any final deal .
If US lawmakers passed such a resolution , Barack Obama would be unable to waive some of the congressional sanctions on Iran .
The Tennessee senator Bob Corker , the chairman of the foreign relations committee , has said the legislation has the 67 votes required to override a presidential veto in its current form .
As a result , both Corker and Republican leaders have urged Rubio and Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul â€ “ also 2016 candidates â€ “ to withhold so - called â€œpoison pillâ€ � amendments that would revive a veto threat from the White House .
Cruz filed an amendment last week that would require congressional approval of any Iranian nuclear deal before sanctions relief can occur â€ “ essentially granting lawmakers an up or down vote on a final agreement .
Paul has not offered any amendments to the Iran bill yet , but is eyeing a debate over the National Security Agencyâ€ ™ s bulk surveillance program as lawmakers near an end - of - May deadline to renew central components of the USA Patriot Act .
The Obama administration has made clear that if any Republican amendments geared toward upending the deal make their way into the final bill , the president will rescind his support for it .
â€œThere will be a lot of pretty awful amendments , quite frankly , â€ � Wendy Sherman , a top official at the State Department , said Monday .
â€œThe president has said that if the Corker - Cardin legislation stays where it is , he will not veto it .
If it becomes something else , then heâ€ ™ ll have to consider his options.â€
�
As many as 60 amendments have been filed , but itâ€ ™ s unclear how many , or which ones , will come to the floor for a vote .
The Senate rejected one amendment on Tuesday , offered by the Wisconsin senator Ron Johnson , that would have required any nuclear deal with Tehran to be considered an international treaty .
The Senate majority leader , Mitch McConnell , said on Tuesday he expected lawmakers to work with the billâ€ ™ s sponsors â€ “ Corker and Maryland
Senator Ben Cardin , the ranking member of the foreign relations committee â€ “ to schedule votes .
Cardin pushed back against Rubioâ€ ™ s Israel amendment on Wednesday , telling the Florida senator on the floor that the bill already states â€ “ at Rubioâ€ ™ s request â€ “ that the president â€œshould determine the agreement in no way compromises the commitment of the United States to Israelâ€ ™ s security nor its support for Israelâ€ ™ s right to existâ€ � .
But Rubio is seeking public recognition from Iranâ€ ™ s leaders that Israel has a right to exist as a Jewish state , a notion that Obama said this month is â€œakin to saying that we wonâ€ ™ t sign a deal unless the nature of the Iranian regime completely transformsâ€ � .
Rubioâ€ ™ s amendment would put lawmakers in a tricky position , given their strong ties to Israel .
Democrats in particular would be pressured to buck the White House and vote for the amendment , despite the concerns raised by the administration .
â€œI hope that we will be able to move on these amendments .
I donâ€
™ t think they undermine this one bit , â€ �
Rubio said on the floor .
â€œItâ€ ™ s about time that this body takes this up.â€ �
For Rubio , the Iran debate offers the first real test since he declared his candidacy to flex his political muscle .
Much of Rubioâ€ ™ s 13 April announcement speech in Miami centered on the need for a new direction in Americaâ€ ™ s foreign policy .
Failing to procure even a vote on one of his amendments would , at the very least , raise questions about Rubioâ€ ™ s effectiveness .
Corker has remained optimistic that he can fend off politically charged amendments but would not predict how exactly the process will play out .
He received an unexpected boost from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , the largest pro - Israel lobby in Washington , which has been rallying pro - Israel Republicans behind the scenes against controversial amendments .
Corker told reporters on Wednesday he was taking things one day at a time .
â€œI hope weâ€ ™ re going to end up with a bill that will become law and thatâ€ ™ s the goal , â€ � he said ."
2015-05-04,"Carly Fiorina formally declared herself a candidate for president on Monday , making her the first woman to seek the Republican nomination in 2016 â€ “ and perhaps Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s most antagonistic foil .
She announced the move on Twitter with the simple message : â€œI am running for president.â€
�
Fiorina , a former chief executive of Hewlett - Packard , joins senators Ted Cruz , Rand Paul and Marco Rubio in what is shaping up to be a crowded GOP field .
The retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson announced his candidacy too ; former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee is expected to launch his campaign on Tuesday .
Fiorina , 60 , has never held public office , having lost a 2010 Senate bid in California after serving as an adviser to John
McCainâ€ ™ s 2008 presidential campaign .
But she has touted her private sector experience as the first female CEO of a Fortune 20 company , despite a tumultuous few years as the head of Hewlett - Packard that ultimately led to her losing her job .
On her new website , she wrote a message that has been a staple of the run - up to a formal campaign launch : â€œOnly in the United States of America can a young woman start as a secretary and work to become chief executive of one of the largest technology companies in the world.â€ � Fiorina is viewed by many as the Republican partyâ€ ™ s best answer to Hillary Clinton , the frontrunner among Democrats .
Fiorina is already assuming the role of Clinton attack dog and in numerous public appearances has gone after the former secretary of stateâ€ ™ s family non - profit , the Clinton Foundation , and its dealings with foreign governments .
Her campaign launch video opens with her watching Clintonâ€ ™ s much - publicised campaign launch film on TV , before ostentatiously switching it off with her remote control .
â€œOur founders never intended us to have a professional political class ,
â€ �
Fiorina says .
â€œThey believed that citizens and leaders needed to step forward .
We know the only way to reimagine our government is to reimagine who is leading it.â€
�
She adds : â€œIf youâ€ ™ re tired of the soundbites , the vitriol , the pettiness , the egos , the corruption , if you believe that itâ€ ™ s time to declare the end of identity politics , if you believe that itâ€ ™ s time to declare the end of lowered expectations , if you believe that itâ€ ™ s time for citizens to stand up to the political class and say : â€˜Enoughâ€ ™ , then join us.â€ �
In a call with reporters on Monday , she said her campaign was not just anti - Clinton , then proceeded to attack Clinton again .
â€œYes , I would be running for president no matter who the nominee is on the Democratic side ,
â€ �
she told the call .
â€œShe
[ Clinton ] reminds people that there is a huge disconnect between that political class and the hopes and concerns of the hardworking Americans everywhere.â€
�
In an interview with ABCâ€ ™ s Good Morning America on Monday
, she went further : â€œShe clearly is not trustworthy , about a whole set of things , â€ � Fiorina said of Clinton .
On Tuesday , Fiorina is scheduled to speak at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in New York before traveling to Iowa .
Her new book , Rising to the Challenge , is also set for release on Tuesday .
It details aspects of her personal life and how the death of her daughter and her fight against cancer intensified her adherence to Christianity .
She is also the author of Tough Choices , a memoir that focused on her business career .
Nearly a dozen Republicans are expected to make a bid for the White House , including former Florida governor Jeb Bush , Wisconsin governor Scott Walker and former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum .
On the Democratic side , the independent Vermont senator Bernie Sanders joined Clinton as an official candidate last week .
Former Maryland governor Martin Oâ€ ™ Malley and former Virginia senator Jim Webb are also expected to run ."
2015-05-05,"The Republican Partyâ€ ™ s disingenuous exploitation of identity politics explains why for the next few months you will see a lot of Dr Ben Carson ( and Carly Fiorina and Marco Rubio ) , who yesterday announced his intention to fail to become President of the United States .
But let us take a cue from the Republican Party and employ a quote they run out whenever arguing that they donâ€ ™ t dislike minorities for being minorities but just coincidentally dislike almost all of them on their merits .
Let us judge Dr Ben Carson not by the color of his skin but by the content of his character .
Ben Carson is a mean - spirited loon .
This is not to suggest that Ben Carson is an unintelligent man .
Far from it !
You donâ€
™ t get to become a Director of Pediatric Neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins and successfully separate twins conjoined at the head without mastering a great deal of formidable and specialized knowledge .
And indeed his life story is pretty incredible ; they made it into a TV movie !
Unfortunately , he thinks he can now operate on the body politic , and , sorry , but you canâ€ ™ t do that , man .
Thatâ€ ™ s just a metaphor .
Youâ€ ™ ve probably seen this kind of bozo impulse at work in your life .
A friend or colleague amasses a tremendous amount of knowledge in some arcane or specialized field and mistakenly thinks this proficiency applies to everything .
At some point , they forget that itâ€ ™ s possible that they could be uninformed on any issue that interests them and they assume any obstacles encountered are the fault of people who have failed to keep up .
Call it stupid - smart if you want , call it Carsonâ€ ™ s Neurosis , call it whatever
â€
”
theyâ€ ™ re the same problem .
Sure , you say , but how was the announcement ?
It looked like something arranged by a loon .
There was 25 minutes of music preceding the speech , including a gospel choir performing Eminemâ€ ™ s Lose Yourself .
Imagine the thought process that went into that .
One hopes , on some fundamental level , that somebody actually said out loud : â€œThe thing thatâ€ ™ s kept black people from voting Republican is not enough gospel versions of white rap.â€ �
We , as an ailing nation , need that to be true .
Starting at 15:30 , there was also light opera .
A five minute video of breathtaking grandiosity followed , with a deep - voiced narrator starting off slowly and gruffly before speeding up into something like a mild ecstasy at the notion of launching Ben Carson into the White House instead of the sun .
We are told that â€œhistorians will write about this critical turning point for our nation and how we responded to the dynamic forces changing our worldâ€ � , as Carson is likened via images to Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr.
Okay .
Next , the voiceover guy tells us : â€œWe can no longer afford the continuing dysfunction of opposing partisan rancor ...
We have stifled all civilized and productive debateâ€ � .
Yo , voiceover guy , Iâ€ ™ m really happy for you and Iâ€ ™
ma let you finish , but lets read some old Ben Carson quotes : There was the time he said that Obamacare is â€œthe worst thing that has happened to this nation since slavery.â€ �
There was the time in February of last year that he said that Americans were afraid to speak up against progressives because they were afraid â€œthey will be targeted , they will be called names , they will be investigated by the IRS and all kinds of unimaginable things
will happenâ€
� .
He later repeats this same talking point in his announcement speech .
But back then he went on : â€œThere comes a time when people with values simply have to stand up .
Think about Nazi Germany .
Most of those people did not believe in what Hitler was doing .
But did they speak up ?
Did they stand up for what they believe in ?
They did not , and you saw what happened.â€ �
And if that was just a rhetorical flourish , he clarified a month later when he said that Americans lived in a Gestapo state .
I mean , [ our society is ] very much like Nazi Germany .
And I know youâ€ ™ re not supposed to say â€˜Nazi Germany , â€ ™ but
I donâ€
™ t care about political correctness .
You know , you had a government using its tools to intimidate the population ...
And itâ€ ™ s because of the PC police ,
itâ€ ™ s because of politicians ,
itâ€ ™ s because of news .
Itâ€ ™ s all of these things are combining to stifle peopleâ€ ™ s conversation .
He goes on to make those same â€œstifling conversationâ€ � points in his announcement speech , but with all the Nazi stuff cut out .
Like the de - Nazified Nazi material , much of Carsonâ€ ™ s announcement is similar to previous speeches , and frankly his speech just doesnâ€ ™ t pop without Hitler or slaves .
Carson has a headset mic and paces the state , trying for the Ted Cruz effect .
But Cruz was a star parliamentary debater , and Carson is not .
He noticeably searches for his next point and repeats himself , speaking with a heavy - lidded and often downcast visage , as if your tired , exasperated granddad converted a kitchen lecture you didnâ€ ™ t want to hear into a TED talk you want to hear less .
Carson states that he doesnâ€ ™ t want to get rid of the safety net .
â€œThis is a blatant lie .
I have no desire to get rid of safety nets for people who need them .
I have a strong desire to get rid of programs that create dependency in able - bodied peopleâ€ � .
Translated back from the Republican , thatâ€ ™ s :
â€œI want to get rid of the safety net for anyone who isnâ€ ™ t sickâ€ � .
He then flawlessly attacks a straw man argument about socialism that no Democratic candidate has ever made in history : â€œthey want to be involved in every aspect of [ peopleâ€ ™ s ] lives .
They want most of their earnings.â€ �
He boldly says the word socialism and sarcastically says the word utopia .
Minutes later , he laments :
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve allowed the purveyors of division to become rampant in our society and to create fiction and fear.â€ �
This somehow then segues into the words Saul Alinsky and another straw man about , essentially , thoughtcrime .
It gets dumber from there , but it involves math and familiar BS about the highest corporate tax rate in the world , so weâ€ ™ ll skip it .
Finally , he says : â€œWe also have a great team .
We have â€ ” who do we have?â€ � then remembers the names of his campaign advisors and brings them all up onstage after introducing each .
We close with them , the gospel choir and the Carsons singing â€œThe Battle Hymn of the Republic.â€
�
This is all going to get worse and hopefully much funnier before Carson goes away .
Because , while heâ€ ™ s certainly a brilliant medical mind , he seems unaware or unconcerned with all the things he doesnâ€ ™ t know .
What he doesnâ€ ™ t know about foreign policy could probably be described as â€œall of it.â€ �
He honestly thinks that the deprivation of heterosexual contact that leads to homosexuality in prison is a good argument for homosexuality being â€œa choice.â€
�
He once stated that â€œanarchyâ€ � could cancel the 2016 election .
And you will keep seeing him , not only because heâ€ ™ s polling at 7.3 % in Iowa ( above Ted Cruz ! ) , but because heâ€ ™ s good for identity politics .
It works both in terms of optics ( eg â€œHow can the Republican Party not appeal to black people when thereâ€ ™ s a black candidate?â€ � ) , and in terms of a far - right fever dream of Ben Carson as the savior candidate who could peel off Obama voters and guarantee a Republican presidency .
All he needs is 17 % of the black vote , despite offering no policies that address black peopleâ€ ™ s needs instead of boilerplate conservative , Christian , pro - business needs .
The math is inevitable !
Ordinarily , with a candidate this prone to saying things this crazy and with such a steep road ahead , you go to the default answer for why theyâ€ ™ re doing this : theyâ€ ™ re selling a book , or theyâ€ ™ re trying to get a multi - million - dollar annual contract at Fox News , or â€ ” if theyâ€ ™ re
Newt and Callista Gingrich â€
” theyâ€ ™ re trying to sell books ,
childrenâ€ ™ s books , collectibles , videos , wallpaper patterns and haunted jade figurines .
But thatâ€ ™ s the interesting thing about a brilliant idiot like Ben Carson .
He may , with deep intellectual conviction , have no idea he can not possibly win ."
2015-05-06,"Hillary Clinton has called for a â€œfull and equalâ€ � path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US , in her most direct effort to distinguish herself â€ “ on any issue â€ “ from Republican presidential challengers .
During a campaign swing through the battleground state of Nevada on Tuesday , Clinton gave her full support for Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s controversial executive actions on immigration reform â€ “ and promised to â€œgo even furtherâ€ � with the threat of her own â€œin the face of inactionâ€ � .
Clinton continued to re - establish her domestic - policy credentials to progressives while stepping up her challenges to Republicans like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio , saying it was â€œfoolishâ€ � to believe that deportations were the answer to one of the most contentious topics in the amped - up race for the White House .
â€œWe canâ€ ™ t wait any longer for a path to full and equal citizenship , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œNow this is where I differ from everybody on the Republican side .
Make no mistake
: today not a single Republican candidate announced or potential is clearly or consistently supporting a path to citizenship â€
“ not one.â€ � â€œWhen they talk about legal status , that is code for second - class status.â€
�
Clinton again positioned a liberal cause as a family and economic issue , as she has on womenâ€ ™ s rights .
But she also positioned herself to the left of even Obama on immigration , whose orders have led to non - stop conservative ire and legal challenges but would still allow for the deportation of those brought illegally to the country as children â€ “ so - called â€œdreamersâ€ � .
She called for allowing the parents of dreamers to apply for legal status , as well as a recalibration of targeted enforcement procedures and extended deferred action .
â€œItâ€ ™ s very short - sighted of us not to legalize students who graduate from college and can use their skills to make a good life for themselves but also to give back , â€ �
she told a roundtable of young Nevadans who had benefited under the presidentâ€ ™ s deferred action program .
Clinton spoke at a Las Vegas high school that her campaign said has a roughly 70 % Hispanic student body , on the same day as the release of a controversial book alleging that her family foundation accepted donations in exchange for subtle favours when she was serving as secretary of state .
Two polls released on Tuesday showed her dipping slightly and holding strong amid the controversy against a widening Republican field .
But taking on conservatives trying to attract Latino voters while careful not to upset the party base , Clinton forcefully baited her challengers .
Bush , the former Florida governor whose name remains at or near the top of most early polls , has called for a pathway to legal status , rather than citizenship .
Even so , and even without yet formally declaring his campaign , may prove to be an attractive candidate to Latino voters .
He speaks fluent Spanish and his wife , Columba , was born in Mexico .
As governor of a state with a large Latino population , he is well - versed in immigration policies and politics , and has a track - record of supporting reform measures .
He has not gone so far as to back family reunification ; asked recently if he would roll back Obamaâ€ ™ s executive order , Bush replied : â€œYes I would.â€ � Rubio , the son of Cuban immigrants , was a driver behind comprehensive immigration reform that faltered in Congress but has since retreated from that position .
He said as recently as last week that he would support a pathway to citizenship only in tandem with stricter immigration enforcement measures .
Senator Ted Cruz , also the son of a Cuban immigrant , remains a ferocious opponent of Obamaâ€ ™ â€ ™ s immigration action , which he has called â€œexecutive amnestyâ€ � and pushed hard against plans to create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants .
Simon Rosenberg , a strategist and president of NDN , a left - leaning Washington think tank that tracks issues important to Latino voters , said conservatives wavering on immigration reform would have to â€œclaw their way backâ€ � as Clinton tacked to the left herself .
â€œRepublicans going up against a candidate with a very strong standing in the Hispanic electorate â€ “ and they donâ€ ™ t have the perfect candidate , â€ � he said .
â€œThey donâ€
™ t have a silver bullet.â€
�
Though she has at least supported a pathway to citizenship since 2006 , Clinton herself has wavered in her support for other issues important to Latino and immigration reform advocates .
In 2006 , Clinton voted in favour of building more than 700 miles of fencing along stretches of the US - Mexican border .
In a 2007 presidential debate , Clinton stumbled over the issue of driverâ€ ™ s licenses for illegal immigrants .
She later clarified that she opposed driving licenses for undocumented people â€ “ a position she was forced to reverse .
Last summer , Latino advocacy groups critiqued Clinton after she said unaccompanied minors flooding the US - Mexico border , most fleeing violence and poverty in Central American , should be â€œsent backâ€ � to their native countries .
Her record on immigration was even a target for former Maryland governor Martin Oâ€ ™ Malley , who said in response to a question from the Guardian last month that he was â€œglad Secretary Clintonâ€ ™
s come around to the right positionsâ€ � on providing documentation for illegal immigrants .
The 2016 Democratic hopeful , who has yet to formally declare his candidacy , has been critical of Clinton for not being progressive enough , especially on issues like immigration .
On Tuesday , Oâ€ ™ Malleyâ€ ™ s spokeswoman , Lis Smith , said : â€œGovernor Oâ€ ™ Malley stood up when it mattered .
When most leaders in the Democratic and Republican parties were saying that we should close our border to children fleeing violence in Central America , he defied them and said that we could not send children â€˜back to certain deathâ€ ™ .
He was criticized for that position , but leadership is about forging public opinion , not following it.â€ �
During the roundtable discussion , Clinton insisted she has been a longtime advocate for immigrants , though she admitted : â€œWe were not successfulâ€ � in building a path to citizenship during her time in the US Senate .
Clinton will next travel to California for a fundraising tour expected to court technology executives .
But it may be her unexpectedly full - throated call for progressive immigration reform that ends up standing out on her west - coast tour .
â€œSo , you know where I stand and there can be no question about it ,
â€ � she said ."
2015-05-13,"Marco Rubio filled a lecture hall at the Council on Foreign Relations with imagery about warships , fighter jets and weapons shipments in an appearance on Wednesday to lay out his vision for a significantly more muscular US foreign policy â€ “ one that he said would prevent a global descent into â€œchaosâ€ � but stop short of making America the â€œworldâ€ ™ s
policemanâ€ � .
â€œAmerica plays a part on the world stage for which there is no understudy , â€ � the senator and Republican presidential hopeful told a standing - room - only crowd on New Yorkâ€ ™ s Upper East Side .
â€œWhen we fail to lead with strength and principle there is no other country , friend or foe , that is willing or able to take our place .
And the result is chaos.â€ �
While most of the policy prescriptions Rubio made on Wednesday â€ “ arm the Ukrainian military , pull back from negotiations with Iran , increase air strikes in Iraq , increase naval activity in the China Sea , reverse the â€œnormalizationâ€ � of relations with Cuba â€ “ were hawkish in nature , on the most hotly contested foreign policy issue of the last decade
â€ “ the Iraq war
â€ “ the candidate seemed to reverse himself in the direction of restraint .
During his run for the US Senate in Florida in 2010 Rubio was asked whether the Iraq war had made the United States â€œsafer and better offâ€ � .
â€œI think ultimately yes , â€ � Rubio said ,
â€œbecause
Saddam Hussein is no longer in charge.â€
�
Rubio seemed to contradict that view on Wednesday when moderator Charlie Rose asked whether he would have been in favor of the Iraqi invasion â€œafter finding out that there were no weapons of mass destructionâ€ � .
â€œNot only would I not have been in favor of it , President [ George W ]
Bush would not have been in favor of it , â€ �
Rubio replied .
â€œAnd he said so .
President Bush has said that he regrets that the intelligence was faulty .
I donâ€
™ t think Congress would have voted in favor of the authorization if they didnâ€ ™ t know that.â€
�
Likely Rubio presidential opponent Jeb Bush had told a questioner days earlier that â€œknowing what we know
nowâ€ �
, he still â€œwould haveâ€ � authorized the 2003 invasion of Iraq had he been president .
Bush later said he had misunderstood the question .
The relatively measured talk on Iraq was the exception , however , in Rubioâ€ ™ s appearance Wednesday , which he otherwise used to sharply condemn a White House foreign policy that he characterized as too passive and â€œunhinged from its moral purposeâ€ � .
The speech fed perceptions that Rubio , who recently backed an amendment that would have crippled the Iran nuclear negotiations and who vehemently opposes the â€œnormalizationâ€ � of relations with Cuba , has raised the temperature of his foreign policy views in recent months , possibly with an eye on the proclivities of Republican primary voters .
In the world view Rubio outlined Wednesday , which he billed as a new doctrine , certain regional conflicts that look very difficult
â€ “ the ongoing war in Syria , the failed state of Libya â€ “ in fact began as tractable problems that spun out of control due to tragic US negligence .
Other regional conflicts that look very difficult
, meanwhile â€ “ the demise of a two - state solution for Israel - Palestine , for example â€ “ Rubio presented as every bit as confounding as they seem , with the United States powerless to act .
â€œMost threatening of all , â€ � Rubio said , â€œwe have seen Iran expand its influence throughout the Middle East , and threaten to annihilate Israel , as it moves closer to a nuclear weapon capability .
The presidentâ€ ™ s proposed deal with Iran will likely lead to a cascade of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East , and it could force Israel to take bold action to defend itself , making war with Iran even more likely.â€ � Rubio offered a similar prescription for flashpoints in Ukraine , the Gulf and the Pacific , describing a need for gestures that would demonstrate a US willingness to defend its interests with military might .
Such a gesture might be directed at China , which Rubio accused of arrogating territory near Japan and the Philippines .
â€œWe should never accept it as a truth that they control that , â€ � Rubio said , referring to artificial islands built by the Chinese .
â€œAnd I would in fact take all sorts of naval actions â€ “ not military actions , per se â€ “ but military naval vessels transiting through that zone , to clearly show this is international waters , open to transit to anyone who wants to go through there.â€ �
Rubio called for increasing airstrikes against Isis militants in Iraq , to be supported on the ground by a â€œpan - Arab Sunni forceâ€ � including troops supplied by Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al - Sisi , who to many eyes appears to be the kind of â€œpro - American dictatorâ€ � that Rubio dismissed as an â€œoxymoronâ€ � in his last outing before the council on foreign relations , in 2012 .
â€œI still think that itâ€ ™ s good weâ€ ™ re conducting air strikes
â€ “
the truth is that we probably need moreâ€ � in Iraq , Rubio said Wednesday .
â€œBut I really think itâ€ ™ s critical that a Sunni force confront them on the ground , and part of that can be Iraqi Sunnis , and I see today that theyâ€ ™ re starting to train some , but I also think itâ€ ™ s important to go to our allies in the region â€ “ the Jordanians , the Egyptians , the GCC countries â€ “ that are willing to also put forces on the ground to help stabilize that country.â€ � Rubio took particular aim at Hillary Clinton , the former secretary of state and presidential contender on the Democratic side , calling her the â€œchief architect and spokesperson of a foreign policy that will go down in history as disastrousâ€ � .
â€œWe simply can not afford to elect as our next president one of the leading agents of this administrationâ€ ™ s foreign policy , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œA leader from yesterday whose tenure as secretary of state was ineffective at best , and dangerously negligent at worst.â€ �
Rubio denied an assertion by Rose that his intensifying proximity as a presidential candidate to mega - donors such as Sheldon Adelson , the staunch supporter of Israel and opponent of a two - state solution , had pulled him in a hawkish direction .
â€œMy interest in Israel is not about the people who will support me politically , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a longstanding belief.â€
� Asked whether he considered Iran as dangerous as Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu seems to , Rubio replied : â€œI view them as the same threat he does .
The difference is , he lives a lot closer to them than I do.â€ �
After Rubio concluded his prepared remarks , Rose asked him : â€œShould we be the worldâ€ ™ s policeman?â€ �
â€œI donâ€ ™ t think thatâ€ ™ s necessarily the role that I would advocate , â€ � Rubio replied .
â€œThe title is not world policeman.â€ �"
2015-05-27,"Hillary Clinton once more placed womenâ€ ™ s economic issues at the center of her agenda on Wednesday , using a speech before a predominantly female audience to distinguish herself from her Republican opponents on issues such as equal pay and pay transparency .
During keynote remarks to the South Carolina House Democratic Womenâ€ ™ s Caucus and the South Carolina Democratic Womenâ€
™ s Council , Clinton made a string of thinly veiled shots at GOP presidential candidates for blocking equal pay legislation in Congress .
Although Clinton did not name specific candidates , she criticized comments made by three Republican presidential hopefuls : Wisconsin governor Scott Walker , who said equal pay was a â€œbogus issueâ€ � ; Florida senator Marco Rubio , who said equal pay legislation amounted to Congress â€œwasting time on scoring political pointsâ€ � ; and Kentucky senator Rand Paul , who has compared equal pay to central governance under the Soviet Union .
â€œTo that I say , what century are they living in?â€ �
Clinton said .
â€œWe could fix this if Republicans could get on board .
We could in fact fix this today , but they wonâ€ ™ t.â€ � â€œWhen any parent is shortchanged , the entire family is shortchanged , and when families are shortchanged , America is shortchanged .
And therefore , this is not a womenâ€ ™ s issue , this is a family issue and an American economic issue.â€ �
Outlining the policies she would support if elected president , Clinton urged the passage of equal pay legislation , known as the Paycheck Fairness Act , and promoted pay transparency to provide women with information to better negotiate their earnings .
Clinton also called for raising the minimum wage , pointing out that lower - paying jobs were disproportionately held by women , and reiterated her support for paid family leave .
Republicans in Congress have blocked equal pay legislation several times over the last couple of years , arguing that it is largely a campaign issue waged by Democrats .
The amped up rhetoric showed a more aggressive side of Clinton , who has thus far spent the last month on a low - key â€œlistening tourâ€ � with middle class Americans in early voting states such as Iowa , New Hampshire and Nevada .
Even as Republicans have mounted a decidedly anti - Clinton message in the primary â€ “ raising questions over her familyâ€ ™ s nonprofit and her use of a private email server at the State Department â€ “ Clinton has largely declined to go on the offensive and dismissed GOP attacks as a distraction from her campaign .
Her rare jabs at GOP presidential contenders on Wednesday were met with both laughter and applause from an audience of roughly 200 people , who also responded enthusiastically to another issue seldom raised by Clinton on the campaign trail : her age .
Noting how most presidents â€œgrow grayer and grayer , â€ � Clinton , who is 67 years old , said there comes a point when â€œthey are as white as the building they live in.â€
�
She then added , â€œI may not be the youngest candidate in this race , but I have one advantage â€ “ Iâ€ ™ ve been coloring my hair for years.â€ � Clintonâ€ ™
s visit to South Carolina marked her first swing through the early voting state since launching her bid for president last month , as well as since losing the state to Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary .
Earlier on Wednesday , the former secretary of state met with minority women who are small business owners at a famed chicken and waffles restaurant in the area .
Clintonâ€ ™ s emphasis on courting women voters has already emerged as a central piece of her campaign , which , contrary to 2008 , embraces the historic nature of her candidacy as the first potential woman president .
In Columbia on Wednesday , Clintonâ€ ™ s outreach was largely tailored toward both women and minorities as she seeks to build the same coalitions that were twice instrumental in electing Barack Obama ."
2015-06-07,"It is an episode that Marco Rubio had hoped was long forgotten â€ “ a federal investigation and top - to - toe examination of the Florida GOPâ€ ™ s financial trickery at the end of the last decade that saw the stateâ€ ™ s party chairman jailed for grand theft and money laundering and another senior Republican facing corruption charges .
Rubio , who was speaker of the Florida House of Representatives from 2007 to 2009 , emerged unscathed as agents from the US attorneyâ€ ™ s office , Internal Revenue Service , FBI and the Florida department of law enforcement examined a number of senior party figures .
But now that he is running for president , and enjoying a popularity surge that placed him top of the crowded field of Republican White House hopefuls in last weekâ€ ™ s CNN / ORC poll , questions over Rubioâ€ ™ s fiscal propriety appear to be coming back to haunt his campaign .
Opponents will seize on his misuse of a party - issued credit card , and separate accusations that he treated hundreds of thousands of dollars in political donations to two conservative action committees he established before he became speaker as a personal slush fund .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s no other way of putting it than saying he raised money to travel and to go for fine - dining meals when the purpose of those committees was to help elect candidates running for public office , â€ � said Christian Ulvert , a senior Democratic adviser who was the opposition partyâ€ ™ s communications chief in Florida when Rubio was speaker .
â€œIf itâ€ ™
s 25 to 35 K over a year
youâ€ ™ d be saying is that a big deal , and rightfully so .
But when youâ€ ™ re talking around $ 300,000 dollars thatâ€ ™ s a different story .
Thatâ€ ™ s a big chunk of change .
Itâ€ ™ s clear there was lack of accountability and fiscal discipline.â€
� Set up ostensibly for â€œeducationâ€ � and â€œto support state and local candidates who espouse conservative government policiesâ€
� , the committees , according to investigations by the Miami Herald and Tampa Bay Times , paid tens of thousands of dollars in â€œreimbursements for expensesâ€ � to Rubio and several family members , another $ 150,000 for â€œoffice / operating and administrative
costsâ€ � , up to $ 50,000 in vague credit card charges covering travel , food and lodging , and many thousands more in â€œconsultancy feesâ€ � .
Former Florida governor Charlie Crist , who lost to Rubio in the 2010 US Senate election , accused his opponent of enriching himself through private â€œslush fundsâ€ � .
Rubioâ€ ™ s then campaign adviser Todd Harris admitted that the bookkeeping â€œwas not always
perfectâ€ � .
During the separate federal investigation , which began in 2010 , little more than a year after Rubio left office , IRS agents looked closely at lavish personal spending that appeared on American Express cards issued by the state GOP to Rubio , then - chairman Jim Greer and other state party leaders .
Tax exemption rules for political parties limit spending to legitimate political activities including fundraising .
Yet more than $ 100,000 in charges that appeared on Rubioâ€ ™ s bills during his two years as speaker included bills for groceries , liquor , a $ 10,000 family vacation to Georgia and some expensive car repairs .
The image - conscious politician even splurged $ 134 on a haircut at a prestigious Miami salon .
When the Herald and Times inquiry exposed the details , Rubio acknowledged the spending as a misunderstanding and paid back more than $ 16,000 .
â€œI was as diligent as possible to ensure the party did not pay for items that were unrelated to party business , â€ �
Rubio said in a written statement at the time .
â€œThere was no formal process provided by the party regarding personal charges.â€ �
Rubio also pointed out that the damage to his family minivan was caused by parking attendants while he was at a political event , and that the party had agreed to cover some of the cost .
The IRS inquiry quietly went away , leaving Rubio free to fight for and win election to the US Senate later that year .
An IRS spokesman told the Guardian he could not comment on individual investigations .
Senior party allies under scrutiny alongside Rubio , however , were not so fortunate .
After a lengthy investigation , Greer , chair of the Florida Republican Party from 2006 until he resigned in 2010 , pleaded guilty to fraud and theft charges over a crooked fundraising scheme .
He served 15 months of an 18-month sentence .
Ray Sansom , Rubioâ€ ™ s successor as speaker who resigned in 2009 , faced grand theft and conspiracy charges for misappropriation of tax dollars in an unrelated episode before prosecutors dropped all charges in 2011 .
Greer was widely seen as the scapegoat for the partyâ€ ™ s financial scandals during the Rubio era .
Before accepting the plea deal , he hinted he knew where the bodies were buried .
He promised his 2013 trial would be â€œa Shakespearean play where everyone dies in the endâ€ � and speculation was rife that Rubio , on a list of 117 potential witnesses in the case , was among the leading party figures whose secrets Greer was about to reveal .
In his book The Chairman , released shortly before he was freed from jail last summer , Greer accused Rubio of hypocrisy for calling for audits to secure greater oversight of state spending while at the same time he was spending freely .
He described Rubio as â€œsmart , ruthless and always schemingâ€ � .
To Rubioâ€ ™ s camp , which already appears to be weary of the renewed interest in his fiscal activities , all of this is old news .
In reply to specific questions from the Guardian about Rubioâ€ ™ s credit card spending and financial controversies over his tenure as Florida House speaker , press secretary Brooke Sammon replied only that her boss â€œaddresses much of this in his first bookâ€
� .
In March , in a Business Insider report , Sammon said the stories were â€œnothing more than proven inaccuracies and false attacks from liberals trying to distract from Senator Rubioâ€ ™ s optimistic vision for our country in the 21st centuryâ€ � .
While the Florida GOP did release some of the credit card bills , Rubio has always steadfastly refused to reveal those from the time before he became speaker , calling them â€œan internal party matter.â€ �
In his book , An American Son , a chronicle of his early political career , Rubio denied any intentional wrongdoing , and during a 2012 interview with Fox News he explained that he would directly pay off the personal expenses each month as the bills arrived , and that the party never paid them .
The issue , he insisted , â€œwas totally resolved years agoâ€ � .
Yet the questions are certain to keep coming up as the 2016 candidateâ€ ™ s closets are rifled through for skeletons .
Another test will come over his close friendship with David Rivera , a controversial former member of the Florida House with whom he owned a house in Tallahassee shared during their time in office together .
The property was in foreclosure in 2010 until Rubio made a payment to clear mortgage arrears .
But the three - bedroom house , and Rubioâ€ ™ s friendship with a disgraced politician under federal and state ethics investigations for alleged illegal campaign activities , remains a liability .
Sammon would not address a question about the Rubio - Rivera relationship .
The controversies from Rubioâ€ ™ s bumpy two years as speaker also run to his handling of the stateâ€ ™ s purse strings .
He was dogged by criticism over an upscale refurbishment of his suite of offices and members - only areas in the state capitol , questions over pay raises for his senior staff , and suspicion over helping to steer millions in state money to a university at which he accepted a position as a well - paid part - time professor of politics when he left office .
He also fell out with others in his own party , especially then - governor Crist , over finances , and he had two committee chairman stripped of their authority for voting against his vision on property insurance reform .
â€œIt was Marcoâ€ ™ s way or no way , â€ �
Ulvert said .
â€œAs is true for all Republican colleagues in the legislature , they want to say theyâ€ ™ re fiscal conservatives but itâ€ ™ s in convenience only .
They go around the state parading those terms , but when you look at their spending habits , itâ€ ™ s far from it.â€
�
The damage to Rubio from such scrutiny remains to be seen .
â€œAs simple as it sounds , itâ€ ™ s going to come down to his oratory and storytelling skills outplaying his laundry list of issues and controversies , â€ � Ulvert said .
â€œCan he weather his Florida record ?
The intensity is going to grow and all these things will be played out on the national stage .
The problemf is heâ€
™ s going to spend the final months leading up to the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary defending his record and using his fine oratory skills as a defense mechanism rather than as an ability to sell his vision.â€ � Support for Rubio , meanwhile , comes from a surprising quarter .
Dan Gelber , who as leader of the minority Democrats in the Florida House often faced down the speaker , said his one - time political opponent and friend was mostly following financial policies set by his party , and could not be singled out for criticism .
â€œThe Republican stewardship of Florida was a disaster
but I canâ€
™ t attach it all to him , â€ � Gelber said .
â€œSpeakers are normally forgotten very quickly , but Marco is the exception rather than the rule in terms of future political success .
He clearly has a lot of ingredients to make a run .
â€œRepublicans seem to flirt with a lot of candidates , then nominate the guy you want in your golf foursome .
Under that metric I would vote on Jeb Bush but not count Marco Rubio out.â€ �"
2015-06-15,"Jeb Bush sought to cast himself as a political outsider during his first big speech as a presidential candidate on Monday , drawing on his record as governor of Florida to counter criticism that he represents the establishment wing of the Republican party .
“
We will take Washington – the static capital of this dynamic country – out of the business of causing problems , ” Bush was expected to say as he took to the stage in a college sports hall in Miami .
The brother of president George W Bush and son of president George HW Bush has been implicitly criticised by Republican rivals such as senator Marco Rubio , who urge primary voters to back a younger , “ change ” candidate .
But the two - term state governor – and former mentor of Rubio – took his local protege head - on during his first speech , echoing language and sentiments designed to show he too could appeal to those looking for change in Washington .
“
We will take command of our future once again in this country , ” Bush was due to say , according to an extract provided in advance by his campaign team .
“
We will lift our sights again , make opportunity common again , get events in the world moving our way again .
”
The crowd of several hundred supporters gathered at the event – which marks the formal start of Bush ’s campaign – were noticeably older than those backing Rubio and other activist favourites such as senator Rand Paul .
But the Bush team are playing heavily on his links to Hispanic voters and support for immigration reform , warming up the crowd with Latin music .
The governor also sought to appeal to economic conservatives with repeated references to his track record in his office .
“
We made Florida No 1 in job creation and No 1 in small business creation , ” he was due to say – “ 1.3 million new jobs , 4.4 % growth , higher family income , eight balanced budgets , and tax cuts eight years in a row that saved our people and businesses $ 19bn .
” Bush was due to be joined on stage by his son , Texas land commissioner George P Bush , and Berthy De La Rosa - Aponte , a local advocate for individuals and children with disabilities – a theme that featured heavily in a pre - event campaign video designed to highlight his “ compassionate conservatism ” .
“
I will campaign as I would serve , going everywhere , speaking to everyone , keeping my word , facing the issues without flinching , and staying true to what I believe ,
” Bush was due to say .
“
I will take nothing and no one for granted .
I will run with heart .
I will run to win .
“"
2015-06-18,"The Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio was interrupted by immigration activists during a speech at a conservative gathering in Washington on Thursday .
Rubio was in the midst of making a pitch for why he should be elected president at the annual Faith and Freedom Coalition Conference when two men , who identified themselves as undocumented immigrants , stood up and heckled the Florida senator .
â€œWhy do you keep supporting the deportation of families?â€ � one of the protesters yelled .
Both men then launched into chants of â€œImplement Dapa !
Protect Daca!â€
� , referring to the executive orders signed by Barack Obama in 2014 and 2012 that grant deportation relief to some undocumented migrants brought to the United States as children and their parents .
The crowd , made up primarily of social conservatives , began to boo the protesters as they were escorted out by security .
They could still be heard for a few minutes chanting outside the ballroom where Rubioâ€ ™ s speech was being held , but the first - term senator was unfazed by the disruption .
Rubio , a candidate whose message is built in large part on his experience as the son of immigrants , pointed out that his parents came to America from Cuba â€ “ where such action would not be tolerated .
â€œIf you do that in another country , youâ€ ™ d be in jail tonight , â€ � Rubio said , drawing applause from the audience .
â€œIn the United States you can speak freely .
They have a right to be rude and they have a right to be wrong .
We live in a free society.â€ �
Although Rubio is one of the few Republican presidential contenders who supports immigration reform , activists have questioned his commitment after he appeared to distance himself from his own efforts to provide a pathway to citizenship for the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US .
Rubio co - sponsored a comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate in 2013 but died in the House of Representatives .
After drawing the ire of conservatives for his work on the legislation , Rubio switched his position to favoring a piecemeal approach to immigration that begins with strengthening border security .
He has nonetheless faced constant questions on the subject both in interviews and on the campaign trail .
In response , Rubio has continued to make the case for immigration reform by arguing that it enhances Americaâ€ ™ s global competitiveness and still acknowledges the need to address the undocumented immigrants who are already here â€ “ but he has been reticent to openly talk about a pathway to citizenship .
In a Spanish - language interview with Univision in April , Rubio said he would not â€œimmediatelyâ€ � undo Obamaâ€ ™ s 2012 program , Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( Daca ) , which offered temporary reprieve to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children and known as â€œDreamersâ€ � .
But even as he regarded the program as â€œimportant , â€ �
Rubio said it would â€œhave to end at some pointâ€ � .
Rubio has also said he would â€œcancelâ€ � Obamaâ€ ™ s 2014 policy , Deferred Action for the Parents of Americans ( Dapa ) , which expanded the childhood arrival program and provided deportation relief to undocumented parents of US citizens and legal permanent residents who have lived in the country for at least five years .
The 2014 initiatives have been put on hold by a federal court amid legal challenges .
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush was also interrupted by immigration activists this week when announcing his own candidacy for president in Miami .
During a trip to New Hampshire on Tuesday , Bush told Fox News he would repeal Obamaâ€ ™ s executive action on immigration but expressed his support for providing â€œlegal statusâ€ � to undocumented immigrants ."
2015-06-18,"Less than one day after a white gunman killed nine people at a prayer meeting at a historic black church in Charleston , South Carolina , Republican presidential candidates touted their support for the right to bear arms before a mass gathering of conservatives .
Speaking at the Faith and Freedom Coalition conference in Washington DC on Thursday , an annual event that draws a largely evangelical audience , both US senators Marco Rubio and Rand Paul declared their unwavering support for defending second amendment rights in separate speeches .
â€œIf
I am president of the United States , we will appoint justices and we will have an attorney general who will protect our second amendment rights , â€ �
Rubio said to thunderous applause .
â€œEverybodyâ€ ™ s for the second amendment .
All 55 candidates running for president are for the second amendment , on our side , â€ � Paul said later in his own speech .
Although the rousing defenses of gun ownership were not made in reference to the Charleston church massacre â€ “ and are routinely part of both candidatesâ€ ™ stump speeches when addressing social conservatives
â€ “
the comments coincided with what political watchers said was at least the 14th time Barack Obama has been forced to address gun violence in America .
Speaking at the White House , Obama said the shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal ( AME ) church could â€œshift how we think about the issue of gun violenceâ€ � .
At the conference across town , Paul did directly address the Charleston killings just a few minutes into his remarks , as did Texas senator Ted Cruz , another Republican presidential candidate who spoke at the event .
â€œWhat kind of a person goes in a church and shoots nine people ?
Thereâ€ ™ s a sickness in our country .
Thereâ€ ™ s something terribly wrong , â€ � Paul said .
â€œBut it isnâ€ ™ t going to be fixed by the government .
Itâ€ ™ s people straying away .
Itâ€ ™ s people not understanding where salvation comes from.â€ �
Cruz opened his speech by holding a moment of silence for the victims of what he called a â€œhorrific tragedyâ€ � .
â€œToday the body of Christ is in mourning .
A sick and deranged person came and prayed with a historically black congregation for an hour and then murdered nine innocent souls , â€ �
Cruz said of the incident at the historically black church .
â€œChristians across our nation , across our world , believers across our world , are lifting up the congregants at Emanuel AME.â€ �
Rubio did not mention the shooting at all during his remarks , although he tweeted earlier on Thursday that he was â€œsaddenedâ€ � by the event .
By contrast , a visibly frustrated Obama reacted to the shooting by pointing out that he has had â€œto make statements like this too many timesâ€ � .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t have all the facts but we do know that once again innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun , â€ � Obama said .
â€œAt some point we will have to deal with the fact that this kind of mass violence doesnâ€ ™ t happen in other countries and it is in our power to do something about it.â€ �
Republican lawmakers in Washington remain overwhelmingly opposed to gun control and blocked an expansion of background checks in the US Senate shortly after the 2012 mass shooting by 20-year - old Adam Lanza at an elementary school in Newtown , Connecticut , which left 20 children and six educators dead .
All of the roughly dozen Republican contenders for president have consistently flaunted their support for the second amendment while on the campaign trail , often warning that the Obama administration is out to grab guns from ordinary citizens .
Democratic presidential candidates struck a more proactive tone than either their Republican rivals or the exasperated - sounding Obama , with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders calling loudly for a renewed debate on both guns and race .
â€œAs we mourn
and as our hearts break a little more , we will not forsake those who have been victimised by gun violence , this time we have to find answers together , â€ � said Clinton , during a scheduled campaign stop in Las Vegas .
â€œLetâ€ ™ s unite in partnership , not just to talk but to act.â€ � â€œWe have to face hard truths about race , violence , guns and division , â€ � she added .
Sanders was blunter still , calling the attack â€œnot just a tragedyâ€ � but â€œan act of terrorâ€ � .
â€œThis hateful killing is a horrific reminder that , while we have made important progress in civil rights for all of our people , we are far from eradicating racism , â€ � he added .
Despite facing criticism for holding a campaign event on pensions within earshot of a Charleston prayer vigil , Sandersâ€ ™ statement was the first from a leading politician to describe the attack as an act of terrorism .
Clinton was also more outspoken than Obama , saying gun control would have to happen â€œat some pointâ€ � .
â€œWe will stand with you as we seek answers and take action , â€ � she told the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials conference in Las Vegas .
â€œHow many innocent people in our country from little children , church members to movie theater attendees
â€ “ how many people do we need to see cut down before we act?â€
� the former secretary of state asked ."
2015-06-30,"Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio is demanding answers after a Pakistani court quietly freed eight of the 10 men charged with coordinating the shooting of schoolgirl and Nobel Laureate Malala Yousafzai .
Rubio , a senator from Florida , joined forces with California senator Barbara Boxer , a Democrat , in a letter to the US ambassador to Pakistan seeking â€œan honest and transparent accountâ€ � of why the attackers were released .
The senators wrote that they were â€œalarmedâ€ � by reports that eight of the men found responsible for carrying out the 2012 attack , in which Yousafzai was shot in the head while traveling home from school in Swat valley , were acquitted despite being sentenced to 25 years in prison in April .
Their trial was held behind closed doors and raised further questions about the Pakistani judicial system , all too often regarded as broken and criticized for its lack of accountability .
â€œThese reports raise significant concerns about the transparency and the accountability of the Pakistani judicial system , â€ � Rubio and Boxer wrote .
â€œAs
such , we respectfully request that the Pakistani judicial system provide an honest and transparent accounting of the events surrounding the cases against these ten individuals and continue its important work to bring all those responsible for the brutal attack against an innocent teenage girl to justice.â€ � Jalil Jilani , the US ambassador to Pakistan , told the Guardian he has requested the details of the case from Islamabad , the nationâ€ ™ s capital .
A senior police official in Pakistan has said the attackers were released because the evidence against them was insufficient .
But a prosecutor said the men had confessed to plotting the attack .
The actual gunmen who carried it out are believed to have fled to Afghanistan .
Taliban gunmen claimed responsibility for the attack on Yousafzai , which drew global attention and turned the teenager , now 17 , into a symbol of the plight of girls seeking an education in the developing world .
Yousafzaiâ€ ™ s subsequent advocacy for both education and girls earned her the Nobel peace prize last year , making her the youngest recipient of the award in history .
She has also penned a memoir , I Am Malala , met with world leaders including Barack Obama , and addressed the United Nations .
Rubio and Boxer urged the Pakistani government â€œto re - double its effortsâ€ � to bring those responsible for Yousafzaiâ€ ™ s attack to justice .
Rubio is the chairman of the Senate foreign relations committeeâ€ ™ s subcommittee on western hemisphere , transnational crime , civilian security , democracy , human rights and global womenâ€ ™ s issues , and Boxer is its ranking member .

2015-07-08,"Senator Marco Rubio on Wednesday denounced as â€œsilly talkâ€ � the recent charge by Hillary Clinton that the 2016 Republican presidential field is on â€œa spectrum of hostilityâ€ � toward immigrants , insisting the Democratic frontrunner was motivated by pressure she feels from her liberal base .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s silly talk .
Weâ€ ™ re a sovereign country .
We have a right to enforce our immigration laws , â€ �
Rubio said while speaking to reporters on the second of a three - day campaign swing through Iowa .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s not
hostility , thatâ€ ™ s
sovereignty.â€ �
Rubio shot back against Clintonâ€ ™ s own immigration record , citing her opposition â€ “ until recently â€ “ to giving undocumented immigrants driverâ€ ™ s licenses .
He added that he expected the Democratic frontrunner to â€œcontinue to say silly things
â€ ¦ because she feels heat from the leftâ€ � .
The Florida senator , one of the top contenders for the Republican nomination for president , was responding to comments made by Clinton during an interview with CNN on Tuesday .
The former secretary of state was asked about Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s controversial remarks about Mexican immigrants , whom the real estate mogul equated to â€œrapistsâ€ � and â€œkillersâ€ � .
â€œThey are all in the same general area on immigration , â€ �
Clinton said of the Republican partyâ€ ™ s field , which will balloon to 15 candidates on Monday , when the Wisconsin governor , Scott Walker , is expected to declare his own White House run .
â€œThey donâ€
™ t want to provide a path to citizenship .
They range across a spectrum of being either grudgingly welcome or hostile toward immigrants.â€ � Rubio , one of the co - authors of a comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate in 2013 , disputed Clintonâ€ ™ s claim by pointing to his own record .
â€œI do believe that weâ€ ™ re going to have to responsibly and reasonably deal with the fact that weâ€ ™ ve got 12 or 13 million people in this country that are illegally here
â€ ¦ and an enormous and overwhelming majority
have not violated our laws , other than immigration laws , â€ � he said ,
before reiterating his position that immigration reform must begin with border security and bring illegal immigration under tighter controls .
â€œAnyone who believes otherwise is delusional , â€ � said Rubio , who is the son of Cuban immigrants .
He also sharply criticized Trump , who is also seeking the partyâ€ ™ s nomination , and sought to distance the views of other Republican candidates from those of the self - described billionaire .
â€œI think voters are capable of distinguishing the Republican party from Donald Trump , â€ �
Rubio said , adding he â€œobviously strongly disagree[s]â€ � with the comments .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re inaccurate , and theyâ€ ™ re offensive , and theyâ€ ™ re divisive.â€ �
Among other topics Rubio addressed were
the US supreme courtâ€ ™ s recent decision on same - sex marriage , where he took on a different position than Walker , and the financial crisis in Puerto Rico .
The Wisconsin governor reacted to the courtâ€ ™ s landmark ruling in favor of marriage equality last month by saying he would push a constitutional amendment allowing states to define marriage and effectively reverse the courtâ€ ™ s decision .
Rubio said he opposed that approach .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t support a constitutional amendment .
I donâ€
™ t believe the federal government should be in the marriage regulation business , â€ � said Rubio , while reaffirming his belief that marriage should be defined as between a man and a woman .
â€œWe can continue to disagree with it .
Perhaps a future court will change that decision , in much the same way as itâ€ ™ s changed other decisions in the past , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œThe decision is what it is , and thatâ€ ™ s what weâ€ ™ ll live under.â€ �
On Puerto Rico , the senator sounded a different note than Clinton and Jeb Bush , the former governor of Florida who is considered one of Rubioâ€ ™ s top rivals for the Republican presidential ticket .
Both Bush and Clinton have come out in favor of the US Congress granting Puerto Rico the same legal support to file for bankruptcy that is afforded to states .
Asked by the Guardian if he supported Chapter 9 bankruptcy rights for Puerto Rico , Rubio did not take a definitive position , focusing instead on the need to resolve the issue in a way that sets the right precedent for similar situations in the future .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a complex issue , â€ � Rubio said on Wednesday .
â€œWe want to make sure that whatever decision we make with regards to this is probably going to create a precedent for other jurisdictions in the country that are going to face similar situations in the near future .
There are going to be other jurisdictions that are facing financial crises and the inability to meet their liabilities.â€ � â€œWhatever precedent we set in Puerto Rico could be established in these other places , â€ � Rubio said , â€œso
itâ€ ™
s important
we get it right.â€
�
He also appeared to take a thinly veiled swipe at Bush and Clinton , pointing out that he is in a position to deal with the situation directly in the US Senate .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to be careful about doing it , because unlike some of the other people opining on it weâ€ ™ re actually in a position to propose something that could pass .
We want it to be the right thing , â€ � Rubio said .
Rubio also took a different position than Bush on the issue of statehood â€ “ Bush has been a longtime backer of statehood for Puerto Rico and called on Congress during an April visit to the island to hold an up - or - down vote on the issue .
Rubio said on Wednesday that he supported that clear vote on statehood â€ “ not by the US Congress , but the people of Puerto Rico .
Echoing comments he made on the subject last year
, Rubio suggested a two - option ballot that would give Congress â€œa clear indication of what they want their future to beâ€ � , citing a 2012 vote in which Puerto Ricans technically voted in favor of statehood but were given three choices on in a ballot process that ultimately did not yield clarity .
â€œI think we need an up - or - down referendum in Puerto Rico that clearly signals what it is they want to be , and once we get that then that I think is when Congress can begin to get involved in the process , â€ � Rubio said in Iowa .
â€œUltimately , at this point obviously itâ€ ™ s not something thatâ€ ™ s going to happen in the near term given the financial strife theyâ€ ™ re facing.â€ �"
2015-07-09,"Who is Alan Grayson ?
Alan Grayson is an outspokenly progressive Democratic member of the House of Representatives from Florida who is responsible for 90 % of all scowly leftist congressional zingers posted in your Facebook feed now that Barney Frank has retired .
He is running for the Florida Senate seat that Marco Rubio will vacate in 2016 because he really wants to become president .
Why on earth should I care ?
Because you all smugly mock Florida , then retire here anyway .
( Try Arizona . )
Also , Democrats are desperately trying retake the Senate in 2016 , and Rubio just abandoned a Senate seat that the Republican party could have held for a generation .
Isnâ€ ™ t a Democrat already running for Senate in Florida ?
Weird how you knew that already ,
but yes !
Patrick Murphy , who is best known for defeating Commie Nazi hunter and Iraqi torturer Alan West , has already been endorsed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and many Florida officials .
But heâ€ ™ s also a former Republican who became a Democrat in 2012 and voted for the Keystone XL pipeline and to weaken Dodd - Frank financial reforms .
Isnâ€ ™ t a centrist Democrat better in a purple state like Florida ?
Florida Democratic officials think so .
In 2010 , their gubernatorial candidate was former bank executive Alex Sink , who ran as a centrist and used the word â€œliberalâ€
� the way vampires use suntan lotion .
She lost .
In 2014 , she spent a ton of money to lose a special congressional election to newcomer David Jolly .
Also the Democratsâ€ ™ 2014 gubernatorial candidate was a former Republican who lost to Lord Voldemort .
Running to the center can backfire when you donâ€ ™ t sound like an alternative .
So Grayson would be better ?
Heâ€ ™ s a persuasive speaker , an effective congressman and endlessly quotable , but ,
for every â€œRepublicansâ€ ™ health care plan is â€˜die quicklyâ€ ™ â€ � line , thereâ€ ™ s him calling a lobbyist a â€œwhoreâ€ � .
He called a newspaper editor a â€œshitting robotâ€ � for questioning why he had millions stored in offshore accounts .
He has a personal fortune and can raise a ton from devoted fans nationwide , but those people donâ€ ™ t vote in Florida .
He lost the 2010 election by 18 % in part because of the Tea Party wave , but also because Grayson was easy to lampoon to locals as â€œAlan Grayson , D - MSNBCâ€ � and was a really easy conservative fundraising target .
Also his annulment was really quite gross .
What should I root for here ?
Grayson is a lot like Donald Trump in that he channels the
i d of his partyâ€ ™ s wing and , to their utter terror
, can flip off party leadership because he doesnâ€ ™ t need their money .
But , like Trump , he has a tendency to get high on his own supply and say silly things .
Grayson can win the race ( Florida Democrats outnumber Republicans by almost 500,000 and turn out in presidential - year elections ) , but if nothing else maybe Florida Democratic officials will consider him scarier than Republicans and decide they should sound like progressives for once instead ."
2015-07-10,"Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s historic policy shift toward Cuba would be short - lived under a Marco Rubio presidency , the Florida senator has told the Guardian , one week after the White House made the final major step in renewing diplomatic ties with the Castro regime .
Rubio , a top contender for the Republican nomination for president , said he would â€œabsolutelyâ€
� reverse the unilateral steps Obama has taken thus far to normalize relations between the two countries â€ “ including closing down the embassies that are slated to open on 20 July â€
“ if he is elected to the White House in 2016 .
â€œIn fact , I think theyâ€ ™ re in violation of the law , â€ �
Rubio said during an interview at the tail end of a three - day campaign swing through Iowa .
â€œThe statute passed by Congress specifically prohibits many of the things he [ Obama]â€ ™ s now undertaking .
It says those things can only happen after certain conditions have been met , none of which have been met .
As president , I will follow the law.â€ � Rubio , the son of Cuban immigrants , has been the leading opponent in the US Congress of Obamaâ€ ™ s overtures to the island nation .
Ever since the president announced in December that the US would end a half - century diplomatic freeze with Cuba , Rubio has publicly castigated the administration at every turn
â€ “ be it the lifting of certain commercial and travel sanctions , the removal of Cuba from a list of state sponsors of terrorism , and Obamaâ€ ™ s announcement last week on the reopening of embassies between Washington and Havana .
In addition to saying he would reverse those steps , Rubio also defended his steadfast opposition to lifting the 50-year - old US trade embargo on Cuba â€ “ which critics argue has taken a significant humanitarian toll on the Cuban people while doing little to deter the grip on power of the Castro brothers .
Opponents of the embargo , Rubio said , â€œfundamentally misunderstandâ€ � its purpose .
â€œThe purpose of the embargo was not to overthrow Fidel Castro â€ “
thatâ€
™ s what the Bay of Pigs was about ,
thatâ€ ™ s what Operation Mongoose was about , but not the embargo
, â€ � Rubio said , referring to the failed missions under President John F Kennedy in the early 1960s to help the Cuban people overthrow the communist regime .
The intent of the sanctions , Rubio argued , was to protect the property of Americans and other private owners and prevent stolen goods from being trafficked into the United States as well as to serve as leverage against the Castros .
â€œWe could have used , and can use , economic sanctions through the embargo as a leverage to gain democratic concessions and openings for the Cuban people in exchange for alleviating some of these conditions , especially the diplomatic recognition and the removal of Cuba from the state sponsor of terrorism list , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œThe Cubans have basically achieved all of those concessions and in return have done nothing to change â€ ¦ The only thing that will change is the amount of money the regime will have access to.â€ � Jeb Bush , regarded as one of Rubioâ€ ™ s main rivals in a crowded pathway to the Republican nomination for president , has similarly opposed the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s Cuba policy but offered a less definitive response when asked if he would allow a US embassy in Havana to remain open .
â€œProbably not , â€ � Bush , a former governor of Florida , told the editorial board of the New Hampshire Union Leader newspaper this week .
â€œI
havenâ€
™ t given thought about undoing a work in progress.â€ �
Rubio has pledged to oppose whoever Obama nominates as ambassador to Cuba â€ “ a post that must be confirmed by the US Senate , where he sits on the influential foreign relations committee .
Republican lawmakers in Washington have also refused to take up Obamaâ€ ™ s request to lift the trade embargo , which requires an act of Congress .
Rubioâ€ ™ s unwavering position on US policy toward Cuba is a point of contrast in a presidential campaign built on the notion that he is a next - generation leader with fresh ideas to usher in what he has dubbed â€œa new American centuryâ€ � .
In seven stops this week through different parts of the early battleground state of Iowa , the earliest - voting state in the primaries , the 44-year - old senator sought to convince voters that he is the candidate of the future while declaring that â€œyesterday is overâ€ �
â€ “ an implicit dig both Bush and at Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton .
But those in favor of rapprochement in US - Cuba relations see the 50-year policy upheld until Obamaâ€ ™ s reversal late last year as decidedly antiquated , and at odds with recent decades of bipartisan support for liberalizing international trade with the express purpose of expanding political and economic opportunity around the world .
Rubio himself referred to two such examples â€ “ China and Vietnam â€ “ in a Wednesday op - ed in the New York Times , but to make a counterpoint : that despite the opening up of economic pathways , both China and Vietnam remain notorious violators of basic human rights .
Asked if he believed the US should then no longer engage in trade with China or Vietnam , Rubio conceded there was a â€œgeopolitical realityâ€ � that set the two apart from Cuba â€ “ especially with respect to China .
â€œItâ€ ™ s the second largest economy in the world , it has nuclear weapons , itâ€ ™ s the second largest military or the third largest on the planet , â€ � he said .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a reality there that doesnâ€ ™ t exist with Cuba that we have to address .
It just is what it is â€ “
we have to balance geopolitical reality.â€ �
Rubio added that concessions to China had nonetheless forced the US to go silent on human rights abuses there , and his broader point was that China , Vietnam and Burma disproved the argument that economic engagement will pave the way for a political transformation .
â€œIt is proof that economic engagement alone does not lead a reluctant tyranny to open up democratically , â€ � Rubio said , before identifying the biggest difference , in his view , in the analogy .
â€œChinaâ€ ™ s half a world away
, Vietnam is half a world away
â€
“ Cuba is 90 miles from our shores .
It is not in the national security interest of the United States to have a communist , anti - American tyranny 90 miles from our shores.â€ �
He said prerequisites necessary for him to consider engagement with Cuba would be free and fair elections , independence of the media , the right to organize political parties , freedom of assembly , and the release of political prisoners .
Rubio further referenced reports of a crackdown last weekend in which nearly a hundred peaceful activists were detained by Cuban authorities , and prominent activist Antonio G Rodiles was beaten , to underscore his point that engagement at this juncture was futile .
The reports of the arrests were confirmed by the State Department earlier this week .
A spokesman expressed concern , but argued that such behavior further reinforced â€œthe need to move forwardâ€ � with restoring diplomatic relations .
Obama acknowledged in his own remarks last week that â€œvery serious differencesâ€ � will continue between the two countries on freedom of speech and assembly , and access to information , while proposing engagement as the means through which change can occur .
â€œNobody expects Cuba to be transformed overnight , â€ � Obama said in his speech on the reopening of embassies .
â€œBut I believe that American engagement through our embassy , our businesses and most of all through our people , is our best way to advance our interests and support for democracy and human rights.â€ �
Although the president did not mention Rubio by name , he criticized Republicans who have rejected his approach .
Obama cited public opinion in both the US and Cuba showing a majority support for re - establishing ties , and urged Republicans to â€œlisten to the Cuban people , the American peopleâ€ � .
Asked for his response to polling putting the public at odds with his view â€ “ which includes a majority of Americans , as well as Cuban Americans , and residents of Cuba â€ “ Rubio was unfazed .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t ever believe a president should conduct foreign policy on the basis of polls , â€ � he said .
â€œA
presidentâ€ ™ s supposed to lead .
A presidentâ€ ™ s supposed to do whatâ€ ™ s right for the country even if it isnâ€
™ t popular , particularly when it comes to national security issues .
A president needs to view things with a 20- , a 10- and a 5-year outlook , not whatâ€ ™ s immediately gratifying .
One of the biggest failures of this administration is that itâ€ ™ s tried to use foreign policy for domestic political considerations.â€ �
Rubio added that the opinion of Americans would shift if they were more informed on the implications of opening up ties with Cuba , which he said would be an â€œeconomic opening to the Cuban regime [ that ] controls the entire economyâ€ � .
Although Rubio did not raise in detail his stance on Cuba while courting several packed rooms across Iowa this week , he drew heavily on his personal story , as he has since declaring his candidacy for the White House .
He recounted how his parents left Cuba in 1956 in search of a better future .
Their realization of the American Dream â€ “ Rubioâ€ ™ s father worked as a bartender and his mother a maid â€ “ is what set the United States apart from the place his parents once called home he said .
The senator launched his presidential campaign in April from the Freedom Tower in Miami , Florida , which served for more than a decade starting in the early 1960s as the first stop for Cuban exiles seeking asylum in the United States .
Cuban Americans living in Florida who are registered Republicans continue to overwhelmingly oppose Obamaâ€ ™ s new Cuba policy .
â€œThat combination has been steadfastly anti - Castro and pro - embargo , â€ � said Dr. Gregory Weeks , an expert on Latin America who heads the political science department at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte .
â€œThis is how Cuban - American Republicans have been for many , many years and something that is very only slowly changing .
Thatâ€ ™ s how [ Rubio has ] developed politically .
He also sees that as part of a package that includes relations with Iran , Russia and dealing with Isis , indicative of what he believes is a broader weakness of Obamaâ€ ™ s foreign policy.â€ �
But unravelling the steps the administration has already taken would be politically risky , according to Richard Feinberg , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and an architect of the first Summit of the Americas .
â€œLatin America as a whole would be outraged .
It would be incredibly costly for Rubioâ€ ™ s US policies throughout the region , â€ � Feinberg said .
â€œTwo years from now itâ€ ™ s going to be difficult for any Republican to completely reverse the initiative of this administration.â€

2015-07-10,"Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio on Friday framed the debate over abortion as a â€œdefinitional issueâ€ � of what kind of society Americans want to live in .
Rubio , a Florida senator and early frontrunner for his partyâ€ ™ s nomination in 2016 , has built his presidential campaign on an optimistic message that uses his own story to celebrate the American Dream .
He drew upon the same themes on Friday , in an impassioned speech at the National Right to Life Convention in New Orleans , Louisiana .
â€œConnected to the issue of the innate value of every human life is the question of how we help everyone achieve their God - given potential in 21st century America , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œIt is fundamentally impossible for America to reach her destiny as a nation founded on the equal rights of all if our government believes an entire segment of the human population doesnâ€ ™ t have a right to exist.â€ �
As has been his staple on the campaign trail , Rubio invoked his familyâ€ ™ s story â€ “ parents who came from Cuba to the United States in 1956 â€ “ but this time to paint a contrast between abortion procedures and allowing unborn children to reach their full potential .
â€œThatâ€
™ s why the issue of life is more than political or policy - related .
It is a definitional issue about the kind of country we want to be , â€ � Rubio said , while vowing to advocate the pro - life cause if elected president .
He also dubbed Roe v Wade , the US supreme courtâ€ ™ s landmark ruling in 1973 legalizing abortion and forbidding states from banning the procedure until viability â€ “ generally accepted to be at around 24 weeks â€ “ as â€œa historically , egregiously flawed decisionâ€ � that â€œhas condoned the taking of innocent life on a massive scaleâ€ � .
The speech contained Rubioâ€ ™ s most in - depth remarks on abortion since he declared his candidacy in April .
While he has touted his pro - life record at several conservative gatherings , Rubio has not delved into the subject at length â€ “ sometimes , if at all â€ “ while cross - crossing early voting states and fundraisers .
But his address on Friday offered a glimpse of how he would articulate his position on what has been a thorny issue for Republicans in previous elections : tying his pro - life stance into his campaignâ€ ™ s central message of economic opportunity and prosperity .
Whereas some Republican contenders have employed aggressive rhetoric to counter attacks by Democrats that they are
â€œanti - womenâ€ �
â€ “ Kentucky senator Rand Paul infamously said Democrats want to â€œkill a 7 lb baby in the wombâ€ � â€ “ Rubio took a more nuanced approach .
â€œYou can judge a cause by the arguments made on both sides .
For example , I rarely meet anyone whoâ€ ™ s willing to say theyâ€ ™ re pro - abortion , â€ �
he said .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ ll say theyâ€ ™ re pro - choice , but almost everyone Iâ€ ™ ve met says that they personally disagree with abortion .
That alone tells us a little about the basic common sense the issue is built on.â€ � Pro - choice advocates and Democratic allies , including Hillary Clinton , have already come out swinging against Republicans for pushing legislation that would outlaw abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy .
Rubio is a co - sponsor of a 20-week abortion ban introduced last month in the Senate , which opponents said has a too - narrow rape exception and defies medical research on when fetuses can feel pain .
A spokesman for Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign did not return a request for comment when asked by the Guardian what abortion exceptions , and under what conditions , the senator supports .
Rubio has in the past supported exceptions for victims of rape and incest , and to save a motherâ€ ™ s life , but also sponsored bills that do not include the same protections .
Democrats are confident they can resurrect the so - called â€œwar on womenâ€ � narrative that has in the past damaged the Republican partyâ€ ™ s image among single women in particular â€ “ helping produce a record gender gap in the 2012 presidential election , when single women overwhelmingly cast their ballots for Barack Obama .
Emilyâ€ ™ s
List , a group that helps elect pro - choice Democratic women to public office , responded to Rubioâ€ ™ s speech by criticizing him as someone who â€œclearly has no understanding of the challenges women and families face in their daily lives and is more concerned about imposing his own extreme , ideological agenda over millions of Americansâ€ � .
â€œMarco Rubio comments today show exactly the type of backward world he wants to live in , â€ �
Rachel Thomas , a spokeswoman for the group , said in a statement to the Guardian .
Thomas said that world was one â€œwhere politicians dictate what personal healthcare decisions a woman can and canâ€ ™ t make , where women are publicly shamed for putting their babies up for adoption , and where employers can decide what birth control a woman is allowed to useâ€ � ."
2015-07-10,"Six Republican candidates touted their anti - abortion credentials on Friday at the National Right to Life Convention in New Orleans .
Marco Rubio , Rick Santorum , Rick Perry and Ben Carson all appeared on stage in front of numerous American flags and a sign that said â€œWe are a voice for the voicelessâ€ � , while Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz sent video messages to the gathering .
In recent weeks , Republicans have been pushing legislation that would ban women from having abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy , but candidates at the convention focused less on legislation and instead touted their deep opposition to abortion and their anger with the supreme court .
â€œWe have reached a point in America where the will of the people is subjugated to an oligarchy of nine lawyers and that is no longer a democracy , â€ � said former senator Rick Santorum .
â€œAnd we have an obligation to fight and we have to have people leading our country who are willing to engage in that battle.â€ �
Santorum announced in May that he would make his second bid for president and said that he has been targeted because of his beliefs .
â€œBut you know that the area that is the hardest to fight on , the one where you pay the biggest price , is on the moral and cultural issues â€ “ and none bigger than life , â€ � he said .
He drew a clear line between the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade supreme court decision that said women have the right to seek an abortion and last monthâ€ ™ s historic ruling Obergefell v Hodges , which made same - sex marriage legal across the United States .
â€œWhen
did it become the law of the land that the supreme court has the final say on anything?â€ �
Santorum said .
â€œThe American people have the final say on everything .
Thatâ€ ™ s the country I live in â€
“ is that the country you live in?â€ �
While Santorum boosted himself as the strongest â€œpro - lifeâ€ � candidate in the field , his friend Texas governor Rick Perry spent most of his 20-minute speech discussing his childhood and the importance of Christianity in his life .
He spoke comparatively little about abortion , though he has created a situation where only nine abortion clinics are open in Texas , the second most populous state .
â€œOur most basic right that we have emanates from our creator and it is that unalienable right to life , â€ � Perry said .
He too insisted on reforming the supreme court , saying that the next president could have the opportunity to pick three supreme court justices .
There is already a 5 to 4 conservative majority in the court and three of the justices are going to be more than 80 years old for the 2016 election , provoking speculation that the next president could have the opportunity to fill their seats if they retire .
â€œWe need to make sure that we come together , that we take aim , that our candidate to be nominee , not only will win , but understands how to pick credentialed conservatives for the United States supreme court because we are probably going to put three on there , â€ � Perry said .
Florida senator Marco Rubio , a co - sponsor of the 20-week abortion ban , spoke more generally about the supreme court .
He said Roe v Wade was â€œa historically , egregiously flawed decisionâ€ � that â€œhas condoned the taking of innocent life on a massive scaleâ€ � .
He said : â€œIt is fundamentally impossible for America to reach her destiny as a nation founded on the equal rights of all if our government believes an entire segment of the human population doesnâ€ ™ t have a right to exist.â€ �
Ben Carson , a retired pediatric neurosurgeon , was the only of the four candidates to not condemn the supreme court in his speech and instead warned about â€œbaby killersâ€ � and other perceived health threats .
â€œThe baby killers , thatâ€ ™ s what they do
, they manipulate you into thinking this is not a human being
and they capitalize on peopleâ€
™ s
lack of knowledge and understanding , â€ � Carson said .
Carson implied that liberal policies could lead to euthanasia and rationed healthcare .
â€œIt is the natural consequences of the kind of thinking that has become pervasive in our society , â€ � he said .
Two Republican presidential hopefuls sent videos to the convention .
Florida governor Jeb Bushâ€ ™ s video was less than three minutes long and focused on what he did in Florida to restrict abortion .
â€œWhen
we devalue life , whether itâ€ ™ s at the beginning of life or at the end , we devalue our society , we devalue our culture , â€ �
Bush said in his campaign - style video .
Texas senator Ted Cruz provided a six - minute address where he spoke extensively about how conservative Texas politicians defeated state senator Wendy Davis , who filibustered for 11 hours to stall a bill that would close nearly every abortion clinic in the state .
â€œOur founders had the foreknowledge to protect life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness , in that order , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œWithout life , there is no liberty , Without life , there is no pursuit of happiness .
Abortion is a stain on our nationâ€ ™ s history.â€ �"
2015-07-12,"Marco Rubio was working the crowd , shaking hands , engaging in small talk and snapping selfies with eager fans .
A few feet away , an elderly couple who had come to see the Republican presidential candidate on a balmy Thursday morning were discussing a speech Rubio gave moments earlier .
â€œI liked him before , but now I really like him ,
â€ � the woman said to her husband .
â€œI have just one regret , â€ � he responded .
â€œI
didnâ€
™ t bring a tape recorder .
I wish I could play that speech over again.â€ �
The exchange was emblematic of the effect Rubio , a 44-year - old senator from Florida who is regarded as the most skilled orator in a crowded Republican field , can have on an audience .
Roughly 150 people had crammed into a room on the second floor of a county Republican office to hear Rubio speak on the last day of a three - day swing through Iowa , the state that will hold the first nominating contest in the presidential primary next February .
In less than 48 hours , he had made seven stops through the east of the state , to make a pitch that combined domestic and foreign policy while drawing heavily on his personal story .
Rubio rarely mentioned Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton by name , nor did he attack his Republican opponents .
The main reason Barack Obama won re - election in 2012 , he noted to each crowd , was because Republicans spent all of their time attacking each other â€ “ creating four more years of what Rubio argued had brought the country to a crossroads .
â€œThis is the most important election our nation has had in a generation , â€ � Rubio said , before asking crowded rooms to consider the kind of society they wished to live in .
He then recounted how his parents emigrated to the US from Cuba in 1956 , to both paint a contrast with the oppression of those in less fortunate and free countries and emphasize the essence of the American Dream .
Rubioâ€ ™ s father worked as a bartender in banquet halls , his mother as a hotel maid and stocking shelves at the discount department store Kmart .
â€œThey were never rich or famous , but they were successful , â€ �
he said .
â€œAnd they were able to retire with dignity and security.â€ �
Their sacrifices , Rubio told his audience , were what enabled him to stand before them , running for the nationâ€ ™ s highest office .
Itâ€ ™ s a compelling biography that has played an instrumental role in Rubioâ€ ™ s meteoric rise in politics , from state legislator in Florida to House speaker and then to the US Senate in what was meant to be a long - shot campaign for federal office , in 2010 .
And now , it may contain the extra mile he needs to stand out among as many as 16 Republican presidential hopefuls .
Throughout his tour of Iowa â€ “ at events ranging from a keynote country club luncheon to a casual poolside happy hour
â€
“ Rubio weaved his family background into an optimistic message on restoring economic opportunity and prosperity .
â€œQuite frankly , Iâ€ ™ m
the only one running up to now that is running on this message that the future is now .
It is here .
And we can not be left behind by it
, â€ � he said .
Rubioâ€ ™ s prescriptions included solutions to reduce the national debt , train people for high - skilled jobs and transform higher education .
He called for lowering the corporate tax rate to 25 % from 35 % and cutting back on regulations he said stifled innovation .
While speaking to older crowds , Rubio candidly discussed proposed reforms to entitlement programs such as Medicare and social security â€ “ in part to stress to elder voters that he was not out to get them .
The press releases that will go out , he said , might read : â€œRubio wants to take away Medicare and social security.â€ �
He added quickly : â€œThatâ€ ™ s not true.â€ � Here , too , Rubio got personal , invoking his 85-year - old mother .
â€œI would never be for anything thatâ€ ™ s bad for her , â€ � he said .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t want it to change at all for her , and it doesnâ€ ™ t have to.â€ �
Any changes , such as raising the retirement age , would apply to people like him and those younger , Rubio assured them .
Although Rubio was well received , Iowans have more than six months to choose their nominee and many acknowledged they were still shopping around .
It doesnâ€ ™ t help that they are inundated by Republican candidates seeking their votes and grassroots support , and Rubio â€ “ having spent the last few months focused on fundraising â€ “ is still building a presence .
To Rubioâ€ ™ s benefit , Republican voters almost always like what they see : a youthful and charismatic senator who many believe holds the key to bridging the gap among key demographics â€ “ particularly Latinos â€ “ that have eluded the party in recent elections .
Many also took away from Rubioâ€ ™ s humble beginnings a candidate who understands everyday struggles , another area where Republicans have struggled to connect .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s the only one whoâ€ ™ s really relatable to people of a working class , â€ � Colleen Alexander , a 38-year - old pharmacy cashier from Waverly , Iowa , said after listening to Rubio at a summer cookout on the front end of his trip .
â€œYou have to be able to live different experiences to understand them , and heâ€
™ s been through some of the experiences that the rest of us have.â€ �
Alexander said she worked two jobs and would like to go back to school , but had not found it to be possible given her financial situation .
â€œYou should be able to work a 40-hour week and still pay your bills .
You shouldnâ€ ™ t have to be working 80-hour weeks and still living paycheck to paycheck , â€ �
she said , adding that Rubio â€œreally seems to understand those issuesâ€ � .
Mel Mcmains , a retired financial executive from Muscatine , also saw an earnestness in Rubio .
â€œHe is speaking from the heart .
Heâ€ ™ s one of the real people ,
â€ � he said .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s had the struggles of paying off college loans , wasnâ€ ™ t born with a silver spoon in his mouth .
Heâ€ ™ s a self - made man â€ “
thatâ€ ™ s
impressive.â€
�
Mcmains was nonetheless undecided .
Rubio is on his shortlist , but the 72-year - old said experience could be an issue and lead him to select Scott Walker , the Wisconsin governor who will formally announce his candidacy on Monday , or even Rick Perry , the former Texas governor who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2012 .
â€œI personally favor the governorâ€ ™ s experience as opposed to the senatorâ€ ™ s experience , having a senator for president now , â€ � he said .
Senator - turned - president Obama is a comparison Rubio is used to , but with which he wholeheartedly disagrees .
That was on full display when an elder voter made the analogy directly to him at a breakfast event where Rubio fielded some questions from the audience .
â€œYou are an extremely articulate , energetic , bright , young first - term senator .
That reminds me of somebody eight years ago , â€ � the man said , drawing knowing laughter from the crowd .
â€œI think
thereâ€
™ s some significant differences between me and the current occupant of the White House ,
â€ � Rubio said , before laying out those differences .
Obama , he said , was a â€œbackbencherâ€ � while serving in the Illinois state legislature , while Rubio was speaker of the Florida House .
â€œI led that institution both legislatively and administratively .
I ran it ,
â€ � he said .
When Obama ran for president in 2008 , he had only served in the Senate for a few years â€ “ Rubio pointed out he will be closing out a full term there when the election rolls around next year .
â€œThis president has not been a failure because he was a senator , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œThis president has been a failure because he has failed on the key questions of presidential leadership â€ ¦
I donâ€
™ t care if heâ€ ™ d served 50 years in government , his ideas still wouldnâ€ ™ t work.â€ � Barb Gill , a 45-year - old insurance agent from Urbandale , took Rubioâ€ ™ s side .
His freshness , she said , should be welcomed by Republicans as they seek to overcome the perception that their party is only old and getting older .
â€œI like the fact that heâ€ ™ s younger
, â€ �
Gill said .
â€œWe as a party have to bring young people in , or weâ€ ™ re going to lose forever .
It canâ€
™ t just be the party of old white men.â€ �"
2015-07-17,"Donald Trump , billionaire businessman turned presidential hopeful , is ahead in the polls in one category â€ “ the number of memes and cartoons
heâ€
™ s starred in .
The New Yorkerâ€ ™ s upcoming 27 July cover is a good example .
It features Trump belly - flopping into a pool while his fellow Republican presidential candidates Rand Paul , Jeb Bush , Marco Rubio and Chris Christie , run for cover in panic and dismay .
Twitter users have been just as creative .
Trump has filed for corporate bankruptcy four times over the years , in 1991 , 1992 , 2004 , and most recently in 2009 .
On 19 June he defended himself on Twitter : â€œStop saying I went bankrupt .
I never went bankrupt but like many great business people have used the laws to corporate advantageâ€”smart!â€
�
Nevertheless , some spoilsports continue to hold it against him .
Trump has been clear that he is a supporter of â€œtraditional marriageâ€ � between a man and a woman .
Others have had the audacity to use his own catchphrase on The Apprentice against him , after various organizations severed their business ties with him after his comments about Mexican immigrants .
Trump said the Mexican government sent â€œrapistsâ€ � and criminals to the US .
â€œMexico is not our friend .
Theyâ€ ™ re killing us at the border and theyâ€ ™ re killing us on jobs and trade .
FIGHT!â€ �
he said on Twitter .
But one tweeter noticed something interesting about his Macyâ€ ™ s clothing line .
Americans have also been fascinated by Trumpâ€ ™ s hair .
And cat - owning tweeters took things one stage further , using the excess hair from combing their cats and sculpting it into mini toupees .
And as Nasa revealed new photos of Pluto this week , speculation began as to whether Trump could expand his empire to the far reaches of the universe ."
2015-07-29,"Hillary Clinton will call for an end to the US embargo on Cuba during a rare foreign - policy speech for the Democratic presidential frontrunner , in a signal that the former secretary of state is willing to challenge her chief Republican rivals in the arena in which they have sought confrontation the most .
Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign announced that she will make her case for Congress to restore commercial dealings with Cuba during an address on Friday at Florida International University in Miami , the home turf of Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush , who both staunchly oppose any thaw in relations with Havana .
â€œShe will highlight that Republican arguments against increased engagement are part of failed policies of the past and contend that we must look to the future in order to advance a core set of values and interests to engage with Cubans and address human rights abuses , â€ � Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign said in a statement on Wednesday .
The Republican - led Congress is overwhelmingly opposed to ending the Cuba embargo , despite Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s historic shift in policy toward the island nation in December .
The Obama administration has since eased certain restrictions on Cuba , removed it from the list of state sponsors of terrorism , and reopened embassies in Washington and Havana .
Clinton has supported the presidentâ€ ™ s overtures toward Cuba , and was reportedly one of the chief architects in a long - running , behind - the - scenes effort to renew ties with the Cuban government while running his administrationâ€ ™ s State Department .
Clinton acknowledged in her 2014 book Hard Choices that she advised the president to reconsider the diplomatic freeze .
â€œNear the end of my tenure
, I recommended to President Obama that he take another look at our embargo , â€ � Clinton wrote in the book , which encompassed her tenure in the Obama administration .
â€œIt wasnâ€ ™ t achieving its goals , and it was holding back our broader agenda across Latin America.â€ �
This week at Florida International University , Clinton will more publicly declare her support for ending the 50-year embargo in her first visit as a presidential candidate to the key battleground state of Florida .
The remarks will represent a shift from a carefully orchestrated policy rollout , which has thus far been decidedly focused on domestic policy and the economy .
Bush and Rubio , both Republican candidates for president hailing from Florida , from have been vocal in their opposition to ushering in a new chapter in US - Cuba relations .
Rubio , a senator who is the son of Cuban immigrants , has been especially adamant that the United States should not deal in any way with the Castro regime until human rights abuses and democratic reforms are addressed .
The senator even launched his presidential campaign from Miamiâ€ ™ s Freedom Tower , which served as the first stop for Cuban exiles seeking asylum in the United States for more than a decade starting in the early 1960s .
In an interview with the Guardian earlier this month , Rubio said he would â€œabsolutelyâ€ � reinstate sanctions on Cuba if elected president and reverse other changes in Obamaâ€ ™ s policy toward the island â€ “ such as the embassy exchange and terror list removal .
Rubio happens to teach political science classes at the university from which Clinton will deliver her speech .
Responding to her new stand on the Cuban embargo , Rubio said Clinton was making a â€œgrave mistakeâ€ � .
â€œAfter
Secretary Clintonâ€ ™ s failed â€˜resetâ€ ™ with Putin , now she wants to do a â€˜resetâ€ ™ with Castro .
She is making another grave mistake , â€ �
Rubio said in a statement .
â€œUnilateral concessions to the Castros will only strengthen a brutal , anti - American regime 90 miles from our shore .
â€œPresident Obama and Secretary Clinton must learn that appeasement only emboldens dictators and repressive governments , and weakens Americaâ€ ™ s global standing in the 21st century , â€ � Rubio added .
â€œAs president , I will stand with the Cuban people and only support an end to the embargo that is accompanied by real democratic reform.â€
�
Bush , the former governor of Florida , has also accused the Obama administration of making concessions to the Castro regime with little promise of democracy or freedom for the people of Cuba .
A spokeswoman for Bushâ€ ™ s campaign said Clintonâ€ ™ s announcement amounted to â€œanother example of â€ ¦ putting political expediency ahead of doing whatâ€ ™ s rightâ€ � .
â€œHillary Clinton and President Obama claim that our Cuba policy is a relic of history , but itâ€ ™ s the Castro regime that is stuck in the cold war ,
â€ �
Bushâ€ ™ s spokeswoman , Emily Benavides , said in a statement .
â€œAs
Governor Bush said last week , â€˜The Cuban people are not imprisoned by the past , they are imprisoned by the Castro regime.â€ ™ â€ �
Although polling shows that the majority of Americans , as well as Cuban Americans , support lifting the embargo , a similar shift has not been observed among Cuban Americans in Florida who are registered Republicans and of an older age bracket .
That demographic remains steadfast in its opposition to the restoration of ties , but surveys have also found the dynamics to be changing â€ “ particularly among younger voters .
A poll of Cuban Americans in South Florida , conducted by professors at FIU , Clintonâ€ ™ s chosen venue on Friday , found that a slight majority now opposes the embargo .
The overwhelming majority of younger Cuban Americans â€ “ 90 % â€ “ support re - establishing diplomatic ties ."
2015-08-01,"The competition among Republican presidential candidates for the support of the political and fundraising network of Charles and David Koch will heat up this weekend .
Five Republican candidates will attend a retreat held by Freedom Partners , a key cog in the political network of the Koch brothers .
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush , Texas senator Ted Cruz , former CEO Carly Fiorina , Florida senator Marco Rubio and Wisconsin governor Scott Walker will all attend a gathering of well - heeled GOP donors at a luxury resort in Orange County , California .
Kentucky senator Rand Paul was invited but declined to attend , citing previous commitments to campaign in Iowa .
The event is designed to boost those who the Koch brothers consider to be in â€œa top tier of candidatesâ€ � who , in the words of one person familiar with the efforts of the Koch network , â€œare most likely to elevate a serious debate on the principles of freedomâ€ � .
All five candidates will participate in a moderated policy discussion with Politico reporter Mike Allen and will be able to mix and mingle with the approximately 450 high - powered donors expected to attend .
However , the current frontrunner will not be in that top tier of GOP candidates .
Donald Trump is not considered among the candidates who are most capable of elevating that debate and Politico has reported that the Koch network is â€œfreezing him outâ€ � .
Trumpâ€ ™ s
signature policy , his hostility to immigration from Mexico and Latin America , runs counter to the Kochsâ€ ™ support for immigration reform and efforts to sell Hispanic Americans on conservative ideas .
The Koch network has long funded the Libre Initiative , a group dedicated to â€œadvanc[ing ] the principles and values of economic freedom to empower the US Hispanic communityâ€ � .
The Trump campaign declined to comment .
Even if Trump were welcome at the event , it would counteract the increasingly populist message of the bellicose billionaire .
The former reality television star has flaunted his wealth to demonstrate his independence from special interests in politics .
At a campaign event in Iowa earlier in July , Trump said of Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush : â€œThose people are controlled by whoever gave them their money , and I will tell you they are totally controlled.â€ �
He boasted of buying influence with politicians himself in the past :
â€œI give to everybody and they do whatever I say.â€
�
Trump hasnâ€ ™ t quite gone as far as to criticize the Koch network by name .
His only mention so far came in a tweet on Wednesday :
â€œI really like the Koch Brothers ( members of my P.B. Club ) , but I donâ€ ™ t want their money or anything else from them .
Can not influence Trump!â€
�
The real estate mogul isnâ€ ™ t being singled out , though .
A number of other candidates have also not been invited , including Ohio governor John Kasich , whose support for expanding Medicaid in the Buckeye State has made him anathema to many in the Koch network .
Like Trump , not only will Kasich not be attending this weekendâ€ ™ s event in California , but he will be absent from another Koch - affiliated event in Ohioâ€ ™ s state capital of Columbus in September .
The Ohio governor reportedly alienated attendees at the Koch - affiliated conference in 2014 by giving a fiery defense of his decision to expand Medicaid .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t know about you , lady ,
â€ �
Kasich told one prominent Republican donor .
â€œBut when I get to the pearly gates , Iâ€ ™ m going to have an answer for what Iâ€ ™ ve done for the poor.â€ �
According to Politico , roughly 20 attendees walked out of the room in protest at the Ohio governorâ€ ™ s answer .
The event , which lasts through the weekend , will be the last significant milestone on the Republican primary calendar before the first debate , sponsored by Fox News , is held in Cleveland on 6 August ."
2015-08-07,"Marco Rubio walked into the first Republican presidential debate on Thursday night as a decided underdog .
But the youthful Florida senator emerged â€ “ almost by way of non - engagement on a stage of bombastic personalities â€ “ making significant gains on the pathway toward his partyâ€ ™ s nomination .
If Rubio can survive the Donald Trump war of attrition , political watchers agreed , he is primed for the long battle ahead .
Not long into the debate , conservatives quickly began fantasizing over a hypothetical matchup between the 44-year - old senator and Hillary Clinton .
But Democrats believe the Florida senator handed them a gift when he strongly asserted that he had never advocated for exceptions to abortions in cases of rapes and incest .
The moment came when moderator Megyn Kelly questioned Rubioâ€ ™ s prior support for including rape and incest protections in anti - abortion laws , as part of a string of questions on womenâ€ ™ s rights that forced several candidates to play into an issue Democrats see as a stronghold .
â€œI have never advocated that , â€ � Rubio responded , adding that â€œfuture generations will call us barbarians for murdering millions of babies when we never gave them a chance to live.â€ � Rubio has , in fact , supported legislation including rape or incest exceptions , and he has also backed measures without them .
He has also said in the past that he would sign a bill with exceptions as president if thatâ€ ™ s the only option .
Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign sought to clarify after the debate that the senator has indeed signed on to legislation with exceptions but not actively advocated for them .
Rubioâ€ ™ s forceful rebuke of exceptions could nonetheless have lingering consequences if he is the nominee .
Democrats are eager to engage with Republicans on womenâ€ ™ s reproductive rights , an issue that has frequently dogged the GOP in recent elections .
Rubio was nonetheless defiant when given an opportunity to clarify his stance on Friday , choosing to double down on his position against rape or incest exceptions while arguing that life begins at conception .
The senator acknowledged that he had backed a bill including exceptions , but added that â€œevery single pro - life senator , every single pro - life group â€ “ including the Catholic pro - life groups â€ “ supported the billâ€ � .
Rubio said he was willing to sign on to bills both with and without exceptions , because his broader goal was to prevent abortions so there were no prerequisites required , in his view , for his support .
â€œI am here to try to save as many of
those unborn childrenâ€ ™ s lives as possible , â€ � Rubio said .
Pressed further on why he was comfortable removing protections for women who had conceived through rape or incest , Rubio said such instances were â€œhorrifying , â€ � but â€œextremely rareâ€
� .
â€œI personally and honestly and deeply believe that all human life is worthy of protection irrespective of the circumstances in which that human life was created , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œI personally believe that you do not correct one tragedy with a second tragedy â€ “
thatâ€ ™ s how I personally feel ,
very strongly about.â€ � â€œIf I have to weigh the two equities here , Iâ€ ™ m always going to err on the side of life , â€ � he added .
â€œI think thatâ€ ™ s a timeless principle.â€
�
While the American electorate is broadly split between being pro - choice and pro - life , polling has shown that exceptions for rape , incest or to save a motherâ€ ™ s life is supported by at least three - quarters of the American public .
A spokesperson for Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign quickly pounced on Rubioâ€ ™ s comments , tweeting that the senator was â€œLosing the general to win the primaryâ€ � â€ “ reflecting the confidence among Democrats that they are on the winning side of the debate over reproductive rights .
The Democratic National Committee also hit Rubio hard following his appearance on CNN .
â€œHey Marco Rubio , the women of the 21st century can hear you , â€ �
Christina Freundlich , a spokeswoman for the group , said in a statement .
â€œWhen you donâ€ ™ t account for rape or incest , the only thing we see
is a candidate with outdated , out of step , and offensive policies of the past .
Get with the times or go home.â€
�
The debate was a critical test for Rubio , who in recent weeks took a dramatic dip in the polls despite launching his run for the White House in April with soaring expectations .
A slew of press reports even questioned if Rubioâ€ ™ s â€œObama - esqueâ€ � appeal was sustainable , predicting an early demise for the candidate who has long been regarded as a rising star within the Republican party .
Outside of the abortion issue , the senator seized on most of his allotted time in Cleveland â€ “ just the seventh most out of 10 candidates on stage â€ “ by articulating his prescriptions for economic , immigration and education policy , while presenting himself with a general - election aura that was capable of confronting the formidable Clinton operation .
Ohio governor John Kasich , well received on his home turf , was arguably the only other fluid candidate of the Republican lot who made the most of a chance to elevate his national profile .
Cutting through the noise was no easy task with Trump , the real - estate mogul and early frontrunner , taking his controversial presence from the stump to the stage â€ “ pressing hard on contentious issues such as immigration reform while refusing from the outset of the debate to rule out a potentially destructive run as an independent candidate .
While some opponents sparred unabashedly with Trump â€ “ Kentucky senator Rand Paul , whose campaign has been floundering , took on the self - proclaimed billionaire early and often â€ “ Rubioâ€ ™ s approach appeared to be one of near - avoidance .
When presented with a direct opportunity to respond to Trump on immigration , shortly after the former reality - TV star talked up the need to build â€œa big , beautiful doorâ€
� , Rubio declined to address his opponent directly and stuck instead to his own proposals for the Mexican border .
â€œI also think we need a fence , but if El Chapo can build a tunnel under that fence , we need to deal with that , â€ � Rubio said , referencing the escaped cartel kingpin Joaquin â€œEl Chapoâ€ � Guzman .
â€œLet me tell you who never get talked about in these debates : the people who call my office , waiting 15 years to come to the United States .
Theyâ€ ™ ve paid their fees , hired a lawyer and theyâ€ ™ re wondering if they should come in illegally.â€
�
The only time on Thursday when the first - term senator addressed Trump directly was to refute the mogulâ€ ™
s claim that he had donated to most of the Republicans sharing the stage .
â€œNot me , not me !
Actually to be clear , he supported Charlie Crist ,
â€ � Rubio quipped , referring to the establishment - backed primary opponent he defeated in his long - shot bid for the Florida senate seat he now holds .
â€œI think he was the winner of the second debate , â€ � said Liz Mair , a Republican operative who has advised four of the Republican candidates , including Paul and Wisconsin governor Scott Walker , but not Rubio .
â€œThroughout , he came off as very polished , policy savvy , smart , positive , and perhaps above all , he looked the part â€ “
and I wasnâ€ ™ t expecting that .
â€œThere was a risk he could have come off as the little kid trying to play with bigger kids , and not keeping up .
But he did a very good job .
Based solely on tonightâ€ ™ s performance , I could imagine him taking on Clinton in a debate and winning.â€ � Rubio previewed at least some of what a debate with the former secretary of state might look like , if he makes his way through the gauntlet of nearly a dozen Republican debates and the primary season of 2016 .
â€œIf Iâ€ ™ m our nominee , how is Hillary Clinton going to lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck ?
I was raised paycheck to paycheck , â€ � said Rubio , invoking his personal biography as the son of a bartender and a maid .
â€œHow is she going to lecture me about student loans ?
I owed over $ 100,000 just four years ago , â€ � he said ."
2015-08-07,"Republican presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Carly Fiorina took the momentum each earned in Thursdayâ€ ™ s nightâ€ ™
s debates and carried it on to an Atlanta stage at RedState Gathering , a conference of conservative activists , on Friday .
Fiorina and Rubio came to the event directly from Cleveland , where they had debated the previous night .
Fiorina , a former CEO of Hewlett - Packard , appeared in the early - evening debate for second tier candidates while Rubio was on stage for the main event held in primetime .
Although both candidates were enthusiastically received by the crowd in a darkened hotel ballroom in Atlanta , Fiorina did show some indications about why she had been relegated to the second tier so far .
With a gaggle of reporters afterwards , the former Hewlett Packard CEO became testy when she was asked how she could criticize Donald Trump for talking a phone call from Bill Clinton before running when she had appeared as recently as last year at the Clinton Global Initiative .
Fiorina was visibly annoyed at the question , firing back : â€œSo you really donâ€
™ t understand the difference between getting a personal phone call from Bill Clinton and showing up at a conference where the Clintons have for years invited a bipartisan group of guests?â€ �
It was a show of irritation that the normally composed and on - message Fiorina had rarely displayed on the campaign trail so far .
She also had to backtrack , both to reporters and via an announcement after her appearance , for misunderstanding a question .
Fiorina said that she had thought that a question about the US Chamber of Commerce , the powerful pro - business lobby , was actually about the US Department of Commerce .
Yet these were relatively minor hiccups for Fiorina , who came on to the stage at RedState with all the swagger one would expect from someone introduced as the winner of her debate .
â€œI think we kind of rumbled last night , what do you think?â€
�
she asked the crowd .
She then went on to hammer home her message attacking
â€œprogressivismâ€ � and Hillary Clinton
â€ “ and got big applause for calling the Democratic frontrunner a liar .
â€œShe did lie about Benghazi .
She did lie about her emails .
She did lie about her servers , â€ � said the Republican candidate , referring to two well - publicized controversies over Clinton .
Rubio was more understated , spending more energy trying to emphasize his credentials as a social conservative .
He compared the zeal of Democrats to use federal money to fund the reproductive health organization Planned Parenthood to the idea of Republicans trying to divert government funds to the NRA .
The Florida senator also emphasized the importance of family .
While he rehashed his familiar story of being the son of an immigrant bartender , he noted that he did â€œcome from privilegeâ€ � .
After all , he said , he was raised in a two - parent , stable household .
The Florida senator also tried to woo the crowd with some corny jokes .
After reading a question in Spanish , he translated it as : â€œIt means I know how to save you a bunch of money on your car insurance by switching to Geicoâ€ � to the mostly older and white crowd .
The only time he visibly struggled was when he got a softball question about hip - hop , a genre of music of which Rubio is one of the most prominent fans in American politics .
Rubio said he was excited to see the upcoming NWA biopic Straight Outta Compton and had heard the new Eminem album was supposed to be â€œpretty goodâ€ � but seemed ill at ease and eventually asked for the â€œnext questionâ€
� .
The crowd was enthused about both candidates .
Debbie Georgatos , a talk show host from Dallas , said : â€œI thought Marco Rubio was fabulous , â€ � and Fiorina â€œinformed , impassioned and couldnâ€ ™ t be better preparedâ€ � .
Andrew Carlton of Atlanta was far more impressed by Rubioâ€ ™ s performance at the conference than that on the debate stage .
The Florida senator â€œseemed very down to Earth and spoke intelligentlyâ€ � , he said .
But Fiorina had made an even bigger impact in his opinion during her debate .
â€œIf sheâ€ ™ s at the next top tier debate , thereâ€ ™ s a big problem.â€ �"
2015-08-09,"Marco Rubio has defended his record as an opponent of abortion , against criticism arising from his statement during the first Republican presidential debate on Thursday that he had never advocated for exceptions of any kind , even if a womanâ€ ™ s life was in danger or when she had been raped .
â€œI personally and deeply believe that all human life is worthy of the protection of our laws
, â€ � the Florida senator said , in an interview broadcast on NBC on Sunday .
â€œI believe that irrespective of the conditions in which that life was conceived or anything else.â€ �
On Thursday , Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly questioned Rubioâ€ ™ s prior support for including rape and incest protections in anti - abortion laws .
â€œI have never advocated that , â€ � Rubio said , onstage in Cleveland , adding that â€œfuture generations will call us barbarians for murdering millions of babies when we never gave them a chance to liveâ€ � .
In fact , Rubio supported such exceptions when he co - sponsored the Pain - Capable Unborn Child Protection Act in 2013 , which aimed to ban abortions after 20 weeks .
On Sunday , asked by NBCâ€ ™ s Chuck Todd about the contradiction between his current statements and his Senate record , he said : â€œIâ€ ™ ll support any legislation that reduces the number of abortions and there are those that have that exception in them .
What Iâ€ ™ ve never done is say that I require that it must have exceptions.â€ �
He added : â€œI recognize that in order to have consensus on laws that limit the number of abortions a lot of people want to see those exceptions and thatâ€ ™ s why Iâ€ ™ ve supported those laws in the past , as has every pro - life group in America .
â€œThatâ€
™ s why the issue is so hard .
There is no doubt that a woman has a right to her own body , to make decisions about her own health and her future .
Thereâ€ ™ s no doubt .
And then thereâ€
™ s
this other right , and thatâ€ ™ s the right of a human being to live .
And these rights come into conflict so you have to make a decision and itâ€
™ s hard .
I donâ€
™ t say
itâ€ ™ s
easy.â€ �
Rubioâ€ ™ s debate remark came amid efforts by Republicans in Congress to defund Planned Parenthood , with some advocating a government shutdown .
The womenâ€ ™ s health organization has been the subject of a number of videos released by a pro - life group , which purport to show staff members negotiating the sale of fetal tissue .
Planned Parenthood has said its staff acted legally at all times .
Democrats have seized on the issue and others â€ “ including former Florida governor Jeb Bush appearing to question all federal spending on womenâ€ ™ s health and Donald Trump seeming to imply Kelly questioned him unfairly in Cleveland because she was menstruating â€ “ to suggest the Republican party is engaged in a â€œwar on womenâ€ � .
Women make up 53 % of the electorate and have leaned Democratic in every general election since 1992 , when Bill Clinton unseated Republican incumbent George HW Bush .
On Sunday , Rubio sought to stress his understanding of the issue .
â€œA rape is an act of violence , â€ � he said ,
â€œitâ€ ™ s a horrifying thing that happens , and fortunately the number of abortions in this country that happen due to rape are very small .
Less than 1 % of the cases
but they happen and theyâ€ ™ re horrifying and a tragedy
and I recognize that .
â€œI also recognize that because of the existence of over - the - counter morning - after pills , not to mention medical treatment thatâ€ ™ s now available immediately after the assault , we can bring that number down to zero.â€ �
He also said : â€œI donâ€ ™ t say itâ€ ™ s easy .
But when asked to make a decision between two very hard circumstances , I personally reached the decision , if Iâ€ ™ m going to err , Iâ€ ™ m going to err on the side of life.â€ �"
2015-08-10,"Hillary Clinton has seized on Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s â€œoffensiveâ€ � and â€œoutrageousâ€ � comments about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly to condemn the broader field of male Republican candidates for president , casting herself as the enforcer of womenâ€ ™ s rights on the campaign trail .
The Democratic frontrunner lambasted the real - estate mogul turned GOP frontrunner as â€œall entertainmentâ€ � on Monday , saying that his apparent reference to difficult debate questions from Kelly stemmed from her menstruation deserved attention and that â€œthe Republican party is going to have to deal with himâ€ � .
But Clinton quickly turned to a broadside against â€œradical and offensive positionsâ€ � on womenâ€ ™ s reproductive rights from establishment Republicans considered more likely to contest her in the general election , directly calling out Florida senator Marco Rubio for â€œoffensiveâ€ � and â€œtroublingâ€ � comments on abortion .
â€œWhat a lot of the men on that stage said in that debate was offensive , â€ � Clinton told reporters in New Hampshire after a town hall event introducing her plan to make higher education more affordable .
â€œI donâ€
™ t want people to be confused here about the outrageous comments by one , and just say weâ€ ™ re focused on this , and let the fact that there should be no exceptions for rape or incest go unnoticed or unmentioned .
Iâ€ ™ m not going to let that happen.â€

During Thursdayâ€ ™ s first Republican debate , Rubio said he has never advocated for abortions in the case of rape and incest â€ “ even though he has â€ “ and insisted â€œfuture generations will call us barbarians for murdering millions of babies when we never gave them a chance to liveâ€ � .
Clinton , offering her first detailed response to the debate , called out Rubio specifically as Republicans fend off the possibility of a renewed â€œwar on womenâ€ � narrative that has haunted the party in the past .
â€œWhat Marco Rubio said has as much of an impact on where the Republican party is today as anybody on that stage , and it is deeply troubling , â€ � Clinton said on Monday .
â€œThat is as offensive and as troubling a comment as you can hear from a major candidate running for the presidency.â€ �
Rubio quickly fired back : â€œHillary Clinton holds radical views on abortion that we look forward to exposing in the months to come , â€ � the senator said in a statement .
Governor Scott Walker , who recently signed a restrictive 20-week abortion ban in Wisconsin , also opposes abortion without exceptions and has said voters agree , though polls tell a different story .
Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee has said he would recognize the fetus as a person from the moment of conception , and called for endowing fetuses with constitutional rights .
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush , seeking to reclaim frontrunner status from Trump , also stumbled on womenâ€ ™ s rights last week , questioning whether the federal government was overfunding womenâ€ ™ s health services .
He quickly backtracked , saying he misspoke while agreeing that the health provider Planned Parenthood should be defunded .
â€œThe Republicans are putting forth some very radical and offensive positions when it comes to womenâ€ ™ s lives , womenâ€ ™ s reproductive health , womenâ€ ™ s employment , â€ � Clinton said on Monday .
Since last weekâ€ ™ s presidential debate , when Kelly pressed Trump on his history of sexist comments , he attacked the Fox News star for what he said was a hostile and unfair line of questioning .
The following day , he implied on CNN that Kelly had been aggressive because she was hormonal .
Trump has since denied that he was insinuating she was menstruating during the debate .
Even as the billionaire remained unapologetic â€ “ â€œShe should really be apologizing to me , â€ � he told MSNBC on Monday â€ “ Clinton joined a chorus of critics from within his own party .
At one point , she laughed him off as â€œhaving the time of his life , being up on that stage , saying whatever he wants to sayâ€ � .
â€œI thought what he said was offensive , and I certainly think it deserves the kind of reaction that itâ€ ™ s getting from so many others
, â€ � Clinton said of the remarks about Kelly , before turning to a wider condemnation of her Republican rivals .
â€œBut I think if weâ€ ™ re focusing on that weâ€ ™ re making a mistake.â€ �
During her Fox show on Monday night , Kelly said she had â€œdecided not to respondâ€ � to Trumpâ€ ™ s comments directed at her .
â€œI certainly
wonâ€
™ t apologize for doing good journalism ,
â€ � she said .
At the debate , Kelly also questioned Trump about the tens of thousands of dollars he has donated to the Clinton Foundation .
Trump told Kelly he donated the money so that she would attend his wedding .
Clinton scoffed at the idea on Monday , saying she attended the wedding because she â€œhappened to be in Florida and thought it would be entertainingâ€ � .
Kentucky senator Rand Paul stepped up his criticism of Trump on Monday as well , telling reporters it was time â€œsomebody stands up and really call nonsense nonsenseâ€ � .
â€œIf no one stands up to a bully , a bully will keep doing what theyâ€ ™ re doing , â€ � Paul said .
â€œUnless someone points out the emperor has no clothes , heâ€ ™ ll continue to strut about.â€ � Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Clintonâ€ ™ s remarks .
But he tweeted on Monday that he had been assured by the Fox News chairman , Roger Ailes , that he would be â€œtreated fairlyâ€ � by the station .
Trump appeared on several Sunday morning TV news shows , but not on Foxâ€ ™ s main show .
He now is scheduled to appear Tuesday morning on Fox and Friends .
In a statement on Monday evening Ailes described a conversation between them as â€œblunt but cordialâ€ � and said the air had been cleared .
â€œDonald Trump and I spoke today .
We discussed our concerns , and I again expressed my confidence in Megyn Kelly , â€ � Ailes said , describing Kelly as â€œa brilliant
journalistâ€ � whom he supports â€œ100%â€
� .
Ailes added that he assured Trump â€œthat we will continue to cover this campaign with fairness and balanceâ€ � .

2015-08-11,"Hillary Clinton has made her first direct dig into Scott Walker , the hardline conservative favourite for president who is now fading in Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s shadow , as the Democratic frontrunner continued to condemn Republicans on the campaign trail .
The Wisconsin governor â€œseems to be delighting in slashing the investment in higher education in his stateâ€ �
, Clinton said during a town hall - style event in the early voting state of New Hampshire on Tuesday .
Clinton , while trotting out her plan on college affordability , has been robust in her attacks on Republican candidates of late â€ “ speaking out against gaffes on womenâ€ ™ s reproductive rights from Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio .
But she saved a special salvo for Walker for failing to support student loan refinancing options â€ “ just as the rightwing stalwart showed signs of weakness in the first formal polls since the first Republican debate last week .
Trump , the real - estate mogul whose unexpected and unpredictable campaign has stolen thunder from establishment Republicans like Bush and Walker , was expected to suffer among likely voters as a result of his attacks on Fox News host Megyn Kelly .
But two surveys released on Tuesday showed Walker down instead : Rasmussen Reports still has Trump as the frontrunner with 26 % support among 651 voters polled nationwide , compared to Walker , who has stumbled 5 percentage points to 9 % .
A Suffolk University poll of voters in the first state to vote , Iowa , shows Trump in the lead , though with fewer voters supporting him .
Still , he remains well ahead of Walker , who slipped in the state to 10 % support .
Clinton also accused the governor of â€œrejecting legislationâ€ � that would help Wisconsin students repay their loans .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know why he wants to raise taxes on students , but thatâ€ ™ s the result , â€ �
she told the crowd at River Valley Community College in Claremont .
Earlier this year , Walker proposed a budget cut of $ 300 m to the University of Wisconsin system , which led to outrage from educators and students alike .
On Wednesday , the governor accused Clinton of â€œoffering the same bait and switch as President Obama , making promises to students while delivering higher tuition costs and tax increasesâ€ � .
â€œAs governor , I froze college tuition at Wisconsin colleges four years in a row ,
â€ �
he said in a statement .
â€œAmericans need a leader who delivers results not empty promises.â€ �
After last weekâ€ ™ s debate , Walker seemed already to be looking past the crowded Republican primary and ahead to a general - election face - off with Clinton , insisting he would not â€œtrash - talkâ€ � his party rivals but â€œfocus on what we have to offer , why weâ€ ™ re the best candidate to take on the real opponent â€ “ which is Hillary Clintonâ€ � .
Clinton had previously lumped together Walker and Bush as part of a â€œfull - on assault on womenâ€ ™ s healthâ€ � , but this week she has been targeting individual Republican contenders for their anti - abortion remarks while looking at the wider field .
On Tuesday morning , Walker called Clintonâ€ ™ s earlier attacks on the GOP â€œanother example of how sheâ€ ™ d further divide this nationâ€ � .
Hours later , Clinton continued to take aim at the Republican presidential candidates , joking with the crowd that she â€œadmiresâ€
� whoever among them watched the debates last week .
â€œThere was not one word from one of those candidates about making college more affordable or dealing with debt , â€ � Clinton said .
She chided :
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know who theyâ€ ™ re talking to out on the campaign trail
â€ “
well , I kind of do.â€
�
The line was met with scattered laughs to an audience of supporters .
Clinton has said repeatedly that college affordability and student loan debt is one of the issues voters raise with her on the campaign trail .
The former secretary of state is on a two - day swing through New Hampshire to roll out her new plan to ensure students can attend American colleges and universities without having to take out a loan .
The plan also includes more refinancing options for Americans who are already saddled with student loan debt .
Her proposal led to a Twitter spat between her campaign and that of Bush , with Clintonâ€ ™ s team giving the former Florida governor a grade of â€œFâ€ � on college debt forgiveness .
Bushâ€ ™ s team got in on the action as well .
The Clinton campaign sees Walker and other candidates who have not made college affordability a priority as ripe for attack on the issue .
Walkerâ€ ™ s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment ."
2015-08-12,"Donald Trump has been the center of attention since the first Republican presidential debate last week .
But perhaps the most significant policy moment in the debates came when two other GOP frontrunners , Florida senator Marco Rubio and Wisconsin governor Scott Walker , announced their opposition to abortion without any exceptions .
During the Cleveland debate , moderator Megyn Kelly asked Rubio to clarify whether he supports exceptions on abortion , including for rape or incest .
â€œI have never said that .
And I have never advocated that , â€ � the Florida senator responded .
He reiterated his opposition to abortion exceptions over the weekend .
Not to be outdone , Walker declared in the debate that he , too , does not support any exceptions to abortion .
â€œWould you really let a mother die , rather than have an abortion?â€ �
Kelly asked .
Walked responded that
heâ€
™ s
â€œalways been pro - lifeâ€ � and has â€œsaid many a time that that unborn child can be protected , and there are many other alternatives that can also protect the life of that motherâ€ � .
( When a Republican congressman made a similar claim in 2012 , the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists put out a statement that â€œabortions are necessary in a number of circumstances to save the life of a woman or to preserve her healthâ€ � . )
For decades , Republicans have been the pro - life party on abortion .
But for the partyâ€ ™ s presidential nominee , that pro - life position has included exceptions .
What makes these statements from Rubio and Walker notable is that , if either man wins the primary , he could be the first Republican presidential nominee in history to openly oppose abortion in all cases .
â€œI am pro - life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape , incest or to save the life of the mother , â€ �
the 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney said in a National Review op - ed .
Same for 2008 nominee John McCain , who said : â€œMy position has always been : exceptions of rape , incest and the life of the mother.â€ �
Likewise with George W Bush , the partyâ€ ™ s nominee in 2000 and 2004 , who declared : â€œMy position has always been three exceptions : rape , incest and the life of the mother.â€ �
The partyâ€ ™ s 20th century nominees all supported abortion exceptions as well .
Even Republican hero Ronald Reagan supported not only allowing abortions when the life of the mother was at stake , but providing federal funding for that as well .
Years earlier , Republicans nominated Barry Goldwater , who was pro - choice , and Dwight Eisenhower , who went on to serve as honorary co - chair of Planned Parenthood after he left the presidency .
Prior to the 1950s , abortion was not widely considered a political issue and few politicians commented on the matter .
This isnâ€ ™ t surprising to Kristin Luker , a professor of law and sociology at the University of California , Berkeley , and author of Abortion and the Politics of Motherhood .
â€œThe Republican party was historically the party of sexual liberals , â€ �
she said .
In the mid-20th century , Luker noted , the partyâ€ ™ s demographic base was â€œwell - educated , affluent
peopleâ€ � who â€œhad a vested interest in access to contraceptionâ€ � .
George HW Bush was such a champion of contraception during his time in Congress that he earned the nickname â€œRubbersâ€ � .
Even Reagan , as governor of California in the 1960s and 70s , signed one of the most liberal abortion laws in the country .
However , that previous support began to erode in the early 1970s .
According to Luker , â€œRichard Nixon â€ “ never one to pass up an opportunity
â€ “ figured that by opposing abortion he could carve off Catholicsâ€ � , who had been a traditional Democratic constituency , for the GOP .
This move was a part of Nixonâ€ ™ s infamous â€œsouthern strategyâ€ � , which not only won him re - election in a landslide , but also set the Republican party on a path of increasingly embracing social conservatism .
It wasnâ€ ™ t until around 1980 , Luker said , that â€œabortion really became a litmus testâ€ � for the GOP .
In part because of civil rights and in part because of abortion , she noted , â€œwell - off intellectuals began migrating to the Democratic partyâ€ � , creating a feedback loop that drove Republicans further to the right on reproductive issues .
So is Walker and Rubioâ€ ™ s
no - exceptions position just a natural result of the GOPâ€
™ s evolution on abortion ?
Not necessarily .
Even former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and Texas senator Ted Cruz , both of whom are playing for the partyâ€ ™ s rightwing voters , have supported an abortion exception for the life of the mother .
Though Walker and Rubio are trying to stand out in a crowded field , especially to religious conservatives in Iowa , opposing all exceptions
doesnâ€
™ t just put them out of step with recent GOP nominees .
It puts them at odds with most Republican voters as well .
A 2014 Quinnipiac poll found that just one in six Republican voters supported banning abortion in all cases , the same proportion of Republicans who believe abortion should be legal in all cases .
According to Morris Fiorina , political science professor at Stanford University and author of Culture War ?
The Myth of a Polarized America , opposing all exceptions to abortion â€œis extreme even by Republican voter standardsâ€ � and â€œonly a small minority would go so far as Walker and Rubioâ€ � .
Opposition to all abortions is an even more unpopular position in the general election .
A new poll this week on behalf of Planned Parenthood found that just 16 % of voters in Ohio , 11 % of voters in Pennsylvania , and 8 % of voters in New Hampshire supported banning all abortions .
If either candidate does succeed in winning the nomination , political director at Naral Pro - Choice America Erika West predicts they will try to walk back their position .
Support for banning all abortions
â€œmakes them completely unelectableâ€ � , West said .
â€œWhen itâ€ ™ s time to run in the general , I am 100 % certain we will hear something different.â€ �
Indeed , both Rubio and Walker have indicated support for some abortion rights in the past .
Walker declared in a 2014 ad that he is â€œpro - lifeâ€ � but supports legislation that â€œleaves a final decision to a woman and her doctorâ€ � .
Rubio , meanwhile , co - sponsored a 2013 anti - abortion measure that included exceptions for rape , incest and the life of the mother .
If either candidate succeeds in becoming the first GOP nominee to oppose abortion in all cases , it will represent a significant rightward shift for the party , and one that Democrats will surely try to use to their advantage next fall ."
2015-08-19,"If 2012 was the year of Republican men saying stupid things â€ “ from â€œlegitimate rapeâ€ � to pregnancy from rape being something â€œGod
intendedâ€ � â€ “ this must be the year of Republican men simply being stupid .
Thereâ€ ™ s no other way to account for the complete meltdown that the partyâ€ ™ s presidential hopefuls are having over abortion , racing to the right in a short - sighted effort to win the nomination while leaving themselves high and dry for the general election .
Marco Rubio , who supported a bill in 2013 that included exceptions for rape and incest , flat - out denied as much during the Republican debate earlier this month , saying , â€œI have never advocated that.â€
�
Later , when caught in his lie , Rubio said he only supported the bill because â€œit prevents abortionsâ€ � and doubled down on his extreme position : â€œWhile I think [ pregnancy from rape and incest ] are horrifying ...
I personally believe you do not correct one tragedy with a second tragedy.â€ �
When Ben Carson was asked if he supported rape and incest exceptions , Slate writer Amanda Marcotte pointed out that he claimed exceptions arenâ€ ™ t really necessary because women can just stop the pregnancy before it starts : â€œI would hope that they would very quickly avail themselves of [ an ] emergency room , and in the emergency room , they have the ability to administer , you know , RU-486 , other possibilities , before you have a developing fetus.â€
�
Leaving aside the fact that not all rape victims are able to get to an emergency room
â€ “ especially if the rapist is a family member â€ “ RU-486 is not the morning - after pill ; itâ€ ™ s an abortion - inducing pill you take to end an established pregnancy .
Perhaps a doctor should know this ?
Scott Walker says that women donâ€ ™ t really ever need abortions to save their lives , and Mike Huckabee â€ “ the gift who keeps on gaffing â€ “ is out there actually arguing that 10-year - old rape victims should be forced to give birth .
Have you ever met a 10-year - old girl , Mr Huckabee ?
As I find myself ( almost ) speechless in response to all of these men , I think Sen. Elizabeth Warren said it best : â€œDid you fall down , hit your head and think you woke up in the 1950s or the 1890s ?
Should we call for a doctor?â€ �
Republicans vying for their partyâ€ ™ s endorsement seem to forget that womenâ€ ™ s votes exist .
And that while this anti - choice posturing may be beneficial in the primaries , they are handing Hillary Clinton â€ “ or whoever the Democratic nominee may be â€ “ a mighty large sword to wield against them in the general election .
Jess McIntosh , vice president of communications at EMILYâ€ ™ s List , told me , â€œTheyâ€ ™ re so extreme it almost forecloses the possibility of a campaign .
No persuadable voters want to hear about your plan to force raped children to give birth .
It sounds as monstrous as it is.â€ � â€œAnd
how do you argue about parental consent , when if you had your way the wishes of the parents would be meaningless?â€ �
she continued , â€œsince every accidental teen and pre - teen pregnancy would be forced to result in birth?â€
�
The GOP contenders are ignoring the fact that one in three American women will have an abortion and that 95 % of them will not regret it .
Do they think those women will be voting for the candidate who would try to have that decision taken away ?
Itâ€ ™ s
well - established that extreme positions against abortion simply donâ€ ™ t fly with American voters .
Measures to give zygotes personhood rights have failed again and again , the majority of Americans donâ€ ™ t want to see Roe v Wade overturned , and most people believe in abortion exceptions .
Jocelyn Kiley , associate director at the Pew Research Center , told me that about 75 % of Americans believe abortions should be possible in the case of rape .
â€œFor and health and life exceptions , â€ � she says , â€œthereâ€ ™ s a broad majority of more than 80%.â€ �"
2015-08-20,"It may be Donald Trump who has raised this presidential campaign to new levels of frivolity , but in a poll that is arguably frivolous by nature one â€œcandidateâ€ � has managed to go viral â€ “ and it turns out heâ€ ™ s a 15-year - old from Iowa .
Unlike his competitors in the race to be president in 2016
â€ “ people like Marco Rubio , Hillary Clinton , or Trump â€
“ Deez Nuts has no public profile .
He will likely never appear in any televised debates ; he has never held public office .
Wednesday was a big day for Deez Nuts .
First he won 9 % of the vote as an independent in a Public Policy Polling poll of voters in North Carolina â€ “ which , on top of recent results of 8 % in Minnesota and 7 % in Iowa from previous polls , makes him what experts confirmed is the most successful independent candidate for president in two decades .
It was also the day of his high school sophomore orientation .
The candidate is in reality 15-year - old Brady Olson , a high school student from Wallingford , Iowa .
â€œMy name is not Deez Nuts , â€ �
he said in an email interview .
â€œI am a 15-year - old who filled out a form , had the campaign catch on fire , and am now putting up the best third - party numbers since Ross Perot.â€ �
The Guardian has also seen Olsonâ€ ™ s passport , spoken to him on the phone and confirmed his identity with his parents .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve told my family and some of my friends from school , â€ � he said .
â€œThey still think itâ€ ™ s hilarious.â€ �
There are 585 registered candidates for president in 2016 , including Sydneys Voluptuous Buttocks ( independent ) , President Emperor Caesar ( Democrat ) , Buddy The Cat ( Democrat ) , Crawfish Crawfish ( other ) , Bailey D Dog ( independent ) , Buddy The Elf ( write - in ) and Lindsey Graham ( Republican ) , none of whom â€ “ unlike Deez Nuts â€
“ received any support whatsoever in PPPâ€ ™ s North Carolina poll .
The poll stood out even in a campaign season that has seen frivolity reach new heights .
And PPP is known for occasionally frivolous polling , with questions on whether hipsters should be subject to a special tax or the approval rating of God â€ “
but the group said it would continue to include Nuts in future polling .
And while Trump was the headline figure â€ “ at 24 % in the Republican primary race , double digits clear of his next rival , Ben Carson , at 14 % â€ “ Nutsâ€ ™
s showing as an independent was the real surprise .
Asked the question â€œIf the candidates for President next year were Democrat Hillary Clinton , Republican Donald Trump , and independent Deez Nuts , who would you vote for?â€ � respondents in North Carolina voted Trump 40 % , Clinton 38 % , and Nuts 9 % .
He has been endorsed by the punk / hardcore band of the same name , according to his campaignâ€ ™ s Facebook page .
And Darrell West , vice - president and director of governance at the Brookings Institution , confirmed that with these numbers , Deez Nuts is indeed at the crest of the most successful independent campaign since Perot in 1996 .
It was with â€œa mix of astonishment and happinessâ€ � that Olson saw his poll results come in on Wednesday , he said .
â€œI never thought it would go this far and now it has .
â€œItâ€
™ s amazing how this campaign caught on .
Right now itâ€ ™ s mainly just the name recognition , but hopefully as we go down the stretch people will actually take the time to look at my campaign website and look at my platform.â€ �
Jim Williams , a polling analyst at PPP , who conducted the North Carolina poll , said that he thought the success of Deez Nuts represented a hunger for voters looking for an alternative to the two main parties .
â€œYou could call [ the third party candidate ] anything , â€ � he said , â€œand they would get their 7 % or 8%.â€ �
He said that PPP had included Nuts in their polling questions at first â€œfor our own amusement and interestâ€ � .
Deez Nutsâ€ ™ s platform is fairly serious .
In his manifesto he expresses support for the work John Kerry and the state department have done with the Iran nuclear deal .
â€œEveryone wants a better deal , but thatâ€ ™ s the whole point of negotiating .
Look at your wants , then their wants , and meet in the middle.â€ �
He is no fan of Fox News :
And a Deez Nuts White House , according to his manifesto , would also halve congressional salaries until the federal budget is balanced , and cut subsidies to oil companies in favour of tax incentives on renewable energy sources .
Asked whether his candidacy was a political statement or a joke that had snowballed , Olson said it was â€œa little bit of both ,
I guessâ€ � .
He said he watched the 2012 election closely and he was a supporter of Libertarian party and their presidential candidate , Gary Johnson , and said the libertarians were â€œrobbedâ€ � in the gubernatorial race in 2014 .
â€œThen I saw the slop bucket that we call the GOP field , the one - woman show on the Democratic side , and the lack of any third party candidate and thought â€˜Man , Deez Nuts would be better than any of these guys , â€ ™ â€ � Olson continued .
â€œSo after that I just ran with it.â€ �
Contacted by the Guardian , a spokesperson for the Federal Election Commission said that officials did not actively check the age or identity of the candidates who registered to run for president , adding that it was all done â€œat state levelâ€ � .
Olson , for his part , said he had been â€œshocked by the responses at first , but then remembered this is American media and they find everythingâ€ � .
â€œItâ€
™ s been really fun so far , â€ � he added .
â€œI
just hope that we can actually do something memorable in 2016 that we all could remember forever.â€

2015-09-02,"As Barack Obama wraps up a three - day visit to Alaska centered on the urgency of tackling climate change , Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio on Wednesday previewed what energy policy would look like under his administration .
Rubio vowed to reverse key components of the climate agenda Obama has been touting in Alaska , while also making the case for turning back some of the nationâ€ ™ s energy authority to the states and away from the federal government .
While outlining his proposals during a swing through Oklahoma â€ “ currently the fourth - largest producer of natural gas in the United States â€ “
the Florida senator decried in particular the Environmental Protection Agencyâ€ ™ s new rules to reduce greenhouse emissions under its Clean Power Plan .
The rules would have â€œa devastating impact on affordable energy in exchange for little to no environmental benefitâ€ � , Rubio said , while pledging to immediately stop them in their tracks .
â€œIt would truly be one of the most expensive and costly regulations ever created .
Yet Hillary Clinton has pledged to make defending and expanding it a â€˜top priorityâ€ ™ ,â€ �
Rubio said in remarks before the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association in Oklahoma City .
â€œAs president , I will immediately stop this massive regulation .
Iâ€ ™ ll pursue a sweeping overhaul of the regulatory system to make sure costs and benefits of new rules are accurately accounted for and that localities , states and industries can meet the timelines I set forward.â€ �
Another key component of Rubioâ€ ™ s plan would be to lift the nationâ€ ™ s ban on crude oil exports , which has been in place for four decades .
Rubio said lifting the ban would both boost job creation and bolster national security interests by â€œreducing the leverage of oil - rich anti - American governmentsâ€ � .
â€œThis ban is a perfect example of just how outdated Washington has become , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œLifting the crude - oil export ban will be an immediate boon to our economy.â€ �
As domestic oil production has dramatically risen in the United States , the oil industry has been urging the White House to reverse the ban on crude oil exports .
A study commissioned by the Obama administration and released on Tuesday added further momentum to the industryâ€ ™ s cause by concluding that lifting the ban would not increase US gas prices , but may even help to lower them , putting at ease at least some of the concerns previously expressed by those who had been re luctant to support changing the current policy .
The White House has remained mum on its own thinking , as calls have steadily grown among congressional Republicans and a handful of Democrats to allow crude oil exports .
In addition to Rubio , Republican presidential candidates such as Jeb Bush and Scott Walker have also backed lifting the ban .
Charles Ebinger , a senior fellow in the Energy Security and Climate Initiative at the Brookings Institution , told the Guardian that lifting the ban â€œmakes a lot of senseâ€ � .
â€œI think weâ€ ™ re moving toward bipartisan support on crude oil exports , â€ � Ebinger said .
He added the he was surprised Rubio did not talk much about boosting ethanol use , given Oklahoma is a fairly significant producer of ethanol and that the question of supporting it would be â€œa litmus testâ€ � in the early voting state of Iowa .
While Rubio did not delve into the issue on Wednesday , he noted that he would unveil a more detailed energy plan this fall .
He also used the opportunity to jab his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton .
â€œWhat we hear from Hillary Clinton are more of the same ideas from yesterday â€ “ and thatâ€ ™ s when she speaks up on the issue at all , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œFor the most part , she resorts to empty rhetoric that refuses to chart much of a course in either direction .
This is no way to treat one of the most important issues of our time.â€ � Clinton has backed the proposed EPA rules on coal - fired power plants , but recently declined to take a position on the Keystone XL Pipeline â€ “ a controversial project that is opposed by environmental activists .
Ebinger said he expected the Clean Power Plan to remain a â€œcontentious
issueâ€ � throughout the presidential contest .
â€œYou can read it as a usurpation of statesâ€
™ rights , â€ � Ebinger said .
â€œI personally think the Clean Power Plan is going to have a lot of legal challenges to it , so I would not be personally surprised if it gets overthrown or at least drastically modified by the courts.â€ �"
2015-09-04,"Against the backdrop of a crushing debt crisis , Hillary Clinton and Marco Rubio took their presidential campaigns to Puerto Rico on Friday .
They offered pointedly different views on how to best resolve the financial woes afflicting the US territory .
The two candidates took time away from routine stops in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire to court Puerto Rican voters , who can not vote in the general election but can play a critical role in the primary process by providing delegates to the eventual nominee .
While Clinton held a low - key roundtable to discuss struggles within the islandâ€ ™ s healthcare system , Rubio used his visit to draw a sharp contrast with his Democratic opponent and link her proposed policies to Puerto Ricoâ€ ™ s $ 72bn debt .
Speaking entirely in Spanish at a restaurant in San Juan , Rubio told around 150 people that allowing Puerto Rican municipalities to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection was not the solution to its problems .
The senator announced his position earlier in the day , in an op - ed that placed him at odds with both Clinton and former Florida governor Jeb Bush , one of Rubioâ€ ™ s key rivals in the race for the Republican presidential nomination .
Clinton and Bush have both embraced extending Chapter 9 bankruptcy status , a right reserved under the law for the municipalities of US states , to Puerto Rico and called on the US Congress to move legislation to meet that end .
Clinton stood firmly behind her stance on Friday and , though she did not mention Rubio by name , sharply criticized Republicans in Washington over congressional inaction .
â€œCongress needs to do its part , and that means it should give Puerto Rico the authority to let severely distressed government entities , including public corporations and municipalities , restructure their debt , â€ � Clinton said at her roundtable event .
â€œThere is no alternative because the debt is so large and it is impossible to restructure it without the kind of help you get in bankruptcy .
â€œBut not a single Republican has stepped up in Washington to support the leaders , and theyâ€ ™ re not offering any alternative either.â€ �
Puerto Ricoâ€ ™ s Democratic governor , Alejandro GarcÃ­a Padilla , has repeatedly appealed to lawmakers in Washington to assist with the commonwealthâ€ ™ s financial crisis .
Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign confirmed she would meet Padilla during her visit .
Conservatives have been steadfast in their opposition to enacting bankruptcy legislation , arguing that it would amount to a bailout .
Influential donors , including the billionaire Koch brothers , have also lobbied against granting Chapter 9 status to Puerto Rican municipalities .
Speaking hours before Clintonâ€ ™ s event in San Juan
, Rubio insisted the only way forward was for leaders to first bring the islandâ€ ™ s debt , deficit and spending under control , even as reporters pressed him on how that could be achieved without outside help .
â€œI donâ€
™ t believe Chapter 9 would solve Puerto Ricoâ€ ™ s problems , â€ � he said .
â€œI believe what would solve Puerto Ricoâ€ ™ s problems is the same thing that would solve Washingtonâ€ ™ s problems , and that is to restructure the way government spends its money .
â€œNo organisation , whether itâ€ ™ s a government , a company or a family , can survive long - term spending more money than it takes in.â€ �
For Rubio , the trip presented an opportunity to preview what a general election matchup might look like if he and Clinton were to secure the nominations .
As the son of Cuban immigrants , Rubio is fluent in Spanish and regarded by Republicans as one of their best hopes to broaden the partyâ€ ™ s tent .
The senator , who is one of 17 Republican presidential hopefuls , served up jabs at Clinton in both English and Spanish .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t know what Secretary Clintonâ€ ™ s plan is for Puerto Rico is .
I think it was on her server
and it was wiped clean , â€ � Rubio quipped , to a mix of laughter and applause , referring to the controversy over Clintonâ€ ™ s use of a private email server .
Clintonâ€ ™ s own event was markedly different in style and tone .
The former secretary of state held a roundtable with eight officials in a conference room at the Cardiovascular Center of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean , resembling the listening sessions she held in early voting states in the initial stages of her campaign .
An additional 120 seats in the room were reserved for local officials and members of the healthcare industry .
Clinton placed her emphasis on healthcare , telling attendees she wanted to hear about the challenges they face â€ “ particularly with respect to the federal reimbursement rates for entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid , which are lower for healthcare providers in Puerto Rico than in any US state .
Two - thirds of the Puerto Rican population is enrolled in either Medicare or Medicaid .
According to data from the Puerto Rico Healthcare Crisis Coalition , the Medicare reimbursement rate is 40 % lower than in any state , while that for Medicaid is 70 % lower .
Puerto
Ricoâ€ ™ s physicians have been leaving the island in droves .
Rubio pinned Puerto Ricoâ€ ™ s healthcare troubles on
Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s Affordable Care Act , which he has said he would repeal and replace as president .
The senator said his healthcare plan would treat Puerto Rican consumers the same as consumers in US states .
Clinton pledged to do everything in her power , if elected president , to move the island â€œon a path toward equal treatmentâ€ � .
â€œItâ€
™ s just hard to justify how you can be an American citizen in Puerto Rico and be treated differently in so many ways from being an American citizen somewhere else , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œNo one who is fair - minded could listen to this and conclude anything other than , the way Puerto Rico is being treated when it comes to health is inconsistent , it is incoherent , it is inequitable .
â€œIt just shouldnâ€ ™ t continue .
We must do more to deal with what is morally wrong and economically disastrous for the people of Puerto Rico.â€
�
Puerto Ricans have traditionally favoured Democrats , and have grown in their political influence , a situation reflected by the overtures candidates from both parties have made toward the island .
Rubioâ€ ™ s state of Florida , where votes are crucial in both the primary and general contests , is home to the second - largest Puerto Rican population among US states .
During her 2008 presidential bid , Clinton made a number of trips to Puerto Rico , ultimately winning a decisive victory over Barack Obama in the islandâ€ ™ s Democratic primary , taking nearly 68 % of the vote .
With Clintonâ€ ™ s second run for president shaping up to be competitive once more , due to Vermont senator Bernie Sanders , her campaign has said it is taking nothing for granted and looks forward to gaining the islandâ€ ™ s vote ."
2015-09-04,"As Marco Rubio makes his first trip to Puerto Rico as a presidential candidate , the Republican has said he does not support granting Chapter 9 bankruptcy status to the islandâ€ ™ s municipalities as it contends with a burgeoning debt crisis
â€ “ putting him odds with both Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush .
Rubio , a senator from Florida , detailed his proposals for addressing Puerto Ricoâ€ ™ s $ 72bn debt burden â€ “ which , much like the economic agenda he has campaigned on thus far , include cutting spending , reducing the size of government and lowering taxes .
Chapter 9 status , Rubio argued , should be considered a â€œlast
resortâ€ � .
â€œAllowing Puerto Rican municipalities to reorganize their debts under Chapter 9 of the US Bankruptcy Code would not solve Puerto Ricoâ€ ™ s problems and should only be a measure of last resort considered if Puerto Rico takes significant steps to fix its budget and economic mess , â€ � Rubio wrote in a Spanish op - ed published early Friday in El Nuevo Dia ,
Puerto Ricoâ€ ™ s largest daily newspaper , with an English translation posted to Medium .
Rubioâ€ ™ s position stands in contrast with that of Clinton and Bush , both of whom have backed extending bankruptcy protection to Puerto Rican municipalities .
Clinton was also scheduled to visit the US territory on Friday .
Bush , the former Florida governor who is one of Rubioâ€ ™ s key rivals for the Republican presidential nomination , made a trip to Puerto Rico in April where he also advocated in favor of statehood .
On Friday , the Democratic National Committee hit back at Rubio in a statement that likened the senatorâ€ ™ s plan to leaving Puerto Ricans â€œout in the coldâ€ � .
â€œPuerto Rico shouldnâ€ ™ t stand alone on their debt crisis â€ “ but itâ€ ™ s no surprise that Marco Rubio wants to leave one of our nationâ€ ™ s territories out in the cold to fend for themselves , â€ � said Christina Freundlich , a DNC spokeswoman .
â€œRubio should support restructuring Puerto Ricoâ€ ™ s debt in a way that lifts up its people , rather than preaching a failed agenda that will hurt the middle class across the board .
Marco Rubio : out of ideas , out of touch.â€
�
Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla , a Democrat , warned in June that Puerto Rico was inching toward a â€œdeath spiralâ€ � and in need of restructuring .
â€œThe debt is not payable â€ ¦
There is no other option .
This is not politics , this is math , â€ �
Garcia Padilla said , while urging the US Congress to move a bill that would allow access to Chapter 9 status .
Citing the impact of a tropical storm , a working group failed to meet a deadline on Sunday to present its restructuring plan to the governor .
A new fiscal adjustment proposal will be presented to Padilla by 8 September .
Chuck Schumer of New York , the second - ranking Democrat in the Senate , has sought bipartisan support for Chapter 9 legislation .
Rubio was among the Republicans Schumer reached out to , and Fridayâ€ ™ s op - ed reflects the first time the candidate has detailed his position on the issue .
Rubio placed the onus on Puerto Rican leaders to resolve the status quo and laid the blame for their woes on a â€œliberal ideologyâ€ � that he tied to Clinton , who will participate in a health care roundtable in San Juan during her own trip to the island .
â€œLike
their counterparts in Washington ,
Puerto Ricoâ€ ™ s liberal - leaning politicians â€ “ who today are hosting Hillary Clinton in San Juan â€ “ have taxed and spent too much , and lacked the political courage and competence to pull Puerto Rico out of economic despair , â€ �
Rubio wrote .
â€œThe result is todayâ€ ™ s toxic brew of economic stagnation , high taxes and bloated government , which have led to a serious debt crisis and a mass exodus of its people .
More than 3.5 million American citizens live in Puerto Rico today , and they are facing grim economic hardship.â€ �
As president , Rubio said , he would seek to improve the economic conditions of Puerto Rico through tax reform .
He pointed to proposals under the tax plan he introduced earlier this year , such as replacing the Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC )
â€ “ which currently does not apply in Puerto Rico â€ “ with a wage subsidy that would apply to all Americans , including those living on the island , and an expansion of the Child Tax Credit .
Rubio also reiterated his view that the movement for Puerto Rican statehood should be determined by its people in a clear , up - or - down vote , and pledged as president to â€œspeak clearly about the importance of enabling Puerto Ricans to resolve their statusâ€ � .
Citing a 2012 referendum in which Puerto Ricans chose statehood â€ “ but that did yield clarity due to a confusing ballot process with three choices â€ “ Rubio wrote that Puerto Rico â€œdeserves to take the next step , something America has offered to its territories since 1787 when it first opened the door to the creation of new states , even before adopting our Constitutionâ€ � .
â€œPuerto Rico should have a federally sponsored vote on the island with two choices : become a state or not .
If a majority of Puerto Ricans votes yes , Congress and the next president should respect their will and do whatâ€ ™ s necessary to admit them as the 51st state.â€ �
While Puerto Ricans not not eligible to vote in the general election , voters in the island commonwealth can participate in the presidential primaries and help select the eventual nominee in both parties .
Florida , home to both Rubio and Bush , also contains the second largest population of Puerto Ricans among US states and is a key battleground in both the primary and general contests .
Rubio is expected to further discuss his proposals during his one - day swing through Puerto Rico , where he will hold a campaign rally at a restaurant in San Juan .
Clinton , who is set to meet on Friday with officials from Puerto Ricoâ€ ™ s health care industry and patient representatives , said in July that Puerto Rico deserves â€œa fair shot at successâ€ � while discussing its fiscal crisis .
â€œThe challenge is multi - faceted , and will ultimately require Puerto Rico to find a way to pay back its debtors in an orderly fashion , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œAs a first step , Congress should provide Puerto Rico the same authority that states already have to enable severely distressed government entities , including municipalities and public corporations , to restructure their debts under Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code.â€ � Martin Oâ€ ™ Malley , the former governor of Maryland who is challenging Clinton for the Democratic nomination , paid a visit to Puerto Rico last month and also threw his support behind enabling its municipalities to seek protection under US bankruptcy laws .
Opponents of extending Chapter 9 status to Puerto Rican municipalities , including influential Republican donors like the Koch brothers , have argued that such a move is tantamount to a federal bailout .
A number of conservative groups have instead advocated in favor of putting in place a financial control board to externally manage Puerto Ricoâ€ ™ s affairs ."
2015-09-08,"Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s rally against the Iran nuclear deal on Wednesday â€ “ whose guest star will be his rival Donald Trump â€
“ is the tip of an iceberg of campaigning and fundraising to thwart the deal by non - profits funded partly by casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson , conservative groups and other GOP candidates such as Marco Rubio .
These drives to block the nuclear accord on Capitol Hill are going strong , even though the White House has locked up enough Democratic Senate supporters to ensure it has the votes to sustain a veto from Barack Obama of any resolution of disapproval that anti - deal congresspeople do manage to pass .
And some of these groups are readying drives for more sanctions against Tehran to replace ones set to expire as part of the nuclear deal .
Over the summer , Texas senator Cruz helped forge a coalition of staunchly pro - Israel and conservative groups which has worked aggressively to build backing for congressional resolutions opposing the nuclear deal , a top Obama administration priority .
And a non - profit group set up by allies of Senator Rubio of Florida has spent about $ 4.5 m on an ad blitz in which Rubio blasts the nuclear deal , and may spend more , a spokesman for the group said .
The high - stakes fight could also yield political dividends for GOP presidential candidates , say Republican operatives and other conservatives .
â€œAggressively fighting the Iran deal benefits you with activists , and has a not - so - small side benefit of pleasing one of the GOPâ€ ™ s most generous donors , â€ � one veteran GOP operative said , referring to mega - donor Adelson , a staunch opponent of the deal .
Mort Klein , president of the Zionist Organization of America ( ZOA ) , a group which historically has been heavily funded by Adelson and is co - sponsoring Wednesdayâ€ ™ s rally , praised Cruz as a â€œman who tells the truthâ€ � about the Iran nuclear deal , and said that â€œinadvertently this could benefit his appeal to some donorsâ€ � .
The lobbying battle royale has pitted Republicans , conservative groups and some Democrats , who argue the nuclear agreement is not strong enough and poses a serious threat to the security of Israel and the United States , against the administration and a growing number of Democratic allies who insist it will significantly diminish the Iranian nuclear threat for at least a decade .
Rubio and Cruz are among several candidates vying intensely for Adelsonâ€ ™ s financial backing .
A close ally of the Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , and an implacable foe of the Iran deal , Adelson has poured millions of dollars into a few of the big ad efforts under way by outside groups , according to three conservatives with ties to the Las Vegas mogul .
Adelson , who in 2013 suggested dropping a nuclear bomb in the Iranian desert as a warning to Tehran against building nuclear weapons , has also made personal calls to some Democratic senators to urge them to oppose the deal , sources say .
Both Rubio and Cruz have had multiple meetings in the last year with Adelson , a sometimes mercurial donor , who gave close to $ 150 m in 2012 to numerous Super Pacs and â€œdark moneyâ€ � non - profits in an attempt to oust Obama and help congressional Republicans .
Boasting strong pro - Israel and hawkish credentials , Rubio and Cruz are said to be near the top of the list of those candidates Adelson is considering backing with his big checkbook , a decision that will probably turn on the candidatesâ€ ™ ideological bona fides coupled with an assessment of their electability .
The topic of Wednesdayâ€ ™ s Cruz - orchestrated rally was broached in a late July meeting in the senatorâ€ ™ s office that drew a couple of dozen conservative groups .
The three event co - sponsors â€ “ the Tea Party Patriots , the Center for Security Policy and the ZOA
â€ “ were in attendance .
Klein , of the ZOA , lauded Cruz for inviting Trump because â€œhis participation substantially increases the publicity and visibility of the Iran nuclear deal , which is a catastropheâ€ � .
This Thursday , as Congress is poised to vote on the deal , Klein will lead a lobbying blitz with some 70 of his board members and donors targeting at least 50 members of Congress , including those who appear undecided and some backers of the accord .
( Klein added that his group would keep pressing Capitol Hill for a resolution that would back Israel and other countries â€œin taking any steps they deem necessary to protect themselves against Tehranâ€ � and other measures . )
Meanwhile , the Conservative Solutions Project , a non - profit group run by allies of Rubio , has featured the Florida senatorâ€ ™ s words and image in its $ 4.5 m anti - nuclear deal ad blitz which has run on cable , radio and the internet .
Jeff Sadosky , a spokesman for the group , said in an email : â€œWeâ€ ™ re prepped to continue advertising throughout the time that Congress is considering the Presidentâ€ ™ s
dangerous Iran treaty.â€ � Adelson has given â€ “ or pledged â€ “ a seven - figure check to the pro - Rubio group , say three sources familiar with the casino mogulâ€ ™ s donations .
The Rubio - allied group , which reported raising almost $ 16 m in the first half of 2015 , isnâ€ ™ t required to publicly disclose its donors under IRS rules .
Sadosky declined to comment on whether Adelson has donated to the project .
Rubio recently said : â€œThereâ€ ™ s nothing about this [ Iran agreement ] thatâ€ ™ s binding on the next administration.â€ �
The non - profit American Security Initiative , which was founded earlier this year by former senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota , an Adelson ally , and three other ex - senators , including onetime Democrat Joe Lieberman , has also spent big money fighting the deal .
The group says it has spent almost $ 10 m running hard - hitting ads against the deal â€ “ including a late August blitz aimed at six Democratic senators .
Conservative sources say that the Coleman group has received seven - figure support from Adelson .
Coleman declined comment on its donors , but said in a phone interview that the goal â€œhas been to alert both Members and the American publicâ€ � about what the group deems the dealâ€ ™ s risks .
( Coleman and Adelson are also board members of the Republican Jewish Coalition , a conservative pro - Israel group that receives hefty funding from Adelson and has mounted a lobbying and ad effort against the nuclear accord . )
An Adelson spokesman declined to respond to questions for this piece ."
2015-09-16,"As Republicans take the stage for the second US presidential debate of the 2016 race in Simi Valley , California , on Wednesday , Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s commanding lead over the field will once again place the bombastic real estate mogul front and center .
But even as support for Trump has only strengthened ahead of round two , a number of top - tier candidates will be looking to recapture some of the momentum after a sluggish summer dominated by outsiders .
While a glance at polling conducted in recent weeks might reflect Trump as formidable or retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson as on the rise , political observers have longed viewed the race for the Republican nomination as a battle predominantly between a triumvirate of candidates : former Florida governor Jeb Bush , Florida senator Marco Rubio and Wisconsin governor Scott Walker .
And yet since Trump entered the race , he has sucked up every ounce of media oxygen with his celebrity and an outlandish candor that rather than alienating supporters only endears him to them further .
Bush , Rubio and Walker , meanwhile , have each taken different paths in responding to the Trump phenomenon â€ “ but all have struggled to cut through the noise .
Wednesday nightâ€ ™ s debate at the Ronald Reagan presidential library could offer a much - needed boost for the GOPâ€ ™ s
top brass â€ “ or at the very least a reminder that they are the ones to watch in the long run despite the national fascination with all things Trump .
Hereâ€ ™ s what to expect .
Marco Rubio
The senator from Florida will be looking for another strong showing after he drew praise in the first debate for offering substantive policy answers on issues ranging from education to immigration while positioning himself as the candidate best equipped to take on Hillary Clinton , who remains the Democratic favorite .
Unlike many of his fellow contenders , Rubio has mostly ignored the Trump show â€ “ a move that has spared him the sort of public confrontations that have thus far borne little fruit for candidates whoâ€ ™ ve tussled with the Republican frontrunner , such as Jeb Bush and Rand Paul .
Rubio has only indirectly referenced Trump on the stump , when drawing attention to the Apprentice starâ€ ™ s
â€œMake America
Great Againâ€ � slogan , which Rubio has said misses the point .
( The question is not whether America is great , but whether it can be even greater , the senator has argued . )
In interviews , too , Rubio typically responds to endless Trump - related queries by pivoting back to his own campaign , which weaves his compelling personal story into an optimistic pitch on restoring economic opportunity .
Donâ€ ™ t expect that to change at Wednesdayâ€ ™ s debate , Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said Tuesday .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s not going to hit any of the candidates .
Heâ€ ™ s going to go out there and talk about his ideas , his agenda ,
â€ �
Conant told CNNâ€ ™ s
Wolf Blitzer of Rubioâ€ ™ s preparation for the debate .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s going to talk about why heâ€ ™ s running for president.â€ �
Although Rubio is polling in single digits , most experts agree that in previous years early numbers have not typically predicted the eventual nominee for either the Republicans or the Democrats .
â€œRubio is better suited than any other candidate to be standing when the dust settles because heâ€ ™ s everyoneâ€ ™ s second choice , â€ �
Republican pollster Frank Luntz told the Guardian .
â€œThe most important polling question right now is â€˜Would you consider voting for Candidate X?â€ ™ More than 80 % of the GOP electorate would consider voting for Rubio â€ “ more than any other candidate.â€
�
The rise of outsiders such as Trump , neurosurgeon Ben Carson and businesswoman Carly Fiorina , Luntz added , â€œis a gut emotional reaction by Republicans to Obama , Clinton and even the Republican Congress.â€
�
In a nod to the current â€œanyone - but - DCâ€ � sentiment among primary voters , Rubio has recently made subtle changes to his usual stump speech by casting himself as both an underdog and an outsider .
At recent campaign stops in early voting states such as Nevada and New Hampshire , the senator has begun playing up his upset win in the 2010 Florida Senate race over his establishment - backed opponent , then - governor Charlie Crist .
He was told to wait his turn then , and the political establishment has again told him to wait to run for president out of deference to party elders , Rubio recalls in a thinly veiled reference to Bush .
â€œI
didnâ€
™ t know there was a line
, â€ � he then quips .
Rubio also criticized the establishment in both parties â€ “ including his own leadership in the US Senate â€ “ when Republicans last week failed to block Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s nuclear deal with Iran in a vote .
His disillusionment with the status quo in Washington is part of why Rubio chose not to seek re - election to the Senate and to instead run for president , the senator said .
Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign declined to discuss its strategy , but last week released a documentary recounting his 2010 Senate victory to telegraph that he had been here before , and this time was no different .
â€œWhen
he entered this race
he knew he wasnâ€ ™ t going to have as much money or as much name ID as some of the other candidates , â€ �
Conant told the Guardian .
â€œI would remind people that in every campaign heâ€ ™ s ever run , heâ€ ™ s started as an underdog and heâ€ ™ s never lost an election.â€ �
Scott Walker Leading up to his formal entry into the race , the Wisconsin governor had everything going for him on paper : he was a battle - tested Republican governor who in four years won three elections in a blue - leaning state , and a darling among conservatives for his fight against organized labor .
Walker also began the summer as a strong favorite in the early - voting state of Iowa , where voters seemed inherently drawn to his midwestern persona and retail politics
â€ “ which have often included traversing from one county to the next on a Harley Davidson .
But Walkerâ€ ™ s fall over the course of August was arguably the most striking of the GOPâ€ ™ s top - tier candidates , with a number of dust - ups raising questions over his preparedness for primetime , and his once dominant presence in Iowa all but disappearing .
It took Walker several tries , for example , to clarify where exactly he stood on birthright citizenship
â€ “ an issue injected into the race by Trump .
The governor also raised more than a few eyebrows for saying the idea of building a wall along the Canadian border was a â€œlegitimate
issueâ€ � .
And on some issues â€ “ such as Syrian refugees and the gay - marriage controversy over Kentucky clerk Kim Davis â€ “ Walker has declined to take a specific side , despite being pressed by reporters .
Walker has looked to steer the conversation back toward policy and on Monday announced a plan to rein in the power of labor unions , shifting back into the terrain that first catapulted him into the national spotlight .
Aides to Walker said to expect a similar focus on policy in the second debate , where the governor will look for opportunities to highlight his record in Wisconsin and to tout his plans for labor and to repeal and replace Obamaâ€ ™ s signature healthcare law .
The governor will seek to contrast himself not only with the likely Democratic nominee but also with the other Republicans on the stage â€ “ for example with his vow to terminate the Iran deal on day one , a Walker aide told the Guardian .
And while he was fairly subdued in the first presidential debate , this time Walker had plans to â€œstep it up and be more aggressiveâ€ � , the aide said .
â€œI really hope to be aggressive and make the case that weâ€ ™ re ready to wreak havoc on Washington ,
â€ �
Walker told CNN on Sunday .
Walker , like Rubio , has also sought to dispel the notion that he is an insider and recently denied that he was a career politician despite having served in public office for the majority of his adult life .
The governor has increasingly voiced his frustration at Republicans in Congress and pledged to take on the establishment , even if that means members of his own party .
â€œThey want people who will take on Washington , who will shake things up , and I agree with that , â€ �
Walker recently told Fox News .
â€œHeck , Iâ€ ™ m an outsider .
I was one of the guys who took on the Washington - based power structure right here in the state of Wisconsin .
They tried to come after me in the recall election [ of 2014 ] .
They failed.â€ � Jeb Bush
The former Florida governor was , in many ways , supposed to be as inevitable to Republicans as Hillary Clinton was to Democrats .
After moving quickly to form an exploratory committee in December , Bush amassed a record fundraising haul prior to the formal announcement of his candidacy in June as pundits began to frame the election around another Bush - Clinton match - up .
And despite a few hiccups leading up to the official launch â€ “ most notably his inability for days to definitively say whether or not he would have gone to war in Iraq knowing
what we know now â€ “ Bush remained a consistent second only to Trump in most polling in the early months of summer .
But on a crowded debate stage last month , Bushâ€ ™ s performance was described as dull and lacking in any memorable moments .
The former governor has also struggled to contend with Trumpâ€ ™ s shadow over the race , landing in hot water over his use of the controversial phrase â€œanchor babiesâ€ � and offending the Asian American community while attempting to clarify his comments , reflecting the perils of engaging with Trump on the issue of immigration .
Bush has nonetheless upped the ante against Trump , repeatedly going after his authenticity and even attacking him in Spanish , which Bush speaks fluently .
Team Jeb has also sharply questioned Trumpâ€ ™ s conservative credentials by highlighting his prior support for Democrats and changing policy positions , while Bush promised to pull no punches at the second debate .
â€œIf someone comes at me , bam !
Iâ€ ™ ll come back at â€˜em , â€ �
Bush said while campaigning in Salem , New Hampshire , this week , according to Reuters .
â€œIâ€ ™ ll campaign hard.â€
�
George Gonzalez , an associate professor of political science at the University of Miami , said Bushâ€ ™ s increasingly aggressive posture is the most effective way for him to reclaim his position as the Republican frontrunner .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s this sense that heâ€ ™ s not meeting expectations , and so his campaign says , â€˜Letâ€ ™ s fight this .
Weâ€ ™ re not supposed to be one of the dark horse candidates , â€ ™ â€ �
Gonzalez said .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re supposed to be the frontrunner , and unless we act like it people are just going to peel away.â€ �
And even as his poll numbers have plummeted of late , Bushâ€ ™ s command over policy and campaign war chest leave him safely positioned to ride out the outsider wave .
â€œIf thereâ€ ™ s going to be one person whoâ€ ™ s raised enough money that they can survive to wait and see if Carson and Trump both implode , it would be Jeb , â€ � said Steve Geller , who served as the Democratic state senate leader in Florida when Bush was governor .
â€œJeb has a lot more money in the bank , Jeb is better known , and Jeb has a deeper reservoir of support.â€ �"
2015-09-17,"Marco Rubio has been struggling to keep his head above water while Donald Trump overflows the race for president of the United States .
So when he arrived at the Reagan Presidential Library for the second Republican debate , he had to have something pretty special in the tank or heâ€ ™ d get hosed .
Back in 2013 , Rubio became a national joke for grabbing for a bottle of water during his official rebuttal to Obamaâ€ ™ s State of the Union address .
Hereâ€ ™ s the beautiful , timeless moment , in case you had forgotten .
Since then , the Florida senator has struggled desperately to escape his thirsty reputation .
But in the official introduction to Wednesdayâ€ ™ s debate at the library â€ “ in the question - less cold open that was totally prepared , with one - liners in the can and nothing spontaneous â€ “ Rubio found himself dragged back in his mind to that fateful moment more than 900 days ago ... by himself .
â€œIâ€ ™ m aware California has a drought , â€ � Rubio said ,
â€œThatâ€ ™ s why I brought my own water bottle.â€
�
Which didnâ€ ™ t go over so well ...
He didnâ€ ™ t speak again for almost half an hour ."
2015-09-17,"In an exchange that would have been all but unthinkable even four years ago , moderator Jake Tapper posed a question to Florida senator Marco Rubio and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie that quoted Reagan secretary of state George Schultz : â€œWhy not take out our insurance policy and approach climate change the Reagan way?â€ �
But despite the token question well into the third hour of CNNâ€ ™ s GOP debate , no candidate was willing to endorse any possible solution .
â€œHereâ€ ™ s the bottom line , â€ � Rubio answered .
â€œEvery proposal they put forward will make it harder to do business in America .
Harder to create jobs in America .
Single parents are already struggling across this country to provide for their families .
Maybe a billionaire here in California can afford an increase in their utility rates , but a working family in Tampa , Florida or anywhere across the country can not afford it.â€
�
He said : â€œWe are not going to destroy our economy , make America a harder place to create jobs , in order to pursue a policy that will do nothing , nothing to change our climate , to change our weather .
â€œAmerica is a lot of things â€ “ the greatest country in the world , absolutely .
But America is not a planet.â€ � Christie , who has previously stated that he believes climate change to be real , demurred when asked if he had an answer to â€œscepticsâ€ � like Rubio .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think Senator Rubio is a sceptic on climate change , â€ �
he said .
â€œI think what Senator Rubio said I agree with â€ “ that in fact we donâ€ ™ t need this massive government intervention to deal with the problem .
Look at what weâ€ ™ ve done with New Jersey â€ “ weâ€ ™ ve already reached our clean air goals for 2020.â€ �
He pointed to 53 % of New Jerseyâ€ ™ s power coming from nuclear energy .
â€œI agree with Marco .
We shouldnâ€ ™ t be destroying our economy in order to chase some wild leftwing idea that somehow us by ourselves is going to fix the climate .
We can contribute to that and be economically sound.â€
�
Both Rubio and Christie , and later Walker , accepted the premise that the climate was changing .
But Rubio felt there was nothing a government intervention could do about it .
â€œHereâ€ ™ s what we should be sceptical of : we should be sceptical of decisions
the left wants us to make , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œThey will not do a thing to lower the rise of the sea , they will not do a thing for the drought here in California , but what they will do is make America a more expensive place to create jobs
â€
¦ I am not in favour of anything that will make it harder for [ Americans ] to raise their families.â€ � Scott Walker echoed Rubio in worrying that â€œweâ€ ™ re going to put people â€ “ manufacturing jobs
â€ “ this administration is going to put them at riskâ€ � .
At the start of the debate , Rubio startled many by bringing up the environment â€ “ in what turned out to be a joke .
â€œIâ€ ™ m aware California has a drought , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œThatâ€
™ s why I brought my own water bottle.â€ �"
2015-09-17,"For once , the voters agreed with the pundits .
In the second floor of Halligan ’s Tavern on Wednesday night , a few dozen local Republicans agreed with the conventional wisdom that Carly Fiorina and Marco Rubio had performed best in the debate held in Simi Valley , California .
John O’Connor , a local state representative , told the Guardian that Rubio reminded him in some ways of John F Kennedy .
He also thought Fiorina did well , saying : “ Carly , I really like the way she approaches things .
”
However , the three - term legislator was left somewhat befuddled by the rise of Donald Trump .
O’Connor said he had been out of the country for large parts of the summer and had not closely followed the real - estate billionaire ’s rise to the top of the polls .
He was not impressed with what he saw on Wednesday .
Trump did n’t do much for the Republicans attending this bar in Derry , New Hampshire .
It was , however , something of a self - selecting crowd .
The Trump campaign was holding its own debate - watching parties across the state and this group of stalwarts was n’t exactly drawn from its target demographic .
Trump drew laughs , but not much support .
As Trump stumbled on questions about Middle East , one Republican , Patricia Dancey , exclaimed :
“
What a strange guy .
”
Dancey became a Rubio fan in the course of the debate .
After it , she said she was ready to vote for him .
However , she still thought he would n’t win in 2016 .
Instead , she thought he was someone who could become president eventually .
Another Rubio supporter was Neil DeLuca .
A second - generation Italian American , he said he felt an emotional connection to the Florida senator ’s story of growing up in a blue - collar immigrant household .
He also admitted that Fiorina did well too .
Fiorina ’s strong performance may have won over one Derry voter who previously supported her nemesis .
Deb Gowins , an ardent Trump supporter before the debate , told the Guardian she was now “ on the fence ” and considering supporting the former Hewlett Packard chief executive .
Yet in New Hampshire , a state where voters are famously loth to commit to supporting anyone , such impressions may only last until the next debate .
As state representative David Milz said , he may not know who he will vote for until he walks into the polling booth on primary day .
Milz was picking between Fiorina , Rubio and Chris Christie .
He told the Guardian Jeb Bush had fallen off his list after the debate .
Milz just did n’t think the former Florida governor was up to snuff .
“
He did n’t project , ” he said .
There are seven more debates until New Hampshire ’s primary , the first in the nation , and Milz will be watching them all .
But like many other New Hampshire Republicans , he may not commit to a candidate .
After all , as Milz pointed out , it ’s always possible that a campaign will implode on the eve of the primary .
It ’s worth keeping an open mind .
The next Republican debate will be held on 28 October in Boulder , Colorado ."
2015-09-21,"Presidential candidates from both parties have weighed in after leading Republican Ben Carson said no Muslim should be president of the United States of America , with some criticising the former neurosurgeon but many giving a more equivocal response .
In an interview with NBC for broadcast on Sunday morning , the retired neurosurgeon said : â€œI would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation .
I absolutely would not agree with that.â€ �
Carson was asked : â€œSo do you believe that Islam is consistent with the constitution?â€ � â€œNo , â€ � he said ,
â€œI donâ€ ™ t , I do not.â€ � Article VI of the US constitution states : â€œNo religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.â€
�
The first amendment to the constitution begins : â€œCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof â€ ¦ â€ �
Here are responses from his fellow presidential candidates : Republicans Marco Rubio : The Florida senator said faith should not disqualify anyone from the presidency , while adding that a person who believes in Sharia law would not be elected to public office in America in any case .
Rubioâ€ ™ s comments came in an interview with Fox News , which will air Monday evening and were shared with the Guardian by his campaign .
I donâ€
™ t believe anyone should be disqualified from the presidency because of their denomination or because of their faith .
I also believe if someone believes in Sharia Law theyâ€ ™ re not going to be elected to anything , much less the presidency .
But I do believe there are hundreds of thousands , if not millions , of people in this country who are Muslim and who love America .
I personally do not believe that your religious denomination should disqualify you from serving in office .
Thatâ€ ™ s what voters decide on on a variety of issues , including the values of someone .
Jeb Bush :
The former Florida governor believes an individualâ€ ™ s faith is irrelevant to seeking the White House or any public office , his campaign told the Guardian .
â€œThe United States Constitution is clear , â€ �
Allie Bradenburger , a spokeswoman for Bushâ€ ™ s campaign , said in an email .
â€œIt prohibits religious tests for public office.â€ �
Lindsey Graham :
South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham rebuked Carson for his comments on Twitter on Sunday .
Graham , a long - shot candidate in the Republican primary wrote that Carson â€œis not ready to be Commander - in - Chief .
America is an idea , not owned by a particular religion.â€ �
He added in a follow - up tweet that Carson â€œneeds to apologize to American Muslims .
He is a good doctor , but clearly not prepared to lead a great nation.â€ �
Graham amplified his criticism in an interview with Fox News in which he cited the service of thousands of Muslims in the US armed forces .
Ted Cruz :
Ardent conservative Ted Cruz expressed his disagreement with Carson in more measured words .
In an interview with Iowa public television , the Texas senator said : â€œYou know , the constitution specifies there shall be no religious test for public office and I am a constitutionalist.â€ �
John Kasich :
Ohio governor John Kasich has not yet commented on Carsonâ€ ™ s remarks .
But before Carsonâ€ ™ s interview Kasich was also asked by NBC if he â€œwould ever have a problem with a Muslim becoming presidentâ€ � .
Although Kasich did not say he would have a problem with a Muslim president , he did not directly address the issue and answered the question more broadly .
â€œYou know , I mean , thatâ€ ™ s such a hypothetical question , â€ � Kasich said .
â€œThe answer is , at the end of the day , youâ€ ™ ve got to go through the rigours , and people will look at everything .
But , for me , the most important thing about being president is you have leadership skills , you know what youâ€ ™ re doing , and you can help fix this country and raise this country .
Those are the qualifications that matter to me.â€ �
Bobby Jindal :
Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal issued a statement on Monday saying : â€œThis is a dumb game that the press is playing .
It is an absurd hypothetical question.â€ �
He then said : â€œIf you can find me a Muslim candidate who is a Republican , who will fight hard to protect religious liberty , who will respect the Judeo - Christian heritage of America ...
I will be happy to consider voting for him or her.â€ � Rand Paul :
Kentucky senator Rand Paul did not indicate he would have any objections to a Muslim president in an interview on CBS Sunday .
Instead , Paul tried to understand the skepticism that some might have about a Muslim president .
â€œI think , itâ€ ™ s not so much what religion you are
, itâ€ ™ s what you stand for .
But I donâ€ ™ t think that weâ€ ™ re really anywhere near that - probably that happening because theyâ€ ™ re a small minority in our - in our population .
But I think we - the hard part is , is while we are a very pluralistic society and weâ€ ™ re open to all religions , more free than any other country , the problem we have is that people have been attacking us have been all of one religion and itâ€ ™ s hard to separate that .
And so I understand people saying ,
oh my goodness , you know , how could that happen ?
He added : â€œI try to see that as a separate thing , someoneâ€ ™ s religion .
I just think itâ€ ™ s hard for us .
We were attacked by people who were all Muslim.â€ �
Donald Trump :
The real estate mogul said in an interview Sunday morning when asked if he could ever imagine supporting or being comfortable with a Muslim president :
â€œYou know , itâ€
™ s something that could happen .
Would I be comfortable ?
I donâ€
™ t know if we have to address it right now .
But I think it is certainly something that could happen.â€
�
Mike Huckabee : While former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee declined to directly attack Carson in an interview with Fox Business Network on Monday , he made clear he disagreed .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s no religious test for a person to hold public office in America , â€ � said Huckabee .
â€œI think it would depend on the individual .
I donâ€
™ t think we ought to just disqualify from somebody because of his or her faith.â€
�
George Pataki :
The former New York governor vehemently disagreed with Carson .
He said in an interview : â€œDr Carson is wrong too .
You know , they said the same thing back in the past , you couldnâ€ ™ t have a Catholic president ,
you couldnâ€ ™ t have a Jewish president , you couldnâ€ ™ t have an African American or a women president and now Dr Carson is saying you canâ€
™ t have a Muslim president and I think it is just wrong.â€ �
In Patakiâ€ ™ s opinion â€œit comes down to respect for our system of government , respect for the constitutionâ€ � .
Carly Fiorina
The former Hewlett - Packard boss said Carsonâ€ ™ s comments were â€œwrongâ€ � when asked about the controversy on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon on NBC .
â€œIt says in our constitution that religion can not be a test for office .
Itâ€ ™ s also true that this country is founded on the principle that we judge each individual and that anyone of any faith is welcome here ,
â€ �
Fiorina said .
When host Jimmy Fallon asked Fiorina if she was affirming that she would be fine with a Muslim president , she confirmed , â€œYes , I would be fine with that.â€ � Democrats Bernie Sanders :
In the Democratic field , Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont issued a statement Sunday saying : â€œI am very disappointed that Dr Carson would suggest that a Muslim should not become president of the United States.â€
� Sanders added : â€œIt took us too long to overcome the prejudice against electing a Catholic or an African - American president .
People should be elected to office based on their ideas , not their religion or the color of their skin.â€ �
Hillary Clinton :
The Democratic frontrunner tweeted : Martin Oâ€ ™ Malley :
In a series tweets on Sunday , the former Maryland governor condemned Carsonâ€ ™ s comments .
In one tweet , he wrote : â€œAmerican people are better than latest Trump / Carson / GOP anti - Muslim bigotry .
Hate is not an American value .
# diversityisourgreateststrengthâ€ � . Oâ€ ™ Malley followed up by noting :
â€œItâ€ ™ s sad to see the party of Lincoln being led by candidates who choose bigotry against Muslim - Americans over â€˜united we stand.â€ ™ â€ � Lincoln Chafee : Former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee said Carson should drop out of the race after his comments .
Chafee said : â€œRegarding Dr Carsonâ€ ™ s statement that a Muslim shouldnâ€ ™ t be president , Article II Section 1 of our Constitution clearly states the qualifications for the presidency.â€ �
He added : â€œDr Carson should discontinue his campaign based on making such an uninformed and discriminatory statement that a Muslim shouldnâ€ ™ t be able to ask American voters to have the freedom to make that decision.â€ � Carsonâ€ ™ s comments come in the wake of GOP frontrunner Donald Trump declining to correct a questioner Tuesday who called President Obama a Muslim .
The New York real estate mogul has often falsely suggested that Obama was born overseas in the past but has backed away from that claim in recent years .
The Guardian is contacting all the campaigns for their responses to Carsonâ€ ™ s comments and will update this article accordingly ."
2015-09-25,"For the first time since running for president , Donald Trump got booed on Friday among a crowd of staunch conservatives .
At the Values Voter Summit , a gathering of social conservatives in Washington DC , Trump received an angry response after calling his fellow Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio â€œa clownâ€ � .
Trump later told reporters , â€œthose werenâ€ ™ t boos , those were cheers.â€ � The Republican frontrunner has been engaged in a war of words with the Florida senator in recent days .
Trump has criticized Rubio for missing votes in the Senate , and the Florida senator went after Trump as a â€œtouchy and insecure guyâ€ � who â€œcanâ€ ™ t have more than a 10-second soundbite on any key issueâ€ � .
The boos marked the first time Trump has met such a hostile reaction on the campaign trail .
The Republican frontrunner , who told reporters that Rubio was â€œa babyâ€ � before speaking , also attacked the Florida senatorâ€ ™ s past support for immigration reform .
Trump said of Rubio : â€œReally , talk about weak on immigration â€ “ nobodyâ€ ™ s weaker.â€ �
The GOP frontrunner also said that fellow Republicans , including Rubio , criticized him solely to get attention .
Trump said of the Florida senator : â€œAnd he hits me , sometimes the Republicans do it more than anybody because they want to get into the publicity side and all your doing is hurting yourself .
Itâ€ ™ s a bad thing .
All youâ€ ™ re doing is hurting yourselves.â€
�
The boos werenâ€ ™ t the only negative reaction that Trump got from the audience .
When the Republican frontrunner claimed that he won the most recent GOP debate based on polls , an audience member shouted : â€œNo , you didnâ€ ™ t.â€ �
After speaking , Trump left quickly without taking questions from reporters ."
2015-09-28,"As Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin prepared to meet on Monday for the first time in nearly a year , the Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio said the US president had â€œstrengthened Russiaâ€ ™ s handâ€ � by failing to have a clear strategy in the conflict - ridden Middle East .
In an interview with NPR , Rubio , the Florida senator who has made foreign policy a cornerstone of his campaign , said Russia had gained leverage by making a case that the US was to blame for invading Iraq , withdrawing too early and leaving behind â€œchaosâ€ � .
Putin , he added , had already begun positioning Russia as a â€œmuch more reliable allyâ€
� with the capacity to fill the leadership vacuum left behind .
â€œThis president [ Obama ] has fallen into that .
Heâ€ ™ s , in fact , strengthened Putinâ€ ™ s hands , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œIf
I were president , the argument would be the reverse .
We would provide a clear strategy to deal with Isis â€ “ we would have done so already
â€ “ and those nations would prefer to work with us .
â€œBut , if left with a choice between Russia and nothing , theyâ€ ™ re going to choose Russia.â€ � Rubio has drawn a tough line against Putin , often referring to him on the campaign trail as a â€œgangsterâ€ � who controls government much like an â€œorganized crime figureâ€
� .
Putin responded to the â€œgangsterâ€ � charge on Sunday during an interview with CBSâ€ ™ s 60 Minutes , stating : â€œHow can I be a gangster if I worked for the KGB ?
Come on , that does not correspond to reality.â€ �
Rubioâ€ ™ s NPR interview aired in advance of a meeting between Obama and Putin at the United Nations general assembly in New York , where the two leaders will discuss conflicts in Syria and Ukraine , and the Islamic State .
Obama and Putinâ€ ™ s notoriously frosty relationship was on full display hours before the meeting , as both leaders sharply criticized each other in remarks before the UN .
Obama is expected to raise directly with Putin the issue of Russian military forces in Syria , after using his speech at the UN on Monday to chastise â€œthe support of tyrants like Bashar al - Assad who drops barrel bombs to massacre
innocent civiliansâ€ � .
In a clear rebuttal , Putin said it would be an â€œan enormous mistakeâ€ � to not cooperate with the Syrian government .
Asked by NPR if Assad should remain in power , Rubio said it was important not to lose sight of how the Syrian war began â€ “ as an uprising against the Syrian president , that was later seized upon by Isis and other terrorist groups .
â€œObviously , the Russians and the Iranians view Assad as a client state , and they want either him to remain in power or someone like him , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s quite different from our view because , as long as Assad is in power , you will have an Isis , or an Isis - like movement , and that vacuum will continued to be filled by the next jihadist group in line.â€ �
On the domestic front , Rubio dismissed an arguably less threatening foe : Donald Trump .
The senator and the real - estate mogul engaged in a war of words last week , after Rubio characterized the Republican frontrunner as â€œthin - skinnedâ€ � and â€œsensitiveâ€ � and said he had shown no ability to speak on policy or national security .
Trump responded , going after Rubio at a conservative gathering on Friday â€ “ only to be booed by the crowd , who had warmly received the senator earlier in the day .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not interested in the back and forth to be a member or part of his freak show , â€ �
Rubio told NPR , while reiterating that Trump was â€œsensitiveâ€ � and responded poorly to criticism .
â€œHis poll numbers have taken a beating , and he was embarrassed on national television at the debate by Carly Fiorina and others , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œBut this election is not going to be about Donald Trump .
He thinks it is , but itâ€ ™ s not about him .
â€œIt has to be about the issues confronting our country .
And my sense of it is that every time issues become prominent , he will say something outrageous or do something outrageous so that he doesnâ€ ™ t have to talk about the issues.â€ �"
2015-09-29,"As Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s critics look to cast his relative youth as a liability in seeking the nationâ€ ™ s highest office , the Republican presidential candidate on Monday brought a crowd of nearly 1,000 retirees to their feet on multiple occasions with a decidedly generational pitch on restoring American prosperity .
Rubio , 44 , hit all of the familiar themes of his campaign in his home state of Florida while speaking at a retirement community where attendance was so high that two overflow rooms were filled .
And perhaps most notably , he offered an increasingly sharper contrast to Floridaâ€ ™ s other favorite son â€ “ former governor Jeb Bush , one of Rubioâ€ ™ s key opponents in the race for the Republican nomination .
Rubio , whose presidential campaign has been on the rise , repeatedly called for a new chapter in American leadership at a time of great uncertainty .
The extent to which the country was willing to embrace change , Rubio argued , would later define this critical juncture in history .
â€œItâ€ ™ s why I chose to run for president , because I want this to be even greater than the country that was left for me and my generation , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œBut to do so we must turn the page.â€
�
â€œThe time has come for both the Republican party and the United States of America to elect a new generation of leaders with ideas relevant to the times in which we live.â€ �
Although the parking lot of the recreation center was filled with as many golf carts as it was cars , Rubio held up car - sharing services such as Uber as a model for innovation .
He even joked about the popular video game Candy Crush to people who , after the senator left , formed smaller groups in a nearby game room to play checkers and chess .
â€œIt took the telephone 75 years to reach 100 million users , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œIt took Candy Crush one.â€ �
To attendees almost entirely in their 60s and 70s , lessons on the way we live now from a man who is presumably the same age as most of the audienceâ€ ™ s children , could have easily been brushed aside .
But Rubioâ€ ™ s message â€ “ rooted in the need for a president who understands how evolving technology is shaping the modern - day economy â€ “ was received as enthusiastically as were his warnings taken in with somber reflection .
His strength was in knowing how to work the crowd â€ “ interspersing his appeals with jokes designed to make light of the age gap separating the senator from his audience .
One of the first things Rubio mentioned upon arrival was the reaction from his children when he had informed them of his pending visit to the central Florida development .
â€œIs
that the place with the golf carts?â€
�
Rubio recalled them saying , prompting a knowing laughter from attendees .
He dropped in references to the Bee Gees and Saturday Night Fever , if all but to point out , â€œSee , Iâ€ ™ m not that young.â€ �
And when it was time to turn to more serious matters , the senator drew from his stronghold of foreign policy with scathing criticisms of leaders in Russia , Iran and Syria , and the threat posed by Islamic State and other militant groups .
The crowd offered its most thunderous applause when Rubio pledged to strengthen the military , after decrying a foreign policy that he said lacked â€œmoral clarityâ€ � .
â€œIf I am ever blessed to be president of the United States â€
¦ not only will we have the strongest military in the world , but our allies will trust us and our adversaries will respect us ,
â€ � Rubio said .
Rival campaigns have sought to place focus on the fact that Rubio lacks adequate experience at the executive level .
Jeb Bush has both played up his own two - term tenure as Floridaâ€ ™ s governor and sounded alarms over electing another first - term senator , a la Barack Obama , to office .
But some of those leaving Rubioâ€ ™ s event were less concerned with another one - term senator and more worried about the prospects of another Bush on the ticket .
â€œThe governor is good , â€ � said Saundra Ciliberto , 72 , who noted sheâ€ ™ d be happy with either Bush or Rubio but has decided to support the senator .
â€œIâ€ ™ m just afraid with the Bush name he might not win .
We need someone to win â€ “ we need to change the office , and I think we have a better chance with someone whoâ€ ™ s younger.â€ � Paul Bova , 74 , said he found Rubio â€œvery upliftingâ€ � and was not at all anxious about his age .
Bush , he added , was a fine governor but lacking the â€œsparkâ€ � the country needs .
â€œI
really donâ€ ™ t see a whole lot of enthusiasm from his run for president , â€ � Bova said .
â€œIt concerns me .
I just donâ€ ™ t see that fight in him.â€ �"
2015-10-02,"In a damp parking lot outside Pittsburgh , an increasingly exasperated Jeb Bush is trying to claw his way back into the race for the White House with a simple message : itâ€ ™ s time for the grownups to take charge .
â€œWhereâ€ ™ s the marching band , for crying out loud?â€ � the former Florida governor asks a small crowd of energy workers who he believes , like him , deserve some more respect from America .
â€œAs president I would approve the XL [ oil ] pipeline for crying out loud , â€ � he adds , repeating what is fast becoming a catchphrase , not just for his scornful view of environmentalists who oppose its construction but a political world where very little has gone as planned .
Yet as Bush throws everything he has this week at boosting his moribund poll numbers â€ “ from announcing dozens of party endorsements , to buying airtime for political ads and prowling television studios like never before â€ “ some palpable question marks are beginning to hang over campaign stops like this .
What if the 62-year - old brother of George W and son of George HW is not the best mainstream Republican to reel in anti - establishment rivals such as Donald Trump , Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina ?
What if his roughly $ 130 m in donations from rich backers canâ€ ™ t compensate for a lack of enthusiasm among voters ?
What if he does not emerge as the partyâ€ ™ s designated grownup ?
Down in the warmer climes of Florida , there was another candidate who , despite being the youngest in the race , cast himself this week as a viable alternative : Marco Rubio , Bushâ€ ™ s friend and longtime ally .
Speaking at a retirement community in his home state , the 44-year - old senator told an overflow crowd of people twice his age that the issues confronting the nation could not be resolved by leaders of the past .
The time had come , Rubio said , to turn the page .
The forward - facing , optimistic pitch has been central to Rubioâ€ ™ s candidacy since he announced his run for president in April , despite being urged by some to stay in the Senate and wait his turn .
But it has grown sharper in recent weeks , as the candidate looks to capitalise on a steady uptick in his campaign .
And with Scott Walkerâ€ ™ s departure from the race last week , top party officials and donors are also giving Rubio an even closer look .
The senator , who spent most of the summer quietly campaigning with a focus on fundraising , has notably benefited from standout performances in the first two debates and staying out of the Trump sideshow that bogged down Bush and pushed Walker into a fatal , downward spiral .
Unlike Bush , Rubioâ€ ™ s modest beginnings , as the son of a bartender and a maid , have been an integral part of his story .
With four kids of his own , the senator often invokes his middle - class background on the campaign trail â€ “ an asset his backers believe makes him uniquely positioned to resonate with voters in a country still struggling economically .
â€œThat story that he talks about is a real story , itâ€ ™ s not concocted , â€ �
Bernie Navarro , a close friend who helps with Rubioâ€ ™ s fundraising , said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s weaved into his DNA .
Heâ€
™ s been there
â€ “
he knows what it is to balance his checkbook , and I think that drives him.â€ �
Also in contrast to Bush , whose poll rating has steadily collapsed from 17.8 % in July to an average of little over 7 % in the last three surveys , Rubio has begun to gain momentum in recent weeks â€ “ narrowly overtaking Bush nationally and slowly beginning to catch the three anti - establishment frontrunners who have dominated since the summer .
Amid a growing sense that there may only be room for one establishment favourite come the first primary voting in February , the two former Florida allies have also broken away from their reluctance to criticize one another with some none too subtle digs in recent days .
â€œIâ€ ™ m a proven leader , â€ �
Bush told CNN when asked why voters should favour him over the younger senator .
â€œI disrupted the old order in [ the state capital ] Tallahassee .
I relied on people like Marco Rubio and many others to follow my leadership and we moved the needle.â€ �
Rubio has declined to go after Bush , often referred to as his mentor , when pressed directly on their joint presence in the race .
â€œJeb is my friend , â€ � he told reporters in Florida on Monday .
But inherent in the themes of Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign is a rejection of the past â€ “ an argument that extends beyond Hillary Clinton to also encompass Bushâ€ ™ s candidacy .
As the senator put it himself in his announcement speech in April : â€œYesterday is over.â€ � â€œI honestly believe our party and our country need to turn the page and allow a new generation of leadership with new ideas to guide us toward the 21st century , â€ �
he added pointedly on Monday .
And the departure of Walker â€ “ a Wisconsin governor who proved unready for the national stage
â€ “ has prompted a race between Rubio and Bush to capture the support of his money men .
Anthony Scaramucci , a New York hedge fund manager who was Walkerâ€ ™ s national finance co - chairman , was poached on Tuesday to join Bushâ€ ™ s finance committee instead .
But several more donors and so - called â€œbundlersâ€ � , who gather contributions from wealthy friends , went Rubioâ€ ™ s way .
Bush denies reports that his own donors are getting jittery about his falling poll numbers , which he insists are still too early in the election cycle to worry about much .
â€œThere are a lot of people kicking the tire right now , a lot of anger , a lot of angst , â€ � he told MSNBC in one of several TV appearances on Thursday .
â€œThey are scratching their heads , saying â€˜whatâ€ ™ s going onâ€ ™ so they are latching on to the people who are the most outsider.â€ �
Like Clinton , Bush has also started avoiding more unscripted encounters with the press .
His campaign refused to allow journalists to pose questions after the event in Pittsburgh , for example , perhaps following a series of racial gaffes that undermined his attempts to be seen as a kinder , more multicultural , face of the party .
Instead , the former governor is renewing his focus this week on the two clear areas of advantage over Rubio : ad spending and connections .
As evidence of his familyâ€ ™ s support among older , more established , political activists , Bush has been in overdrive in recent days , announcing 25 endorsements in Iowa , the backing of 20 of Floridaâ€ ™ s 26 state senators and eight of the stateâ€ ™ s former speakers , plus five senior backers in Massachusetts , including two former governors .
Bush has also provided a taste of how he might spend some of the $ 100 m he has raised from Super Pac donors , filming a series of slick ads ( currently paid for by the campaign ) that paint him as the business - friendly face of grownup America .
Rubio has also reserved millions worth of advertising time this autumn , as he seeks to boost his name recognition and build a stronger presence in the early states .
And while he lacks the perks in resources of being a Bush , the senator has looked to turn his lack of wealth into a bonus .
Addressing voters in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , on Friday , Rubio repeatedly uttered the words â€œpaycheck to paycheckâ€ � to describe not only his own upbringing but also the plight of many Americans today .
â€œImagine
if you werenâ€ ™ t born rich or famous , â€ � he said , adding later that his goal was to ensure that the next generation is not â€œtrapped into the circumstances of their birthâ€ � .
And then there was the generational contrast that has become a staple of Rubioâ€ ™ s stump speech while traversing the early voting states that will play the biggest hand in choosing the eventual nominee .
â€œWe can not simply promote the next person in line or the most familiar name , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œIf we keep electing the same people with the same names , many of these issues that trouble us we will not be able to fix.â€ �
Itâ€ ™ s a point of distinction that has served Rubio well during his meteoric rise in politics .
Whether he was seeking the local office of West Miami commissioner , or running for the Florida House at the age of 28 , someone would invariably be standing in the way .
This time that obstacle is Bush , who moved early in December to form an exploratory committee for president designed to clear the field .
But Rubio has never been one to wait in line , even when the odds are stacked against him .
The most notable comparison : when he ran for the Senate seat he now holds , an example Rubio and his supporters have held up amid a crowded presidential contest to telegraph that he has been here before .
The political establishment had lined up behind then governor Charlie Crist , a Republican who had angered grassroots conservatives by embracing Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s stimulus package and looking to keep to the middle ground in the election year that ushered the Tea Party wave into Congress .
Rubio saw an opening to challenge Crist in the Senate race , but found little support in terms of endorsements or the kind of campaign war chest his opponent had acquired .
His poll numbers were so low that he and his backers called themselves â€œthe 3 % clubâ€ � .
â€œPeople thought Marco was crazy to run against Crist , â€ � said Jeanette NuÃ±ez , a Florida state representative and friend of Rubio and his wife .
â€œI think people underestimated him , they regretted it , and I think people are falling in the same trap this time around.â€
�
The presidential contest , of course , is a far cry from a statewide election , and Bush remains well poised to survive the ebbs and flows with a massive fundraising haul and campaign apparatus .
But after Walkerâ€ ™ s campaign implosion showed that Super Pac money alone can not compensate for a lack of buzz among supporters , Bushâ€ ™ s strategy may prove the ultimate test of whether the one - time establishment favourite can strong - arm himself back into the lead .
If he fails , he just might be traded in for a newer , younger , model ."
2015-10-03,"Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio escalated his rhetoric against Vladimir Putin on Friday , vowing if elected to the White House to â€œisolate Russia diplomaticallyâ€ � and impose a series of new sanctions on Moscow .
The Florida senator has taken an aggressive stance against Russia while campaigning to become the next US commander - in - chief .
Capping off a two - day swing through Iowa , Rubio used a national security forum to detail what foreign policy toward Russia would look like under his administration .
â€œAs soon as I take office , I will move quickly to increase pressure on Moscow , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œUnder my administration , there will be no pleadings for meetings with Vladimir Putin .
He will be treated for what he is â€ “ a gangster and a thug.â€ �
The senator said he would propose new sanctions on Russian officials and entities , including visa bans and asset freezes against senior leadership .
He also pledged to work with US allies in Europe to exclude Russia from SWIFT , the international banking system that allows for the exchange of money across countries .
â€œWhen Iâ€ ™ m president , America will speak clearly about Vladimir Putin .
He and his cronies will be the target of US financial pressure , â€ � Rubio said .
The Republican contenderâ€ ™ s speech was made against the backdrop of Russian airstrikes in Syria against opponents of Bashar al - Assadâ€ ™ s regime .
â€œWe are barreling toward a second cold war , â€ �
Rubio warned , while dubbing Putinâ€ ™ s moves a â€œpower playâ€ � in the region .
Rubio sounded similar alarms in last monthâ€ ™ s Republican presidential debate , in which his performance was praised and prompted a boost for his campaign .
The senator also used the perch of the debate stage to refer to Putin as a â€œgangster , â€ � a characterization he repeats often in media appearances and while campaigning in early voting states .
The fiery criticisms even attracted a response from Putin on CBS televisionâ€ ™ s 60 Minutes program last week , who when asked about Rubioâ€ ™ s description of him responded : â€œHow can I be a gangster if I worked for the KGB ?
Come on .
That does not correspond to reality.â€ �
Rubio mocked Putinâ€ ™ s comeback in several campaign stops this week , from an event at a retirement community in his home state of Florida to his appearances in Iowa .
Reading the quote aloud on Friday , Rubio simply said , â€œWell Mr Putin , I rest my case.â€ � Barack Obama also took a hard line against Putin on Friday , following his first meeting with the Russian president in nearly a year at the UN general assembly earlier this week .
Putinâ€ ™ s refusal to distinguish between moderate Sunni opposition to Assad and the Islamic State was â€œa recipe for disasterâ€ � , the president said .
â€œWe are not going to cooperate with a Russian campaign to simply try to destroy anybody who is disgusted and fed up with Mr Assadâ€ ™ s behavior , â€ � Obama said .
He rejected , however , the notion Putin was operating in Syria from a position of strength .
â€œMr
Putin had to go into Syria not out of strength but out of weakness , because his client , Mr Assad , was crumbling , â€ � Obama said .
Drawing a sharp contrast to the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s foreign policy has been a central component of Rubioâ€ ™ s pitch , as he seeks to cast himself as the most well versed Republican candidate on international affairs .
Democrats have hit back on Rubioâ€ ™ s approach , criticizing the senator in press releases for holding an â€œoutdated , cold war - era view of the worldâ€ � .
But polling has shown national security ranks as a top issue among the Republican primary electorate .
And Rubioâ€ ™ s efforts to highlight his grasp of foreign policy in a crowded Republican field appears to be paying at least some dividends among voters .
â€œI was watching TV and they were showing how he predicted word for word almost that Russia was going to get into Syria and start airstrikes , â€ � said Gary T , a voter who attended an event Rubio held on Thursday in Cedar Falls .
â€œI was very impressed â€ ¦ that pretty much decided it for me.â€ � Wendy Jorgensen , another resident of Cedar Falls , said Rubio is among her top three choices .
Naming retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina as her other favored candidates , she noted the senator had potentially pushed over the edge during his visit .
â€œHe just seems to really have a command of the issues , â€ � Jorgensen said .
â€œAnd for foreign policy , he really is better than the others.â€ �"
2015-10-06,"Conservative mega - donors allied with the sprawling political and fundraising network spearheaded by the billionaire
Koch brothers have already contributed at least $ 20 m to a handful of Super Pacs backing Republican presidential candidates , the Guardian can reveal .
Several prominent Koch network donors have written checks of between $ 100,000 and $ 11 m to the super Pacs â€ “ organizations independent of the candidatesâ€ ™ campaigns which , unlike the campaigns , may raise unlimited amounts of money from individual donors â€ “ backing senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas , as well as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Carly Fiorina , the former Hewlett - Packard CEO who reports over the weekend claimed was being considered for donations from the Kochs themselves .
A number of donors allied with the Kochs also chipped in millions to the Super Pac backing Wisconsinâ€ ™ s governor , Scott Walker , who dropped out of the race last month , sparking a subsequent free - for - all for their allegiance and big checks .
The Koch donor network is a group of over 200 wealthy conservatives overseen by Charles G Koch and David H Koch that meets twice a year at exclusive resorts to discuss small government and free - market policy priorities and raise funds for nonprofits that push their agenda .
Campaign finance reports and interviews with donors and operatives suggest that the powerful donor network , which intends to spend almost $ 900 m on political and advocacy drives this election cycle , remains divided about its presidential choices .
Of the $ 900 m target for total spending in the 2016 election cycle , about $ 300 m is slated to go to political spending , according to published reports .
Two conservative sources say that the network has raised and has commitments for about $ 600 m .
Most of the Koch network spending will be done by nonprofits which , unlike super Pacs , do not have to disclose their donors .
The tens of millions that Koch network donors have already given to Super Pacs supporting
GOP presidential candidates seems to come on top of their other spending goals .
Two of these presidential Super Pacs are run by operatives with ties to nonprofit groups that have been backed by Koch network donors .
Over the summer , Rubio , Bush , Fiorina , Cruz and Walker made presentations at a Koch network fundraising and policy retreat at a posh resort in Dana Point , California , which drew hundreds of wealthy donors including Charles and David Koch .
The brothers , who together are worth almost $ 100bn and control the multinational industrial giant Koch Industries , have suggested they may personally help a few candidates who meet their deregulatory , low - tax and free - market policy priorities .
The summer donor retreat was hosted by Freedom Partners , the Koch networkâ€
™ s fundraising hub that is set up as a business trade group and has over 200 members who donate at least $ 100,000 a year .
Last year , Freedom Partners launched its own Super Pac , Freedom Partners Action Fund , which raised almost $ 29 m and is expected to spend $ 100 m or more in 2016 .
Even before the summer retreat , network donors were coughing up big checks to Super Pacs , which sprang up after the supreme court in 2010 overturned decades of campaign finance law and allowed corporations , individuals and unions to give unlimited sums to ostensibly independent groups promoting federal candidates .
Koch network donors who have contributed to Super Pacs backing Republican presidential candidates in this election cycle include : Arizonan Randy Kendrick , a wealthy conservative who has donated $ 100,000 to a pro - Rubio Super Pac and is also a leading fundraiser for his campaign committee in her home state of Maryland .
Kendrick is a regular attendee at the Kochsâ€ ™ s semiannual retreats .
Ken Griffin , who runs Citadel , a large Chicago hedge fund , and has donated to Koch network projects .
Griffin also chipped in $ 100,000 to the pro - Rubio Super Pac , and $ 100,000 to the pro - Jeb Bush super Pac , Right to Rise USA .
Hedge - fund mogul Robert Mercer , a big donor to the Koch network , who poured $ 11 m into the pro - Cruz Pac , Keep the Promise I , of which $ 500,000 was shipped to the Fiorina - supporting Super Pac , Carly for America .
Helen Schwab , the wife of investor Charles Schwab , a longtime donor to the Koch network , who gave $ 1.5 m to the Jeb Bush - supporting Super Pac , Right to Rise USA .
Other heavy hitters in the Koch network , such as multibillionaire casino owner Sheldon Adelson and hedge - fund billionaire Paul Singer , have not yet given to Super Pacs , but have met with top GOP contenders including Rubio , Bush and Fiorina .
Adelson , sources say , gave or pledged a seven - figure check to a Rubio - allied nonprofit that does not have to disclose its donors .
Koch network donors attest to the fundraising muscle that the semiannual network retreats offer .
â€œAnybody who goes to the Koch conferences is willing to put their money where their beliefs are , â€ � said Stan Hubbard , a billionaire broadcaster from Minnesota who has attended a few meetings .
â€œThe Koch meetings are an important audience to go before.â€ � Hubbard , who was an early backer of Walker and chipped in $ 50,000 to a Super Pac backing him called Unintimidated , indicated shortly before Walker pulled out of the race that he was going to give the maximum federal donation of $ 2,700 to the campaigns of Rubio , Fiorina , the New Jersey governor , Chris Christie , and Ben Carson .
Asked if he would donate again to a Super Pac , Hubbard said : â€œAnybody who looks like theyâ€ ™ d be a great candidate and is searching for help , weâ€ ™ d certainly consider.â€ �
Another big contributor to Walkerâ€ ™ s Super Pac who has been been a Koch network donor for a few years is Wisconsin billionaire Diane Hendricks .
The founder of ABC Supply Co , Hendricks gave $ 5 m to Walkerâ€ ™ s
Unintimidated Super Pac .
In addition , some of the Super Pacs and campaigns are being run by operatives who have either worked for nonprofits funded by Koch donors or have lobbied for Koch Industries .
For instance , the president of the pro - Cruz Super Pac , Keep the Promise I , is Kellyanne Conway , a GOP pollster who has been a consultant to a few Koch backed advocacy groups including Americans for Prosperity , and attended some Koch donor retreats .
Likewise , the executive director of the Fiorina - supporting Super Pac , Stephen DeMaura , is a Washington operative who recently led Americans for Job Security , a nonprofit which received millions of dollars in the 2012 elections from Koch allied donors .
AJS was embroiled in a California campaign finance scandal that led to a $ 1 m fine against two Arizona groups to which it funneled millions of dollars that were spent on California ballot initiatives without properly disclosing the actual donors .
And Fiorinaâ€ ™ s campaign manager is Frank Sadler , a former lobbyist for Koch Industries .
The Koch network is helping GOP candidates in other ways too .
Americans for Prosperity , which intends to spend over $ 200 m in the coming elections on advocacy and political drives , has hosted a few rallies in key primary states , including New Hampshire and Nevada , where Koch favored candidates including Rubio , Bush and Cruz have been featured guests .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re going to keep inviting favored candidates to key state events , saving the campaigns money and supplying them with made - for - TV exposure , â€ � said a GOP source familiar with Americans for Prosperityâ€ ™ s plans .
Other Koch entities are providing donors with guidance on which candidates might be worth looking at more closely .
Just days before Walker dropped out , Freedom Partners hosted a conference call to update dozens of donors on the status of network plans and the latest appraisals of candidates .
Two donors say that on the call Koch operatives indicated that both Fiorina and Ben Carson were added to their list of viable candidates along with Rubio , Cruz and Bush ."
2015-10-09,"Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio raised roughly $ 6 m in the third quarter of this year , campaign officials told top donors at a Las Vegas retreat on Thursday .
While numbers are not yet final , the Florida senator will start the next fundraising quarter with about $ 11 m cash on hand .
A source who attended the gathering and requested anonymity confirmed the details to the Guardian , where campaign officials acknowledged that Rubioâ€ ™ s fundraising was slow over the summer
â€ “ citing as factors the entry into the race of Wisconsin governor Scott Walker and other candidates in July .
The campaign emphasised a strong uptick in September and October , and Rubio has been viewed as the biggest benefactor of Walkerâ€ ™ s early exit from the presidential contest last month .
October is expected to be Rubioâ€
™ s best month yet , and the Florida senator raised $ 1 m online alone in September , the source said .
Most Republican campaigns have yet to release their fundraising totals for the third quarter , although retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson raised about $ 20 m .
Texas senator Ted Cruz , who like Carson enjoys broad support among grassroots conservatives , raised $ 12.2 m , his campaign said on Thursday .
Kentucky senator Rand Paul reportedly raised just $ 2.5 m in the same time , marking a significant dip for the libertarian firebrand who has struggled to gain traction in a crowded Republican field .
Democratic presidential candidates , who have a far narrower field , raised considerably more in the third quarter .
Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign announced a fundraising haul of $ 28 m earlier this month , while the campaign of Vermont senator Bernie Sanders said it raised $ 26 m .
Rubioâ€ ™ s aides have repeatedly said they are running a frugal campaign and underscored the fact on Thursday , telling donors they had budgeted accordingly and expected the summer to be slow .
Rubio did , however , spend the majority of the summer months focused on fundraising .
Rubio has gained significantly more traction in recent weeks , buoyed in particular by well received performances in both presidential debates .
Coupled with the stumbles of former Florida governor Jeb Bush , who raised record sums of money prior to launching his presidential campaign , Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign hopes to capitalise on that momentum and is competing with Bush for support from the donor class .
A recent report suggested that Rubio is also the new favourite of the powerhouse Koch brothers , Republican mega - donors who previously favoured Walker and are set to spent $ 1bn on the 2016 race .
In addition to gaining new prospective donors , Rubio has also become an increasing target among his Republican rivals -- playing into the notion that his candidacy is on the rise .
Bush , a longtime friend and ally of Rubioâ€ ™ s , has begun to openly criticize the senator over his low attendance in the US Senate , lack of executive experience and even his vote against airstrikes in Syria in 2013 .
Rubio has also drawn attention from real estate mogul Donald Trump , who has hurled insults ranging from calling the Floridian â€œa clownâ€ � and â€œa babyâ€ � to shining a light on Rubioâ€ ™ s prior support for comprehensive immigration reform -- a sticking point for conservative hardliners ."
2015-10-18,"Marco Rubio insists he supports immigration reform and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants , even as he has shifted from once backing a comprehensive overhaul of the system to now advocating a piecemeal approach .
But during time spent with Rubio on the presidential campaign trail , attempting to get underneath the rhetoric and into the specifics of his immigration plan proves challenging .
Should the Florida senator secure the Republican nomination , immigration could be a critical factor in his chances of reaching the White House .
Rubio says he has simply changed his tactics , not his broader position , on how to resolve a decades - long debate .
But immigration advocates believe the devil is in the details and Rubio , at least for now , appears reluctant to identify the metrics and timetables they say are crucial to ensuring that the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US can even apply for work permits , let alone citizenship .
Presidential candidates on both sides have recognized the growing influence of Latino voters , and Rubio , the son of working class Cuban immigrants , is seen as one of the Republicansâ€ ™ best hopes of bringing into its fold a demographic that has overwhelmingly favored the Democrats .
But with immigration driving a wedge between Republican primary voters , Rubio has tried to straddle both sides of the immigration debate â€ “ maintaining that he is â€œpersonally
openâ€ � to green cards for undocumented immigrants but emphasizing an enforcement - first approach .
During town halls in New Hampshire and Iowa over the past few months and at a Latino forum in Nevada last week , Rubio has answered questions on immigration by laying out the same step - by - step process .
His plan begins â€œfirst and foremostâ€ � with securing the border .
Then he will seek to modernize the legal immigration system and only once those steps are complete , he says , will he begin to address those 11 million undocumented immigrants .
He has said quite clearly that undocumented immigrants would not be eligible to apply for work permits until the first two steps of his plan were met .
â€œItâ€ ™ s just impossible to get people to even vote on [ work permits ]
until weâ€ ™ ve done the other things , â€ �
Rubio told reporters in Las Vegas last week , after the Guardian asked when undocumented immigrants would be eligible to apply for work permits under a Rubio administration .
When the Guardian posed a follow - up question on how a Rubio administration would determine that illegal immigration was under control â€ “ and who would decide an appropriate number â€ “ the senator remained vague .
â€œUltimately weâ€ ™ d have to work on what that number is and what people think is reasonable , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œItâ€
™ s never been zero
so it wonâ€ ™ t
be zero , but it canâ€ ™ t be what it is now .
â€œPeople need to see and honestly believe that the problem is not getting worse , that itâ€ ™ s getting better .
And until we are achieving that , I donâ€ ™ t think weâ€ ™ re going to have the political support that we need to move forward on the other pieces of it.â€
�
The answers were consistent with what Rubio first detailed in American Dreams , a book he released earlier this year that confirmed his preference for moving immigration bills in individual pieces .
The shift came after Rubio co - authored a comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate in 2013 but died in the House of Representatives amid intense opposition from conservatives over its inclusion of a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented .
The Republican primary electorate remains deeply divided on immigration and ranks border security as a matter of utmost importance .
One faction likens any path to citizenship or even legal status to â€œamnestyâ€ � .
This has been seized upon by real - estate mogul Donald Trump , the presidential frontrunner whose sharp anti - immigration rhetoric stands in contrast to the stance of pro - reform candidates like Rubio .
Rubioâ€ ™ s predicament has often been on display as he travels the country with a pitch rooted in his own story .
The topic of immigration is raised often , from town halls to local and national interviews and shouts from occasional protesters .
Rubioâ€ ™ s answer is the same each time .
He first identifies three problems : illegal immigration that is â€œout of controlâ€ � , a broken legal immigration system , and the fact that millions of immigrants are already in the country illegally .
Then , drawing on the failure of his own bill , he underscores that his piecemeal approach is the only viable option .
â€œYou have to deal with all three of these things , the problem is you canâ€ ™ t deal with all of that â€ ¦ at once , â€ �
Rubio said at a Las Vegas forum hosted by the Libre Initiative , a grassroots conservative group that aims to make inroads among Hispanic voters .
â€œI know , we tried .
We donâ€ ™ t have the votes .
We donâ€ ™ t have the support to do it that way .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re not going to round up and deport 11 or 12 million people , and youâ€ ™ re also not going to blanket award 11 or 12 million citizenship cards.â€ �
But as Rubio went through his plan â€ “ enhance border security by beefing up personnel and fencing off certain sections ; set up an entry - exit tracking system to crack down on visa overstays ; move toward a merit - based visa system , away from the current family - based system â€ “ the mostly Hispanic audience reserved its applause for the mention of green cards .
For the latter step , Rubio laid out a pathway that mirrored his Senate bill : undocumented immigrants would pass a background check , learn English , pay a fine , start paying taxes and get a work permit .
They would remain in that status for at least 10 years , after which Rubio said he would â€œpersonally supportâ€ � allowing some to apply for a green card .
What Rubio didnâ€
™ t say was what security triggers he would support for the legalization process to commence , other than that it was imperative to prove to skeptics that illegal immigration was under control .
Advocates are far from sold .
Daniel Garza , executive director of the Libre Initiative and moderator of the Las Vegas forum , said he agreed with Rubioâ€ ™ s framing of the political limitations around immigration reform .
But Garza said he was concerned that Rubio had yet to define the security measures and proof points that would show enforcement was working , to trigger a path to work permits and green cards .
â€œHe said , weâ€ ™ re not going to control all of [ illegal immigration ] , weâ€ ™ re just going to bring it under control â€ “
so thatâ€ ™ s very vague , â€ � Garza said .
â€œAre we securing the border entirely ?
How do we at least mitigate it to the point where now we can talk about these other pieces ?
â€œAt least letâ€ ™ s get the certainty of a work - visa program for the 12 million [ undocumented immigrants ] â€
¦ Heâ€ ™ s for it ,
heâ€ ™ s said that , which is great .
But how long is it going to take ?
And thatâ€ ™ s the million - dollar question.â€ �
The Senate bill Rubio co - sponsored included security triggers , such as a goal of intercepting 90 % of people trying to cross the border illegally in â€œhigh - riskâ€ � areas .
The bill also included a requirement that a specific plan for gaining operational control of the border be created , funded and initiated within six months of the billâ€ ™ s enactment , before undocumented immigrants could apply for work permits .
And it established a 10-year timetable for specific benchmarks , such as mandatory employment verification and the implementation of an entry - exit tracking system to stop visa overstays , that would open the path to permanent residence and then citizenship .
Frank Sharry , director of Americaâ€ ™ s Voice , a progressive immigration reform advocacy group , said Rubioâ€ ™ s plan to disconnect the triggers from the path to citizenship essentially meant no reform .
The step - by - step approach , he said , would rest on a hypothetical scenario in which Republicans either changed their mind about a path to legal status or Democrats were suddenly willing to embrace measures they have already ruled out , such as cutting family reunification visas .
â€œRubio says now that once Republicans â€˜believe and seeâ€ ™ that illegal immigration is under control , based on goalposts he refuses to set and specify , in a time frame that extends beyond his presidency , immigrants could be allowed to get work permits and someday citizenship , â€ �
Sharry said .
â€œThat isnâ€ ™ t a realistic strategy , itâ€ ™ s a cruel joke .
For years Republicans have kept moving the goalposts on what constitutes a secure border because it allows them to avoid the issue of legalizing undocumented immigrants , an issue that divides the GOP.â€ �
Rubio has certainly left himself with plenty of room to pivot in a general election , to a plan both more specific and more likely to succeed .
But whether he has left himself enough space to attract sufficient support from Hispanic voters â€ “ which his own pollster said earlier this year would need to be â€œsomewhere in the mid-40s , or betterâ€ � for a Republican to win the general election
â€ “ is hard to say .
Mark Hugo Lopez , the director of Hispanic research at the Pew Research Center , said Democrats have had a â€œsizable advantageâ€ � over Republicans among Latino voters .
He did caution , however , that support for a pathway to citizenship is not necessarily â€œa dealbreakerâ€ � among the voting bloc that ranks jobs and the economy as its top priority and could settle for a candidate who simply supports legal status .
But Lopez acknowledged that Hillary Clinton , the Democratic frontrunner , has enjoyed broad favorability among Latino voters which will likely be compounded by her early and aggressive courtship of a demographic that twice voted overwhelmingly for Barack Obama .
Clinton has positioned herself further to the left on issues like providing undocumented immigrants with driverâ€ ™ s licenses and promising to defend and even expand Obamaâ€ ™ s executive orders on immigration .
The president has signed two major actions to date : one in 2012 that provided deportation relief to millions of undocumented young people who came to the US as children , known as DREAMers , and another last year that would extend the program to millions of parents of US citizens and legal permanent residents .
Rubio has said he would end both programs as president , arguing that such reforms should be debated through the legislative process and not enacted using executive authority .
But that position has been met with objections from immigration activists who at times show up to protest his events .
After one town hall in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , an undocumented immigrant confronted Rubio on why he would seek to end Obamaâ€ ™ s executive actions at a time when the threat of deportation could separate millions of families .
Rubio responded by noting that the US , like every country , has immigration laws and must enforce them .
Democrats and some pro - reform advocates have attacked Rubioâ€ ™ s narrative , arguing that his enforcement - heavy immigration plan could very well postpone the debate over a path to citizenship until after his presidency .
At a campaign stop in Florida late last month , the Guardian asked Rubio for his response to that assertion .
He reiterated his three - step plan and his openness to undocumented immigrants eventually applying for green cards , â€œnot through a special pathway but through the same one that everyone is using , and thatâ€ ™ s consistently been my planâ€ � .
David Damore , a professor at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas who has focused on Latino voting trends , suggested Rubio will need to make a harder sell on his consistency .
â€œAt this point heâ€
™ s pretty much got every position on immigration at some point in the last couple of years , â€ � Damore said .
â€œIf
it looks like itâ€ ™ s political expedience , thatâ€ ™ s problematic.â€ � Following his events last week in Las Vegas , Rubio defended his stance as â€œvery reasonableâ€ � and said he was confident most Hispanic voters would agree .
Speaking in Spanish after a Spanish - language news outlet asked if he risked turning away Latino voters with his emphasis on enforcement , he said : â€œI think I have the support of the majority of people in this country , including Hispanics , for enforcing our laws , so that the problem doesnâ€ ™ t continue to get worse , and to deal in a responsible way forward for the people who are here.â€ �
Pressed further on whether he was giving up on immigration reform , Rubio insisted he was committed to the process .
â€œI want to push a result , â€ � he said .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t just want to have a position on it , I want us to fix it.â€ �"
2015-10-20,"Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio slammed the mainstream media on Tuesday for devoting more coverage to the killing of Cecil the lion than to so - called â€œsanctuary citiesâ€ � that shield individuals from federal immigration laws .
In an interview with the conservative Newsmax TV , Rubio sharply criticized both the media and Democrats after a bill he co - sponsored that would crack down on sanctuary cities failed to advance in the US Senate .
The Florida senator complained that the media essentially ignored a contentious issue in the broader immigration debate , thereby allowing Democrats to face â€œno consequences at allâ€ � for voting in response to â€œradical elements that believe that we shouldnâ€ ™ t enforce any of our immigration
lawsâ€ � .
â€œYouâ€ ™ ve got a mainstream media out there that spends days covering the death of a lion in Africa that an American hunter killed , but does nothing about coverage on issues like this beyond touching upon it in the first few days , â€ �
Rubio said during an appearance on The Hard Line .
â€œAnd then those of us who step out and say this is wrong , we should do something about it , weâ€ ™ re somehow painted as some extreme element that simply wants to enforce the laws of this country.â€ �
This isnâ€ ™ t the first time Rubio has invoked Cecil the lion to question coverage within the media .
When a controversy erupted this summer over a sting operation against Planned Parenthood by anti - abortion activists , Rubio tweeted his frustration with media outrage over the lion but not aborted fetuses .
Rubioâ€ ™ s comments came shortly after Senate Republicans were unable to secure the votes to move legislation that would punish localities that have objected to enforcing federal immigration laws .
The issue has become especially salient among Republicans on the presidential campaign trail , but Democrats on Tuesday seized in particular on Rubioâ€ ™ s support for the bill .
Sanctuary cities are those that have opted not to detain immigrants arrested locally for federal immigration violations .
Policies vary , but many hinge on the rationale that detaining immigrants arrested for local violations could result in blanket criminalization of communities and erode trust between immigrants and law enforcement .
The sanctuary cities issue gained national prominence after the murder of Kate Steinle , a young woman who was fatally shot in San Francisco in July by a man who authorities said entered the US illegally and had already been deported five times .
Steinleâ€ ™ s
death , which was held up by the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to justify his controversial anti - immigration rhetoric , prompted Republicans in Congress to take up legislation in response .
Citing his background as the son of immigrants and from a neighborhood of mostly immigrants in west Miami , Rubio said he had a better grasp of the immigration issue than anyone else .
â€œI understand immigration â€ “ the good , the bad and the ugly .
But this is not good , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œThis part about people that are openly violating our laws , and then you have jurisdictions in our country receiving federal funding and basically refusing to cooperate with federal authorities , is unacceptable and unexplainable .
It makes no sense and I think itâ€ ™ s just outrageous that these people can vote this way today and there will be no consequences and no accountability.â€
�
The sanctuary cities bill needed 60 votes to cross a procedural hurdle , but fell short amid objections from Democrats .
The final vote , 54 - 45 , was almost entirely split along party lines with just two Democrats â€ “ both from conservative states â€ “ joining Republicans in favor of the bill .
The White House had issued a veto threat ahead of the vote , calling on Congress to instead take up comprehensive immigration reform that would also address security at the border .
â€œThis bill fails to offer comprehensive reforms needed to fix the nationâ€ ™ s broken immigration laws and undermines current administration efforts to remove the most dangerous convicted criminals and to work collaboratively with state and local law enforcement agencies , â€ � the White House said in a statement .
The anti - sanctuary cities efforts have also been criticized in editorials as â€œa knee - jerk reaction to a tragedyâ€ � , and by some law enforcement officials as having the potential to weaken their capabilities .
The sanctuary cities bill would withhold certain law enforcement grants from jurisdictions that refuse to comply with federal immigration requests , as well as impose a mandatory minimum prison sentence of at least five years for individuals convicted of repeated illegal reentry into the US .
The latter provision was championed as â€œKateâ€ ™ s Lawâ€ � by Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz , who has aggressively campaigned against illegal immigration and voted in favor of the bill .
In a fiery speech on the Senate floor , Cruz said it would â€œprovide a moment of clarityâ€ � if Democrats voted to â€œstand with violent criminal illegal aliensâ€ � . â€œDo you stand with the violent criminal illegal aliens who are being released over and over again?â€
�
Cruz said .
â€œBecause , mind you , a vote â€˜Noâ€ ™ is to say the next time , the next murderer like Kate Steinleâ€ ™ s murderer comes in , we shouldnâ€ ™ t have a mandatory five - year prison sentence ; instead we should continue sanctuary cities that welcome and embrace them , until perhaps it is our family members that lose their lives.â€
�
Democrats used the opportunity to paint Republicans as anti - immigrant and focused their ire on Rubio , who made a rare appearance in the Senate to vote for the bill .
In a sign of how seriously they are taking his campaign , Democrats immediately pounced â€ “ dubbing the legislation â€œThe Trump - Rubio Sanctuary Cities Billâ€ � and even holding a conference call with reporters to specifically target Rubio .
â€œAs a son of immigrants , itâ€ ™ s distressing to see he forgets where he came from , â€ � said Representative Xavier Becerra , the chairman of the House Democratic caucus , while asking of Rubio : â€œWhat drives you and why are you doing this , especially when you flip - flopped from your positions in the past on immigration?â€ � Rubioâ€ ™ s attempts to straddle both sides of the immigration debate , as well as his low attendance record in the Senate , have been the subject of recent scrutiny as he runs for president .
Democrats said his decision to cast his first vote in nearly a month in support of the sanctuary cities bill was a reflection of the senatorâ€ ™ s priorities .
When the Guardian asked the Democrats on the call why they were focused exclusively on Rubio , when there were other presidential candidates who voted for the bill , Becerra said Rubio â€œtries to distance himself from Ted Cruz and tries to portray himself as something differentâ€ � .
Representative Raul Grijalva , a Democrat from Arizona , added that Rubio â€œpretended to be something rational and realisticâ€ � on immigration reform .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s the one thatâ€ ™ s listening to the political winds in terms of what Trump is saying , and heâ€ ™ s the one whoâ€ ™
s made the most dramatic shift from a position.â€ �
Among other presidential candidates from the Senate is Kentucky senator Rand Paul , who voted for the sanctuary cities bill , while Vermont senator Bernie Sanders voted against it .
South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham was not present for the vote .
In his interview , Rubio vowed to raise the sanctuary cities issue again if elected president .
â€œStep one in any process must be to be able to enforce our laws and part of enforcing our laws is making it clear that people are not going to be able to habitually ignore Americaâ€ ™ s immigration laws and find sanctuary and safety in the United States from federal authorities , â€ � he said ."
2015-10-25,"Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio has defended his common and much - criticised absences from Senate business , saying : â€œVoting is not the only part of the Senate job.â€ � Speaking to CNN in an interview broadcast on Sunday , the Florida senator also deflected the suggestion that his own statement this week , that federal employees who did not perform in their roles should be fired , could be turned back on him .
Rubio has the worst voting attendance record in the Senate this year .
According to an NBC News analysis released at the beginning of October , he had missed 59 votes since declaring his run for president in April , or 42 % .
He has missed votes since .
Other senators running for the White House had missed fewer by NBCâ€ ™ s count :
Lindsey Graham had missed 39 , Rand Paul four , Ted Cruz 57 and Bernie Sanders seven .
â€œEveryone needs to run their own campaign , â€ �
Rubio said on CNN .
â€œI can tell you that in the history of presidential politics , when theyâ€ ™ ve been running for politics in the Senate theyâ€ ™ ve missed votes â€ ¦
Actually , this is lower than what other people have missed .
â€œIâ€
™ m running for president so
the votes they take in the Senate are actually meaningful again .
A lot of these votes wonâ€
™ t mean anything .
Theyâ€ ™ re not going to pass and even if they did , the president would veto
it.â€ �
Earlier this month , Rubio missed a vote on defence spending , which was expected to be tight , because he was campaigning in New Hampshire .
CNNâ€
™ s interviewer , Jamie Gangel , mentioned Rubioâ€ ™ s remarks on the Senate floor on Tuesday , in which she said he said â€œfederal workers who donâ€ ™ t show up should be firedâ€ � .
At that time Rubio had missed seven votes in one month , the Washington Post reported .
â€œThatâ€
™ s not what I said , â€ � Rubio countered .
â€œI said federal workers that arenâ€ ™ t doing their jobs , that are not performing at their jobs , should be able to be fired , should be held accountable for not performing.â€ �
Asked by Gangel if his â€œnot showing upâ€
� meant he was not performing â€
“
â€œnot doing [ his ] job by votingâ€ �
â€ “ Rubio said : â€œNot true , not true.â€ �
He added : â€œVoting is not the only part of the Senate job .
I mean , the most important thing a senator does is constituent service .
Weâ€ ™ re still involved in looking out for Floridaâ€ ™ s issues.â€ � Attacks on Rubioâ€ ™ s Senate attendance record have come from the right â€ “ the Republican frontrunner Donald Trump â€ “ and left .
American Bridge 21st Century , a Democratic - leaning political action committee , recently released a â€œmissingâ€ � poster featuring his face .
Rubio also said he was regularly briefed on Senate business , particularly as a member of the intelligence committee .
â€œWe do all the intelligence briefings ; I was just there this Tuesday , â€ � he said .
â€œI got fully briefed and caught up on everything thatâ€ ™ s happening in the world .
Iâ€ ™ m fully aware
, we have a staffer thatâ€ ™
s assigned to intelligence , we get constant briefings.â€
�
He then repeated : â€œI think votes , of course , are important , but unfortunately , too many of them today are not meaningful.â€ �"
2015-10-28,"Three Republican senators running for president have assailed a bipartisan budget deal to avert a government shutdown , with one of them launching an almost certainly futile attempt to block its passage .
Rand Paul vowed to filibuster the agreement , while Marco Rubio dismissed it as â€œseverely flawedâ€ � and Ted Cruz dubbed it as â€œcomplete and utter surrender.â€ � â€œI will do everything I can to stop it , I will filibuster it ,
I will not let them condense the time ,
â€ �
Paul said on Tuesday during a campaign swing in Colorado ahead of the third Republican presidential debate on Wednesday .
â€œI will make sure that the country is aware that really both sides appear to have given up , right and left.â€ �
But despite Paulâ€ ™ s grievances there is little he or any of the other candidates can do to stop the bill in its tracks .
The deadline to raise the debt limit is not until 5 November and the House of Representatives is set to vote on the bill on Wednesday in what outgoing speaker John Boehner said would be a strong bipartisan show of support .
Under the Senate rules , if there are 60 votes in favor of advancing the bill Paulâ€ ™ s only option would be to eat up any debate time by speaking on the floor without pause â€ “ as he has done in high - profile fights over drone strikes and mass surveillance .
But in this case itâ€ ™ s unlikely he would be able to block the bill â€
“ and leadership aides said part of why they planned to move expeditiously was to avoid a scenario in which the budget debate moved into next week , when Paul or other opponents of the deal could actually risk hitting the debt ceiling .
A spokeswoman for Paul did not immediately return a request for comment when asked how , under the current rules , he planned to filibuster .
The senator did not hide his disdain for the accord , which , in addition to extending the debt limit and funding the government through 2017 , raises caps on both defense and domestic spending .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s a horrible â€
” itâ€
™ s hard for me to not use profanity in describing it , â€ � Paul said .
Rubio criticized the â€œpolitical establishmentâ€ � for a lack of transparency in reaching a deal he said would â€œirresponsiblyâ€ � raise the debt ceiling without substantive reforms .
â€œWe need to fundamentally reform our entitlement programs for future generations and adopt major economic reforms that would boost growth and help us pay down our debt , â€ �
Rubio said in a statement announcing his opposition to the deal .
â€œThis deal does nothing that future generations of Americans will be proud of us for ; instead , it postpones tough decisions until after the next election.â€ � Rubioâ€ ™ s office did not return a request for comment when asked if he would join Paul in seeking to delay the vote .
Itâ€ ™ s unclear
if the Florida senator , whose low Senate attendance has been a subject of scrutiny , will return to Washington for the vote .
Rubio is currently scheduled to campaign in Iowa on Friday and Saturday .
Cruz , the conservative firebrand who played a significant part in orchestrating the government shutdown of 2013 , also did not commit to trying any delaying tactics with respect to the budget agreement .
The Texas senatorâ€ ™
s office did not have any details on how Cruz planned to approach the issue , other than to say they were waiting to see what the process would look like for considering the measure in the Senate .
Cruz unleashed sharp criticism on Republican leaders for what he said was â€œa slap in the faceâ€ � to conservatives after the party regained control of Congress in the 2014 midterm elections .
â€œWe now have a GOP Congress but no one watching this budget surrender would know it , â€ �
Cruz said in a statement .
â€œMake no mistake
: the Speakerâ€ ™ s golden parachute is a victory for the Washington Cartel , for the politically connected elite , and for big business and lobbyists who get in bed with career politicians to grow government.â€ �
Both Cruz and Paul have raised significant money â€ “ and elevated their profiles nationally â€ “ through marathon speeches on the Senate floor .
Paul has struggled in the crowded Republican presidential field , raising just $ 2.5 m in the last quarter .
Whether another â€œStand with Randâ€ � moment will help boost his campaign remains to be seen ."
2015-10-28,"The third Republican debate is over .
Hereâ€ ™ s what we learned : There were tricky questions for Marco Rubio , the senator from Florida , about missing a lot of votes in Congress , for Ted Cruz , the senator from Texas , about his contrarianism ... and one about fantasy football that Chris Christie , the governor of New Jersey , spiked in the end zone .
â€œWe are 19tn in debt , we have Isis and al - Qaeda attacking us , and weâ€ ™ re talking about fantasy football?!â€ � he exclaimed .
Cruz got cheers for attacking the media , successfully turning the crowd against the moderators by saying the quality of the questions was â€œwhy the American people donâ€
™ t trust the mediaâ€ � .
The moderatorsâ€ ™ performance was also decried afterward by Reince Priebus , the national Republican chairman , on Twitter .
The crowd booed one moderator for pressing Ben Carson , the retired pediatric neurosurgeon , on whether his appearance on the web site of a company later accused of false advertising did not reflect badly on his judgment .
Carson said he had nothing to do with the company .
It emerged through fact - checking , however , that Carson had in fact performed in a video for the company .
The episode was representative of an uneven night for the doctor .
Rubio repeatedly turned tricky questions into strong applause lines .
Pressed on having to liquidate a retirement fund even after a $ 1 m book deal , Rubio quipped : â€œAnd I used it to pay off my loans .
And itâ€ ™ s available in paperback!â€ �
Jeb Bush stumbled in trying to attack Rubio for not showing up for work in the Senate , and reverted to flat stump speech - talk when he got a chance to talk about his economic plan .
Donald Trump , the erstwhile frontrunner , turned in an uncharacteristically short - winded performance , denied ever having made a criticism of Rubio that was printed on his website and used his closing statement to brag about having held the debate to two hours instead of three .
Everyone from the audience to the moderators to the candidates to the online audience seemed thankful to Trump for that .
The other four candidates â€ “ former tech CEO Carly Fiorina , Ohio governor John Kasich , Senator Rand Paul and governor Mike Huckabee â€ “ seemed to hold their places without breaking through .
The possible exception was Kasich , who had a couple persuasive moments of exasperation at the â€œfantasyâ€ � plans for entitlements and immigration presented by his rivals .
Searches on Google for the candidates tonight :
Luckily for Jeb !
no Republicans have ever heard of this guy Mike Huckabee was the first one to mention the blimp that came free from its mooring in Maryland today and drifted to Pennsylvania before it was eventually grounded , writes Adam Gabbatt .
â€œIf you saw that blimp that got cut loose in Maryland today , itâ€ ™ s the perfect example of government , â€ � he said .
Unfortunately for Huckabee , his own metaphor had even more in common with the blimp .
Just as the military lost control of its gaseous vessel , Huckabee quickly lost control of his analogy .
Soon his rather hot - aired trope was drifting around without direction or purpose , before eventually flopping to the ground .
â€œWhat we had was something the government made , basically a bag of gas , that got cut loose , destroyed everything in its path , left thousands of people powerless , but they couldnâ€ ™ t get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it.â€
�
He added bafflingly : â€œSo we had to keep it.â€ �
Dominic Rushe and Jana Kasperkevic of the Guardianâ€ ™ s business desk were here to cast their keen eyes over the economic aspects of the debate .
Hereâ€ ™ s what they thought :
Dominic Rushe :
So ... lovely as it is to spend the evening with you Jana , that was a bit crap wasnâ€ ™ t it ?
The main event was better than the kiddie table warm - up and - for such a busy debate - there was some fairly substantive stuff on taxes , on H1-B visas and a few digs at the Fed ( stay with me ) ... but minimum wage ?
No .
Womenâ€ ™ s wages ?
â€œI love my mom , governmentâ€ ™ s bad ,
OK?â€ �
Where was the debate on free trade ?
I miss Trump saying â€œChinaâ€ � .
Pretty lame really for a debate labelled : â€œYour Money ,
Your Vote.â€
�
There were more mentions of â€œmiddle - classâ€ � in the warm - up .
And they should have bumped Lindsey Graham up to first class .
I was surprised that the crowd got so angry given that very few of the questions really struck a nerve .
Jana Kasperkevic :
I , too , missed Lindsey Graham .
You know what else I missed ?
Serious questions about peopleâ€ ™ s money .
There was too much talk about tax plans .
All people want to hear is : â€œI will tax the rich .
I will not tax you .
In fact , I will cut your taxes.â€
�
Anything other than that and peopleâ€ ™ s eyes glaze over .
I know mine did .
Here are the questions CNBC should have asked : Do you think $ 7.25 is high enough for a federal minimum wage ?
Could you survive on about $ 15,000 a year ?
Do you know the average age of a minimum wage worker in America ?
Nine of the candidates on that stage are millionaires .
Ask them : what do you think you and other millionaires should be paying in taxes ?
Ask candidates with children like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz - are you worried about paying for your kidsâ€ ™ college ?
How will you do it ?
Ask Carly Fiorina how it felt to be one of the first female CEO ?
What advice would she give to average American women about asking for a raise ?
After all , in 2014 , US women earned 79 cents for every dollar that men did .
And why not ask Fiorina about the 30,000 people she laid off at HP ?
Does she ever think about them ?
The chairman of the Republican National Committee is not happy with the proceedings this evening .
The candidates blasted the moderators for asking questions they said were irrelevant or petty or antagonistic .
It was the Republicansâ€ ™ big night , but it was Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s name we kept hearing , reports Lauren Gambino , who is on the campaign trail with the Democratic frontrunner in Bartlett , New Hampshire .
While the top 10 polling Republicans take center stage in Boulder , the Democratic frontrunner is watching the debate â€ “ and live texting her reactions â€ “ from somewhere * in New Hampshire .
* She was asked several times by journalists at two events where she was watching the debate and did not answer .
Itâ€ ™ s possible too
that she couldnâ€ ™ t
hear the question amid the adoring throngs , but not likely , leaving us to wonder â€ ¦ where in the Granite State is Hillary Clinton tweeting from ?
Her first text of the night : â€œHillary here .
Iâ€ ™ m here in New Hampshire watching the GOP debate
- how about you?â€ �
Earlier in the evening , Clinton described the third Republican debate as â€œa little scaryâ€ � and said she â€œfeels
sorryâ€
� for her GOP counterparts .
During a speech at the partyâ€ ™ s Annual Grover Cleveland Dinner in Bartlett â€ “ where Clevelandâ€ ™ s grandson
George impersonating his presidential ancestor introduced Clinton â€ “
she joked : â€œFor those of you masochistic enough to want to watch weâ€ ™ ll try to get you outâ€
� of the event in time .
Clinton carried on the joke , saying that the Republican debates are actually a lot like a â€œreality TV show , but the cast of characters are out of touch with actual realityâ€ � .
The room roared with laughter .
She also said she felt bad for Republicans , who attacked her â€œwhen in doubt , when they have nothing else to say , when they donâ€ ™ t want to take any responsible actionâ€ � .
Meanwhile , residents in the early voting states of New Hampshire and Iowa are hearing Clintonâ€ ™ s voice coming out of the television , too .
The Clinton campaign began airing a series of issue - based television ads featuring working women .
Though Clinton does not appear in the ads , she does the voice over .
So far weâ€ ™ ve seen a commercial about Sarah , the senior business analysts , Alexis , the financial programming associate , Mindy , the cardiac nurse and Cheryl , the Kindergarten teacher .
Oh , and her team is rapidly working to respond to attacks over immigration , taxes , social security and Medicare , the economy , healthcare , LGBT equality , equal pay , affordable college , gun safety , criminal justice , raising the minimum wage and climate change .
Wherever she is , sheâ€ ™ s keeping busy .
Jeb Bushâ€ ™ s campaign is angry at CNBC , according to a Politico report , which witnesses a backstage spat .
Jeb Bush campaign manager Danny Diaz got into a heated confrontation with a CNBC producer outside the debate as it was happening , according to two sources familiar with the incident .
Closing statements .
Paul :
I want small government .
The budget deal this week is terrible .
Iâ€ ™ m going to filibuster it tomorrow .
Enoughâ€ ™ s enough .
Christie : Speaking to camera .
Are you fed up with Washington ?
Are you concerned about the debt ?
Are you serious about it ?
Then elect someone whoâ€ ™ s â€œdeadly serious about changing this culture.â€ � Chris Christie for clean government .
Cruz :
Who up here has actually taken on Washington ?
I have .
My dad fled oppression .
Freedom is personal for me .
Fiorina :
Every election we hear talk and intentions .
â€œWhat we need now is a proven leader who has produced results .
Thatâ€ ™ s how you go from secretary to CEO.â€ � â€œI
am Hillary Clintonâ€
™ s
worst nightmare .
In your heart of hearts you can not wait to see a debate between [ me ] and HRC.â€ � Carson : I want to thank my colleagues and the audience â€œfor being attentive and noticing the questions and noticing the answers.â€

People are waking up .
Political correctness stinks .
Trump :
Our country doesnâ€
™ t win anymore .
We used to .
We lose on trade , we lose with Isis .
With Iran .
We donâ€ ™ t win .
These folks , CNBC .
$ 250,000 for a 30-second ad .
Nobody wants to stand up here for 3.5 hours .
They lost a lot of money .
Everybody said it was going to be 3.5 hours .
And after two minutes .
I renegotiated it down to two hours
so we can get the hell out of here .
Rubio :
America is great .
I love it .
Itâ€ ™ s special .
But itâ€ ™ s slipping away .
Leaders are out of touch .
Letâ€ ™ s expand the American dream .
Vote Rubio .
Bush : Americaâ€ ™ s at a crossroads .
I will change the culture in Washington .
Just as I changed [ cough ] the culture in Tallahassee .
We rule .
Thank you .
Huckabee :
To the media this is a game and weâ€ ™ re the players .
But we give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people .
â€œFor those of us who are serious enough to run for president , think long and hard about why weâ€ ™ re here ...
weâ€
™ re not here for ourselves.â€ � Kasich : If youâ€ ™ ve saved one life , youâ€ ™ ve changed the world .
We need to rebuild families .
We need to know our neighbors .
America is great from the bottom up and the bottom up is us .
We will renew America .
God Bless America .
Applause .
Thatâ€ ™ s it .
Checkered flag .
Roger Stone is the longtime Republican political operative and former adviser , this cycle , to Donald Trump .
He accuses Kasich of dealing pot in the 1970s .
The story feels pretty iffy â€ “ not that Kasich sold pot , but that Stone fired him for it in 1976
Itâ€ ™ s Royals 4 , Mets 1 , in the bottom of the 6th .
You can catch up over on our World Series live blog here .
Oh wait the debate is back .
Chris Christie = Allen Iverson .
â€œIâ€
™ m supposed to be a franchised player , and we in here talking about practice .
Not a game!â€ �
Commercial break with closing statements coming up â€ “ so whoâ€ ™ s winning ?
Itâ€ ™ s dawning on us that some of you out there have lost the feeling of jaunty adventure normally associated with national presidential debates .
Letâ€ ™ s talk about that ?
Bush is asked about betting on fantasy sports .
Isnâ€ ™ t that gambling ?
â€œWell first of all , Iâ€ ™ m 7 - 0 in my fantasy football league , â€ � he says .
But he says it has to be looked at it .
â€œThere has to be some regulation , if they canâ€ ™ t regulate it themselves , the NFL has to look at it.â€ �
Christie strikes with a big applause line , figuratively pulling out his hair that with the urgent crises facing the county the debate has turned to fantasy football .
We are 19tn in debt , we have Isis and al - Qaeda attacking us , and weâ€ ™ re talking about fantasy football ? !
Harwood , the moderator , talks over Christie in asking a new question , about renewable energy .
â€œJohn do you want me to answer or do you want to answer ?
Because Iâ€ ™ ll tell you , even in New Jersey what youâ€ ™ re doing is rude , â€ � Christie says .
More applause .
The crowd is against these moderators .
From Guardian US columnist Jeb Lund , live in the â€œstand your groundâ€ � state of Florida : You know that your campaign is really reaching for anything at the point at which you pledge that , as president , youâ€ ™ ll make sure that Americaâ€ ™ s cops will no longer feel unsafe when they get out of their cars .
Chris Christie is going to # 8 with a bullet .
( I actually donâ€
™
t know where Christie is currently ranked .
I canâ€
™ t think that helped . )
Kasich is asked about student debt .
He says that in Ohio , universities will not get paid under a new plan until students complete courses .
He says there are other revenue streams for universities .
He uses the word â€œdisintermediate.â€ �
He arrives at a policy proposal .
Public service to pay off student debt .
â€œThis is a big moral issue for America , living a life bigger than yourself.â€
�
Bush says that government should not get involved in student loans because it would blow up the debt .
Fiorina says â€œthe more the government gets engaged in the economy , the slower the economy becomes.â€ �
She mentions minimum wage laws .
From Guardian US columnist Cindy Casares : Marco Rubio just said : â€œOur immigration system , from now on , needs to be merit - based unlike how it was when my parents got in.â€ �
Ok , maybe Iâ€ ™ m paraphrasing , but thatâ€ ™ s practically
what he just said with a straight face .
That canâ€ ™ t have been easy .
Christie says crime is going up because the president does not support police .
The number one job of the president ... is to protect the safety and security of the American people .
This president has failed .
Actually itâ€ ™ s to uphold the constitution .
Whatever the case , Christie says he would do better .
Much more substance in the â€œgrown - upâ€ � debate , writes Dominic Rushe .
There was almost a serious debate about visas and in particular the H-1B visas , given to skilled tech workers from abroad , that Silicon Valley is lobbying so hard to have increased .
There is some compelling evidence that H-1B visas , loved by Mark Zuckerberg et al , are a scam .
This study from the Economic Policy Institute found the top 10 users of H-1Bâ€ ™ s were all offshore outsourcing firms .
â€œThere are two reasons these firms hire H-1Bs instead of Americans : 1 ) an H-1B worker can legally be paid less than a U.S. worker in the same occupation and locality ; and 2 ) the H-1B worker learns the job and then rotates back to the home country and takes the work with him ,
â€ � according to the report .
Zuckerberg - backed lobby FWD.US has been pushing for an increase , supported by Rubio .
And Trump has been highly critical of the scheme - but not tonight .
Trump has called for employers to pay H-1B workers much more money in an attempt to discourage companies and boost job prospects for Americans .
He also wants tech jobs offered to unemployed Americans before workers with H-1B visas â€œThis will improve the number of black , Hispanic and female workers in Silicon Valley who have been passed over in favor of the H-1B program .
Mark Zuckerbergâ€ ™ s personal Senator , Marco Rubio , has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities , â€ �
Trump wrote in his immigration plan in August .
Tonight he had no problem with Zuck !
Interesting .
Heâ€
™ s prepared to take on CNBC , even Fox , but not Facebook .
Huckabee is asked whether Trump has the moral authority to unite the country .
Huckabee says he loves Donald Trump , â€œheâ€ ™ s a good man.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ m wearing a Donald Trump tie tonight , get over that one.â€
�
Is it made in Mexico ?
Kasich asks .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s a nasty question , â€ �
Trump says , apparently in reference to the original question but perhaps to the Mexico question .
Trump is asked about his concealed carry permit and whether he would be more comfortable if his employees could carry at work .
â€œYes
I might feel more comfortable .
I have a permit , which is very unusual in New York , to carry .
And sometimes I carry .
Not a lot .
But I like to be unpredictable.â€ �
Laugh and applause .
Ha ha . ha .
Trump says he would change policies at Trump resorts to allow guns .
Theyâ€ ™ re back .
CNBC hits Trump with a fact check for his denying he called Rubio Zuckerbergâ€ ™ s senator .
Itâ€ ™ s on your web site !
Quick of CNBC points out .
Trump says however people come in they have to come in legally .
Rubio takes the question .
He says that immigrants must â€œcome here to be an American .
Not just be in America.â€ �
Commercial break .
How much time is left ?
20 minutes ?
Whoâ€ ™ s winning ?
Tell us whoâ€ ™ s winning !
Pot question for Kasich .
Legalize it ?
â€œSending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster , â€ � he says .
Then Kasich switches back to income inequality and makes a call for freezing all regulations for a year except for on public safety , cutting taxes , balancing the budget and sending federal programs back to the states .
â€œAnd that will get to the nub of opportunity for children and an ability to see wages
rise.â€ � â€œYou want to fix America ?
This is the formula .
It worked for Reagan , and it worked for our team in Ohio.â€ �
Itâ€ ™ s a rather rousing speech , but does not seem to get much applause in the room .
Weâ€ ™ re on to Rubioâ€ ™ s tax plan .
The Tax Foundation has scored Rubioâ€ ™ s plan as saying that incomes for top earners would go up 29 % while middle incomes would rise 15 % , Harwood says .
Rubio starts talking really fast and brings up his dry cleaner .
He basically accuses Harwood of making up the Tax Foundation scoring .
Rand Paul cuts in , laboriously .
He has a rather difficult time getting the microphone but he manages .
He says he gets rid of the payroll tax .
( Paul supports a 14.5 % flat tax except for the lowest earners pay 0 . )
Theyâ€ ™ re all trying to jump in with their memorable tax plans .
The stand - out moment from tonightâ€ ™ s debate so far , asks Adam Gabbatt?Jeb Bushâ€ ™ s promise to give a â€œwarm kissâ€ � to a Democrat capable of cutting spending .
The image of Bushâ€ ™ s soft , puckered lips slowly moving towards a political rival , the light of an open fire dancing upon their entwined bodies , has captured the mood of the nation .
Or at least it has disgusted some people on Twitter .
By the way , do not google warm kiss .
That is not the kind of warm kiss Bush was referring to .
If you were following the runaway blimp story of earlier today -- that just came up .
It was pretty good .
From Guardian US columnist Jeb Lund : â€œThe Democrats have the ultimate Super Pac , itâ€ ™ s called the mainstream media.â€ �
Marco Rubio was doing some kindergarten - level trolling , especially after Ted Cruz already demonized the moderators as biased attack dogs in the middle of a debate ... where Tea Party inspiration Rick Santelli is asking questions .
Paul takes a question about the Fed .
â€œWe shouldnâ€ ™ t have price controls on the price of money , â€ � he says .
Carson takes a question about support he had voiced for oil subsides .
â€œI was wrong about taking the oil subsidy , â€ � he says .
He says he studied it and changed his mind .
â€œThe best policy is to get rid of all subsidy , and get government out of our lives , â€ � he says .
Then Carson says â€œthis is a bunch of crapâ€ �
â€ “
did he say that ?
He kind of swallowed the line .
Not characteristic speech from the good doctor .
From Guardian US columnist Cindy Casares : Ted Cruz opened up to let us know that his father Rafael â€ “ an outspoken , staunchly conservative fundamental Christian who often passes judgment on everyone else
â€ “ was once a deadbeat dad .
Turns out he was also a drunk .
Thank God Rafael found Jesus so he could lead Ted to Washington and now we get two Senators for the price of one .
Becky Quick , the moderator , asks Trump about calling Rubio â€œMark Zuckerbergâ€ ™ s personal senator.â€ �
Trump says , I never have called him any such thing , this is another lie by the lying media liars .
But : Trump gets in his much - anticipated hit on Super Pacs .
â€œIâ€ ™ m the only person in either campaign
thatâ€ ™ s self - funding , â€ �
Trump says .
â€œI will be putting up , you know , tremendous amounts of money .
Super pacs are a disaster , theyâ€ ™ re a scam ... and Iâ€ ™ m not blaming these folks , but , I guess I do.â€
�
Then Trump refers to â€œall of these nasty and ridiculous questions.â€ �
Rubio jumps in .
â€œDemocrats have the ultimate super Pac .
Itâ€ ™ s called the mainstream media.â€
�
Then he talks about Clintonâ€ ™ s appearance before the Benghazi committee , calling it damning -- for Clinton .
â€œIt was the week she got exposed as a liar .
But she has her Super Pac helping her out .
The American mainstream media.â€ �
Media really taking it on the chin tonight .
From Guardian US columnist Jessica Valenti : It was disappointing to see Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina pivot from giving real answers to questions about their views on equal pay .
Cruzâ€ ™
s answer was basically just listing a bunch of women in his life
â€
“
we get it , some of your best friends are women .
Fiorina went after Clinton , claiming that â€œever single policy she espouses has been demonstrably bad for women.â€ �
Come on .
( Also , letâ€ ™ s talk about how bad being anti - choice is for women and their familyâ€ ™ s economics . )
And it looks like Fiorina is back on the train to Fibs - ville again :
No , women didnâ€ ™ t lose 92 % of the jobs lost under Obama .
Rubio is asked about his support for expanded H1-B visas for skilled immigrants .
Rubio says American workers should have the first shot at jobs and America should train more high - skilled workers â€œso we donâ€
™ t have to rely on people abroad.â€

Jeb Bush finally threw down the gauntlet at his former protege Marco Rubio tonight , but his efforts to attack the Florida senator may have backfired , reports Sabrina Siddiqui , who has followed Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign closely .
Bush interjected as Rubio tried to explain away his low attendance record in the Senate , on the same day one of the largest newspapers in their home state of Florida called on Rubio to resign his seat .
Rubio recalled how several presidential candidates before him had missed a large percentage of their votes - including Barack Obama and John Kerry - and yet the same paper , the Florida Sun Sentinel , endorsed them for president .
â€œI read the editorial with great amusement , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œThis is another example of the double standard that exists in this country , between the mainstream media and the conservatives.â€ �
The crowd erupted in applause --
only thatâ€ ™ s where Bush stepped in , speaking as a resident of Florida and thus one of the senatorâ€ ™ s constituents .
â€œI expected he would do constituent service , which means he shows up to work , â€ � said Bush , while seeking to disprove Rubioâ€ ™ s theory of bias by pointing out the paper had endorsed his 2010 Senate bid .
â€œWhen you signed up for this , this is a six - year term .
You should be showing up to work , â€ � Bush said .
â€œLiterally , the Senate , is it a French work week ?
You get three days to show up .
â€œJust resign and let somebody else take the job .
There are a lot of people who are living paycheck to paycheck in Florida.â€ �
But Rubio was ready , having clearly prepared for the moment in the wake of increasingly aggressive barbs from Team Jeb leading up to the debate .
â€œSomeone convinced you attacking me is going to help you , â€ �
Rubio told his former ally , before pivoting to his optimistic campaign message .
â€œHereâ€ ™ s the bottom line : my campaign will continue to be about the future of America .
â€œIâ€
™ m not going to attack anyone else on stage .
I will continue to have tremendous admiration for Governor Bush .
Iâ€ ™ m not running against anyone on the stage .
Iâ€ ™ m running for president , because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton.â€
�
Bush and Rubio are competing for the mantle of the more mainstream , electable Republican candidate .
The two are also courting similar donors , and Bushâ€ ™ s inability to gain traction poses a risk that he may lose financial backers to Rubio .
Rubio has only slightly risen in the polls over the last month , but his aides have been optimistic that his well - received debate performances will help boost his profile - and persuade Bush donors to eye their younger , insurgent campaign .
Carson is asked about his affiliation with Mannatech , a medical supplement maker accused of false advertising .
He says he never had anything to do with the company and he canâ€ ™ t help it if they used his image on their web site .
Quintanilla pushes him : But does it not speak to your judgment that your image appeared on this discredited site ?
The moderator is booed .
But Carson was involved with the company : Carson is asked about his role on the corporate board of Costco , which is gay - friendly , in some rankings .
Given his views on homosexuality .
Carson says â€˜you must not understand my views on homosexuality.â€ ™
He says the Constitution protects everybody .
The he says his views on same - sex marriage are not the same as his views on homosexuality .
â€œThey should not automatically assume that because you believe in marriage between a man and a woman , that you are a homophobe.â€ �
From Guardian US columnist and Marco Rubio constituent Jeb Lund , live in Tampa , Florida :
CNBC reporter Becky Quick going in on Rubioâ€ ™
s using Florida Republican party credit cards and defaulting on a mortgage is the first time
Iâ€ ™ ve heard this brought up in a debate and a mainstream forum like this .
Naturally , he dismissed the issues as â€œdiscreditedâ€ � â€ “ which is a good reply if today is Opposite Day .
Cruz says â€œweâ€ ™ ve got to turn the economy around for people who are struggling.â€ �
Then he delivers a somewhat surprising lecture on the struggles of single moms .
â€œYou look at working women .
There are a lot of single moms in my family .
My sister .
Both of my aunts .
My mom was a single mom [ for a while ] ...
thank God my father was invited to a Bible study .
â€œThe struggle of single moms is extraordinary.â€ � Kasich strikes out at this weekâ€ ™ s budget deal .
â€œThis is the same old stuff since I left .
You spend the money today , hoping youâ€ ™ ll save it tomorrow .
â€œIf you really want to get to a balanced budget , you need to reduce your expenses , and you need to grow your economy.â€ �
Doesnâ€ ™ t sound like rocket science on TV .
Rubio is asked about having liquidated a $ 68,000 retirement fund and taking out a second mortgage on his house .
How can he be trusted with the national budget ?
He says thatâ€ ™ s a list of discredited attacks from his Democratic opponents .
Then he talks about growing up without money .
â€œBut Iâ€ ™ m not worried about my finances , Iâ€ ™ m worried about the countryâ€ ™ s finances.â€ � Follow - up question :
But you got a $ 1 m book deal .
Rubio :
â€œAnd I used it to pay off my loans .
And itâ€ ™ s available in paperback!â€ � Applause .
Heâ€ ™ s pressed on liquidating his retirement after a book deal like that .
He says heâ€ ™ s raising a family in the 21st century .
â€œI
didnâ€
™ t learn about this by reading about it , â€ � he says .
Laid down some significant relatability ground there , perhaps .
Fiorina is asked about ... something she ignores , to talk about creeping socialism .
â€œYou see folks , this is how socialism starts .
Government causes a problem , and then government steps in to solve the problem .
This is why , folks , we have to take our government back .
â€œBig government favors the big , the powerful , wealthy and well - connected and crushes the small and powerless.â€ �
Sheâ€ ™ s applauded .
From Guardian US columnist Cindy Casares in Austin , Texas : CNBC anchor Carl Quintanilla confronted Florida senator Marco Rubio about the cognitive dissonance between his Cuban immigrant heritage and his partyâ€ ™ s anti - Latino immigrant stance .
Rubio has gone from co - sponsoring a bill to create sweeping immigration reform two years ago to co - sponsoring a bill to crack down on so - called sanctuary cities this month .
Now nobody trusts him .
Oh , Marco .
His first response â€ “ to reform immigration policy â€
“ was the genuine one .
Now heâ€ ™ s only doing what he thinks that he has to do to get his old school Cuban Republican community to like him .
But he shouldnâ€ ™ t worry about what a bunch of old hypocrites think .
Rubio could be at the head of the new generation of Cuban leaders if heâ€ ™ d only do what he knows in his heart is right .
Bush takes a question about the budget deal .
He reverts to his laundry list about US economic performance .
â€œI actually have a recordâ€ � in Florida , he says .
A triple - A debt rating .
Economic growth and job creation .
He ends on a strangely vivid note : â€œYou find me a Democrat that would cut spending $ 10 , Iâ€ ™ ll give them a warm kiss.â€
�
Christie takes a question about no one at General Motors going to jail for faulty ignition switches that caused fatalities .
Christie says he would have prosecuted .
The problem with the Obama administration , he says , is â€œitâ€ ™ s a political justice department.â€ �
He claims justice went after David Petraeus , as an example .
Who is now in prison .
Oh wait .
From Guardian US opinion editor Megan Carpentier : Texas Senator Ted Cruz learned the hard way that playing to the audience in the house might not play well with the debate moderators , when he used his time on a substantive question about his economic policies â€ “ particularly on the debt limit â€ “ to insult the CNBC reporters asking some hard - hitting questions of all the candidates .
Cruz â€ “ who eventually got 30 seconds to answer the question â€ “ decided to use his initial time to earn kudos from the audience for noting that â€œnoneâ€ � of the members of the media moderating the debate would be voting in the Republican primary and
so , he alleged , they should be nicer to the candidates .
( In fairness to Cruz , the debate â€ “ which started off with a pro - forma interview question about each candidateâ€ ™ s weakness , turned heated quickly as moderators sought to contrast candidatesâ€ ™ positions with economic realities and actual , you know , math . )
But while Cruz earned a round of applause from an audience that is , by now , completely accustomed to Republicans shrieking about the mainstream mediaâ€ ™ s liberal bias , to viewers at home , asking Carson to explain how heâ€ ™ d plug the deficit by converting all taxes to tithes and then following up when he couldnâ€ ™ t answer the question is supposed to be a debate moderatorâ€ ™ s job .
Theyâ€ ™ re not running for best promise - maker , theyâ€ ™ re running for president .
And a little realism in the Republican race is better for Republicans than itâ€ ™ ll be for Democrats .
Carson is asked about pharmaceutical companies profiteering from charging too much for drugs .
Carson says some companies have abused their positions .
â€œWe have to think about ... what can we do for the average Americans ? ..
The average small manufacturer , if they have less than 50 employees , the average cost in terms of regulations is $ 34,000 per employee .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to have to have a major reduction in regulatory influence.â€
�
So he answers the question about profiteering with a call to erase regulation .
Trump is asked about the bankruptcies of his Atlantic City casinos .
He says he used it to his advantage but never personally filed for bankruptcy .
â€œCame out
great ...
thatâ€
™ s what I could do for the country . ...
Boy am I good at solving debt problems .
Nobody could solve it like me.â€ �
Thereâ€ ™ s a Democrat out there watching -- and liking what he sees : Big moments so far weâ€ ™
d say from Cruz and Rubio .
Carson and Bush kind of wavering .
Trump amazingly silent - ish .
Commercial break .
Bracing policy conversation breaking out tonight in Boulder !
Whoâ€ ™ s winning do you think ?
Cruz offers to buy Quintanilla , the moderator , â€œsome famous Colorado brownies.â€
�
Then Cruz says the budget deal is symptomatic of whatâ€ ™ s wrong with Washington .
Then he calls for raising the retirement age for social security and privatizing a portion of it for younger workers .
Huckabee is going to have the last word before break .
â€œThe government has no business stealing more from people who have paid this in , â€ � he says .
Among these Republicans , by reputation budget hawks , which has dared to take a hint of a swing at entitlements ?
Christie is known for talking tough on entitlements .
IF thatâ€ ™ s tough ...
Christie finally gets to speak .
He gets a question about his pitch to raise the retirement age for social security and cutting benefits for some well - off seniors .
Christie turns to the camera .
â€œThe government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.â€ �
He says social security faces insolvency in 7 - 8 years .
He says too much federal spending -- 70%-- is on entitlements and debt servicing .
Then he attacks Clinton , the only one really to do so by name .
â€œIf someoneâ€ ™ s already stolen money from you , are you going to give them more?â€ �
Lots of candidates on stage tonight .
10 .
And not all have spoken yet .
After 50 minutes .
Finally , Number 10 .
He says that entitlements amount to stealing from paychecks .
What is this payroll tax .
â€œItâ€ ™ s like a 400 pound man saying , Iâ€ ™ m going to go on a diet , but Iâ€ ™ m going to eat a sack of Krispy Kremes before I doâ€ � .
Krispy Kremes are donuts .
The World Series is 0 - 0 in the bottom of the third .
Jana Kasperkevic examines Fiorinaâ€ ™ s corporate record : Earlier , Carly Fiorina was questioned about her boast that billionaire venture capitalist Tom Perkins was a supporter .
He has some interesting views on democracy , notes Dominic Rushe .
â€œThe Tom Perkins system is : You donâ€ ™ t get to vote unless you pay a dollar of taxes , â€ �
Perkins said last year .
â€œBut what I really think is , it should be like a corporation .
You pay a million dollars in taxes , you get a million votes .
Howâ€ ™
s
that?â€ �
Paul is asked why he opposes the budget deal .
Paul says itâ€ ™ s taking money from entitlements to spend on the military and domestic spending .
He says that the debt limit â€œshould be leveraged to try to reform government.â€ � â€œWe should use the debt ceiling to force upon them budget reform , â€ � he says .
Cruz is asked about his opposition to the budget deal .
Cruz says , your questions stink , and they indicate why the American people do not trust the media .
Applause line .
Then Cruz pops off with a rather brilliant series of caricatures of the questions so far for various candidates .
He says in contrast , the Democrats were asked â€œwhich of you is more handsome and wise?â€ �
Cruz says Republicans are better than Democrats .
Jeb Bush has on his debating boots , it seems : Fiorina takes a question about how terribly Hewlett - Packard stock did during her tenure as CEO .
Why should she be hired now ?
Fiorina rolls out her usual defense , about how badly the NASDAQ did while she was running HP .
Something tells us that old argument is not going to perform well , this tenth or twelfth time
sheâ€ ™ s
tried it .
Bush is asked about troubles with his campaign .
He kind of rolls into a boring laundry list of statistics about the countryâ€ ™ s economic challenges .
He tries to hit applause lines but the crowd does not seem to be with him .
First blood to John Kasich in what was a fairly substantial exchange on taxes , adds US business editor Dominic Rushe .
Enough to make Donald Trump go for his throat , so it must have worked .
Kasich has been very strong on the - cough - somewhat odd tax plans of the candidates , especially Trump and Ben Carson .
Carsonâ€ ™ s plan seems to be something to do with a 10 % tithe , although tonight that has swollen to 15 % .
As moderator Betty Quick said such a scheme would require a 40 % cut in government spending : â€œIâ€ ™ ve done the math.â€ �
Carson was very unconvincing .
Itâ€ ™ s not enough , Kasich said , to say : â€œWhy
donâ€ ™ t we just give chicken in
every potâ€ �
or say we â€œare just going to be great.â€
�
Rubio says a Florida Sun - Sentinel editorial hitting out at him for missing Senate votes was unfair .
He lists other candidates - Kerry , Obama - who missed as many votes but got the paperâ€ ™ s endorsement , and attacks the â€œmainstream mediaâ€ � for bias .
Applause for Rubio .
Bush jumps in to hit Rubio on his absenteeism .
â€œMarco , when you signed up for thisâ€ � - in the Senate - â€œwhat is it , like a French work week?â€ � Rubio :
â€œItâ€ ™ s interesting , in the last six weeks I listened to Jeb , saying that he was going to model his campaign after John McCain.â€ �
McCain missed a lot of votes , Rubio says .
Bush did not have a problem with it then .
More applause for Rubio .
None for Bush .
The first real Rubio - on - Bush fireworks .
From Guardian US columnist Jeb Lund : John Kasichâ€ ™ s appeal in this debate â€ “ â€œFolks , we got ta wake
up!â€
� â€ “ seems geared to both independents and to the Republican establishment .
His direct message here might as well be , â€œLetâ€ ™
s cut the BSâ€ � : defending Medicare and social security ; slamming Ben Carsonâ€ ™ s fantasy tithing tax ; slamming Trumpâ€ ™ s vague calls for greatness .
Kasich is taking the role of the pragmatic conservative that Jeb Bush canâ€ ™ t avoid being , but heâ€ ™ s doing it with an edge and energy that Bush constitutionally lacks and has been skittering away from as he tries to portray himself as a radical conservative during the primary .
Thereâ€ ™ s a virtue in polling toward the bottom , as Kasich is : it gives him the luxury of making being a conventional conservative sound like an edgy outlier position .
Mike Huckabee
couldnâ€ ™ t think of any weaknesses he had right now , Adam Gabbatt notes .
He has a pretty glaring one though : his habit of doing and saying wrong things : a )
When he threw his support behind Kim Davis , the Kentucky county clerk who refused to marry gay couples .
b )
The time he said : â€œI trust @BernieSanders with my tax dollars like I trust a North Korean chef with my labrador !
# DemDebateâ€ � .
c )
The time he said homosexuality was part of a lifestyle , like drinking and swearing .
d )
When he kept claiming Barack Obama grew up in Kenya .
e )
When he said , following the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting , that the removal of God from schools meant they had become â€œa place of carnageâ€ � .
Rubio takes a question about all the votes heâ€ ™ s skipping .
â€œWhy
donâ€
™ t you slow down?â€
�
â€œThatâ€ ™ s an interesting question , â€ � he says .
â€œThatâ€
™ s exactly what the Republican establishment says too .
Why donâ€ ™ t you wait in line .
â€œWait for what?â€
�
Fiorina is up now .
She says Washington has been talking about tax reform forever but never pulls it off .
She says the 70,000 page tax code could be reduced to three pages .
She makes a persuasive argument about the ability of the rich to hire an â€œarmy of lawyersâ€ � to decipher a more complex code .
So a complex code equates with cheating , in her view .
Carson jumps in .
He rejoins the debate with Quick about whether a flat tax of 15 % would fund the government .
He presents some sketchy back - of the envelope math based on the ability to multiply 18 by .15 .
Cruz is not going for a 0 % flat tax â€ “ itâ€ ™ s 10 % .
It adds up , he says .
He claims the CBO has scored â€œevery one of our plans.â€ �
What plans ?
Most candidates have not floated specific proposals on most tax policy .
Cruz says he just released his .
Trump smashes Kasich .
He says that he got lucky in Ohio because of fracking , that he was on the board of Lehman Brothers , and that his poll numbers have tanked â€œand
thatâ€
™ s why heâ€ ™ s on the end.â€ �
Kasich says that yes , Ohio has an energy industry , and that heâ€ ™ s â€œproudâ€ � of his time as a banker .
Kasich pipes up .
He says heâ€ ™ s actually balanced the federal budget .
True , as the former chair of the budget committee .
He accuses his opponents of â€œfantasy tax schemes.â€
�
This stuff is fantasy , just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid .
Come on , you donâ€ ™ t scare senior citizens like that .
Then he has a â€œmad as hellâ€ � moment .
You have a 10 % tithe and thatâ€ ™ s how you fix government ?
Or that weâ€ ™ re just going to be great ?
Or that we are going to move 10 m people out of the country ? !
Folks , weâ€ ™ ve got to wake up !
We got to elect someone who knows how to do the job !
Carson takes a question about his flat tax , of 10 - 15 % ( he hasnâ€ ™ t said how much ) .
How did he come up with that number ?
Carson says he did not say the rate would be 10 % , it would be 15 % .
And he suggests getting rid of all the deductions and loopholes , and doing â€œsome strategic cuttingâ€ � in federal agencies .
Carsonâ€ ™ s magic number is 645 .
The number of federal agencies .
He says the number over and over .
Quick says youâ€ ™ d have to cut government by 40 % to make his tax plan work .
Carson says thatâ€ ™ s not true .
Quick says it is .
Carson says itâ€ ™ s not .
Now thatâ€ ™ s a debate !
Q for Trump .
Youâ€ ™ ve made many big promises .
Letâ€ ™ s be honest .
Is this a comic book version of a presidential campaign ?
Trump :
No , and thatâ€ ™ s not a nice way to ask that question .
He says his plan brings tax rates down to 15 % , which is true for most middle - income households , though his top tax bracket is 35 % .
Then Trump riffs on building a wall , â€œand Mexico is gon na pay.â€ �
Harwood cuts off Trump .
He says Trump can not cut taxes as much as he wants without blowing up the deficit .
Bush jumps in .
Quick jumps in .
This thing is a disorganized mess so far .
From Guardian US columnist Jeb Lund , deep in the American heartland / swing state of Florida :
This CNBC intro rephrased : â€œWhich one of these Republicans must we elect to rescue the United States?â€ �
First question : Whatâ€ ™ s your biggest weakness ?
Kasich goes first .
He ignores the question and says he fears the party will nominate someone not up for the job .
He mentions
Carsonâ€ ™ s proposal to end Medicare and Trumpâ€ ™ s to deport undocumented migrants .
Not realistic , he says .
Huckabee says he doesnâ€ ™ t have a weakness .
But if he did it might be that he plays by the rules .
Which Washington does not .
Bush says he is by nature impatient .
But also : â€œI canâ€ ™ t fake anger ...
I just donâ€ ™ t believe that this countryâ€ ™
s days are going to be deeply , you know , going down.â€ �
Rubio : â€œIâ€ ™ m not sure itâ€ ™ s a weakness , but ... I believe thereâ€ ™ s a sense in this country that our best days lay behind us.â€ �
Trump : Iâ€ ™ m too trusting .
And when they let me down , if they let me down , I never forgive .
Carson :
Probably in terms of applying for a job of president ... would be , not really seeing myself in that position , until hundreds of thousands of people told me to do it .
Fiorina :
Well gee , after the last debate I was told that I didnâ€
™ t smile enough .
[ BIG SMILE ] .
OK thatâ€ ™ s funny .
Cruz : â€œIâ€ ™ m too agreeable , easygoing.â€ � Ha .
â€œYou know I feel my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite .
Iâ€ ™ m a fighter ...
If you want someone to grab a beer with , I might not be the one .
But if you want a ride home , I will get it done.â€
�
Christie : â€œI donâ€ ™ t see a lot of weakness on the stage , quite frankly .
I see weakness on the Democratic stage .
I see a socialist , and isolationist and a pessimist .
And Iâ€ ™ m not sure which is which.â€
�
Paul :
The budget deal this week stinks ...
I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it .
Itâ€ ™ s started .
The candidates are taking the stage .
Carson has just emerged .
He joines Fiorina , Cruz and Christie .
And thereâ€ ™ s the Donald .
Whoâ€ ™ s going to make the wildest promise on cutting taxes ?
Cruz has said he favors a flat tax at an unspecified level .
For a detailed guide to each candidateâ€ ™ s tax plan so far , such as they are , visit the Tax Foundation web site .
Before we move on to the main event , Ben Jacobs in Boulder has been talking to Bobby Jindal .
The Louisiana governor wonâ€
™ t commit to supporting the Republican nominee to succeed him in his stateâ€ ™ s gubernatorial runoff on 21 November .
In last weekâ€ ™ s first round of voting , Senator David Vitter , a Republican , finished second behind Democratic legislator John Bel Edwards in the stateâ€ ™ s â€œjungle primary.â€ �
In Louisiana , all candidates compete in one primary and then the top two then advance to a general election .
Vitter , despite being the favorite , just managed to barely edge out two other Republican candidates .
However , Jindal , who long been engaged in a feud with Vitter , refused to endorse the Republican standard bearer to succeed him .
When asked by the Guardian if he would campaign on Vitterâ€ ™ s behalf , Jindal said : â€œI respect the judgment of the voters in Louisiana .
I think the press makes too much of watching voters try to endorse each other and look forward to seeing which candidate will commit to policies that will continue the economic development weâ€ ™ ve done in Louisiana.â€ �
When pressed about whether he would even endorse Vitter , he said : â€œWe havenâ€ ™ t made that decision yet ; that doesnâ€ ™ t mean we wonâ€ ™ t but we havenâ€
™ t made that decision.â€ � Politics in Louisiana are complicated by the fact Jindal has an approval rating of only 32 % and is deeply disliked by many voters .
Vitter has his own issues .
He was embroiled in a prostitution scandal several years ago and a private investigator employed by his campaign was arrested last week for spying a county sheriff .
Mitt Romney , the 2012 nominee , gives Lindsey Graham an upvote .
Graham does seem to be the subject of some not insubstantial buzz following the undercard the debate .
Reminder : he said : â€œMake me commander in chief and this crap stops.â€
�
Itâ€ ™ s past 8 pm ET , starting time , but the only Republican onstage is RNC chairman Reince Priebus .
We invite you , while we wait , to check in on our live blog coverage of game two of the World Series between the Kansas City Royals and the New York Mets , where someone has just sung the national anthem .
But donâ€ ™ t get lost over there !
Come on back to Colorado in a few minutes .
Itâ€ ™ s the presidency at stake , here .
Speaking of Ben Carson , here he is testing out his lectern earlier : And hereâ€ ™ s Ben Jacobs with a peek at Carsonâ€ ™ s debate strategy this evening :
Cher : not a Ben Carson fan , evidently .
Further reaction to the undercard : The entire country , to hear Google tell it , was all , Who is this Lindsey Graham ! ? !
Except Delaware , which was all , whoa , George Pataki , hello :
Recreational marijuana use is legal in Colorado â€ “ but will CNBC take the opportunity to grill the candidates ?
Jeb Bush copped ( again ) to pot use as a kid in the last debate , apologizing to his mother for announcing it on national TV .
Itâ€ ™ s not just a lifestyle issue for Colorado â€
“ itâ€ ™ s an economic issue .
Republicans must address whether the next president should continue to let states do as they please with marijuana laws , as Obama has done .
Itâ€ ™ s a point of contention among Republican presidential aspirants , and one that could come up again tonight .
Welcome back for our coverage of the big show , the third Republican presidential debate .
Donald Trump has been invited on national television to talk about money .
Ben Carson takes the stage as a freshly minted frontrunner .
Jeb Bush seems on the verge of fumbling the handoff of the White House from bro and pops .
Marco Rubio was born to talk .
Will Trump go after Carson for surpassing him in his beloved polls ?
Will Carson reveal a heretofore hidden depth on economic policy ?
Will Jeb Bush give America a reason to vote for him that does not have to do with his last name ?
( Some reason ! , some say . )
Ted Cruz raised $ 12 m last quarter .
Carly Fiorinaâ€ ™ s whole campaign strategy seems to be to kick ass in debates .
John Kasich seems angry about something .
Rand Paul and Chris Christie are just glad to be invited .
And Mike Huckabee used to be the governor of Arkansas .
The main event is about to start .
Itâ€ ™ s only two hours this time , and itâ€ ™ s going to go fast .
So stay tuned and please let us know whoâ€ ™ s winning â€ “ and whoâ€ ™ s slipping â€ “ in the comments ...
The Guardianâ€ ™ s
Ben Jacobs is just one cowboy hat away from asking Rick Santorum the question that will settle this thing .
Guardian US business editor Dominic Rushe branches out into hair criticism : From Guardian US columnist Jeb Lund , live from Tampa , Florida .
That was a really fun bit during the Kiddie Table debate , when Lindsey Graham joked about being a Fox News instead of CNBC watcher .
Itâ€ ™ s just a little reminder that CNBC is the Marxist network that aired Rick Santelliâ€ ™ s 1 % whine about taxation and moochers that the conservative astroturf group FreedomWorks used to launch the Tea Party .
The undercard debate in Boulder featured a solid , if unexciting , exchange between the four second tier Republican candidates participating , reports Ben Jacobs in Boulder .
South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham , Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal , former New York governor George Pataki and former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum spent an hour discussing economic issues with occasional moments of feistiness and a near constant stream of one - liners from Graham .
While there was a spirited exchange on tax policy between Jindal and Santorum over the relative importance of balancing the budget and simply cutting taxes in reducing the size of government and George Pataki echoed former Democratic candidate Jim Webb in complaining his lack of speaking time , the real star of the night was Graham .
The South Carolina Republican is well known for his sense of humor and seemed to cracked jokes nonstop during the debate .
Graham mocked Senate colleague Bernie Sanders , saying â€œhe went to the Soviet Union on his honeymoon and I donâ€ ™ t think he ever came backâ€ � while also proclaiming :
â€œI know beer.â€
�
The question is whether Graham will get any mileage out of the debate .
After all , voters are electing a commander in chief and not a comedian in chief .
Weâ€ ™ ve only got 45 minutes till the main debate .
Will the Republicans hit Hillary Clinton for this zany story about running around in a driveway with Bill and Chelsea in a frustrated attempt to crack a coconut ?
In the Democratic frontrunnerâ€ ™ s defense , that was probably before YouTube , and so before about a thousand helpful videos like this one .
While the kids wave their arms and squabble around one of the grown - ups , Jeb Bush , is tweeting , reports Adam Gabbatt .
Heâ€ ™ s made a video !
Visually itâ€ ™ s beautiful .
Thereâ€ ™ s a sunrise !
Someone welding something .
A jazzy shot in the window of a carâ€ ™ s rear view mirror .
Unfortunately for Jeb !
the images donâ€ ™ t quite detract from what he is saying , which is ... strange .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s no way that Barack Obama or the progessive liberals in Washington can take away from the bigness of this place , â€ � he says .
He is referring to America .
I looked bigness up and apparently itâ€ ™ s a real word .
Anyway while Bush was governor of Florida â€œwe turned the systems upside down that werenâ€ ™ t workingâ€ � , so suck on that Donald Trump .
Suck on that , gravity .
The video is worth watching for the euphoric backing track alone .
Fetch the glow sticks !
Enjoy the bigness !
Itâ€ ™ s a wrap !
There goes the first round .
Who do you think won ?
Tell us in the comments .
Closing statements : Graham :
Somebody said â€˜letâ€ ™ s make America great againâ€ ™ .
America is great !
I will win a war we canâ€
™ t afford to lose .
Support the troops .
Make me commander - in - chief !
Pataki :
Thanks for the opportunity .
I love 10th Amendment ( balance of powers ) .
I embrace science .
Santorum :
I announced bid from factory floor .
I come from steel country .
I align myself with working men and women .
Jindal : Conservatives , this is our hour .
Democrats are insane and incompetent .
Weâ€
™ re Christians and Americans .
We can not allow Hillary Clinton to take us further down this path toward socialism .
Now Quick trims them to 20 seconds per answer !
Lightning round .
Whew .
What are your top three apps ?
Jindal : wastes his time by saying he has a blackberry not an iphone .
Santorum : MLB , NHL and Wall Street Journal .
Pataki :
Uber ,
Twitter Graham :
The only reason I have an iPhone is because I gave my number to Donald Trump .
Should the day after Super Bowl be a national holiday ?
Jindal :
Go Saints .
I think itâ€ ™ d be a great day to take off .
Santorum :
Go Steelers .
It is in Pennsylvania already .
Pataki :
Go Jets .
No , thereâ€
™ s no reason .
The Mets are gon na win .
Graham :
I think the national holiday would be the day that commander in chief Barack Obama doesnâ€ ™ t have that job .
Go Tom Brady .
Huh .
Google trends is tracking searches for candidatesâ€ ™ names .
Graham is the blue line .
The blue line is often higher than the other lines .
Graham is the nominee .
Commercial !
Letâ€ ™ s check in on the hacks :
Hacks hacking !
Carry on .
Graham is now mounting a near - tearful defense of Social Security .
â€œ50 % of todayâ€ ™ s seniors would be in poverty without Social Security , â€ �
he says .
â€œI promise you if you make me your president , I will save social security because I know why it exists , â€ � he says .
As for beer policy , he says , he grew up behind a bar .
Epperson cuts him off .
What have we learned from kiddie table economics so far , asks Guardian US business editor Dominic Rushe ?
Not a lot .
Socialism is bad , Obama is bad ( and probably a socialist ) , taxes are bad .
Not all Republicans believe climate change is a lie ( but the ones who believe itâ€ ™ s true probably wonâ€ ™ t get elected ) .
And the arid Boulder weather has done wonders for Rick Santorumâ€ ™ s hair .
In terms of economic policy no one has really excelled - let alone broken ahead of the ( trailing ) pack .
Santorum busts out some etymology .
â€œThe word economy comes from the Greek oikonomos which means family , â€ � he says .
FACT CHECK Our dictionary thinks oikonomos means manager of a household and oikos means house .
Did Santorum just blow his last chance at the nomination ?
Pataki believes climate change is real and caused by humans .
Heâ€
™ s asked about that .
â€œOne of the thing that troubles me about the Republican party is that too often we question science that everyone accepts , â€ � he says .
Pataki mentions the science behind vaccines and climate change .
CO2 emissions trap greenhouse gases , he says .
â€œIt does .
Itâ€ ™ s uncontroverted.â€
�
He actually gets a little applause for that talk , from this presumably Republican crowd .
Beer question !
Is it right to have one third of breweries in this country owned by one brewer ?
Is there a threat to competition in beer ?
Now thatâ€ ™ s a debate question .
The debate is happening in an arena named for Coors , which is brewed in nearby Golden at the worldâ€ ™ s very largest brewery .
Santorum says he travels far and wide and , believe him , thereâ€ ™ s a brewery in like every town .
No worries about keeping beer in the USA competitive , he says .
Whew .
Santorum argues that a failure to protect exports pushed Boeing partly to France .
Santorum seems on tonight ?
Heâ€
™ s speaking with energy and conviction about protecting American jobs .
Heâ€ ™ s not going too long , making arguments instead of speeches .
Looking to break 2 % in Iowa .
From Guardian US columnist Jeb Lund , live from Tampa :
Perhaps this doesnâ€ ™ t reflect that well on me , but I can think of no more fitting commentary on the Republican Kiddie Table Debate than the fact that I was washing dishes and cleaning the house on domestic autopilot and listening to my TV blaring CNN commentary about the main debate without realizing that there was an actual debate being broadcast at the time .
I mean , I DVRd it , but still .
Rick Santelli is up .
He asks Pataki : â€œHowâ€ ™ re you doing tonight?â€
�
Patakiâ€ ™ s good .
Santelli says interest rates should be higher for savers who rely on the growth of their deposits .
He ( Santelli ) is taking issue with the Fedâ€ ™ s hesitancy to raise interest rates .
Pataki does not really engage on the monetary policy question .
He does say the Fed screwed up .
Then : â€œNo question Barack Obama faced an economic disaster in 2009,â€ � Pataki said , but he made it worse with Obamacare .
Soundnibbles !
Indeed .
Itâ€ ™ s as if the moderators are afraid of letting the candidates speak .
Or maybe they just have an eye on the ratings , and realize that churn plays better than drone .
Or maybe this is just the bracing fast pace that money moves at .
Pew pew pew ...
Hereâ€ ™ s a question about paid family leave , and mandatory paid maternity leave .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not for the government mandating that , â€ � Jindal says .
â€œWe already have too many mandates out of DC ...
the government canâ€ ™ t wave a magic wand and make that happen.â€
�
He says that Obama has put the country â€œon the path to socialism.â€ �
He says economic growth will magically produce benefits like paid family leave .
Santorum blames immigration for keeping wages and economic participation rates low .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re bringing in people to compete against low - wage workers , â€ � Santorum says .
That of course is highly debatable .
Graham jumps in once again as the realist on immigration .
He says US companies need workers .
â€œIf you
canâ€ ™ t find an American worker after you advertise for a competitive wage , bring inâ€ � workers , Graham says .
Then everybody starts talking .
Pataki is waving his arms .
Heâ€ ™ s noticeably taller than Graham .
Quick wants him to end his speech .
Quintanilla takes the mic .
Graham has committed the heresies , in the context of the current Republican primary conversation , of saying climate change is real and supporting a path to citizenship for undocumented migrants .
Heâ€
™ s asked to defend himself .
â€œI think Iâ€ ™ m trying to solve problems , â€ � Graham says .
â€œI have been to the Antarctic , I have been to Alaska .
Iâ€ ™ m not a scientist , and I have the grades to prove it ...
[ but ] the greenhouse gas effect is real , that weâ€ ™ re heating up the planet .
I just want a solution that does not destroy the economy.â€ �
He also wants to win elections :
â€œIâ€ ™ m tired of losing!â€ � Graham says .
â€œGood god look who weâ€ ™ re running against.â€
�
The number one candidate [ claimed to be broke ] after eight years in the White House .
The number two guy went to the Soviet Union on his honeymoon , and I donâ€
™ t think he ever came back .
Laugh line , including among the moderators .
Pataki has a chance to defend Wall Street , as a former New York governor .
He does not .
â€œI think they have gone too far , â€ � he says .
â€œI think weâ€ ™ ve seen Wall Street blossom and do really well , while a lot of people are struggling.â€ �
He blames a corrupt relationship with Washington .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve cut taxes more than anybody on this stage , more than anybody on the next stage combined , â€ � he boasts .
Cramer invites Graham to indulge his darkest fantasies about geopolitical threats bearing down on Americaâ€ ™ s shores .
â€œThe foreign policy of Barack Obama needs to be
replacedâ€ �
and you canâ€
™ t do that by electing his secretary of state , Graham says .
Then he produces quite a moment , raising a fist and an open palm .
â€œTo the Chinese , when it comes to dealing with me , youâ€ ™ ve got a clenched fist and an open hand , and you choose which , â€ � Graham says .
â€œThe partyâ€ ™ s over .
Make me commander in chief and this crap stops!â€ �
Cramer asks Pataki whether we need a military response to cyber - warfare .
( The debate is back on .
This is not happening in some weird corner of the internet .
Itâ€ ™ s happening in a weird corner of national TV . )
Pataki hits out at Clinton for â€œputting an unsecure server ... as secretary of state , that without a doubt was hackedâ€ � by China and Russia .
Pataki says Clinton is disqualified .
The crowd whistles and cheers .
As the undercard debate began , Jeb Bush rolled out an endorsement from a former vice president , notes Ben Jacobs in Boulder .
The Bush campaign announced that George HW Bushâ€ ™ s vice president , Dan Quayle was backing the former Florida governor .
The endorsement drew some skepticism .
Quayle , who mounted an abortive bid for the White House in 2000 against George W Bush , was never regarded as one of the best and the brightest in American politics .
Perhaps his best known moment was in 1992 when he insisted to a grade school student that the word â€œpotatoâ€ � should be spelled â€œpotatoeâ€ � .
Well ... Is Hillary Clinton watching tonight ?
Sheâ€ ™ s playing with the Republicans on Twitter , at least : Commercial .
Do what you have to do around the house .
Jindal says itâ€ ™ s â€œdangerous times for Americaâ€ � because of the size of the debt , $ 18tn .
( The debt limit reset in March was $ 18.113tn . )
My colleague Jana Kasperkevic will be analysing the debate through a series of Vines tonight .
Here she highlights the wealth of the candidates in this undercard debate .
Pataki agrees with Graham on the current budget , saying it protects the military .
An air of comity prevails in Boulder .
Jindalâ€ ™ s tie is pink .
The backdrop to the stage is electric blue and rather aggressively branded with the CNBC logo .
Big moment for the little cable channel that could .
Santorum takes a question about his flat tax - he wants to tax every household income at an even 20 % .
He says the biggest problem is the breakdown of the American family .
He says his plan is pro - growth and pro - family .
He doesnâ€ ™ t get into how throwing out the graduated tax system is more pro - family than a flat tax .
Quick asks about debt limits .
Would you blow through the debt ceiling in order to resist passing a disagreeable budget , like the one before Congress now ?
Jindal says itâ€ ™ s a false choice because the government could cut spending and not keep running through the ceiling .
He says something about â€œturning the American dream into a European nightmare , â€ � with reference to unemployment and growth rates .
Harwood swipes the spotlight .
He asks Graham whether he would vote for a budget deal agreed to Monday night .
Graham ignores the question .
â€œIâ€ ™
ll tell you what is real , â€ � he says .
â€œThe threat to our homeland.â€ �
Heâ€ ™ ll vote for the budget , he says , because it puts â€œ$40bn back in the defense department at a time we need
it.â€
�
Harwood has the first Q. Itâ€ ™ s not about $ $ at all .
Itâ€ ™ s about how popular outsider candidacies are this year and asks Jindal , the Louisiana governor , how he fits the bill .
Jindal says he will chop government , which is the most outsider - y thing of all .
Santorum says that he was a force for reform during his two senate terms .
Pataki , the thrice - elected governor , says Washington needs and outsider but
â€œyou canâ€
™ t just be an outsider.â€
�
Graham says thanks for having him and asks the audience to applaud itself .
He says the only way he could have gotten into UC - Boulder was to be invited to the presidential debate .
Hard to tell whether they laughed .
Then he zooms to the end of his statement about national security threats being real .
The event begins .
Becky Quick introduces the show .
Candidates get 30 seconds per question and the same for rebuttals , she explains .
Quintanilla is on her right , your left .
Harwoodâ€ ™ s on the other side .
Oh pity .
Theyâ€ ™ re making them stand there behind their lecterns without , for the moment , asking them anything .
Itâ€ ™ s a silent debate .
Aaand now theyâ€ ™ ve gone to commercial .
Well , Marco Rubio made a joke on YouTube today .
Did you see it ?
Timeâ€ ™ s up for preliminary niceties .
The four bonus candidates have taken the stage .
Bobby , Rick , George and Lindsey .
Letâ€ ™ s listen to what these guys have to say .
Is Donald Trump in trouble ?
In advance of the debate , he was already complaining about an â€œunfairâ€ � fight
The essence of his beef was that CNBC has been broadcasting the same poll everyone else has picked up on this week , which for the first time since July showed Trump trailing Ben Carson in the nominating race .
It was a solid poll , commissioned by CBS News /New
York Times and conducted over the telephone by people , as opposed to through robo - calling or over the Internet , which latter techniques are considered less effective .
The poll found Carson ahead of Trump 26 - 22 .
Trump would rather have America look at a poll published just today , by YouGov/ The Economist and conducted over the Internet , which shows him ahead of Carson 32 - 18 .
Hosting tonightâ€ ™ s event is the cable channel CNBC , which has wrangled three moderators and three sideline questioners for the job .
Theyâ€ ™ re calling it â€œThe Republican Presidential Debate : Your Money , Your Vote.â€ �
The moderators are Becky Quick , John Harwood and Carl Quintanilla .
The questioners are Jim Cramer , Sharon Epperson and Rick Santelli .
Harwood comes into the event with already one debate scalp tacked to his wall .
Remember Texas Governor Rick Perryâ€ ™ s big â€œoopsâ€ � in 2012 ?
That was thanks to Harwood :
But Santelli may be the real star of the evening :
heâ€ ™ s credited with giving rise â€ “ and giving a name â€ “ to one of the most influential forces in conservative politics in the last 50 years .
A Santelli rant on the floor of the Chicago stock exchange in 2009 about bailing out bad mortgages captured the outrage many Americans felt over what they considered to be bad fiscal habits in Washington and a national malady of spending beyond oneâ€ ™ s means .
Behold , how the Tea Party , in part , was born :
Hello ! and welcome to our coverage of the third Republican presidential debate .
Tonight , itâ€ ™ s all about money .
Money :
whatâ€ ™ s more important to you ?
Whatâ€ ™ s more important to anyone ?
Nothing , and yet too often the national political conversation burbles along with no real discussion of the policies that matter most for your bottom line : taxes , debt , pensions , trade , healthcare and capital - G Growth .
The 14 remaining Republican candidates are going to tear into those questions tonight with their teeth , in what should be at the very least an impressive competition to see who can make the most wildly impossible promises about lowering taxes while protecting the entitlements programs voters hold most dear .
On the off chance that those $ $ topics leave you cold , consider this : tonight may present one of the rare moments when Donald Trump will not be the loudest person in the room .
Hosting the debate this evening will be no fewer than six television personalities from the cable financial news channel CNBC , whose programs go by names like Squawk on the Street and Squawk Alley and Squawk Box .
Itâ€ ™ s a great channel !
Here are the candidates taking part in the main debate , which starts at 8 pm ET : Jeb Bush , former governor of Florida Ben Carson , retired neurosurgeon Chris Christie , governor of New Jersey Ted Cruz , US senator from Texas Carly Fiorina , former CEO of Hewlett - Packard Mike Huckabee , former governor of Arkansas and media personality John Kasich , governor of Ohio Rand Paul , US senator from Kentucky Marco Rubio , US senator from Florida Donald Trump , real estate developer and reality show star
As with the three prior Republican debates , tonightâ€ ™ s main event , which starts at 8 pm ET , will be preceded by a junior varsity debate comprising the four candidates who are polling least well .
The venue is named after a beer synonymous with Colorado , if you hate Colorado : the Coors Events Center at the University of Colorado - Boulder .
The JV debate is scheduled to start soon , at 6 pm ET .
Participating in the warm - up will be :
Former senator Rick Santorum Former New York governor George Pataki Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham Settle in now for a night of bling , zing and cha - cha - cha ching .

2015-10-29,"Moments into the third Republican presidential debate on Wednesday , a confrontation that had been brimming for months finally unfolded before millions of TV viewers : Jeb Bush â€ “ son of president George HW , brother of president George W â€ “ turned to his former protege Marco Rubio and attacked .
While outsider candidates such as Donald Trump and Ben Carson have so far stolen the limelight in the Republican race , political pundits have long considered former Florida governor Bush and Rubio , the young senator from the same state , more formidable opponents for probable Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and thus much more likely to face her in next Novemberâ€ ™ s election .
At the debate , Bush at last seized on an opportunity to strike Rubio , attempting to make hay from his habit of missing Senate votes while campaigning for president .
â€œMarco , when you signed up for this , this was a six - year term , and you should be showing up to work , â€ � said Bush .
â€œI mean , literally , the Senate â€ “ what is it , like a French work week ?
You get , like , three days where you have to show up ?
You can campaign , or just resign and let someone else take the job.â€ � Bush , who is 18 years Rubioâ€ ™ s senior , resembled a teacher admonishing one of his pupils â€ “ but the student seemed to have become the master .
Rubio deftly batted away the charge , painting Bush as hypocritical and politically motivated without actually hurling any insults at his former mentor .
â€œI donâ€
™ t remember you ever complaining about John McCainâ€ ™ s vote record , â€ � said Rubio , referring to recent comments by Bush likening himself to the 2008 Republican presidential nominee , who also missed Senate votes .
â€œThe only reason why youâ€ ™ re doing it now is because weâ€ ™ re running for the same position , â€ � Rubio said , as the audience began to roar , â€œand someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you .
My campaign is going to be about the future of America , itâ€ ™ s not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.â€
�
In just 60 seconds , the move the Bush campaign had been openly plotting for weeks failed in dramatic fashion and the candidate they had labelled a â€œGOP Obamaâ€ � looked like a young and charismatic insurgent who could run away with the nomination .
For Rubio , 44 , the comparisons to Barack Obama have almost become a stereotype .
But although Bushâ€ ™ s attack was meant to highlight the senatorâ€ ™ s relative inexperience , Rubio is happy to embrace the mantle of a fresh - faced candidate of the future who , unlike his former Florida ally , was neither born into wealth nor to a political dynasty .
Rubio has centered much of his candidacy on his personal story , invoking his humble beginnings as the son of a bartender and a maid to make an optimistic case about restoring the American dream .
As the son of Cuban immigrants , he is also perceived by Republicans as well positioned to broaden their tent among Latino voters â€ “ a demographic whose distrust of the party has contributed to crushing defeats in recent presidential elections .
Rubio has used both themes to great effect from the debate stage this year , and Wednesday night in Boulder , Colorado , was no different .
The senator shone in no insignificant way due to his ability to parry any perceived liability into a positive line from his stump speech .
When Bush went after his Senate attendance , Rubio reminded the audience , as he often does voters , that his campaign is designed not to take down fellow Republicans but to defeat Clinton , the Democratic presidential frontrunner .
When he was questioned about his prior financial troubles while serving in the Florida state legislature , Rubio cast himself as someone who , like most Americans , has struggled with money and thus understands the impact of a sluggish economic recovery .
Rubio peppered his answers with jabs at two of conservativesâ€ ™ favorite targets : Clinton and the media .
Democrats have said this is what makes him so dangerous
â€ “
he is relentlessly on message and knows how to sell even the most traditional of Republican policies as new and innovative .
Whether Rubioâ€ ™ s performance on Wednesday would dramatically lift his campaign , which has been on a slow and steady upward trajectory , remains to be seen .
He received similarly glowing media attention after the first two presidential debates , but this has yet to prompt a mass exodus of establishment donors away from Bush and over to Rubio .
But increasingly anxious backers of Bush did not get the reassurances they were hoping for from the former Florida governor in Wednesdayâ€ ™ s debate , and Rubioâ€ ™ s aides did not shy away from telling reporters they had received some calls from Bush donors .
By Thursday , Rubioâ€ ™ s backers in Florida had already scheduled a fundraiser in Miami Beach with an eye on the jittery supporters of his home state rival .
A fundraising boost would help Rubio increase his presence in the early - voting states , where his campaignâ€ ™ s light footprint on the ground has raised questions over whether he can remain competitive in a national election .
Rubioâ€ ™ s aides have repeatedly sought to manage expectations and continued to do so even as the accolades poured in after the debate .
â€œWe have a long way to go and a lot of work to do , â€ � Rubioâ€ ™ s spokesman , Alex Conant , said .
Arguably not as much as Bush , however , who came into the race with a war chest of nearly $ 100 m and soaring expectations .
The once - presumed frontrunner downplayed reports of his demise the day after the debate .
â€œI knew this would be a long journey , but to suggest that the campaign is terminal , come on .
Thatâ€ ™ s pretty funny
, â€ � Bush told Fox News on Thursday .
Vowing to win the nomination â€œthe traditional wayâ€ � , he embarked on Thursday on a swing through the early - voting state of New Hampshire in the hopes of resurrecting his beleaguered campaign .
At Bushâ€ ™ s first event in Portsmouth , his supporters also dismissed the notion that the end of days for the former governor was near , even as they conceded they were confounded by the state of the race .
Randy and Susan Shasteen , from Key Largo , Florida , but traveling on holiday , said it was â€œtoo early to give upâ€ � and felt Bush had been too polite in his exchange with Rubio .
â€œJeb was right , but Jebâ€ ™ s too nice and heâ€ ™ s not going to hit back and say , â€˜Marco , you need to do the right thing and not collect $ 179,000 a year and not represent the people , â€ ™ â€ � said Susan .
â€˜â€œI agree with Jeb and I cheered that.â€ �
Privately , several of Bushâ€ ™ s financial backers couldnâ€ ™ t disagree more and were somewhat perplexed by his decision to pick a fight with Rubio , when they viewed the bombastic real - estate mogul Trump as the obstacle standing in Bushâ€ ™ s way to the nomination .
Frank Luntz , a Republican pollster who conducts focus groups during each debate , said the exchange allowed Rubio to benefit tremendously on a night that was â€œtoo muddy to have a clear winnerâ€ � .
â€œHe was given a gift by Jeb Bush and made the most of it , â€ � Luntz said .
â€œBush jumped him .
And not only did Rubio survive , he thrived.â€ �
Bush rejected the premise that he had made a mistake and even stood by his line of attack the following day .
â€œIf you worked at a company and decided not to show up youâ€ ™
d have a deduction in your pay , wouldnâ€ ™ t
you?â€ �
he told reporters after his campaign event in New Hampshire .
â€œI do think people ought to show up to work.â€ �
The Bush campaignâ€ ™ s immediate reaction also signaled they were just getting started .
â€œI think Marco Rubio is an outstanding performer .
We knew that going in , we know that coming out , â€ � said Bushâ€ ™ s campaign manager , Danny Diaz .
â€œThe reality is that he doesnâ€ ™ t have a record of accomplishment .
The reality is that he hasnâ€ ™ t demonstrated that he is qualified to be president .
â€œThatâ€
™ s the terrain where this is going to be fought .
We look forward to that conversation , not just with Marco , but with other candidates.â€ � The collision course of the one - time allies was always inevitable and could define the coming months of a scattered and unpredictable Republican primary .
But as Bush might contemplate retooling his own strategy , Rubio sees no reason to adapt his own .
During a round of media appearances the morning after the debate , the senator refused to take the bait when asked about his high - profile encounter with Bush .
â€œI still have tremendous admiration for him both as a person and what he did as governor of Florida and Iâ€ ™ m not going to talk bad about Governor Bush , â€ ™ â€ ™ Rubio told NBCâ€ ™ s Today show .
â€œMy campaign is not about him .
Iâ€ ™ m not running against him or against anyone else.â€ �
How long Rubio can maintain the sunny demeanor that has personified his candidacy thus far is unclear .
But for now , at least , his campaign appears content to rely on a simple adage : â€œIf it ainâ€
™ t broke , donâ€ ™ t fix
it.â€

2015-10-29,"The third Republican debate is over .
Hereâ€ ™ s what we learned : There were tricky questions for Marco Rubio , the senator from Florida , about missing a lot of votes in Congress , for Ted Cruz , the senator from Texas , about his contrarianism ... and one about fantasy football that Chris Christie , the governor of New Jersey , spiked in the end zone .
â€œWe are $ 19tn in debt , we have Isis and al - Qaida attacking us , and weâ€ ™ re talking about fantasy football?â€ �
he exclaimed .
Cruz got cheers for attacking the media , successfully turning the crowd against the moderators by saying the quality of the questions was â€œwhy the American people donâ€
™ t trust the mediaâ€ � .
The moderatorsâ€ ™ performance was also decried afterward by Reince Priebus , the national Republican chairman , on Twitter .
The crowd booed one moderator for pressing Ben Carson , the retired pediatric neurosurgeon , on whether his appearance on the website of a company later accused of false advertising did not reflect badly on his judgment .
Carson said he had nothing to do with the company .
It emerged through fact - checking , however , that Carson had in fact performed in a video for the company .
The episode was representative of an uneven night for the doctor .
Rubio repeatedly turned tricky questions into strong applause lines .
Pressed on having to liquidate a retirement fund even after a $ 1 m book deal , Rubio quipped : â€œAnd I used it to pay off my loans .
And itâ€ ™ s available in paperback!â€ �
Jeb Bush stumbled in trying to attack Rubio for not showing up for work in the Senate , and reverted to flat stump speech - talk when he got a chance to talk about his economic plan .
Donald Trump , the erstwhile frontrunner , turned in an uncharacteristically short - winded performance , denied ever having made a criticism of Rubio that was printed on his website and used his closing statement to brag about having held the debate to two hours instead of three .
Everyone from the audience to the moderators to the candidates to the online audience seemed thankful to Trump for that .
The other four candidates â€ “ former tech CEO Carly Fiorina , Ohio governor John Kasich , Senator Rand Paul and former governor Mike Huckabee â€ “ seemed to hold their places without breaking through .
The possible exception was Kasich , who had a couple of persuasive moments of exasperation at the â€œfantasyâ€ � plans for entitlements and immigration presented by his rivals ."
2015-10-29,"SacrÃ © bleu , Jeb Bush is having a bad week !
Not only did the presidential candidate have a disappointing showing in Wednesdayâ€ ™ s Republican debate , he has also managed to upset people who can not even vote for him â€ “ the French .
While taking a jab at Florida senator Marco Rubio for missing Senate votes due to being on the campaign trail , Bush made a reference to the â€œFrench work weekâ€
� .
â€œYou should be showing up to work .
I mean , literally , the Senate , what is it , like a French work week ?
You get like three days where you have to show up ?
You can campaign .
Or just resign .
Let someone else take the job , â€ � he said .
Bush said Rubio knew this was a six - year term when he ran for senator and that his constituents , including Bush , are looking for someone who will fight for them .
The campaign also promoted the soundbite on Twitter , sharing a short video footage of the exchange and tweeting :
â€œFrench Work Week vs
Real Accomplishmentsâ€ � .
The French were not impressed .
GÃ © rard Araud , French ambassador to the US , pushed back on Twitter .
â€œThe French work an average of 39.6 hours a week compared to 39.2 for the Germans , â€ � he said .
â€œA French work week of 3 days ?
No , but a pregnancy paid leave of 16 weeks yes !
And proud of it , â€ � he tweeted later .
Hours after the debate , a French newspaper the Local ran a piece with the headline , â€œWhite House race stoops to French bashing ,
againâ€ � .
â€œThe reality is most French people work more than 35 hours each week but the clichÃ © has stubbornly remained on the other side of the Atlantic , â€ � asserted the paper before pointing out that this is not the first time that linking a candidate to France was used as an attack or an insult .
In 2012 , an ad called The French Connection produced by the Newt Gingrich campaign attacked Mitt Romney for speaking French .
Another paper , LibÃ © ration , pointed out that Eurostat figures show full - time workers in France putting in an average of 40.7 hours per week .
The confusion about the French work week stems from the countryâ€ ™ s overtime policies .
The 35-hour mark is â€œsimply a threshold above which overtime or rest days start to kick in , â€ �
French economist Jean - Marie Perbost told BBC last year .
He also pointed out that more than half the population work overtime .
â€œNot too concerned about attacks from the French media , â€ � Bushâ€ ™ s communications director , Tim Miller , told CNNMoney when asked about the response . â€œJebâ€
™ s working far more than 40 hours a week.â€ � Miller also retweeted the following tweet and vine from Independent Journal reporter Kelsey Rupp .
The campaign was not the only one to dismiss the remark .
When Laura Haim , reporter for French TV channel Canal+ , asked the White House press secretary , Josh Earnest , what the president thought of the comment , Earnest joked : â€œI hope you didnâ€
™ t take that personally , Laura .
I can vouch for the fact that you certainly work more than most members of Congress.â€ �
Haim pressed on , pointing to Ambassador Araudâ€ ™ s comments and asking what Obama thought of the French quality of life .
â€œOh
, you guys are so sensitive .
Iâ€ ™ ll bet you that Governor Bush is just jealous , â€ � said Earnest .
Later , he added : â€œIt certainly seems to be a quality of life that many French people have warmly embraced , as they should.â€ �"
2015-10-29,"Republican presidential candidates turned fire on the media on Wednesday as their economic policies were put under the spotlight in an acrimonious but revealing presidential debate in Colorado .
Tough questioning from CNBC moderators , who pressed the candidates over the viability of their tax plans , prompted Marco Rubio , Ted Cruz , Donald Trump , Ben Carson and others to unite against the television network , attacking them for bias .
â€œDo
you want to answer , or do you want me to answer?â€ � demanded governor Chris Christie , who was among the most vocal in taking on CNBC .
â€œEven in New Jersey what you are doing is called rude.â€ �
But the intense focus on the unconventional policies of outsiders â€ “ and current frontrunners
â€
“ Trump and Carson appeared to bolster the hopes of more moderate candidates , particularly Rubio , who used the debate to reinforce his claim to be a strong compromise candidate .
Rubio upstaged his former mentor Jeb Bush , who desperately needed a strong performance to rescue his plummeting poll numbers and restore flagging confidence among donors .
Instead , a clash between Bush , the former governor of Florida , and Rubio , the stateâ€ ™ s senator , was among the most memorable moments of the the night .
The pair , once close allies , are now battling over the same home turf , both a rich vein for donors and a key swing state .
When CNBC moderators brought up a stinging editorial in Floridaâ€ ™ s Sun Sentinel newspaper that pointed out Rubio had missed more votes than any other senator , and should consider resigning , Bush pounced .
â€œMarco , when you signed up for this , this was a six - year term , and you should be showing up to work , â€ � said Bush .
â€œI mean , literally the Senate , what is it , like a French work week ?
You get like three days where you have to show up?â€ �
But the younger rival managed to turn difficult questions into an opportunity to boast of his humble background and promise of change .
â€œI am not running against Governor Bush I am running for president , â€ � responded Rubio , who appeared among the most polished of the 10 candidates in the main debate .
Turning to his former mentor , Rubio added : â€œSomeone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you .
Itâ€ ™ s not.â€
�
However , it was Rubio and some other candidatesâ€ ™ concerted pushback at the TV moderators , whom they accused of liberal bias , that proved to be the biggest talking point after the debate .
Trump , who has for months been the frontrunner in an average of national polls of Republicans , accused TV executives of seeking to profit from overly long debates and blasted what he claimed were â€œnasty and ridiculousâ€ � questions .
Carson , who is gaining ground on Trump , particularly in the first - in - the nation primary state of Iowa , received vocal support from the crowd after he was questioned on his links to a disgraced pharmaceutical company .
He concluded his appearance by thanking fellow panellists â€œfor not falling for the trapsâ€ � .
â€œThe questions that have been asked so far on this debate illustrate why the American people donâ€ ™ t trust the media , â€ � claimed Cruz in comments that brought some of the biggest cheers of the night from the Colorado crowd .
The Texas senator even went so far as to stand up for several rival candidates , defending them against CNBCâ€ ™ s moderators .
Reince Priebus , the chairman of the Republican National Committee , which organises the debates in coordination with TV networks , reacted angrily to the line of questioning .
â€œWhile
I was proud of our candidates and the way they handled
tonightâ€
™ s debate , the performance by the CNBC moderators was extremely disappointing and did a disservice to their network , our candidates , and voters ,
â€ �
he said in a statement .
â€œCNBC should be ashamed of how this debate was handled.â€
�
The aggressive scrutiny was welcomed by Democrats , who used the opportunity of the debate to send out a fundraising email to supporters .
â€œI had chills watching the debate tonight â€ “ and not in a good way , â€ � wrote the Democratic National Committeeâ€ ™ s chair , Debbie Wasserman Schultz .
â€œWe canâ€ ™ t let a single one of them get close to the White House.â€
�
The forensic questioning also laid bare some of the unconventional policies and claims made by candidates , particularly Carson and Trump .
The latter faced an especially embarrassing moment when CNBC moderator Becky Quick asked the real estate mogul about his claim that Rubio was Facebook founder Mark Zuckerbergâ€ ™ s â€œpersonal senatorâ€ � .
Trump disputed ever having made the statement â€ “ and claimed to be unaware where Quick could have found such erroneous information .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œYou people write this stuff.â€
�
As Quick pointed out 20 minutes later , it came from the immigration policy paper on Trumpâ€ ™ s own website .
Despite the heat , there was also substantially more light than in previous debates as candidates were held to account over what many economists view as extreme tax and spending policies as well as conflicting promises on social security .
â€œFolks , we got ta wake up , â€ � said Ohio governor John Kasich in an opening exchange which hinted at a concerted establishment fight - back against the outsiders .
â€œWe can not elect someone who doesnâ€ ™ t know how to do the job.â€ �
The veiled attack on Trump produced a typically robust response from the billionaire TV celebrity , who said Kasichâ€ ™ s poll numbers had tanked .
â€œThatâ€
™ s why heâ€ ™ s on the end [ of the stage],â€ �
Trump said .
â€œAnd then he got nasty.â€ �
CNBC business journalist John Harwood further rattled Trump by asking if his fiscal policy amounted to a â€œcomic - book way to run a presidential campaignâ€ � .
But the difficult questioning was not limited to the so - called â€œoutsiderâ€ � candidates who have never held public office .
Rubio , for example , was asked : â€œDo you have the maturity and the wisdom to lead a $ 17tn economy?â€
�
He responded by accusing the mainstream media of favouring Democrats and failing to hold Hillary Clinton to account in their coverage of the Benghazi hearings .
â€œDemocrats have the ultimate Super Pac , itâ€ ™ s called the mainstream media , â€ � he said .
Danny Diaz , Bushâ€ ™ s campaign manager , later tried to push back on the narrative that Rubio had gotten the better of his candidate .
â€œI think Marco Rubio is an outstanding performer .
We knew that going in , we know
that coming out , â€ � he said .
â€œThe reality is that he doesnâ€ ™ t have a record of accomplishment .
The reality is that he hasnâ€ ™ t demonstrated that he is qualified to be president.â€ �
Meanwhile , Trump , predictably , heralded himself the victor .
â€œI think I did very well according to all the online polls , â€ � he said afterwards .
â€œI got 80 % as a win and hundreds of thousands of people are sending their numbers in and according to every single poll
thatâ€ ™ s a win.â€ �
His wife , Melania , accompanying him for the first time on the trail , said her husband had been â€œfantasticâ€ � .
While Bush and other stragglers such as Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee failed to make much impression on the debate , the third Republican TV showdown revealed how wide open its primary race remains compared with a Democratic race increasingly dominated by Clinton ."
2015-10-30,"A leaked campaign playbook for Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush has revealed a strategy that counts on denigrating rival Marco Rubio and calming donors about their beleaguered candidateâ€ ™ s weak performance on the trail .
â€œMarco is a GOP Obamaâ€ � and the â€œpress obsessionâ€
� with the debates does not matter , Bush donors were told by the campaign in a PowerPoint presentation leaked to some outlets and a 112-page file acquired in full by the website US News and World Report .
Bush , the former governor of Florida , once treated Rubio , currently senator for the state , as his greatest disciple , shepherding the younger manâ€ ™ s ascent through Florida politics and forming a close friendship with him , even passing him a ceremonial sword when Rubio was sworn in as speaker of the Florida house of representatives .
But the mutual admiration has been replaced by an acrimony that was exposed on national TV during Wednesdayâ€ ™ s Republican debate , when the men sniped at each other over politics .
Three slides are devoted entirely to disparaging Rubio , beginning with the title : â€œMarco is a risky bet.â€ �
One slide alludes to apparent skeletons found in Rubioâ€ ™ s closet , saying : â€œThose who have looked into Marcoâ€ ™ s background in the past have been concerned with what they found there.â€ �
A Bush aide told US News that the line refers to something found by the team of 2012 nominee Mitt Romney when they vetted Rubio for vice - president , but the former Romney adviser Beth Myers denied any such concerns .
â€œAs
the person who handled the VP vetting for the Romney campaign , I saw all the vetting documents , â€ � Myers said .
â€œSenator Rubio â€˜passedâ€ ™ our vetting process , and nothing we found would have disqualified him from serving as VP.â€
�
The presentation goes to great lengths to downplay the former Florida governorâ€ ™ s steady descent in the polls , where he has fallen into single digits behind Donald Trump , Ben Carson and Rubio .
Bushâ€ ™ s aides tried to reassure donors that reports of his â€œdeath spiralâ€ � campaign were overblown in this early stage of the race , and compared the primary election to previous cycles , when ultra - conservative Rick Santorum and pizza mogul Herman Cain led the polls .
In 2012 , Romney , the eventual Republican nominee , came in a close second in the Iowa caucuses to Santorum , behind by only 34 votes .
Bushâ€ ™ s aides even suggested that voters flit between choices because they suffer from attention deficit disorder , writing that the â€œrace will remain fluid for some time because â€ ¦ voters have ADDâ€ � .
Backlash to a similarly belittling comment posted to Trumpâ€ ™ s Twitter account forced the billionaire to make the approximation of an apology .
He blamed a â€œyoung internâ€ � for the tweet , which suggested Iowa voters have â€œissues in the brainâ€ � .
The presentation promised that Bush would outlast the â€œcarousel of frontrunnersâ€ � , even though his status as presumptive nominee has faded during his campaign struggles .
In Iowa for instance , staffers have made 70,000 phone calls but identified only 1,281 known supporters .
The presentation makes clear that Bush does not fear Trump and Carson , the current frontrunners , nearly as much as he worries Rubio will steal his supporters and eventually the partyâ€ ™ s nomination .
Other slides accuse the Florida senator of inexperience , saying â€œoutside of lobbying and legal consulting , no credible experience beyond governmentâ€ � , and â€œnever been in charge of anything larger than two dozen peopleâ€ � .
Bushâ€ ™ s campaign also says Rubio is guilty of â€œmisuse of state party credit cards , taxpayer funds , and ties to scandal - tarred former Congressman David Rivera.â€ �
While working in the Florida state house , Rubio charged grocery bills , car repairs and liquor store purchases to the party .
In 2005 , he bought a house with Rivera , a state lawmaker charged with numerous ethics violations .
During Wednesdayâ€ ™ s presidential debate , Rubio deflected a question about his finances by saying it amounted to a â€œlitany of discredited attacksâ€
�
â€ “ a departure from his memoir , when he confessed a â€œlack of bookkeeping
skillsâ€ � .
â€œI
didnâ€ ™ t inherit any money , â€ �
Rubio said at the Republican debate .
â€œI had to save money to go to school , I had to borrow money to go to school.â€ �
During the debate , Bush attempted to use Rubioâ€ ™ s record against him , criticizing the younger man for having the worst voting record in the Senate : â€œYou get , like , three days where you have to show up ?
You can campaign , or just resign and let someone else take the job.â€ � Rubio turned the attack against Bush , who was seen as his mentor while both worked in Florida .
â€œSomeone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you , â€ �
he told Bush .
â€œMy campaign is going to be about the future of America , itâ€ ™ s not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.â€
�
A third slide frames Rubio as anathema to conservatives : a senator with too much in common with Barack Obama to make Republicans comfortable .
â€œRubio and President Obama have strikingly similar profiles , â€ � the slide reads , saying they â€œhad few legislative accomplishments and havenâ€ ™ t shown much interest in the process of advancing legislation and getting resultsâ€ � .
The Rubio campaign did not respond to requests for comment .
The personal attacks against Rubio , the only Republican candidate highlighted this way , are nestled among pages of internal polling data , advertising plans and talking points to spin .
Aides searched for silver linings in details like how â€œ48 % of those currently not voting for Bush say they â€˜could support him for presidentâ€ ™ ,â€ � and told donors that the real push would begin next year with a nearly $ 11 m advertising plan .
Bush apparently also intends to woo young people and minority groups , typically not conservative voters .
The presentation includes an ad called â€œDenishaâ€ � , about a black student who used Bushâ€ ™ s voucher school program , and a â€œJeb TVâ€ � audio segment titled â€œ#JebNoFilter : Sharknado 3â€ � , a reference to the comedy - horror film franchise about sharks cast flying on to land by strong winds .

2015-10-31,"In the heart of socially conservative northwestern Iowa , Marco Rubio is maintaining his momentum .
On Wednesday night , the Florida senator shone in the third Republican debate .
On Friday night , evangelicals who have previously backed the likes of Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee expressed openness towards the Florida senator too .
The North West Iowa Republican Rally is held jointly by six county Republican parties in Orange City , Iowa , a Dutch - American enclave where the GOP regularly picks up more than 80 % of the vote .
Rubio , with his career alongside Democrats in the US Senate and relatively nuanced positions on issues such as immigration , was not a natural fit for such a social conservative audience .
He received a standing ovation .
After he spoke , Rubio was swarmed by reporters who had waited half an hour just to get three minutes with the new political star .
Back in the room , however , attendees sat patiently .
They then gave standing ovations to Carly Fiorina and Chris Christie .
Santorum received one as well .
Nearly a thousand people packed into the basketball gym at Northwestern College , an educational institution so explicitly Christian that , in its logo , the first letter T is seen as a cross .
Among this crowd , Donald Trump was an afterthought .
The other outsider candidate at the top of the polls , Ben Carson , was the favorite .
Old voters and young were excited about the retired neurosurgeon .
Barbara Grady liked Carson , she said , as someone willing to follow the constitution .
Her husband , Arv , leaned more towards the Texas senator Ted Cruz â€ “ for the same reasons .
According to Lincoln Morris and Joseph Tolsma , two students with a group called Young Evangelicals for Climate Action â€ “ which aims to draw attention to the issue from a Christian perspective â€ “ Carson had â€œa huge followingâ€ � on campus .
Yet the support for Carson was soft .
No one was willing to commit to caucusing for him in February .
Instead , they said liked him , that he may even have been their favorite â€ ¦ but they were keeping an open mind .
And they were very interested in listening to Rubio too .
Among Fridayâ€ ™ s crowd , there wasnâ€ ™ t any particular reason given for such hesitation about committing to Carson .
Some , like Tom Farnsworth , a county supervisor in nearby Oâ€ ™ Brien County , went so far as to worry that he was a little too soft - spoken .
( Farnsworth insisted , however , that he really liked him . )
In fact , in this rather godly crowd , it was difficult to find anyone willing to say a bad word about anyone .
Marv Wynia , a farmer from outside Sioux Center , said his hesitation about Rubio lay only in the fact the Florida senator â€œappeared too youngâ€ � .
He too leaned towards Carson , he said , whom he liked for his contemplative and â€œlaid
backâ€ � manner .
There was lingering support for Santorum , too , but also worry over whether he could possibly win .
Frank Bulk of Sioux Center said that while Santorum resonated the most with him , he worried if he could appeal as successfully to the rest of the country .
Despite winning the Iowa caucuses in 2012 , Santorum has yet to crack the top 10 in national polls and has thus not appeared in a prime - time debate .
A handful of folks were more enthusiastic about Rubio .
Pete Wagner , the owner of the Nâ€ ™ West Iowa Review , the local weekly paper , said he had long had his eye on him .
He was one of many attendees who shared a deep skepticism of Trump , whom he viewed as a â€œself - promoterâ€ � â€ “ although few were willing so explicitly to say so .
One attendee , looking to find positives about Trump , insisted to the Guardian that he was â€œhigh energyâ€ � , and that was a good thing .
The typical attendee probably was someone like Darrell Hoekstra , a middle - aged and mustachioed man from Alton .
He said he had missed the CNBC debate because he didnâ€ ™ t have cable television and was still trying to pick from a field of what he thought were all good candidates .
Hoekstra said he â€œreally appreciated anyone with strong stands on pro - life and pro - family issuesâ€ � .
It was clear that on such issues Hoekstra and others liked Rubio .
But in nice north - western Iowa , they liked everyone else as well ."
2015-10-31,"Marco Rubio has gained the backing of Republican mega - donor Paul Singer in a major boost for the Florida senatorâ€ ™ s presidential campaign .
The endorsement comes two days after Rubio was widely praised in the third Republican presidential debate , a night that pitted him against his former Florida ally Jeb Bush .
Singerâ€ ™ s decision to support Rubio is a heavy blow to Bush .
The former Florida governor has thus far led the money race among Republican presidential contenders , but had a crushing night on the debate stage that prompted questions about how long his campaign will last .
Rubio welcomed the news on Friday evening , saying he was â€œgratefulâ€ � to have the help of someone like Singer who is â€œsuccessful at raising moneyâ€ � .
â€œIâ€ ™ m grateful that when people donate to us they buy into our agenda , and Iâ€ ™ m glad that he has and it will help us with resources , â€ � Rubio told reporters after a campaign event in Orange City , Iowa .
â€œBut you know , resources alone are not enough .
You have to have the right ideas and the right principles and convince people that youâ€ ™ re the right person for the job .
But weâ€ ™ re grateful to have his help obviously.â€ � Singer , a billionaire hedge fund manager from New York , praised Rubio in a letter to other donors on Friday first reported by the New York Times .
Dubbing Rubio as â€œthe best explainer of conservatism in public life todayâ€ � , Singer said the senator â€œcan appeal to both the head and the heartâ€ � .
Singer , a staunch supporter of Israel , also praised Rubio as someone â€œaccustomed to thinking about American foreign policy as a responsible policy makerâ€ � .
Foreign policy has been a central tenet of Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign and he has used his role on the Senate foreign relations committee to elevate his positions on issues like the Iran nuclear deal and US - Cuba relations .
Rubioâ€ ™ s foreign policy hawkishness has also closely positioned him to sealing the financial backing of Sheldon Adelson , the billionaire casino magnate who has in the past donated tens of millions to Republican candidates .
Such endorsements are especially critical for Rubio â€ “ his whose fundraising haul in the third quarter was underwhelming but this weekâ€ ™ s debate was a potential breakout moment .
Rubio succeeded in part by swatting away criticism from Bush , who is struggling to resurrect a campaign that has confounded even the most experienced Republican hands .
Singer had until now remained neutral and his move into Rubioâ€ ™ s corner is not only an indication of the debateâ€ ™ s impact but also a sign of things to come .
Singer could pour millions into outside groups backing Rubio but , more importantly , he is a reputable bundler in Republican circles who could help sway anxious donors away from Bush .
Although aides to Rubio have said they donâ€ ™ t expect defections to happen overnight , the debate provided a prime opportunity to court increasingly wary backers of Bush who are looking to bet on a winning horse .
Rubio looked the part on Friday evening , receiving a friendly reaction in a bastion of social conservatism in Iowa where Republicans typically receive 90 % of the vote in a general election .
He started the event with a joke about the CNBC debate , asking : â€œIs this microphone on ?
I thought CNBC was running this microphone , â€ � amid a high - profile clash between the network and the Republican party over what several campaigns complained
were biased proceedings on the part of the moderators .
Rubio went on to deliver his usual stump speech , sharing his life story as the son of immigrant parents and doling out fierce criticism of the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s foreign policy .
He received a standing ovation at the conclusion of his speech .
During his remarks , Rubio also took a rather veiled shot at Bush by noting : â€œWe need people with a sense of energy.â€ � Bush has been labeled as â€œlow energyâ€ � during the Republican primary by the real estate mogul and current frontrunner Donald Trump .
Still , Rubio declined to take shots at his fellow Floridian when pressed repeatedly by reporters on the aggressive nature of the Bush campaignâ€ ™ s attacks on him .
A leaked memo on Thursday detailed the lengths of Team Jebâ€ ™ s strategy against Rubio , including plans to go after his previous issues with finances and closeness to certain billionaire donors .
Rubio reiterated , as he has in the past , that others are welcome to run their own campaigns
â€ “ he plans to stick to his own message about the future of America .
â€œI
just donâ€
™ t think it is a smart thing for Republicans to do Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s job for her.â€ �"
2015-10-31,"Marco Rubio has raised more than $ 1 m since the Republican presidential debate less than three days ago , a campaign aide said on Saturday .
The news came shortly before NBC released the transcript of an interview in which Jeb Bush denied having seen a memo to donors that outlined his campaignâ€ ™ s attack plan against Rubio and was leaked after a debate in which the former Florida governor was widely considered to have been beaten by the serving Florida senator .
â€œI
didnâ€
™ t see it , â€ �
Bush said in the interview with Meet the Press , which was scheduled to be broadcast on Sunday .
â€œI
didnâ€
™ t see it .
I donâ€
™ t know.â€ �
Bush added that he â€œread about it when [ it ] was leaked for sureâ€ � , but said he had not known about â€œthe PowerPointâ€ � .
The PowerPoint was presented at a closed - door donor retreat in Houston last week , where Bush gathered with his influential family to assuage skeptics within their vast network of financial backers .
In the presentation , which was leaked to some outlets while a 112-page file was acquired in full by the US News and World Report , donors to the Bush campaign were told â€œMarco is a GOP Obamaâ€ � and the â€œpress obsessionâ€ � with the debates did not matter .
The leaked material also revealed plans to attack Rubioâ€ ™ s financial past and ties to billionaires .
One slide said : â€œThose who have looked into Marcoâ€ ™ s background in the past have been concerned with what they found there.â€ �
A Bush aide told US News and World Report the line referred to when Mitt Romneyâ€ ™ s 2012 campaign team vetted Rubio for vice - president .
A former Romney adviser , Beth Myers , said this week nothing had been found .
Bushâ€ ™ s team has also gone after Rubioâ€ ™ s low Senate attendance .
Rubio dismissed such criticisms on Friday , repeating his line from the debate that Bush had been convinced â€œthat the way forward is to attack meâ€ � .
â€œAnd thatâ€ ™ s fine .
Everybody makes their own decisions , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œI
just donâ€
™ t think itâ€ ™ s a smart thing for Republicans to do Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s job for her.â€ �
Asked by Meet the Press host Chuck Todd if the attack plan was â€œsomething you want your campaign involved withâ€ � , Bush said : â€œI want to unify the party and Iâ€ ™ m focused on that.â€ � Rubioâ€ ™ s fundraising boost , largely in the way of small donations , follows a debate that was dubbed his breakthrough moment .
The Florida senator walked away with most of the accolades and on Friday earned the backing of Paul Singer , an influential Republican mega - donor who was also being courted by Bush .
Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign had previously pointed to a haul of $ 750,000 in online donations by Thursday , less than 24 hours after the debate was held .
The numbers are especially significant for Rubio , who raised just $ 5.7 m in the third quarter and will need substantial resources to remain competitive in a crowded Republican field .
The 44-year - old senatorâ€ ™ s fortunes appear to be rapidly changing since the most recent debate , when he was challenged on stage by Bush , the former governor of Florida and a one - time Rubio ally .
The night was meant to be a critical test for Bush and his struggling campaign , but his underwhelming performance did little to quell concerns among donors .
The resulting fallout would be especially beneficial to Rubio , who has been competing for the Republican presidential nomination in the same lane .
Bush , the son and brother of US presidents , came into the race with a record - setting war chest of nearly $ 100 m .
But he also had a disappointing third quarter in terms of money raised and now risks defections among his financial backers to the increasingly viable Rubio , who will embark on several fundraising trips in the coming week as he seeks to capitalize on the momentum coming out of the debate .
The piqued national interest nonetheless brings with it greater scrunity , bringing to an end the Rubio campaignâ€ ™ s strategy of keeping a low profile .
The impact of his strong debate showing was palpable on Friday night in Orange City , Iowa , when he addressed an audience of socially conservative evangelical voters , and on Saturday in Des Moines , where Rubio participated in a Republican cattle call at the state fairgrounds .
In Des Moines he was received like a rock star , after delivering a speech laced with his usual generational contrasts to both Bush and Clinton .
As Rubio walked back to his campaignâ€ ™ s booth at the event , he was surrounded by swell of reporters , fans and even professional autograph collectors , who saw an opportunity for profit .
For nearly 30 minutes , Rubio was flanked by people desperately seeking selfies and signatures .
He studiously ignored a pack of reporters that his staffers worked diligently to keep at bay .
Although Rubioâ€ ™ s poll numbers and lean operation in Iowa do not have him registering just yet as a frontrunner , on Saturday , at least , he was received like one .
He might soon find his main competitor , meanwhile , to be Ted Cruz , another first - term senator who has a formidable following among grassroots conservatives .
Cruz , of Texas , had his own big debate moment when he declared â€œwar on the liberal mediaâ€ � .
He raised $ 1.1 m in the next 24 hours , his campaign said ."
2015-11-01,"Jeb ainâ€ ™ t dead .
After his disastrous performance in the CNBC debate on Wednesday , pundits pulped the former Florida governor .
Simultaneously , they hailed the rise in the presidential race of Marco Rubio , the Florida senator who bested Bush in a key debate exchange .
But on Bushâ€ ™ s first trip to Iowa after the debate , even as crowds treated Rubio like a rock star , he showed distinct signs of life .
Amid an ongoing rumble over the leaking of a presentation to donors that outlined ways to attack Rubio and cast doubt on his past and character , the supposedly subdued candidate showed plenty of fight .
For starters , in an interview taped in Miami by NBC and to be broadcast on Sunday , he simply said he â€œdidnâ€ ™ t
seeâ€ � the presentation before it was leaked .
Rubio taped his own Sunday interview in Iowa , answering a question from CBS about whether Bush had ever been his mentor by saying he â€œwas a big part of meâ€ � .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t know about labels like that , â€ � he added ,
â€œbut he was most certainly a big part of my career .
And I have tremendous admiration .
I said that at the debate .
Youâ€ ™ re never going to hear me badmouth him.â€
� Rubio said , nonetheless : â€œHe said something , I had to respond â€
¦
I do believe that Jeb has been convinced by people around him that he needs to attack me in order to be more successful .
I donâ€
™ t personally agree with it , but Iâ€ ™ m not running his campaign.â€ �
Amid all this , in Des Moines , Republican power broker and Bush supporter David Oman hailed Saturday as â€œa boffo dayâ€ � .
His candidate had delivered an impassioned speech at the Growth and Opportunity Party , where 10 GOP candidates spoke to nearly 2,000 potential caucus - goers at the Iowa State fairgrounds .
Bush made a rare reference to his role in the 2005 Terri Schiavo case , took the odd shot at Rubio and contrasted himself , forcefully , with frontrunner Donald Trump .
Bushâ€ ™ s pitch has long been that he is the most presidential Republican candidate â€ “ as supporter Chad Airhart said in Des Moines : â€œClose your eyes , imagining any one of these candidates behind big desk in the oval office .
Itâ€ ™ s real easy to imagine Jeb Bush back there.â€ �
But here , in a state where evangelical voters dominate , he made a speech explicitly rooted in faith .
Bush said several times that he had â€œa servantâ€ ™ s heartâ€ � .
He also discussed Terri Schiavo .
As governor of Florida , Bush intervened in a legal battle over whether Schiavoâ€ ™ s husband could take his wife , who had been in a persistent vegetative state for 15 years , off her life support .
The case sparked national controversy and federal legislation to allow Schiavoâ€ ™ s parents sue to keep their daughter alive .
On Saturday , in a pro - life state , Bush reflected on his role in the case and said : â€œI erred on the side of life.â€
�
Bush then took another , mild jab at Rubioâ€ ™ s poor attendance record in the Senate â€ “ the subject of Bushâ€ ™ s most embarrassing debate moment , a simple putdown from the senator â€ “ by way of complimenting the Iowa senator Chuck Grassley .
â€œYou should do what Chuck Grassley does , â€ �
he said .
â€œYou should show up and vote.â€ �
But he saved the heat for Trump .
â€œLeadership is not about me me me , â€ � he said , â€œnot about pushing people down to make themselves look better .
Itâ€ ™ s about uniting the country around common purposes.â€ �
He also referred to the billionaireâ€ ™ s recent Twitter - fuelled embroglio , in which Trumpâ€ ™ s account retweeted a message which implied Iowa voters suffered from brain damage .
The retweet was blamed on a campaign intern .
Nonetheless , Trump was upset that he had fallen behind Ben Carson in Iowa .
â€œPoll numbers go down and poll numbers go up , â€ � Bush said ,
â€œbut when theyâ€ ™ re down you donâ€ ™ t insult Iowa voters.â€ �
The real advantage in Iowa for Bush , however , may lie in his organization .
Early in the campaign , Bush tried to play down expectations in the Hawkeye state .
But supporters there are now boasting about his ground game as he moves to head off a surging Rubio , who is far weaker on the streets and in the town halls .
Tim Albrecht , a top state operative working for Bush , said â€œthe ground team in Iowa is second to none â€ ¦ a thriving organization churning through voter contacts every single day , building up the database and finding out where activists where landing .
â€œThe point is there are over three months until caucuses and weâ€ ™ re building an organization now so weâ€ ™ re ready when
itâ€ ™ s go time.â€
�
The only candidate with more staffers on the ground in Iowa ?
Trump .
Iowa Republicans have long been perplexed by Rubioâ€ ™ s relative lack of organization in the state , where it seems he has a strong presence in just one town , the Des Moines suburb of Ankeny .
Bush supporters are correspondingly confident they can out - hustle Rubio in Iowa .
After all , as their candidate bragged on Saturday , he has been involved in Iowa caucuses since 1980 , when his father , George HW Bush , first ran for president .
In the six competitive Republican presidential caucuses in the state between then and 2016 , a Bush has been on the ballot in three .
On Saturday , Chris McLinden , who chairs the Bush campaign in Dallas County , thought Rubio was â€œthe flavor of the dayâ€ � .
In contrast , he thought his candidate was built to last .
McLinden noted that the Bush campaign has weekly conference calls with all its precinct captains .
While he admitted they hadnâ€ ™ t found an activist in all 1,700 precincts in the state , noting a weakness in rural Chickasaw County in north - eastern Iowa , McLinden said Bush was covered in major metropolitan areas and major precincts .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think he has the infrastructure ,
â€ �
McLinden said of Rubio , though he did note that the Florida senator â€œgives a great speech.â€ �
After Rubioâ€ ™ s speech at the fairgrounds on Saturday , he was received like a rock star â€ ¦ or at the very least like Donald Trump , surrounded by reporters , fans and even professional autograph seekers , sensing a good investment .
For nearly 30 minutes Rubio was surrounded .
He studiously ignored reporters as his hands became smeared with blue ink from the pictures and stickers thrust his way to sign .
He left just before Bush took the stage .
Bush got a decent reaction as well , then plodded through the crowd as people came up for autographs and selfies .
He took questions , engaging in old - fashioned retail politics .
To McLinden , despite the fact his â€œbackâ€ ™ s against the wall and every pundit in the world is against him and writing his obituaryâ€ � , his candidate is in a good place .
â€œWe all perform better under pressure , â€ � he said .
This is Bushâ€ ™ s chance to do so .

2015-11-02,"Jeb Bush has set out to resuscitate a campaign he insists is not on life support , kicking off a tour on Monday that will cast the former Florida governor as a proven leader amid a sea of candidates with less executive experience .
Against the backdrop of his new slogan , â€œJeb Can Fix Itâ€ � , Bush took veiled jabs at his onetime Florida ally Marco Rubio , the young senator who bested him in a memorable confrontation during last weekâ€ ™ s Republican presidential debate .
â€œThe challenges we face as a nation are too great to roll the dice on another presidential experiment , â€ � Bush said .
â€œThe answer isnâ€ ™ t sending someone from one side of the capital city to the other.â€ � Bush also took shots at Republican frontrunner Donald Trump , although he did not mention the real estate mogul by name .
â€œYou canâ€
™ t just tell Congress â€ ¦ â€˜Youâ€ ™ re Firedâ€ ™ â€ ¦ and go to a commercial break ,
â€ �
he said , adding later : â€œI will not trade in an optimistic outlook to put on the cloak of an angry agitator.â€ �
But the broader emphasis of Bushâ€ ™ s speech was to spotlight his tenure as a two - term governor to make the case that he , unlike other candidates in the race , has the track record to steer a country marred by gridlock .
â€œThe campaign trail is littered with candidates disguised as television critics .
Politicians echoing poll - tested pabulum , â€ � Bush said .
â€œBut leadership is something far different .
â€œItâ€
™ s not about telling people what they want to hear , but what they must hear .
Itâ€ ™ s not about saying the right thing , but doing the right thing.â€ � Coinciding with the release of his new e - book Reply All , the campaign rally was the first in a series of events across early voting states this week in which Bush will seek to emphasize how he engaged directly with constituents in the past to solve even the smallest of their problems .
The book , which has been in the works for almost a year , recaps Bushâ€ ™ s time as Floridaâ€ ™ s governor from 1999 to 2007 through the lens of his electronic correspondence with constituents , staff and colleagues .
Bush , who was known to give out his personal email to constituents , recalled at the top of his rally how he put his team on the job of removing a raccoon from an elderly womanâ€ ™ s attic after she had written to the governor .
The anecdote was to serve as a reminder of how Bush would like to portray himself : a candidate with heart , intent on running a â€œjoyfulâ€ � campaign .
That image was widely questioned in recent weeks , as Bush took to criticizing Rubio in televised interviews and then in an ill - fated attack on the senatorâ€ ™ s penchant for missing votes at his day job in the last debate .
At the rally , Bush rejected the premise that the election would be decided by â€œsound bites ... or which candidate can interrupt the loudestâ€ � .
â€œThis election is not about a set of personalities , â€ � Bush said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s about a set of principles.â€ �
He acknowledged his shortcomings , however , by running through the long list of advice he has received of late : some stylistic , like removing his glasses or changing his tie , and some more strategic : â€œNail that zinger .
Be angrier .
Hide your inner wonk.â€
�
Ultimately , Bush said , he had two takeaways from his time in Florida that he would look to in his bid for the nationâ€ ™ s highest office .
â€œOne
, I canâ€
™ t be someone Iâ€ ™ m not .
And , two , getting things done isnâ€ ™ t about yelling into a camera , or regurgitating sound bites free of substance , â€ � he said .
Some of Bushâ€ ™ s financial backers have privately said he has limited time to turn the ship around , a fact that was evidenced in Republican mega - donor Paul Singerâ€ ™ s decision on Friday to support Rubio .
In another boost , the senator on Monday received the backing of Cory Gardner â€ “
another young , rising Republican star who is a senator from Colorado , a critical swing state .
â€œOur country needs a new generation of leadership and I believe Marco Rubio presents this nation with the greatest possibilities and opportunities to meet the challenges of this generation , â€ �
Gardner told Fox News .
â€œIf we are going to put Marco Rubio on the ballot , thatâ€ ™ s our best foot forward , thatâ€ ™ s our best opportunity to defeat Hillary Clinton , â€ � he said .
Bush has his own wide network of supporters , both from the donor class and establishment lawmakers past and present , who will undoubtedly be keeping a close eye on his efforts to reboot his campaign .
There have been several shakeups already , some even predating the formal launch of Bushâ€ ™ s candidacy , like the selection of a new campaign manager when the â€œexploratory phaseâ€ � of his presidential run did not go as smoothly as planned .
In August , there were more hiccups : pay cuts to senior staff and the departure of top fundraisers when money did not pour in as expected despite a record - setting war chest established before Bush got into the race .
And then , just before the most recent debate , there were across - the - board pay cuts and the reshuffling of staff from the campaignâ€ ™ s Miami headquarters and out into the early voting states .
Bush conceded rough times were upon his campaign in an interview Sunday , but he was nonetheless defiant about his prospects to overcome the challenges before him .
â€œI have enough self - awareness to know that this is the bumpy time of a campaign , â€ � Bush told NBCâ€ ™ s Meet the Press .
â€œThis is the process .
I totally understand it , and Iâ€ ™ m more than prepared to fight on.â€
�
That fighting spirit was on full display Monday before a supportive home crowd that enthusiastically cheered Bushâ€ ™ s barbs aimed at Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and swarmed the former governor after his speech .
His remarks were ostensibly focused not on his rivals , but on the current administration and the implications of electing another Democrat to the White House in 2016 .
There was sharp criticism of Obamaâ€ ™ s foreign policy in Syria â€ “ red lines â€œcrossed without consequenceâ€ �
â€ “ and warnings of the threat posed by Russian president Vladimir Putin .
Bush also dove into a lengthy critique of Washington as he again sought to draw from his rÃ © sumÃ © in Florida to underscore why he was best prepared to change the prevailing culture of partisanship .
â€œIâ€ ™ m putting the Beltway on notice .
Iâ€ ™ ll turn Washington upside down , too , â€ � he said .
In the coming days , Bush will take the same message to South Carolina and New Hampshire in the hopes of persuading Republican primary voters not to heed the predictions of political pundits .
Speaking to the crowd in Florida , he promised to be the one to define his candidacy in the weeks and months to come .
â€œI will do everything in my power to win this race , â€ � Bush said .
â€œI am running this campaign on my own terms .
â€œAnd let me tell you something : when the dust clears , and the delegates are counted , weâ€ ™ re gon na win this damn thing.â€ �"
2015-11-04,"Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio on Wednesday tried to dismiss attacks on his personal finances as â€œdiscreditedâ€ � as opponents on both left and right cast new doubts over his use of an official Republican party credit card .
Rubio , on the campaign trail in New Hampshire , found himself facing fresh questions about the probity of his spending after the Tampa Bay Times highlighted his failure to make public all of his credit card statements from his time serving in the Florida state legislature .
Rubio has long been dogged by reports that he charged personal expenditures to an American Express credit card he received from the Republican party of Florida while serving as the stateâ€ ™ s house speaker from 2006 to 2008 .
Rubio has maintained it was an honest mistake , and that he reimbursed the party with more than $ 16,000 to cover personal charges that included a $ 10,000 family vacation , a $ 10.50 movie ticket and a repair bill for a minivan .
The Florida newspaper said some of his credit card statements from the two - year period remained private .
Rubio addressed these financial issues in his first memoir , An American Son , which was released in 2012 when he was on the vice - presidential shortlist for Republican nominee Mitt Romney .
â€œMy lack of bookkeeping skills would come back to haunt me , â€ � Rubio wrote , referring to efforts by Charlie Crist , his opponent in the 2010 Senate race , to make an issue of the expenditures .
â€œI had helped create the misunderstandings my opponents exploited.â€ �
Following a campaign event in Manchester , New Hampshire , on Wednesday , Rubio was asked why he was characterizing his finances as partisan attacks when he admitted to the accounting errors in his book .
â€œItâ€ ™ s been coming up for five years , so itâ€ ™ s not a new issue , â€ � Rubio said , adding that a Democratic activist tried to file a complaint against him in 2010 that was dismissed .
The senator said he would release his credit card records â€œsoon , probably within a few weeksâ€ � .
While it remains unclear what they might contain , a spokesman for Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign said it had always planned on making the records public .
Rubio called the Times report â€œnot accurateâ€ � , adding that each expense on the card was detailed in the state partyâ€ ™ s official filings .
â€œIt doesnâ€
™ t say who they belong to , but every expense is on there , â€ � he said .
â€œThe Republican party never paid a single expense of mine â€ “ personal expense , â€ �
Rubio said in an interview with ABC Newsâ€ ™ George Stephanopoulos on Good Morning America .
â€œIf there was a personal expense , I paid it .
If it was a party expense , the party paid it .
Now , I recognize in hindsight , I would do it different to avoid all this confusion.â€
�
The senatorâ€ ™ s financial history has come under fresh scrutiny amid his bid for the White House , especially as Rubio has risen in the polls .
His opponents on both sides have seized on the past credit card usage in recent weeks , with Republican frontrunner Donald Trump dubbing Rubioâ€ ™ s finances â€œa disasterâ€ � on Tuesday .
â€œHe certainly lives above his means , thereâ€ ™ s no question about that , â€ �
Trump told reporters at a press conference in New York .
Rubio shrugged off Trumpâ€ ™ s criticisms , suggesting the real estate mogul was reacting to polling showing him in decline .
â€œWhen Donald comes across a poll he doesnâ€ ™ t like , he gets weird and he does these sorts of strange things , â€ � Rubio said .
The Democratic National Committee also accused Rubio of misleading the public on the charges in last weekâ€ ™ s Republican presidential debate .
Rubio was asked during the debate how he would handle the nationâ€ ™ s finances if he couldnâ€ ™ t handle his own , to which the senator similarly defended himself against what he said were â€œdiscreditedâ€ � attacks .
He then pivoted to his humble upbringing to make the case that he understood what it was like to struggle with finances , a line he reiterated on Wednesday in a separate interview with Fox News .
â€œIt will be good for this country to have a president that knows what it feels like to have your house lose its value because of irresponsible and reckless behavior by Fannie and Freddie [ federal mortgage agencies ] , by the Federal Reserve , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œIt would be good for this country to have a president that knows what itâ€ ™ s like to owe money in student loans like I once did.â€
�
It nonetheless remains unlikely that the renewed attention surrounding Rubioâ€ ™ s spending will go away quickly .
The issue was highlighted in a leaked PowerPoint presentation crafted by the campaign of Jeb Bush , Rubioâ€ ™ s former Florida ally , and shown to donors at a closed - door retreat last week â€ “ signalling that an onslaught could be yet to come .
Both Bush and Rubio were campaigning in New Hampshire on Wednesday , a week after they clashed in the last debate .
Although Bush has continued to criticize Rubio over his voting record , he has not publicly gone after Rubioâ€ ™ s finances and declined to wade into the issue when it was raised by reporters on Tuesday .
But in his campaignâ€ ™ s slideshow to donors , aides referred to Rubio as â€œa risky betâ€ � .
In addition to the state party credit card , the presentation also brought up his close ties to Norman Braman , a Florida - based billionaire who , according to a New York Times report in May , has acted as a personal and professional benefactor to Rubio .
Other reports in recent months could serve as additional ammunition for Rubioâ€ ™ s opponents .
The senator faced foreclosure on a house he once co - owned with David Rivera , a former Florida representative and close friend of Rubioâ€ ™ s who has been the subject of several allegations of corruption .
He also liquidated a retirement account last year , incurring large penalties in the process , to pay for unexpected home repairs .
In his interview with Fox , Rubio said he was looking forward to debating the subject with Democrats as â€œsomeone who grew up paycheck to paycheckâ€ � . â€œHowâ€ ™ s [ Hillary Clinton ] going to say that I donâ€
™ t understand the plight of people that are struggling in America when I myself â€ “ through my parents and our upbringing â€ “ lived it?â€ � Rubio said .
â€œSo I am proud of where I come from .
My parents werenâ€ ™ t rich people , but I am proud of what they left us with â€ “ which is the chance of a better life , and weâ€ ™ ve been able to achieve that.â€ �"
2015-11-07,"Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign on Saturday released what it called â€œa full accountingâ€ � of his use of an American Express card issued by the Florida Republican Party , while he was speaker of the House of Representatives in that state .
Questions over Rubioâ€
™ s use of the card for personal expenses have dogged his presidential campaign , even as the US senator for Florida has risen in the polls on the back of strong performances in the Republican primary debates .
The statements released on Saturday detailed such personal payments by Rubio on the Republican Party card , and his subsequent repayments of the relevant sums .
The payments included those to a hotel and car rental in Las Vegas , a tile maker in Miami , a Honda repair shop and a childâ€ ™ s sports activity centre .
The issue came up in the last Republican debate , in Boulder , Colorado last month , when Rubio was asked by CNBC moderators why voters should trust him to run the nationâ€ ™ s finances when he had so publicly struggled with his own .
He deflected the question as an example of an attack which he said was â€œdiscreditedâ€ � .
Though his poll numbers have not been damaged by such attacks , Rubioâ€ ™ s opponents on both the left and right are seeking to make hay of the issue , even as the senatorâ€ ™ s aides have long maintained he had â€œnothing to hideâ€ � .
Last week , a leaked memo from the Jeb Bush campaign mentioned the senatorâ€ ™ s personal financial history as a possible attack point .
On Tuesday , the real estate billionaire and campaign frontrunner Donald Trump called Rubioâ€ ™ s personal finances â€œa disasterâ€ � and said : â€œHe certainly lives above his means , thereâ€ ™ s no question about that.â€ �
The same day , the Tampa Bay Times reported that some transactions involving Rubio were â€œstill secretâ€ � , despite questions having been public for some years .
In 2012 , the Florida Ethics Commission dismissed a complaint that was brought against him by a Democratic state politician in 2010 .
On the campaign trail in New Hampshire on Wednesday , Rubio said his card use had â€œbeen coming up for five years , so itâ€ ™ s not a new issueâ€ � , and said he would release the relevant statements â€œprobably within a few weeksâ€ � .
Speaking to ABC the same day , he said : â€œThe Republican party never paid a single expense of mine â€ “ personal expense .
If there was a personal expense , I paid it .
If it was a party expense , the party paid it .
Now , I recognize in hindsight , I would do it different to avoid all this confusion.â€

On Saturday , the campaign released statements covering the 22-month period from January 2005 to October 2006 .
The statements showed that Rubio charged just under $ 65,000 to the party card in the two - year period .
There were just eight personal charges listed , for a total of $ 7,243.74 , which Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign said he personally repaid in subsequent billing cycles .
Rubio had the American Express charge card for a total of four years , from January 2005 to December 2008 .
The total amount he charged during that duration was just more than $ 182,000 , within which he racked up 73 personal expenses on the card that his team has said he reimbursed fully .
The controversy surrounding Rubioâ€ ™ s finances first emerged when he was running for the US Senate in 2010 , when his then opponent Charlie Crist leaked certain expenditures to the press .
The largest personal expense detailed in the newly released statements is of $ 3,765.24 to a tile company in Rubioâ€ ™ s hometown of Miami , although the records show that the same amount was repaid to American Express the following month .
Rubio also addressed this charge in his 2012 book , without disclosing the exact amount , by noting he â€œpulled out the wrong card â€ ¦ to pay for paversâ€ � .
There is also a $ 5,000 weeklong stay at the Venetian , a luxury hotel and casino in Las Vegas , that was part business and part personal .
Rubio spent some of his early childhood living in Nevada , and according to his campaign extended his trip to visit with relatives .
He subsequently made a payment for $ 1,745 , or roughly 30 % of the total .
The Republican party of Florida covered $ 3,343.58 for the trip .
A release from the Rubio campaign said that , first as speaker designate and then speaker , â€œhe led the Florida Houseâ€ ™ s Republican campaign operation ( the equivalent of the National Republican Congressional Committee ) , which included an aggressive travel and fundraising scheduleâ€ � .
â€œMarco paid his personal charges directly to American Express ,
â€ � the release added .
â€œThe Republican Party of Florida did not pay for any of Marcoâ€ ™ s personal expenses .
Further , taxpayer funds were not used for any political or personal charges on the card.â€ �
Rubio has often admitted to poor handling of his personal finances , writing in his 2012 memoir An American Son of Cristâ€ ™ s leaks : â€œMy lack of bookkeeping skills would come back to haunt me ,
â€ �
and , â€œI had helped create the misunderstandings my opponents exploited.â€ �
On the 2016 campaign trail , he has sought to turn such controversy into an advantage .
This week , the son of Cuban migrants told Fox News he looked forward to debating a Democrat in the general election â€ “ likely Hillary Clinton , a former first lady , US senator and secretary of state â€
“ as â€œsomeone who grew up paycheck to paycheckâ€ � ."
2015-11-08,"Rand Paul has fired a surprise shot across Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s bows two days before the next Republican primary debate , calling the Republican rising star â€œa
neoconservativeâ€ � .
Until now , Paul has not attacked Rubio by name on the campaign trail .
Asked on CNN on Sunday how he saw Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on foreign policy , the Kentucky senator repeated a charge he made earlier when he said : â€œI see her as a neoconservative.â€ �
He added : â€œI see her and Rubio as being the same person.â€ � Rubio , a member of the Senate intelligence committee , is seen as a relatively experienced voice on foreign affairs in the 15-strong Republican field .
He has risen in polls recently , still some way behind Donald Trump and Ben Carson but seen by many as the actual politician most likely to win the Republican race .
On Saturday , Rubio attempted to deflect another line of attack from rivals when he released statements regarding his use of a Republican party American Express card while speaker of Floridaâ€ ™ s house of representatives .
Pre - debate attacks against Rubio also have focused on his work in the Senate on attempts at comprehensive immigration reform , a toxic issue in Republican circles .
â€œLook at Marcoâ€ ™
s
stance on illegal immigration , â€ �
Trump said at a press conference last week .
â€œIt is really trouble for him .
I donâ€
™ t see how he can win.â€ �
On Friday , the Democratic New York senator Chuck Schumer also piled on , seeking in an interview with CNN to link the Florida senator indelibly with the issue .
Rubio was â€œnot only totally committedâ€ � to the reform effort , Schumer said , but he was in the room with the so - called â€œGang of Eightâ€ � senators who authored the legislation .
â€œHis fingerprints are all over that bill .
It has a lot of Rubio imprints , â€ � Schumer said .
â€œHe understood it , he molded it , he made it a tough path to citizenship â€
¦ he was all for it.â€ �
Asked if immigration would be a problem for Rubio in the primary , Paul agreed .
â€œIt was a Rubio - Schumer bill .
So , he does have to explain it , â€ � Paul said .
â€œI think it will be a big part of things.â€ �
The Kentucky senator added that much of the attention thus far had been directed toward one candidate â€ “ seemingly referring to Trump â€ “ but signaled more fire was heading Rubioâ€ ™ s way .
â€œI think we need to sort of start distributing the argument some , so we can know about all of the candidates and where they stand , â€ � Paul said .
By contrast to Rubio , Paul has consistently returned poll scores in the low single digits , and therefore only just managed to secure a place on the main stage for the next debate .
He has been urged by many in his native state to focus solely on re - election to the Senate .
Developing his point on Sunday , he said : â€œ[Clinton and Rubio ] both want a no - fly zone [ in Syria ] ; they both have supported activity in Libya , the war in Libya that toppled [ Muammar ] Gaddafi , an intervention that made us less safe ; they both have supported pouring arms into the Syrian civil war , a mistake that I think allowed [ Islamic State militants ] to grow stronger ; and they both have supported the Iraq war .
So whatâ€ ™ s the difference?â€ � CNN host Jake Tapper
, surprised , asked how Paul defined a â€œneoconservativeâ€ � , a label which lost much of its lustre in world politics thanks to the Bush administrationâ€ ™ s launching and handling of the Iraq war .
â€œSomebody a lot of times who likes big government both domestically and internationally
, â€ � answered Paul , the son of libertarian Ron Paul .
â€œAnd so many of the big neoconservatives came out of a movement , they were Democrats mostly , they were some Marxists and socialists , but they were people who came to believe we needed a big government internationally as well .
â€œAnd I think Hillary Clinton actually fits the bill .
I think sheâ€ ™ s the most likely of all the candidates to get us back involved in another war in the Middle East.â€ �
Discussing the 2011 US - led intervention in Libya , which he said was now a failed state , Paul criticised President Obama for acting unilaterally , without congressional approval .
He added : â€œI fault Hillary Clinton [ who secretary of state at the time ] , I fault President Obama , but I also fault the neoconservatives in my party , like Rubio , who have been eager for war in Libya , in Syria , in Iraq , and want a [ Syria ] no - fly zone in an airspace where Russiaâ€ ™ s already flying .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a foolhardy notion and this is really stepping it to a debate people need , about who do we want to be commander - in - chief of our country.â€ �
Earlier in the interview , Paul was asked about Bush defense secretary Dick Cheneyâ€ ™ s refusal to say if he trusted Paul or Clinton more on foreign policy .
In an echo of the generational Republican infighting which broke out this week over comments contained in Pulitzer - winner Jon Meachamâ€ ™ s new biography of President George HW Bush , Paul said : â€œDick Cheneyâ€ ™ s been wrong about most of the foreign policy of the last several decades.â€ �"
2015-11-10,"Just weeks ago , a confrontation between Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio at the third Republican debate marked a critical turning point in the trajectories of the two former Florida allies and their presidential campaigns .
It not only underscored the perils of Bush , the stateâ€ ™ s former governor , trying to attack Rubio , one of its senators , but also left many political observers baffled by the Bush campaignâ€ ™ s tactics and decision to target his former protege .
But allies of the former Florida governor showed no signs of de - escalation going into the next Republican presidential debate Tuesday night .
Only this time , Rubioâ€ ™ s team is more than willing to hit back .
The Rubio campaign released a video on Tuesday morning recounting the many times Bush praised the young senator as he rose through the political ranks â€ “ first in Florida and then nationally .
â€œIâ€ ™ m
a huge Marco fan , â€ � Bush says in one clip .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s probably the most articulate conservative on the scene today
, â€ � he adds in another .
â€œAnd I look forward to him being a good president.â€
�
The video sought to remind the public of just how big an advocate Bush once was before he took to doling out what Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign dubbed as â€œphony
attacksâ€ � .
The release of the video was provoked by a report in the New York Times late Monday , which detailed plans by the pro - Bush Super Pac Right to Rise to unleash as much as $ 20 m against Rubioâ€ ™ s candidacy .
The article also specifically telegraphed one potential line of attack â€ “ Rubioâ€ ™ s hardline position on abortion â€ “ that Bush surrogates would wield against the rising senator .
In the first Republican presidential debate , Rubio said he had never advocated in favor of abortion exceptions for rape and incest .
While Rubioâ€ ™ s position is in step with social conservatives , several strategists suggested Bush allies might be looking to reach donors with a message that could cast him as too extreme to defeat Hillary Clinton in a general election .
Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign , which has until now declined to respond publicly to the jabs of Bush or any other Republican opponent , wasted no time responding on Twitter .
Marco Rubio â€œis
proudly pro - lifeâ€ �
, tweeted Jonathan Slemrod , the senatorâ€ ™ s policy director .
Todd Harris , a top adviser to the campaign , shared a link to a Politico story from 2012 about Bushâ€ ™ s attempts to get then Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney to choose Rubio as his running mate .
â€œThe former Florida governor is making a big public and private push for Rubio to become the Republican vice - presidential nominee , personally lobbying Mitt Romney on his behalf and speaking to the media about it ,
â€ � the article stated .
Campaigns and Super Pacs are legally barred from coordinating , and Bushâ€ ™ s campaign did not wade into the back - and - forth prompted by Right to Rise .
In an interview with the Huffington Post last week that was published on Tuesday , Bush declined to go after Rubioâ€ ™ s stance on abortion and chose simply to highlight his own position .
Itâ€ ™ s unclear if Bush will target the senator on the debate stage â€ “ the last time he tried the results were , by all accounts , brutal .
After weeks of public telegraphing , Bush failed to execute a planned attack on Rubioâ€ ™ s spotty Senate attendance during the third Republican debate and prompted an overwhelmingly negative backlash toward his already struggling campaign .
To make matters worse , Rubio seized on the moment with a rejoinder that in many ways summarized Bushâ€ ™ s problem .
â€œThe only reason why youâ€ ™ re doing it now is because weâ€ ™ re running for the same position , and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you , â€ �
Rubio said of Bushâ€ ™ s criticism .
Bush , who vowed to run a substantive campaign on the issues , was now the reluctant antagonist toward a candidate he championed for years as a next - generation leader .
Kevin Madden , a former adviser to Romneyâ€ ™ s campaign who is unaffiliated for 2016 , said it was always expected that the candidates would draw a contrast .
But he questioned the attention drawn by Bush allies to their process , which Madden said would only give Rubio and his team ample time to prepare a response .
â€œFrom a pure tactical standpoint , donâ€ ™ t give your opponents a take - home exam , â€ �
Madden said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s turned it into much more of a process story , and it also runs counter to the promises that [ Bush ] keeps making himself about running a â€˜joyfulâ€ ™ campaign.â€ �
The pre - emptive strikes , when leaked to the media , have also made way for quotes â€ “ sometimes anonymous , sometimes on the record â€ “ from anxious Bush donors who disagree with the campaignâ€ ™ s decision to go after Rubio .
â€œSo one of the story lines coming out of it is , this is not a strategy that is fully endorsed by the folks who are supportive of Bush , â€ �
Madden said .
â€œAnd in a way that serves to undercut the effectiveness of it.â€ � Parallels have been drawn to the contentious primary between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in 2008 .
Dan Pfeiffer , a former Obama aide , tweeted on Tuesday that the Clinton campaign â€œsimilarly telegraphed a coming assault on Obamaâ€ � back then .
â€œWe raised money , organized off it and used the leak as a shield , â€ � Pfeiffer said .
Bill Burton , another Obama campaign alum , agreed .
â€œThe way theyâ€ ™ ve set this up , theyâ€ ™ ve given Rubio something to fundraise off of and something to organize around , â€ �
Burton said .
Indeed , Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign was out with a fundraising blast by Tuesday morning in an emailed titled , â€œThis is a Joyful Campaign???â€ �
Referring to the New York Times story , Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign manager Terry Sullivan wrote to supporters : â€œYou read that right .
Jebâ€
™ s
plan is to spend $ 20 m dollars to â€˜damage
Mr Rubioâ€ ™ s reputation.â€ ™ Not just talk about how they differ on the issues but to actively try to destroy Marcoâ€ ™ s reputation.â€ � â€œHonestly
, itâ€ ™ s something weâ€ ™ d expect from Hillary and the mainstream media , but the fact that the Republican establishment believes this is what they need to do to take down Marco is astonishing.â€ � Several prominent Republicans sided with Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign .
Bill Kristol , a longtime conservative pundit and editor of the Weekly Standard , tweeted : â€œEvery donor to Right to Rise who doesnâ€ ™ t want his money used for destructive assault on @marcorubio should call and ask for his money back.â€
� Jennifer Rubin , a conservative columnist at the Washington Post , wrote that the Bush campaignâ€ ™ s game plan was â€œat the very least dishearteningâ€ � .
â€œIt should not be surprising , however , to discover that he is another cynical pol whose own message is so weak that his only alternative is to diminish others , â€ � she wrote .
Having worked for a campaign at the receiving end of a similar assault , Burton said it was always inevitable that Bush would eventually have to go negative in order to win .
The issue , he said , was not the shots themselves but their delivery and timing .
â€œThe problem is that heâ€ ™ s barely introduced himself to voters and as a result attacks are a lot less credible coming from someone you donâ€
™ t really know that well , â€ � Burton said .
â€œJeb Bush has not been able to find who he is and campaign as that person.â€ �"
2015-11-11,"The eight top Republicans jostling for position in the race for their party ’s presidential nomination engaged in the most substantive but also the most volatile and feisty debate of the 2016 cycle on Tuesday night as the race for the White House entered a new and more demanding phase .
Two hours of debate in the Milwaukee Theater in Wisconsin saw the country ’s leading rightwing presidential hopefuls hurl themselves into detailed and heated disputes over the fundamentals of modern conservatism .
Donald Trump clashed with Jeb Bush over immigration , Rand Paul took on Marco Rubio , while Ben Carson was deeply tested over his knowledge of foreign affairs and the veracity of his own personal story .
The media hosts of the fourth Republican presidential debate , Fox Business and the Wall Street Journal , promised that it would be the most substantive on the issues that Americans cared about .
And it delivered .
The populist grandstanding of the so - called “ outsider ” candidates – notably Trump and Carson – came under more detailed scrutiny than in any previous debate .
Trump in particular was challenged over his headline - grabbing promise to round up and eject the country ’s 11 million undocumented immigrants .
Jeb Bush , whose campaign has been seriously flagging in recent weeks as he struggled to find his voice , came out guns blazing in a derisive take - down of the Trump position .
“
Twelve million illegal immigrants , to send them back , 500,000 a month , is just not possible .
And it ’s not embracing American values .
And it would tear communities apart .
And it would send a signal that we ’re not the kind of country that I know America is .
”
Feeling the wind finally in his sails , Bush pressed on .
He said that even having a conversation about forced deportation of millions of law - abiding people “ sends a powerful signal .
They ’re doing high - fives in the Clinton campaign right now when they hear this
, that ’s the problem with this ” .
Ohio governor John Kasich also attacked Trump on his crude immigration plan , insisting : “ Come on folks , we all know you ca n’t pick them up and ship them across a border .
It ’s a silly argument .
It ’s not an adult argument .
”
His phrase caught the mood of the night , when more experienced politicians snatched back control of the conversation .
Bush was not the only experienced politician on the stage who palpably felt the momentum of the presidential contest move in their direction , away from the hitherto ascendant “ outsiders ” .
Rand Paul too came into his own to an extent not previously seen in any of the three earlier debates .
In one of the most substantive discussions of the night , the Kentucky Republican took on Marco Rubio over their respective interpretations of conservatism as it applied to government spending on domestic welfare and the military .
When Rubio talked about introducing a new family - friendly tax system , Paul pounced , denouncing the plan as a new trillion - dollar expense on the federal budget .
“
He ’s talking about giving people money they did n’t pay .
It ’s a welfare transfer payment , ” Paul said , adding it did n’t look very conservative to him .
He then went on to lambast Rubio ’s plan to increase spending on the US military by a similar trillion dollars .
“
How is it conservative to add a trillion dollars in military expenditures ?
You can not be a conservative if you ’re going to keep promoting new programs you ’re not going to pay for .
”
Rubio lashed back by branding Paul a “ committed isolationist ” .
“
I believe the world is a stronger and a better place , and the United States is the strongest military power in the world .
There are radical jihadists beheading people and crucifying Christians .
”
It was a difficult night for Ben Carson , who was exposed to one of the only non - economic questions of the evening when he was asked whether recent press coverage of inaccuracies in his personal story had damaged his standing .
Carson , the retired neurosurgeon , has faced a recent flurry of news stories suggesting that he juiced up his personal biography .
He has been shown to have exaggerated or misrepresented his own accounts that he turned down a scholarship to West Point military academy , tried to stab a friend at school and was rewarded by his professors for being the most honest student in his class at Yale .
He tried to deflect the question by turning it back on the media in an echo of the attack leveled by Republican candidates at CNBC over the debate two weeks ago .
Carson said the assault on his trustworthiness by the media was unfair compared with the treatment of Hillary Clinton ’s narrative over Benghazi .
“
We should vet all candidates , I have no problem being vetted
but I do have a problem with being lied about and putting that out there as truth .
We have to start treating people the same .
”
Carson also faced difficulties over his approach to raising the minimum wage and tax policy .
Within the first 10 minutes of the debate , he flip - flopped on his policy when he told moderator Neil Cavuto : “ I would not raise [ the minimum wage ] .
I would not raise it specifically because I ’m interested in making sure that people are able to enter the job market and take advantage of opportunities .
”
However , in May , Carson favored raising the federal minimum wage .
He said then in an interview on CNBC : “ I think , probably , it should be higher than now .
”
Carson later said he would favor getting rid of tax deductions for home mortgages and charitable giving , which are two of the most popular and widely used tax deductions .
He stood by this statement after the debate , saying he was “ 100 % ” in favor of removing both from the tax code .
In a further assault on his image of calm but assured statesmanship , Carson also exposed his limited knowledge of the complexities of foreign affairs when he talked about his proposed way of dealing with Isis .
The important thing , he said , was to treat the Islamist extremists as “ losers ” , and to take the land they controlled in Iraq away from them .
The more detailed the level of discussion , the more edged out of the limelight both Carson and Trump appeared .
When historians look back on the 2016 presidential race , they may come to see Milwaukee as a tipping point in which the more establishment politicians within the crowded field of contestants finally came into their own .
Trump also sounded maverick on foreign policy , saying that he was quite happy with Russian president Vladimir Putin going in to Syria to fight the Isis insurgents .
That gave Bush the second chance of the night to assert his desperately struggling bid for the Republican nomination .
“ Donald is absolutely wrong on this .
The idea of letting Putin take out Isis , that ’s like a board game , like playing Monopoly or something
, that ’s not how the world works ,
” he said .
While Bush and Paul both left a greater imprint on the race than they have up to now , other candidates on stage found it more difficult to leave their mark .
Ted Cruz made a forceful statement on immigration , pinning his colors to the same mast as Trump by opposing any concession to any of the 11 million undocumented individuals .
Carly Fiorina , the former CEO of Hewlett - Packard , stuck largely to a familiar script about her business prowess though she did receive a resounding cheer from the audience when she exclaimed :
“ We must take our government back .
”
In the post - debate spin room
Trump praised the debate as “ an elegant evening ” compared to the controversial CNBC debate just two weeks before .
Other presidentical campaigns took turns declaring victory .
Doug Stafford , the top strategist for Paul , said of his candidate : “
I thought Rand really stood out from everyone in this debate and showed himself to be the real , true fiscal conservative on every issue .
” Michael Steel , a top aide to Bush , also felt comfortable about his candidate ’s performance .
“
I think Governor Bush showed again why he ’s the best choice to be the next commander in chief and did the best job making a contrast with Hillary Clinton on question after question .
”
Earlier in the evening , in the undercard debate , New Jersey governor Chris Christie , newly relegated from the top tier by dint of low poll ratings , also helped to resurrect his moribund campaign by strategically turning his remaining firepower on Hillary Clinton .
Christie said Clinton was “ the one to fight tonight ” , the one who would inflate public spending were she to get into the White House .
“
The people out there … care about who ’s going to beat Hillary Clinton and who ’s going to keep their eye on the ball .
I ’m going to keep my eye on the ball , ” he said .
Christie ’s
statesmanlike tone earned him a plaudit from Rupert Murdoch , the CEO of News Corp which owns the host media organizations , who tweeted about him : “ Possible to see as Chief Executive . ”"
2015-11-12,"Here are some key figures from Tuesday nightâ€ ™ s primetime Republican debate : $ 4.5bn .
$ 59 m .
$ 26 m .
$ 22 m .
$ 10 m .
$ 3.5 m .
$ 2 m .
Theyâ€ ™ re the estimates of the net worth of seven of the eight Republican candidates who joined the debate in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , representing the wealth accumulated by ( respectively )
Donald Trump , Carly Fiorina , Ben Carson , Jeb Bush , John Kasich , Ted Cruz and Rand Paul .
Missing from that list , and the definite outlier in the crowd , is Marco Rubio .
Depending on how you calculate the number , his net worth is only between $ 100,000 and $ 443,000 .
And yet there seems to be widespread agreement that his standing among the pack of presidential hopefuls is rising ; almost as many respondents in one poll called him the winner of Tuesdayâ€ ™ s debate as described Trump as the victor .
Given Rubioâ€ ™ s
â€ “ relative â€ “ poverty , his push to the forefront is intriguing .
While nearly all of the candidates talked about the little guy , and paid lip service to the importance of the middle class , itâ€ ™ s only Rubio who , with a straight face , can still claim to experience some of what they go through on a routine basis .
As recently as 2011 , for instance , at the age of 40 and with children of his own , the Florida senator was still struggling with $ 100,000 in student debt , acquired from both his undergraduate and his law school studies .
Only the publication of his book , An American Son , enabled him finally to pay off the balance of those loans .
Even so , his net worth was still negative as recently as 2012 .
Like a lot of Americans , he has struggled to manage his own finances , probably largely without assistance or advice because neither his net worth nor his income would have been large enough for him to have found it easy to hire a financial adviser .
His parents â€ “ his father was a bartender , his mother was a maid who worked in a hotel â€ “ never had any money to manage .
That meant that in the home , the first place that someone learns crucial lessons about being wise with money , the issues were probably confined to how to stretch a dollar to cover as much as possible , not how to use credit , how to accumulate savings or how to approach more sophisticated financial decisions .
And as a nation , weâ€ ™ re still pretty bad about teaching financial literacy in schools
â€ “ though at least the picture is improving .
Whether out of carelessness , laziness , ignorance or simply because he was overwhelmed by the magnitude of the financial hurdles ahead of him , Rubio made a lot of foolish financial decisions .
With all that student debt still hanging over his head , he treated himself by splashing out on a new $ 80,000 luxury speedboat .
He made one of the poorest financial decisions possible when he cashed out a $ 68,000 retirement plan in order to pay for a new fridge , repair his air conditioning , and cover some school expenses .
Not only is that money not quietly sitting aside and accumulating , tax free â€ “ a big loss for his future , since every dollar he can save from here on out will never be able to match what those dollars could have earned for him , due to the way compound interest works â€
“
but he probably lost at least a third of that amount in taxes and penalties .
Earlier this year , he sold a Tallahassee investment property that he jointly owned at a loss after narrowly avoiding foreclosure , having failed to make the mortgage payments on the house for five months .
Then there is Rubioâ€ ™ s haphazard use of credit cards .
His apparent willingness to intermingle personal and party funds ( at least in the short term ; Rubio has said he settled all those outstanding personal charges promptly , and that many of them were errors on his part when he pulled the wrong card out of his wallet ) has caused a kerfuffle that seems unlikely to die down .
Overall , it appears that of $ 182,000 charges on a Republican party American Express card over the course of four years , 73 items , totaling $ 22,000 , were for personal items , ranging from flowers to a hotel bill .
The plus side ?
It would be hard indeed for the average American not to relate to this , from Rubioâ€
™ s struggle to finance a college education to his foolhardy decision to liquidate that IRA account to cover routine expenses .
And itâ€ ™ s certainly a hell of a lot easier to understand Rubioâ€ ™ s missteps than to relate to Donald Trumpâ€
™ s finances : the son of a successful real estate developer
, Trump has claimed that by the time he himself graduated from college and joined his fatherâ€ ™ s firm , he had a net worth of $ 200,000 in 1968 dollars , more than Rubio does in 2015 dollars .
An American might wish he had the good luck to be born into a family like Trumpâ€ ™ s , but is well aware that the odds make it more likely his family circumstances will be more like Rubioâ€ ™ s .
And thereâ€ ™ s a fairly decent chance that middle - class voters will find Trumpâ€ ™ s easy ability to write off debt via no fewer than four corporate bankruptcies of firms bearing his name in the last 25 years as troubling , in a different way , as some of Rubioâ€ ™ s missteps , given the difficulties theyâ€ ™ ve had simply renegotiating their own mortgages in the aftermath of the financial crisis .
Republican candidates would be foolish to underestimate how important it is to middle - class voters â€ “ even those who aspire to be as wealthy as Trump or Fiorina â€ “ to show that they not only think about the votersâ€ ™ issues but have lived their lives .
A key moment in George HW Bushâ€ ™ s ( failed ) re - election campaign in 1992 came when the president was visibly startled by the electronic scanners available in supermarkets â€ “ scanners that had been in place for years .
It came to symbolize the extent to which he was out of touch with the lives and concerns of ordinary Americans , and trapped inside an elite existence .
Similarly , the 2012 Republican presidential candidate , Mitt Romney , may have doomed his chances at the polls not only by being extremely wealthy but when his wife let slip that they wouldnâ€ ™ t need to take so many vacations outside the country because , you know , they had so many houses in the United States for that purpose .
The question of relatability is one on which Rubio wins and his rivals fall short , to varying degrees .
Of course , Rubio also has a big achilles heel : he isnâ€ ™ t a plucky striver who has budgeted carefully and made no mistakes .
Heâ€
™ s been like the rest of us
â€ “ only on a larger scale .
He has made some of the same mistakes many of us have made , like being tempted to spend on a vacation or other large purchase when weâ€ ™ ve still got student debt payments to make , or yanking money out of a retirement account .
And heâ€ ™ s had the chutzpah to think that this doesnâ€ ™ t disqualify him from seeking the office of president â€ “
so itâ€
™ s safe to say that any remaining velvet gloves with respect to Rubioâ€ ™ s personal finances are likely to be whipped off in the coming weeks .
While his rivals rehash past mistakes , Iâ€ ™ d rather look at whether he understands where he went wrong and whether he did anything right .
( Yup : he used that book advance to pay off his student loans , and he is already setting money aside in college savings plans for his children . )
The next question isnâ€ ™ t about what happened in the past , but about how Rubio proposes to handle the countryâ€ ™ s finances and what policies heâ€ ™ d suggest to help other families out there .
And here the track record is mixed .
Some individual ideas are intriguing .
Rubio has suggested what he calls a â€œStudent Investment
Planâ€ � , which would see a company sponsor a studentâ€ ™
s education in return for a percentage of their salary for a given number of years : it sounds a lot like a corporate sector version of the military plan that sends veterans to college free after their tour of duty , only without the students having to sign up to risk their lives .
His tax and spending plans
donâ€ ™ t make all that much sense , alas : if he tries to balance the budget while implementing what he has proposed , the results will be devastating for precisely those groups he has claimed to worry most about , such as working - class families and single mothers .
Ultimately , perhaps Rubioâ€ ™ s major legacy in this campaign will be as a kind of great personal finance lesson in what not to do with your money , whether or not you intend to run for president one day â€ “ and a spur to greater and more effective financial literacy education at all levels , nationwide .
While I wish his policies reflected his background and those experiences , itâ€ ™ s still marginally reassuring to see that itâ€ ™ s at least theoretically possible to make it into the final rounds of this Republican contest and not be a millionaire .
Because â€ “ lest the Republican candidates forget â€ “ should one of them win the whole shebang , and become the nationâ€ ™ s CEO , their job isnâ€ ™ t going to be to hang out with the rich and powerful .
It will be to represent and be accountable to the rest of us : from the poorest of the working poor , holding down three jobs to make ends meet , to the laid - off middle manager , to the single parent wondering how to send kids to college .
Our worries were Rubioâ€ ™ s worries ; our worries should be the worries of anyone who aspires to the presidency .
This article was amended on 12 November 2015 .
An earlier version said the last Republican debate was on Wednesday ; it was on Tuesday ."
2015-11-13,"Donald Trump has said Marco Rubio supports â€œamnestyâ€ � for millions of undocumented immigrants because he is Hispanic .
During an interview with CNN , host Erin Burnett cited Rubioâ€ ™ s inspirational story as a Hispanic and the son of Cuban immigrants while discussing immigration reform with the real estate mogul .
â€œThatâ€
™ s why he wants amnesty , â€ �
Trump , who is the Republican presidential frontrunner , responded .
Earlier in the program , Trump said Rubio â€œwas always in favor of amnestyâ€ � , in reference to the Florida senatorâ€ ™
s
work as the co - author of a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013 that included a pathway to citizenship for the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States .
â€œHe was always in favor of letting people pour into the country , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œThen what happened is , when people found that out , he sank like a rock in the water.â€ �
Trump has escalated his attacks on Rubioâ€ ™ s immigration record in recent weeks as the Florida senator has risen in the polls .
But this is the first time Trump has injected Rubioâ€ ™ s family background into the debate .
A spokesman for Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign did not immediately respond when reached for comment on Trumpâ€ ™ s remarks .
Rubio is one of two Republican presidential contenders of Hispanic descent .
Texas senator Ted Cruz , like Rubio , is Cuban American .
Rubioâ€ ™ s rivals have shown an eagerness this week to revisit his involvement in immigration reform efforts in the US Senate two years ago .
Rubioâ€ ™ s role in crafting the immigration bill is well documented , as is his disavowal of the process after the legislation cleared the Senate but died in the House of Representatives amid steep conservative opposition .
Trump has spent weeks berating Rubio over the issue and dubbing him as â€œpro - amnestyâ€ � .
Rubio has maintained he â€œpersonallyâ€ � supports undocumented immigrants eventually applying for green cards , but has laid out a step - by - step process that does not detail a clear path to citizenship .
As Rubio has grown in stature following strong debate performances , other Republican candidates have also piled on the criticism .
Rubio and Cruz sparred over immigration on Thursday , after Cruz made a string of comments looking to contrast his position on immigration with that of Rubioâ€ ™ s .
Both senators are looking to solidify their support among conservatives , the majority of whom remain opposed to citizenship for undocumented immigrants .
â€œIn my view , if Republicans nominate for president a candidate who supports amnesty , we will have given up one of the major distinctions with Hillary Clinton and we will lose the general election , â€ �
Cruz told reporters late Wednesday , after referring to Rubioâ€ ™ s bill as â€œthe seminal fight over amnesty in Congressâ€ � .
Cruz elaborated on the issue on Thursday , telling conservative radio show host Laura Ingraham â€ “ a vocal opponent of immigration reform â€ “ that Rubio had stood against Cruzâ€ ™ s efforts to beef up the billâ€ ™ s border security requirements before legalizing undocumented immigrants .
â€œHe opposed every single one of them .
Every single amendment , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œThe Gang of Eight voted as a gang against enforcing and securing the border.â€ � Rubio hit back at Cruz by noting the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s support for providing legal status to undocumented immigrants . â€œTed is a supporter of legalizing people that are in this country illegally ,
â€ �
Rubio told reporters while campaigning in South Carolina on Thursday .
â€œIn fact , when the Senate bill was proposed , he proposed giving them work permits .
Heâ€
™ s also supported a massive expansion of the green cards .
Heâ€
™ s supported a massive expansion of the HB-1 program , a 500 % increase .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think our positions are dramatically different.â€ �
But Rubio was also on the receiving end of an attack by Kentucky senator Rand Paul , who tried to tie immigration to Rubioâ€ ™ s tax plan in his own appearance Thursday on Ingrahamâ€
™ s show .
â€œI think Rubioâ€ ™ s tax plan would explode payments to illegal aliens and this a real problem until we fix the current tax credits .
Do you really want to double and triple what weâ€ ™ re giving?â€ � Paul said .
â€œI mean really , $ 4bn to illegal aliens ?
I think Rubioâ€ ™ s tax plan will extend more tax credits to illegal aliens and I think thereâ€ ™ s no way in the world we should be supporting something like this.â€ �
Rubioâ€ ™ s plan explicitly states that undocumented immigrants would not be eligible for any tax credits .
But Paul , whose campaign has struggled to break through , has also taken a more aggressive tack toward Rubio over the last week .
In an interview with CNN last Sunday , the Kentucky senator said Rubio would have to explain his prior immigration efforts , while adding that Rubioâ€ ™ s bill â€œwill be a big part of things.â€ �"
2015-11-14,"Ted Cruz led Republican criticism of White House policy on Syria on Saturday , in light of the devastating terror attacks in Paris , deriding Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s pledge to take more refugees and calling for intensified action against Islamic State .
Marco Rubio took a different tack , however , in declaring â€œa civilizational conflict with radical Islamâ€ � .
â€œThis is not a grievance - based conflict , â€ �
Rubio said in a video released by his presidential campaign .
â€œThis is a clash of civilizations .
And either they win , or we win.â€
�
Cruz and presidential candidates including Donald Trump , Bobby Jindal and Mike Huckabee seized on the news to demand drastic action on immigration , a hot - button issue on the campaign trail .
Rubio , however , has made foreign policy a central focus of his run for the White House .
In that light , he said the attacks in Paris were â€œa wake - up callâ€ � .
â€œThey literally want to overthrow our society and replace it with their radical , Sunni Islamic view of the future , â€ � the Florida senator said .
â€œThey do not hate us because we have military assets in the Middle East .
â€œThey hate us because of our values .
They hate us because young girls here go to school .
They hate us because women drive .
They hate us because we have freedom of speech , because we have diversity in our religious beliefs .
They hate us because weâ€ ™ re a tolerant society.â€ �
Cruz , the senator from Texas who is riding high with rightwing voters , unleashed a scathing indictment of Obama and Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton .
â€œPresident Obama and Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s idea that we should bring tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees to America
: it is nothing less than lunacy , â€ �
he said , in an interview with Fox News .
He later said the US should â€œnot allow jihadists to come back to America using US passports to murder innocent men and womenâ€ � .
Rubio also criticized the president for lacking a strategy against Isis .
The Florida senator called for a more aggressive tack against the militants , although he placed the onus on Sunni countries to defeat Isis â€œideologically and militarilyâ€ � with the US playing a supporting role .
Other candidates kept their focus on the implications of the Paris attacks for immigration policy .
The Kentucky senator Rand Paul went directly after Rubio , who two years ago co - authored a comprehensive immigration reform bill .
Paul said he had offered an amendment to Rubioâ€ ™ s bill that would have applied â€œspecial scrunityâ€ � to immigrants coming to the US from countries â€œthat have large jihadistsâ€ � .
He then accused Rubio of having done a â€œsecret dealâ€ � with Democrats to block any amendments to the bill .
â€œMy amendment ... was defeated because Rubio was more intent on working with Chuck Schumer than he was in working with conservatives , â€ �
Paul said .
Alex Conant , a spokesman for Rubio , disputed the claim .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know what Senator Paul is talking about .
The Senate voted on amendments , including conservative ones , â€ �
Conant told the Guardian .
â€œIt would appear Senator Paul is trying to change the subject away from his dangerous isolationist agenda and proposals to cut defense spending.â€ �
But in a sign that the immigration debate would continue to dominate the Republican primary , other contenders reacted to the Paris attacks with calls to ramp up security along US borders .
At a rally in Beaumont , Texas , Donald Trump said : â€œWith the problems our country has , to take in 250,000 people , some of whom are going to have problems , big problems , is just insane.â€ �
Elsewhere , Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal said it was time â€œto close our borders and keep our people safe from these radical , evil terroristsâ€ � .
Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee said : â€œWe donâ€ ™ t just have open borders like they do in Europe.â€
�
In September , the White House said it would accept 10,000 Syrian refugees in the fiscal year starting on 1 October 2015 , up from less than 2,000 .
Refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war have caused a crisis in Europe , where rightwing politicians reacted to the Paris attacks with tough rhetoric .
It was reported on Saturday that one of the gunmen who carried out the Paris attacks was a Syrian who passed through Greece as a refugee last month .
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the suicide bomb and shooting attacks in Paris on Friday night , in which 129 people were killed and 352 wounded , 99 of them critically .
The group said it had acted in response to French involvement in Syria .
On Saturday , the US military said an airstrike had killed the Isis leader in Libya .
Speaking to reporters ahead of a â€œrally for religious libertyâ€ � in Greenville , South Carolina , Cruz said of the victims of the Paris attacks : â€œThey were not injured by some faceless menace .
They were not injured by some abstract and inchoate violent extremism .
â€œThey were injured by radical Islamic terrorism , an evil that is at war with the people of America , that is at war with freedom - loving people across the globe.â€ � Repeating a common charge against Obama regarding semantics as much as policy , Cruz added : â€œWe need a commander - in - chief willing to utter the words â€˜radical Islamic terrorismâ€ ™ because it is the Islamists who embrace this extreme political and theological philosophy that â€ ¦ will murder or try to forcibly convert anyone that doesnâ€ ™ t share their extreme view of Islam.â€
�
Cruz continued :
â€œI call on Congress to pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act , legislation Iâ€ ™ ve introduced that says that any American who goes and takes up arms and joins Isis to wage jihad against the United States of America , that by doing so they forfeit their American citizenship .
â€œWe should not allow jihadists to come back to America using US passports to murder innocent men and women.â€ � Huckabee â€ “ who , unlike Cruz , is well off the pace in polls of the 2016 field and missed out on
this weekâ€
™ s
prime - time Republican debate â€ “ said Syrian refugees should be provided a safe haven , but it did not have to be in the US .
â€œWe need to have a better process , â€ � Huckabee said on CNN .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t just have open borders like they do in Europe.â€
�
Huckabee also attacked Obama for saying recently that Isis had been â€œcontainedâ€ � and said the president was more concerned with â€œimage of Islamâ€ � than defeating extremist terror groups .
The former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum , speaking at the Republican Party of Floridaâ€ ™ s Sunshine Summit , said he was uniquely qualified to lead the US in the effort against Islamic State because â€œno other presidential candidate has been in [ the ] Isis magazineâ€ � .
Promising a major offensive against Isis if he made it to the White House , he said : â€œThey know who I am and I know who they are.â€ �
In South Carolina , Cruz advocated a similar course of action and invoked a familiar Republican exemplar , saying : â€œWhat is the answer to radical Islamic terrorism ?
It is , to paraphrase President Ronald Reagan with regard to the Cold War , very simple .
We win , they lose .
That is the only appropriate resolution to this.â€ �
He continued : â€œIt would start with a commander - in - chief laying out the objective that we will utterly destroy Isis .
The next thing that would happen would be using overwhelming air power .
You know , in the first Persian Gulf war we launched roughly 1,100 air attacks a day .
Overwhelming air power .
â€œRight now , President Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day .
It is pinprick air assault .
It is photo - op foreign policy .
It makes for a good shot on CNN , but it doesnâ€ ™ t actually do anything to stop the terrorists.â€ �
On Friday , Cruz issued a statement which appeared to suggest that airstrikes that risked killing innocent civilians would be acceptable , given the nature of the threat ."
2015-11-15,"Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio on Sunday said the US should not take in more Syrian refugees in light of the terrorist attacks in Paris .
The Florida senator had previously signalled openness to relocating some of the millions fleeing the Syrian civil war to American shores .
On Sunday , as other Republican candidates rushed to condemn the Obama administration over its policy on Syria and Islamic State and its willingness to increase such admissions â€ “ and as the GOP governor of Michigan said his state would not after all welcome any Syrian refugees â€ “ he switched course .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not that we donâ€ ™ t want to , â€ �
Rubio said in an interview with ABC .
â€œItâ€
™ s that we canâ€ ™ t.â€ � Isis , which has strongholds in Iraq and Syria , has claimed responsibility for the suicide bombings and shootings in the French capital on Friday which killed 129 people and injured 352 others , 99 of them critically .
The US plans to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next year , significantly less than its European allies .
Like his rival Jeb Bush , Rubio cited concerns over the vetting of such refugees , stating there would be no way to conduct background checks in order to keep out potential terrorists .
â€œYou can have a thousand people come in and 999 of them are just poor people fleeing oppression and violence , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œBut one of them is an Isis fighter â€
“
if thatâ€ ™ s the case , you have a problem .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s no way to vet that out .
Thereâ€ ™ s no background check system in the world that allows us to find that out because who do you call in Syria to background check them?â€
�
Bush said the US should â€œcreate safe zones inside Syriaâ€ � .
He also appeared to advocate selective admittance on religious grounds when he said : â€œWe should focus our efforts as it relates to refugees on the Christians that are being slaughtered.â€ �
Rubio was one of the first Republican presidential contenders to indicate his support for accepting Syrian refugees , particularly Christians , in a September interview .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve always been a country
thatâ€ ™ s been willing to accept people who have been displaced , â€ � said Rubio , the son of Cuban migrants .
â€œI would be open to that if it can done in a way that allows us to ensure that among them are not infiltrated â€ ¦ people who were , you know , part of a terrorist organisation that are using this crisis.â€ �
Rubio raised questions over the vetting of refugees at a forum in Iowa last month , but he did not explicitly say the US should close the door .
Other Republican presidential candidates have pointed to the attacks in Paris as a reason for the US to enhance border security .
Michigan governor Rick Snyder had said his state would welcome Syrian refugees .
On Sunday he announced that he was postponing those plans .
â€œThere will be difficult days ahead for the people of France and they remain in our thoughts and prayers , â€ � Snyder said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s also important to remember that these attacks are the efforts of extremists and do not reflect the peaceful ways of people of Middle Eastern descent here and around the world.â€ �
He added , nonetheless , that his stateâ€ ™ s â€œfirst priority is protecting the safety of our residentsâ€ � .
By contrast , the Democratic presidential candidates largely maintained their support for accepting more refugees .
At the Democratic presidential debate on Saturday in Des Moines , Iowa , all three candidates said the attacks in Paris should not change the fact that the US could and should take in refugees .
But they agreed that background checks should be as thorough as possible , to ensure potential terrorists do not gain entry .
â€œI think that is the No 1 requirement , â€ � the frontrunner Hillary Clinton said .
â€œI also said that we should increase numbers of refugees .
â€œThe administration originally said [ 10,000 ] .
I said we should go to [ 65,000 ] , but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine , whatever resources it takes .
I do not want us to in any way inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.â€ �
Humanitarian groups have called on the US to accept 65,000 more refugees .
Former Maryland governor Martin Oâ€ ™ Malley was the first to call for that number and he stood by it on Saturday .
â€œI believe that that needs to be done with proper screening , â€ � Oâ€ ™ Malley said .
â€œBut accommodating 65,000 refugees in our country today , people of 320 million , is akin to making room for 6.5 more people in a baseball stadium with 32,000.â€ �
He said : â€œThere are other ways to lead and to be a moral leader in this world , rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike.â€ �
Vermont senator Bernie Sanders said there was â€œno magic numberâ€ � for refugee admissions , but he agreed the US had the â€œmoral responsibilityâ€ � to welcome refugees ."
2015-11-15,"Foreign policy hawks seized on the Paris terrorist attacks to argue for more aggressive military intervention in the Middle East , as national security issues assumed centre stage in the US presidential race .
Following a Democratic television debate on Saturday that was dominated by calls for a tougher response to Islamic State radicals , leading Republicans joined the fray on Sunday in a series of political interviews that also saw linked attacks on immigration and calls for more intelligence surveillance .
â€œThis is clearly an act of war and an attack on one of our Nato allies , and we should invoke Article 5 of the Nato agreement , and bring everyone together to put together a coalition to confront this challenge , â€ � Senator Marco Rubio said on ABC .
He was joined by his Florida rival Jeb Bush , who also demanded the US lead a new war to â€œeradicate Isis from the face of the earthâ€ � and warned that screening of Muslim refugees from Syria was unlikely to be fully effective in preventing terrorist infiltration of the US .
â€œUltimately , the best way to deal with the refugee crisis is to create safe zones inside Syria so that people donâ€ ™ t risk their lives and
you have donâ€ ™ t have what will be a national security challenge both for our country and Europe , â€ � Bush said on CNN .
â€œWe should focus our efforts as it relates to refugees on the Christians that are being slaughtered , â€ � he added , suggesting that specific efforts should take place to determine individualsâ€ ™ religion before refugees were admitted into the US .
Republicans are increasingly less reticent than Democrats to describe the battle against Isis in religious terms .
The South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham went furthest of all the presidential candidates on Sunday by demanding an immediate ground invasion of Syria .
â€œThe best thing the United States can do to protect our homeland is to go on offence , form a regional army â€ “ with the French involved if they would like to be â€ “ and go in on the ground and destroy their caliphate , â€ � Graham said .
â€œWe are going to fight [ Isis ] in their backyard or we are going to fight them in our backyard , â€ � he added , arguing thousands of US troops would be needed in Syria and Iraq to â€œpull the caliphate up by the roots , take back land held by Isil and hold it until Syria repairs itselfâ€
� .
Graham has long been an outlier even among hawkish Republicans , but his tone is increasingly matched by politicians in both parties as the White House struggles to articulate its compromise strategy of airstrikes and limited ground support from US special forces .
Administration officials were on the defensive on Sunday after a pre - recorded interview with Barack Obama in which the president boasted of â€œcontainingâ€ �
Isis was rapidly overtaken by events in France .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think theyâ€ ™ re gaining strength , â€ � said Obama in remarks to ABC that were recorded before the Paris attacks but after the Beirut and Russian aircraft bombings .
â€œFrom the start our goal has been first to contain , and we have contained them.â€ �
On Sunday , deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes insisted this was a â€œvery specific point that the president was makingâ€ � , rather than a broader claim of victory .
â€œThere is no question that this is a very significant threat that is going to require a long - term campaign and there are going to be setbacks , â€ � Rhodes said .
â€œWe have to very methodically degrade this threat , â€ � he added , pointing to fresh US attacks on a leading Isis figure in Libya .
Nonetheless , the slip has seen even Democrats distance themselves from Obamaâ€ ™ s strategy for tackling Isis .
â€œIt can not be contained .
It must be defeated , â€ � said Hillary Clinton at the outset of Saturdayâ€ ™ s second presidential debate .
â€œOur prayers are with the people of France tonight but that is not enough , â€ � she added .
â€œWe need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like Isis , the barbaric , ruthless , violent jihadist ,
terrorist group.â€ � Clintonâ€ ™ s rival Bernie Sanders briefly warned that the track record of US intervention in the Middle East had not helped .
But even Democrats running to the former secretary of stateâ€ ™ s left have criticised her for not being clear enough that the US has to lead action against Isis .
â€œI would disagree with Secretary Clinton , respectfully , on this score , â€ � said the former Maryland governor Martin Oâ€ ™ Malley in the debate .
â€œThis actually is Americaâ€ ™ s fight.â€ �
Bush also echoed calls made by the US intelligence community in the last 24 hours for the Paris attacks to lead to a rethink of recent reforms designed to protect against overly intrusive surveillance .
Meanwhile , Obama met Russian president Vladimir Putin on the fringes of the G20 summit in Turkey , to discuss diplomatic progress toward ending the civil war in Syria and call for a ceasefire ."
2015-11-18,"Cuban immigrants account for less than 1 % of the US population , but they are uniquely poised by our immigration system to receive power and status that , in just one generation , can produce a candidate â€ “ or two â€ “ ready to enter the political scene on a national level .
Thatâ€ ™ s why , though most Hispanics lean Democrat , though they are the largest minority population in the US , and though Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s entire presidential campaign should be a Hispanic recruitment coup for the Democratic party , itâ€ ™ s not actually surprising that the two Hispanic frontrunners in the presidential race , Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio , are both Republicans .
When pollsters say the vast majority of Hispanics lean Democrat , theyâ€ ™ re speaking of Mexican Americans , who make up the largest group of Hispanics by a landslide .
Nearly two - thirds of Hispanic Americans
â€ “ 64 %
â€ “ are of Mexican descent .
Sixty - five percent of those , or 22.3 million , are US - born .
Hispanics of Mexican origin make up 11 % of the US population .
But Mexican and Cuban immigrants have had vastly different experiences immigrating to this country .
When Cubans are caught entering the United States without documentation , theyâ€ ™ re granted refuge if they have at least one foot on US soil .
Before 1980 , when both Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s parents and Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s father arrived in this country , any Cuban could receive political refuge in the United States even if they were rescued at sea .
A year after arriving , those Cuban immigrants could apply for permanent residency and eventually US citizenship .
Think about that the next time you hear Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s father Rafael bragging about coming to the US legally .
Immigration policy is just the beginning of the Cuban immigrantâ€ ™ s advantage in the United States .
During Fidel Castroâ€ ™ s Cuba , which lasted until 2008 , US banks pioneered small business loans for Cuban exiles who had no credit or collateral in this country .
With that startup capital , Cuban immigrants were uniquely set up by the American establishment to succeed financially .
Their neighborhoods and communities were able to develop robust economic and political systems to support the success of newer Cuban immigrants .
Their descendants had a fast track to join the American elite .
As a result , according to the Pew Research Center , compared with the rest of the Hispanic population in the United States , Cubans have a higher level of education , higher median household income and higher rate of home ownership .
Mexican Americans , on the other hand , inherit a legacy of discrimination that goes back to the founding of this country .
The highly controversial Mexican American war , which secured Texas , California and the land in between for the US , is acknowledged by historians to be a land grab of dubious moral imperative .
General Ulysses S Grant , who fought in it , said it was â€œone of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation .
It was an instance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies , in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional territory.â€ �
The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 , but many of the Hispanic families that remained in the newly created American south - west had their land grants stolen by Anglo settlers .
These grabs were often backed by the American statesâ€ ™ court systems .
Thus began a grand American tradition of redlining American citizens of Mexican descent that continued openly until the 1980s , when it went largely underground .
It still exists today in the form of economically depressed neighborhoods and even whole regions , like the one from which I hail : the Rio Grande valley of Texas .
The legacy of over 150 years of Mexican Americans â€ “ and later , immigrants from throughout Latin America â€ “ being segregated into the poorest communities our country has to offer has resulted in Hispanic Americansâ€ ™ devastatingly low educational attainment rate and high rates of poverty , unemployment , incarceration and poor health .
These circumstances hardly provide a pool brimming with high - level political talent .
So Mexican Americans and other Hispanics are still not appearing in positions of national political power in proportion to their numbers â€ “ especially not within the Democratic party .
In fact , a recent op - ed from NBC News points out that Bob Menendez is the only Latino Democrat in the US Senate , and heâ€ ™ s in danger of losing the job due to possible federal corruption charges .
There are also only two Latino governors in the country , and they are both Republicans .
There are exceptions to these dire numbers .
I know hundreds of them .
Latinos who , despite growing up in less - than - ideal circumstances , managed through great parenting , the advantages won by civil rights activists of the baby boomer generation and some God - given brains , to rise to the top of their fields .
Two high - profile examples of this , and the best chance Americans have for a future Democratic presidential candidate of Hispanic descent , are the 41-year - old Castro twins of San Antonio , Texas .
Joaquin is a US congressman , and JuliÃ¡n was the mayor of San Antonio and now serves as the US secretary of housing and urban development .
Their mother , Rosie , is an activist who raised her sons on her own .
She taught them to value community service and education , and they both graduated from Stanford University and Harvard Law .
They have been in the national spotlight since Barack Obama ran for re - election and I believe they are , wisely , waiting until they are a little older before one of them throws his hat in the ring for the White House
â€ “ though there are rumors that JuliÃ¡n is on the shortlist to become Hillary Clintonâ€ ™
s
running mate
should she gain the Democratic nomination .
Texas Democratic party chairman Gilberto Hinojosa â€ “ the first Hispanic to hold the position
â€ “ told me in a written statement that his organization believes many issues important to Latinos , such as increasing incomes , making debt - free college a reality , ensuring paid - family leave , improving healthcare and fixing a broken immigration system , have been well represented by the current list of Democratic presidential candidates , but his organization hopes that whoever wins the nomination will consider a Latino running mate .
â€œTexas Democrats like JuliÃ¡n and Joaquin Castro have the values , government and leadership experience to be president , â€ � Hinojosa said .
For today , Hispanics have a choice between voting for a party that openly hates them and one that takes them for granted , because who else are they going to vote for ?
How long can Democrats hold on to Hispanics with this tactic ?
If the Republicans keep recruiting conservative Cubans , sooner or later they will grab a larger share of the rest of the Hispanic vote , too ."
2015-11-19,"In the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris , Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio has sought to reignite debate over the surveillance apparatus of the National Security Agency .
The Florida senator on Wednesday signed on to legislation that would delay the implementation of the sweeping surveillance reforms passed by Congress under the USA Freedom Act .
â€œThe Paris terrorist attacks remind us that no corner of the free world is safe from these savages , and it is our duty to defeat them by any means necessary , â€ �
Rubio said in a statement .
â€œThe USA Freedom Act signed into law earlier this year left our intelligence community with fewer tools to protect the American people and needlessly created more vulnerabilities and gaps in information gathering used to prevent terrorist attacks at home and abroad.â€ �
Under the USA Freedom Act , the NSAâ€ ™ s access to the phone data of millions of Americans will cease on 29 November .
The bill backed by Rubio , which was introduced by Arkansas senator Tom Cotton , another national security hawk , would extend the NSAâ€ ™ s bulk collection of phone records through 2017 .
It would also make permanent the authorization for roving wiretaps and the targeting of so - called lone wolf terrorists .
Rubio , a top contender for the Republican presidential nomination , has long been a staunch advocate of NSA surveillance powers .
Throughout the debate over surveillance , he warned that any efforts to curtail the agencyâ€ ™ s intelligence - gathering capabilities would hinder the fight against terrorism .
Rubioâ€ ™ s preference was to permanently reauthorize key provisions of the Patriot Act .
â€œWe also can not afford to ignore another lesson of 9/11 and curtail intelligence - gathering capabilities that have been legally and painstakingly established following those horrific attacks , â€ �
Rubio wrote in an op - ed earlier this year .
He also repeatedly called Edward Snowden , the former contractor who made the NSA revelations to the Guardian and other media outlets in 2013 , a â€œtraitorâ€ � .
â€œI can tell you we know less about our adversaries today than we need to know or should have known because of the information he released , â€ �
Rubio told voters while campaigning in South Carolina this summer .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s done terrible damage to this country and put the lives of real Americans at danger because of it.â€ �
Itâ€ ™ s unclear if the Senate will revisit a debate over surveillance or hold a vote to prolong the NSAâ€ ™ s authorities .
A Republican aide said efforts to block the USA Freedom Act from taking effect were â€œgoing nowhereâ€ � , given the probability that Democrats would filibuster it and president Obama would most certainly veto it .
The House of Representatives also voted overwhelmingly in favor of ending the bulk collection program .
But for Rubio , who has made foreign policy a central tenet of his campaign , an opportunity has emerged to cast himself as stronger on national security than his Republican rivals .
He has drawn a contrast to Ted Cruz and Rand Paul , two other first - term senators seeking the Republican nomination who have been more critical of the NSA .
Cruz and Paul spent the last week attacking Rubio over his record on immigration , going so far as to imply that an immigration reform bill he co - authored would have made it easier for extremists to enter the US .
But while Cruz and Paul have gained steam among the grassroots over the years in part due to their libertarian tendencies , polling has consistently reflected that national security is a top priority for the current Republican primary electorate .
Rubio , whose foreign policy resume includes positions on the Senate foreign relations committee and select committee on intelligence , said on Wednesday there was â€œno one running for presidentâ€ � who had access to more sensitive information than he did .
Speaking with conservative radio show host Hugh Hewitt , Rubio laid into Cruz , in particular , over his support for the USA Freedom Act in June .
â€œHe was a part of that coalition that worked with the Democrats like Chuck Schumer and the ACLU [ American Civil Liberties Union ] to harm our intelligence programs , â€ � Rubio said , adding that he had â€œparted waysâ€ � with Cruz on several defense issues .
â€œ[Cruz ] voted for budgets that have hurt the military .
He voted for a budget that basically gutted our foreign aid program , particularly our defense of the Israelis and the aid that weâ€ ™ ve provided them.â€ � Cruz has dismissed Rubioâ€ ™ s criticism as an attempt to shift the conversation away from his immigration record .
The Texas senator also reiterated his support for the USA Freedom Act , telling a forum hosted by the Washington Examiner on Wednesday he opposed the Tom Cotton bill and that there was no need to put the NSA reforms on hold .
â€œThe USA Freedom Act preserved the law enforcement tools to target the bad guys , â€ � he said , in an answer to a question .
He added : â€œI believe it is possible for the federal government to do two things at once .
To protect the constitutional rights and privacy of law - abiding citizens , and at the same time to target the bad guys and go after terrorists.â€ �
Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign has also pushed back by pointing out that several conservatives , including some who have endorsed Rubioâ€ ™ s candidacy , voted for the USA Freedom Act ."
2015-11-22,"Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio has vowed to use American forces to inflict â€œhigh - profile , humiliating defeatsâ€ � on Islamic State jihadis , to show the world they are not invincible .
In an interview with the Guardian while he campaigned across Iowa this weekend , the Florida senator detailed a strategy to fight Isis that left no options off the table â€ “ including US ground troops to support a coalition led by Sunni nations .
In a wide - ranging examination of US foreign policy , he also : Dismissed Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s controversial plan to broadly target mosques and create Muslim registries as â€œnot a serious proposalâ€ � .
Accused Republican rivals Ted Cruz and Rand Paul of taking steps that would weaken American defense and intelligence - gathering capabilities .
Signalled that he would not be able to work with Russia as a partner in attempting to resolve the chaos in Syria .
Rubio spoke during a swing through Iowa , one week after the terrorist attacks on Paris that killed 130 people and injured hundreds more .
The aftermath of those attacks and the stated threat of similar violence in Brussels provided a greater sense of urgency to his pitch for a more hawkish foreign policy .
Speaking with the Guardian , Rubio criticized Barack Obama for having only â€œcomponents of a strategyâ€ �
but no comprehensive plan to take on Isis .
He nonetheless maintained that â€œthe bulk of the ground workâ€ � would rest on the shoulders of Sunni Arabs in the region .
â€œThe only way to defeat Isis is for Sunni Arabs themselves to reject them ideologically and defeat them militarily , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œThey must be defeated on the ground with a ground force that is made up primarily of Arab Sunni fighters from Iraq , from Syria , but also from Jordan , from Egypt , from the Emirates , from Saudi Arabia.â€ �
While the US would need to support that coalition with increased airstrikes and by embedding special operations forces on the ground , he said , Rubio would not specify the number of American ground troops that might be needed , nor would he place a limit on what that commitment might look like .
â€œI believe it will require some level of special operators on the ground , â€ � he said ,
â€œto subject Isis to high - profile , humiliating defeats , to sort of reverse this narrative that theyâ€ ™ ve created that they are an invincible force.â€ �
Rubio said the size of such an American special operations force â€œwould depend on our military tacticians to outline a strategy and tell us what the commitment would be .
â€œWhatever it is , weâ€ ™ re going to do that .
If youâ€ ™ re going to engage militarily , you have to ensure you have the resources to win , not simply to have a symbolic gesture .
â€œSo unlike this president , our troop strength in an effort like that will be determined by whatâ€ ™ s necessary to achieve victory , not some artificial constraint or an artificial number that I make up in my own head.â€
� Obama has rejected calls for major ground forces in Iraq and Syria , a position he maintained after the Paris attacks .
â€œIt is not just my view , but the view of my closest military and civilian advisers , that that would be a mistake , â€ � the president told reporters at the G20 summit meeting in Turkey last week .
Rubio has also joined calls for the imposition of a no - fly zone in Syria .
Asked how this could avoid conflict with Russia , which is also carrying out airstrikes in the country , he said : â€œRussia says itâ€ ™ s there to fight against Isis .
Our no - fly zone would not have Isis fighters in it.â€ �
He added : â€œThe problem is , I donâ€ ™ t think Russiaâ€ ™ s geopolitical interests overlap ours at this moment .
Other than that they now have a motive for some revenge attacks against Isis [ after the downing of a Metrojet airliner , an attack claimed by Isis ] , their goal in this region is to prop up [ Bashar al - Assad ] .
And as long as Assad is in power , there will be no solution to this problem.â€
�
At a campaign rally in West Des Moines on Saturday , Rubio laid into Obama publicly for what he said was a â€œfecklessâ€ � approach to the turmoil in the Middle East .
He also rebuked the president for â€œspending more time attacking Republicans than talking about how he would attack Isisâ€ � .
Obama has , on a number of occasions over the last week , condemned Republican presidential candidates over their opposition to accepting more Syrian refugees after the tragedy in Paris .
â€œHe accused us of being xenophobes because we want to protect America , â€ �
Rubio told the crowd , who had braved the first snowstorm of the season in the midwest to see him speak .
The senator told the Guardian there had been â€œa fundamental distortionâ€ � of what the refugee debate was about .
â€œThis is not about turning away Muslim refugees , this is not about turning away refugees , â€ � he said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not that we donâ€ ™ t want to accept refugees , itâ€ ™ s not that weâ€ ™ re going to have a religious test .
Itâ€ ™ s that you may not be able to fully vet everyone and
if you canâ€ ™ t vet someone , you canâ€ ™ t let them in.â€ �
Other Republican presidential contenders , such as Cruz and former Florida governor Jeb Bush , have pushed for allowing in only Christian refugees fleeing war - torn Syria .
Cruz even attempted to pass legislation specifically barring Middle Eastern refugees from entering the US for a period of three years , while Kentucky senator Rand Paul pushed bills to ban the resettlement of refugees from 34 â€œhigh - riskâ€ � countries and strip refugees from those nations of access to social welfare assistance .
Trump has gone a step further with a series of controversial statements in the last week .
The real estate billionaire said his administration would close down some mosques and later backed the idea of creating a national registry for Muslims .
Rubio pushed back on Trumpâ€ ™ s suggestion , arguing it was â€œnot a serious proposalâ€ � .
â€œWe have a registry of people that come into the country , so thatâ€ ™ s not by religious affiliation , itâ€ ™ s a registry of people that are here on visas or people who have immigrated here , â€ � Rubio said .
Rubio reiterated his view that any facility where terrorism was inspired â€ “ be it a mosque , community center , or website â€ “ should be targeted .
But he added that â€œthe enormous majority of mosques in this country have nothing to do with radical Islamâ€ � .
â€œWe need to focus in on areas where people are being radicalized , but that doesnâ€ ™ t mean you go around saying youâ€ ™ re going to target specifically centers of worship.â€
�
Ever since Rubio declared his candidacy in April , foreign policy has been a cornerstone of his campaign .
The senator routinely indicts the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s handling of international affairs into his stump speech , criticisms which have only grown sharper in the aftermath of the Paris attacks .
In addition to being a longtime critic of Obamaâ€ ™ s policy toward Syria , Rubio ranks among the most vocal opponents of the nuclear deal in Iran and is a staunch defender of National Security Agency surveillance .
The latter distinguishes Rubio from Cruz and Paul , the other first - term senators seeking the Republican nomination .
Unlike Rubio , they have sided with civil liberties advocates and backed legislation reining in the NSAâ€ ™ s bulk collection of phone records .
And while Cruz and Paul have escalated attacks on Rubio for co - authoring a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013 they claim loosened security at the US border , Rubio has responded in kind by highlighting their votes on issues pertaining to defense .
â€œThey make that argument to distract from their own record on national security , â€ � Rubio said in the interview .
â€œBoth Ted Cruz and Rand Paul have voted to weaken the Defense Department ...
Ted Cruz recently joined with Rand Paul to weaken our intelligence programs.â€ �
Rubioâ€ ™ s willingness to throw punches at his opponents marks a shift from the early months of his campaign , when he repeatedly declined to respond to attacks from other Republicans .
But with a crowded Republican field , the race remains wide open .
As the Iowa caucuses approach , Rubio is seeking to build on momentum gained from strong debate performances .
The inching of voter priorities towards national security could prove an asset .
â€œThe national security of our country is the most important issue that the federal government deals with , â€ � he said , â€œand our next commander - in - chief has to be someone with a strong record on national security.â€ �"
2015-11-23,"Ten Republican US senators , including presidential candidate Marco Rubio , have written to the Pentagon and military chiefs demanding to know why the joint chiefs of staff ( JCS ) apparently withheld their approval for the recent release of British resident Shaker Aamer from GuantÃ¡namo Bay .
The senators have written to the secretary of defense , Ashton Carter , asking why the JCS , a body of senior uniformed leaders who act as Carterâ€ ™ s advisers , was not listed in the official authorization of Aamerâ€ ™ s release last month among the agencies that approved it .
The conservative politicians suggested that the absence of their sign - off was a breach of normal protocol .
In the letter , which was also circulated to the current chairman of the JCS , General Joseph Dunford , the senators floated the idea that the apparent dissent of the military chiefs was motivated by security issues .
â€œWere the Joint Chiefs
concerned that [ Aamerâ€ ™ s ] release could put at risk the lives of US service members?â€ � they wrote .
But Aamerâ€ ™ s lawyer Clive Stafford Smith of the UK - based human rights group Reprieve dismissed the letters as political posturing on the part of the Republicans .
â€œThe JCS never gets to sign off on releases â€
“ itâ€ ™ s the defense secretaryâ€ ™ s decision and he sends the notice to Congress , which he did in this case without any objections.â€
�
The Republican senators have unwittingly cast light on further evidence that President Obamaâ€ ™ s stated desire to close GuantÃ¡namo has been met by internal resistance from powerful elements of the military .
Though he has promised to shut the prison by the time he steps down in January 2017 , Obama faces strong opposition from senior military chiefs who answer to him as commander - in - chief .
â€œThis strikes me as elements in the Pentagon resisting the Obama administration in its efforts to close the prison , â€ � Stafford Smith said .
Aamer was released on 30 October after almost 14 years of incarceration at GuantÃ¡namo without charge or trial .
He was transferred back to the UK , where his family lives , following high - level lobbying of the White House by British officials including prime minister David Cameron .
The detainee had been cleared for release in 2009 but remained in the notorious detention camp in Cuba for six more years as a result of foot - dragging by senior Obama administration officials , largely within the Pentagon .
Carterâ€ ™ s predecessor as defense secretary , Chuck Hagel , was dismissed last year partly because of his resistance to closing GuantÃ¡namo despite President Obamaâ€ ™ s pledge to do so .
Carter was appointed with the mandate to speed up the process of closing the prison by accelerating detainee transfers to other countries .
Yet the Guardian reported in August that Carter himself , backed by powerful US military officials , was personally blocking Aamerâ€ ™ s release .
The normal review procedure that decides whether a GuantÃ¡namo prisoner is safe to be transferred is conducted by six US government agencies .
Four of them are known to have given their unanimous consent to Aamerâ€ ™ s transfer : the US Justice Department , the State Department , the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence .
Carter eventually came around to releasing Aamer and put his signature to the release papers in September , kicking off a 30-day period that culminated in the prisonerâ€ ™ s flight to the UK last month .
What remains unclear is the position adopted by the joint chiefs during the protracted discussions .
According to the US senators , the JCS withheld its approval for Aamerâ€ ™ s transfer from the final release papers .
In the letters , the GOP politicians effectively accuse the Pentagon of lying to the public when it said in a press release that â€œAamer was unanimously approved for transfer by the six departments and agencies comprising the GuantÃ¡namo Review task forceâ€ � .
That â€œseems misleadingâ€ � , the senators wrote .
The Pentagon , however , stands by its story .
A military spokesman , Cmdr Gary Ross , told the Guardian in a statement : â€œIn 2009 , the Joint Chiefs of Staff was part of the six - agency GuantÃ¡namo Review Task Force which conducted a comprehensive review of this case .
As a result of that review , which examined a number of factors , including security issues , Aamer was unanimously approved for transfer pending appropriate security and treatment agreements by the six departments and agencies comprising the taskforce.â€ �
Ross went on to say that it was inappropriate â€œto discuss internal and pre - decisional matters .
The secretary of defense makes the final decision to transfer detainees.â€ �"
2015-11-23,"The man considered the father figure of environmental protection in the US has attacked Republicans for â€œgoing through all the stages of denialâ€ � over climate change , accusing leading presidential contenders Donald Trump and Marco Rubio of ignoring science for political gain .
William Ruckelshaus , who on Tuesday is to receive the nationâ€ ™ s highest civilian honor , the presidential medal of freedom , told the Guardian that leading Republicans are harming the USâ€ ™ s reputation by attempting to stymie efforts to tackle climate change .
The criticism is particularly stinging as Ruckelshaus previously ran for election as a Republican and was appointed by Richard Nixon as the first head of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 .
Ronald Reagan appointed him to a second term at the federal regulator in 1983 .
â€œThe [ Obama ] administration is trying to lead on climate change but they arenâ€ ™ t getting much support from the Republicans who have turned it into a partisan issue , which is too bad , â€ �
Ruckelshaus said .
â€œIf
they are successful , that will set us back a fair bit .
It wonâ€
™ t look good to the world and it wonâ€ ™ t be good for the US.â€ � Republican leaders , who have signaled their opposition to any deal at looming climate talks in Paris , have attempted to dismantle key elements of Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s strategy to lower emissions .
The Republican - dominated Senate voted on Tuesday to repeal Obamaâ€ ™ s centerpiece policy that uses the EPA to enforce rules to cut pollution from power plants .
Mitch McConnell , the senate majority leader , said Republicans were protecting middle - class Americans from â€œdeeply regressive energy regulations that would eliminate good - paying jobs and punish the poorâ€ � .
Obama has vowed to veto any repeal , but any Republican who succeeded him as president appears unlikely to follow suit .
Trump , a leading contender for the Republican nomination , has called global warming â€œbullshitâ€ � and a â€œtotal and very expensive hoaxâ€ � .
Ben Carson , another potential nominee , has said climate change is â€œnot a big dealâ€ � , while Florida senator Marco Rubio said last year that scientists have taken â€œa handful of decades of research and say that this is now evidence of a longer - term trend thatâ€ ™ s directly and almost solely attributable to man - made activity .
I donâ€
™ t agree with that.â€ �
Ruckelshaus criticised the current Republican leadership for â€œresisting doing anythingâ€ � on climate change in a bid to appease the partyâ€ ™ s increasingly conservative voting base .
The 83-year - old was appointed the first administrator of the EPA in 1970 by Nixon , leading the landmark introduction of pollution regulations before standing down in 1973 .
He then served a second stint heading the federal regulator under Ronald Reagan from 1983 to 1985 .
Prior to the EPA , he ran for the Senate as a Republican .
â€œThe Republicans arenâ€ ™ t helping , they are just responding to the convictions of the base that climate change isnâ€ ™ t a real problem and feeding that back to them
â€
“ itâ€ ™ s a vicious cycle , â€ � he said .
â€œInstead of treating it as a serious problem they are going through all the stages of denial .
They are now at the stage of saying that itâ€ ™ s too expensive to do anything about climate change , which is no solution at all , they may as well just deny itâ€ ™ s a problem .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know what Trump actually knows about climate change , I donâ€
™ t think Trump thinks much about many of the issues .
Rubio shifts around a lot because he hears a lot of different messages from his constituents but what heâ€ ™ s essentially saying is that climate change isnâ€ ™ t a big enough problem to address .
That comes down to not dealing with it .
Itâ€ ™ s concerning and I donâ€
™ t understand why they donâ€ ™ t see this as an opportunity rather than something to be denied.â€ �
â€œThere was huge resistance from the auto industry , they pushed back very hard , â€ � Ruckelshaus said .
â€œThe difference from then until now is that the public demanded something be done about pollution and the government listened .
The four major auto companies sent their CEOs to lobby against the Clean Air Act and they got about three votes in the Senate and not many more in the House .
They thought theyâ€ ™
d get it reversed in the House and they didnâ€ ™ t get anywhere .
â€œIn those days you could smell and touch the pollution , it was a bit like how Chinaâ€ ™ s cities are today .
That had a galvanizing effect .
The greenhouse gases of today , you canâ€ ™ t see or taste or feel them .
And itâ€ ™ s got way too partisan .
The atmosphere today is completely different to the 1970s ; Republicansâ€ ™ arguments are all partisan driven , they arenâ€ ™ t based on any legitimate analysis of science.â€
�
Under Obamaâ€ ™ s plan to slash the USâ€ ™ s output of greenhouse gases , the EPA will treat carbon dioxide as a pollutant and will ensure that power plants cut emissions by 32 % by 2030 on 2005 levels .
A coalition of 24 states and a coal mining companies have filed lawsuits against what they call the â€œflatly illegalâ€ � regulations , claiming that they represent an overreach of executive power .
But Ruckelshaus said the new use of the EPAâ€ ™ s powers was â€œexactly how the Clean Air Act was meant to work in the first placeâ€ � .

2015-11-24,"Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio said the US should be â€œvigilantâ€ � in prosecuting police officers who do a bad job , but he also warned of the danger of demonizing people in law enforcement in the wake of a number of high - profile cases .
The Guardian asked Rubio during an interview on the campaign trail in Iowa if the Justice Department should require police departments nationwide to report on excessive use of force and killings by law enforcement .
Rubio did not call for a federal database of such incidents , but said they are reported â€œin essenceâ€ � by the media .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s no police incident that exists in this country
thatâ€ ™ s not documented in the press , so it wouldnâ€ ™ t be hard to put that together one way or another , â€ � he said .
The issue has risen to national prominence following a series of high - profile killings by police of unarmed black men , including Michael Brown in Ferguson , Missouri and Eric Garner in New York .
The Guardian has an ongoing investigation , The Counted , into the use of lethal force by police , recording every death caused by law enforcement in the US in 2015 .
The crowdsourced investigative project has so far found a total of 1,024 deaths this year .
Last month , FBI director James Comey said it was â€œunacceptableâ€ � that the Guardian and the Washington Post , which has a similar project on police killings , have better data on police shootings than the federal government .
Rubio said it was imperative that the debate over criminal justice not â€œdemonizeâ€ � law enforcement while addressing areas of mistrust between certain communities and police .
â€œI think we need to understand that
yes , there are communities in this country where the police department does not have a good relationship with the local community , and there are instances in this country where police officers use excessive force , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œBut the vast majority of police officers â€ “ this is what we can not forget â€ “ the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country are doing a good job .
â€œAnd so we should be vigilant about those rare officers out there that are doing a bad job , and there are laws in the books to prosecute people for civil rights violations and so forth .
But we should not allow that to create this environment that exists now , where police officers are being demonized and in some instances specifically targeted .
I think thatâ€ ™ s
not only unfair , itâ€ ™ s dangerous.â€
� â€œThey are the only thing standing between us and danger .
They are the first people weâ€ ™ re going to call if our family is in trouble , â€ � he added .
Rubio has generally struck a measured tone while discussing police brutality and Black Lives Matter , the movement seeking to highlight discrimination against communities of color in the criminal justice system .
The US Congress is poised to debate a bipartisan bill that , if passed , would usher in significant reforms to mandatory minimums for nonviolent drug offenders â€ “ an area that disproportionately affects African American and Hispanic communities in America .
Although it does not make specific changes to police conduct , the measure seeks to address the systemic incarceration of minorities and has the backing of the White House .
Rubio has not taken a position on the bill , although he told the Guardian at a campaign stop last month he was supportive of lowering mandatory minimums for nonviolent offenders and was reviewing the criminal justice compromise in the Senate ."
2015-11-25,"On a blustery afternoon in eastern Iowa , Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s voice grew stern as he sounded a warning one week after deadly terrorist attacks struck Paris .
â€œWe face the rapid spread of radical jihadists , â€ � the Republican presidential candidate told his audience at a town hall held in a hotel just off the interstate .
â€œWe find ourselves today in a clash of civilizations between these radical animals , who believe that anyone who does not share their interpretation of their faith , that they have a God - given obligation to slaughter them.â€ �
â€œItâ€ ™ s a fight between them and the rest of the civilized world.â€ �
Rubio was referring to the Islamic State , the exceptionally brutal terrorist group that claimed responsibility for the assault on Paris that killed 130 people and injured hundreds of others .
â€œThey hate us because of our freedoms , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œThey hate us because in America , women drive cars .
They hate us because in America , little girls are sent to school .
Thatâ€ ™ s why they hate us.â€
�
The rhetoric was not entirely new , mirroring a statement the senator issued by video the day after the attack and responses in interviews that followed .
But it was an adjustment to his typical stump speech that was reflective of what could be a turning point in the Republican presidential primary â€ “ a focus on foreign policy , a central theme of Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign .
Several voters who attended events across Rubioâ€ ™ s five - day swing through Iowa said they were increasingly concerned about national security .
â€œThe most important thing to me is keeping us safe and itâ€ ™ s a strong part of his message , â€ � said John G , a resident of Glenwood , who added he was â€œleaning stronglyâ€ � toward Rubio .
â€ �
Heâ€ ™ s definitely got the experience , heâ€ ™ s been on the intelligence committee , and foreign policy is definitely a weakness for some of the other candidates at the top of the polls.â€ �
Rob Mauritz , who attended a Rubio rally in West Des Moines , also cited foreign affairs as a major factor in his selection of a candidate .
â€œI think
heâ€ ™ d be a much better world leader in that same situation that Obama was in last week after Paris
, â€ �
Mauritz said of Rubio .
â€œI think youâ€ ™ d get much stronger American answers.â€ �
Unlike some of his Republican rivals who until Paris did not emphasize foreign policy on the campaign trail , Rubioâ€ ™ s message to voters has been laced with scathing critiques of the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s handling of international relations since day one .
He seldom mentions world leaders not considered to be American allies by their names â€ “ Kim Jong - un is a â€œlunatic in North Koreaâ€ � , Vladimir Putin a â€œgangster in Moscowâ€ � , and Hassan Rouhani a â€œradical Shia cleric in Iranâ€ � .
China , Rubio often says , is on the verge of a rapid military expansion that must be countered .
Other staples include a vow to rescind the nuclear accord with Iran , a willingness to refer to the threat posed by terrorists as â€œradical Islamâ€ � , and an unwavering commitment to Israel .
Oftentimes
these are his biggest applause lines , offering a window into the mindset of Republican primary voters this cycle who have consistently ranked national security as a top priority .
Rubioâ€ ™ s riff on the civilizational clash confronting the western world at the Cedar Rapids town hall was met not with applause but with quiet contemplation .
Soon after , one voter seated in the front row voiced his concern .
Language like â€œwar of civilizationsâ€
� , he said , was a mischaracterization that might â€œinflame Islamophobiaâ€
� .
â€œIt looks like youâ€ ™ re talking about all of Islam around the world , and youâ€ ™ re really only talking about a fanatical splinter group that is obviously quite dangerous , â€ � the man said .
â€œBut itâ€ ™ s not a war of civilizations , itâ€ ™ s a war against a particular group.â€ � â€œWhen
you use rhetoric like that , then I think people in this culture will tend to become more anti - Islamic in general .
And not being willing to welcome [ Syrian ] refugees
â€ ¦
this is turning us in an ugly way that I think is very un -
American.â€ �
Rubio was anything but thrown off guard by the questioning of his tone â€
“
he launched instead into a response that , at nearly six minutes , sounded like a condensed speech of its own .
â€œThis is not a geopolitical conflict .
This is not a conflict between Isis because they want us out of the Middle East , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œThis is a civilizational conflict â€ “ not with Islam â€
“ with radical Islam , particularly their interpretation of radical Islam.â€
�
Arab - Muslim leaders , from the Egyptian president to the King of Jordan , had used a similar phrase to define the battle against extremists , he pointed out .
â€œWe will need Muslims to defeat Isis â€ “ in fact , I believe the only way we can defeat them is for Sunni Muslims to ideologically reject them and militarily to defeat them , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œBut we have to be able to say clearly , this is a clash between two very different views.â€
�
â€œThis is an apocalyptic view of Islam â€
¦
I know these things start to sound a little eccentric , but the truth is that is at the fundamental core of this conflict and we must understand it , â€ � he added .
Rubio also clarified , after initially ruling out allowing more refugees into the US , that â€œcommonsenseâ€ � rules still apply to groups of people who can be vetted â€ “ children , widows , the elderly or a â€œwell - known Chaldean
priestâ€ � .
But he explained his opinion that background checks could not be completed on the majority .
â€œYou know that there is a radical and capable group that is openly trying to use the refugee crisis as a way to infiltrate fighters into other countries , â€ � Rubio said , as his voice grew emphatic .
â€œHow can we ignore that ?
How irresponsible and reckless is that?â€
�
â€œThis is not an anti - Muslim , it is not â€ ¦ radical jihad is a view of civilization that we must reject and defeat for what it is .
Either they win , or we do.â€
�
The applause that had earlier been missing suddenly erupted within the room .
Concerns among Americans over national security have already risen in the aftermath of Paris , as Obamaâ€ ™ s marks on fighting terrorism have dropped .
Rubio , whose foreign policy pitch is ostensibly rooted in â€œrestoring American strengthâ€ � , moved quickly in the last week to position himself as the most prepared candidate to be the next commander - in - chief .
On Sunday , his campaign released its first television ad centered on national security and the fight against Isis .
Set against a dark backdrop , Rubio again cautions of the â€œcivilizational struggleâ€ � in a straight - to - camera appeal .
â€œWhat happened in Paris could happen here ,
â€ � he says .
Although at 44 he is one of the youngest candidates in the race , Rubio has used his positions on the Senate foreign relations committee and select committee on intelligence to distinguish himself from a crowded Republican field of 14 remaining candidates .
â€œFrom my perspective , thereâ€ ™ s no one running for president that has access to more sensitive information than I do , â€ �
Rubio told radio show host Hugh Hewitt last week .
He has also used the moment to underscore his differences with two other first - term senators seeking the Republican nomination â€ “ Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky , who supported major reforms to the National Security Agencyâ€ ™ s surveillance methods , of which Rubio is a staunch defender .
Cruz and Paul , for their part , responded to the tragedy in Paris by pushing various pieces of anti - refugee legislation .
Their posture on the question of military intervention has been less hawkish than that of Rubio , who said he was prepared to deploy US ground troops as part of his strategy to combat Isis .
â€œI believe it will require some level of special operators on the ground to subject Isis to high - profile , humiliating defeats , â€ � Rubio told the Guardian in an interview in Iowa , â€œto sort of reverse this narrative that theyâ€ ™ ve created that they are an invincible force.â€ �
At another campaign stop in Iowa , he went a step further by suggesting US raids on Isis be filmed and put up on YouTube to reverse their propaganda machine .
â€œI want the world to see how these Isis leaders cry like babies when theyâ€ ™ re captured , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œI want the world to see how these Isis leaders , once captured , begin to sing like canaries if they survive.â€
�
The message of fortitude nonetheless requires a balancing act in a country exhausted by over a decade of war .
Rubio declined to specify , when asked by the Guardian , how many US ground forces his strategy might require and maintained that the â€œbulk of the ground workâ€ � would lay with Sunni Arabs in the region .
In a subsequent appearance on Fox News , Rubio emphasized that he was not calling for â€œa return to Iraqâ€ � .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re not talking about 100,000 or 50,000 armed soldiers , but we are talking about force with specific missions that will have to be embedded , that this president and the United States must put together if we are to defeat Isis on the ground , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s the only way to do it .
They have to be defeated by a ground force and have to be made up primarily of Sunnis.â€
�
Voters , at least for now , did not appear to be concerned with the specifics so much as an idea that a candidate had a plan to make them feel more safe .
Aaron Sewell , a resident of West Des Moines , offered one such example .
Naming education as his top issue , he went on to quote from the speech Rubio had delivered moments before : â€œIf weâ€ ™ re not safe and secure here at home , then none of this matters.â€ � â€œA lot of that has to do with paying attention to foreign policy , and obviously with the terrorist attacks in Paris
itâ€ ™ s come back to the forefront , â€ �
Sewell said .
â€œIt doesnâ€
™ t mean sending in ground forces , but it means a candidate is attentive to whatâ€ ™ s going on around the world and how much it can affect us if weâ€ ™ re not ready to face these challenges.â€ �"
2015-12-02,"A conservative group backed by the billionaire Koch brothers and their wealthy allies boasts a scorecard on its website that rates the presidential candidates based on their opposition to policies meant to tackle climate change , such as EPA regulation of greenhouse gas emissions , a renewable fuels standard , and a tax credit that benefits wind energy .
Texas senator Ted Cruz scored the highest rating on the American Energy Alliance site , which labelled him a â€œheroâ€ � due in part to his opposition to regulation and taxes .
Cruz was followed on the scorecard by four other Republican candidates â€ “ Florida senator Marco Rubio , ex - Florida governor Jeb Bush , ex - Hewlett - Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and Kentucky senator Rand Paul , who were named as â€œdefendersâ€ � .
Other GOP candidates , such as Donald Trump and Ben Carson , were labelled â€œdoubtersâ€ � , while Hillary Clinton and her Democratic rivals Bernie Sanders and Martin Oâ€ ™ Malley were bottom of the heap and branded â€œvillainsâ€ � .
As Republican presidential candidates compete to corral big checks from the industrialists Charles and David Koch and the 400-odd super - rich donors who support their political and advocacy network , the AEA scorecard is one of a number of tools that Koch - backed outfits are using to test the hopefulsâ€ ™ conservative credentials â€ “ and perhaps sway their stances â€ “ on major energy issues and other free market , small government priorities they support .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a public negotiation with these candidates to see which ones will be best on their pet issues , like climate change and environmental regulations , â€ � said one senior conservative operative .
Freedom Partners , the funding arm of the Koch network , and Americans for Prosperity , a leading political and advocacy group in the network , hosted separate multi - day gatherings in August which drew several candidates deemed strong on energy matters , plus slashing regulations and taxes .
The events drew Rubio , Cruz , Bush and a few other contenders who gave talks stressing their pro free enterprise bona fides .
The Koch networkâ€ ™ s intense political vetting process underscores the high stakes for candidates scrambling for six- and seven - figure checks for Super Pacs backing their campaigns , as well as scores of donors seeking the strongest candidate to implement their deregulatory climate - change skeptical and low tax agendas .
Super Pacs sprang up after the supreme court overturned decades of campaign finance law in 2010 and allowed corporations , individuals and unions to give unlimited sums to ostensibly independent groups promoting federal candidates .
With two months to go before the first primaries , Charles and David Koch have given mixed signals about their plans .
In April , Charles Koch told USA Today that he and his brother might back more than one candidate in the primaries , suggesting that if â€œthey want our support , one way to get it is to articulate a good messageâ€ � on certain policies .
But in late November , in another USA Today interview , he took another tack .
â€œI have no plans to support anyone in the primaries now , â€ � he said , leaving himself some wiggle room but surprising some donors and fellow conservatives .
â€œMy view is that [ Charles Koch ] is trying to set up an advocacy competition between the major candidates for the support of network donors , â€ � said former House majority leader Dick Armey , who after he left Congress spent about two years chairing a now defunct Koch - backed lobbying group .
â€œAnybody who wants to get enthusiastic support from the Kochs is going to have to show real enthusiasm on the climate issue.â€ �
The Koch brothers , whose combined net worth is close to $ 88bn , derive their fortunes from Koch Industries , the energy and industrial giant they control .
The brothers and their donor network have long fought climate change regulations and several other high - profile EPA rules for a mix of ideological and business reasons , say some conservatives .
Charles Koch has strongly rejected the idea that his political and advocacy efforts are driven by bottom - line concerns .
While the Koch brothers remain coy about their candidate preferences , a number of billionaire donors in the Koch network , including hedge fund chieftains Paul Singer and Robert Mercer , have either made large donations to Super Pacs supporting candidates , or are expected to do so .
Rubio , who reportedly won a straw poll of some conference donors at a Freedom Partners event in January , and Cruz for now seem to have an edge among network donors .
Singer in October sent an enthusiastic letter to scores of big conservative donors â€ “ including a number in the Koch orbit â€ “ endorsing Rubio .
Singer is slated to host a large campaign fundraiser for the senator in New York this month , and is expected to write a big check â€ “ and raise money from others â€ “ for a pro - Rubio Super Pac .
And Mercer has already plowed a whopping $ 11 m into one of four Super Pacs supporting Cruz .
Overall , the Koch network plans to spend $ 750 m in 2016 on direct political activity and issue advocacy .
The political spending is expected to total about $ 300 m in the general election .
Besides prodding GOP candidates , several Koch - funded advocacy groups are engaged in aggressive energy lobbying drives at both the federal and state levels targeting EPA regulations of carbon emissions from power plants , efforts to expand wind and solar power usage via tax incentives , and the climate change accords currently under discussion in Paris .
The multi - front lobbying battles are being waged by several Koch backed groups , such as Americans for Prosperity and the American Energy Alliance .
Tom Pyle , a former lobbyist for Koch Industries , runs the American Energy Alliance .
The two groups are also working to lift the ban on oil exports and to end funding for the US governmentâ€ ™ s Export - Import Bank , which they deem an example of â€œcrony capitalismâ€ � .
Currently , Americans for Prosperity , the American Energy Alliance and a few other nonprofits backed by the Koch network are embroiled in a big fight in Florida over a pro - solar ballot initiative in 2016 which , if passed , would expand solar power usage in the Sunshine State .
Charles Koch , in an interview with the Washington Post at the Freedom Partners donor retreat in August , raised alarms about the impact of climate change regulations on the economy , a point echoed by some GOP candidates .
In the interview , Koch asked : â€œDo we want to create a catastrophe today in the economy because of some speculation based on models
that donâ€ ™ t work?â€
�
But some veteran oil industry lobbyists say that such economic arguments are often overblown .
â€œIf
I believed all the predictions that the economy was going to hell because of new regulations , the industry would have declared Chapter 11 many times , â€ � said Don Duncan , a former top lobbyist for ConocoPhillips ."
2015-12-04,"A day after 14 people were killed in the mass shooting in San Bernardino , California , all four Republican presidential candidates in the US Senate â€ “ Ted Cruz , Lindsey Graham , Rand Paul and Marco Rubio â€
“ opposed a measure that would introduce tighter gun laws .
They were among Republicans who overwhelmingly voted down a gun control measure that would extend FBI background checks on every firearms purchase .
Only four of the 54 Republican senators voted on Thursday in favour of applying the checks to currently unregulated sales of firearms online and at gun shows .
Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania , who co - sponsored a similar failed attempt at gun reform in the wake of the December 2012 massacre in Newtown , Connecticut , was joined in supporting the tighter restrictions by fellow GOP senators Susan Collins of Maine , Mark Kirk of Illinois and John McCain of Arizona .
But they were the only four Republicans to do so .
The almost blanket opposition to greater gun controls â€ “ even in the wake of the bloodiest mass shooting since Newtown â€ “ underlined the hardline position that the Republican party has come to adopt over the second amendment .
A second gun control effort by Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein suffered a similar fate , voted down by a solid Republican bloc giving 54 votes to 45 .
It would have removed one of the most glaring anomalies of current US gun laws whereby individuals who are listed on the stateâ€ ™ s terror watchlist â€ “ and forbidden from flying as a result â€ “ are nonetheless able to buy lethal firearms .
Both measures were introduced by the Democrats as a means of casting light on the almost rock - solid hostility of the modern Republican party to gun controls despite the rash of recent mass shootings .
It was not always like that .
Ronald Reagan , a figure of worship for many modern conservatives , was far more amenable to the idea of intervention to reduce the carnage .
The late president , also a former governor of California , was profoundly influenced in his thinking on firearms by the assassination attempt on his life in 1981 that injured him and left his press secretary Jim Brady paralyzed .
Brady went on to found the leading gun control advocacy group in the country , the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence .
Reagan himself , on leaving office in 1989 , added his considerable political weight to key pieces of gun control legislation .
In 1991 he wrote an article for the New York Times titled â€œWhy Iâ€ ™ m for the Brady billâ€ � in which he explained why he supported a new provision â€ “ named after Jim Brady â€ “ that forced gun buyers to wait seven days before acquiring a firearm , giving time for background checks by local police .
â€œEvery year an average of 9,200 Americans are murdered by handguns , â€ � Reagan said .
â€œThis level of violence must be stopped .
If the passage of the Brady bill were to result in a reduction of only 10 - 15 % of those numbers ( and it could be a good deal greater ) , it would be well worth making it the law of the land.â€ �
Three years later Reagan joined fellow former presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford in writing a letter to the Boston Globe in which they backed a ban on assault rifles .
â€œWhile we recognize that assault weapon legislation will not stop all assault weapon crime , statistics prove that we can dry up the supply of these guns , making them less accessible to criminals , â€ � the presidents wrote .
It is not coincidental that the shift from Reaganâ€ ™ s relatively moderate stance on guns to the Republican partyâ€ ™ s hard line today is mirrored by an identical trajectory shown by the NRA .
As Adam Winkler of UCLA has shown , the NRA in the 1920s and 30s was a leading proponent of gun control laws .
The lobby group pioneered legislation that banned the concealed carrying of handguns in public places without police permission .
It also backed the introduction of permits that only granted firearms to individuals who could show a â€œproper reason for carryingâ€ � .
Josh Sugarmann , executive director of the Violence Policy Center and an authority on the NRA , said the groupâ€ ™ s moderate position came to an abrupt end in 1977 when it sharply changed tack under the leadership of Harlon Carter .
â€œFrom then on the NRA dropped its focus on sporting activities and concentrated primarily on politics , â€ � Sugarmann said .
Over the past 20 years the NRA and the Republican party have moved in concert towards increasingly rigid policies opposing any gun controls .
Their combined strength has seen the rolling back of even the meagre regulations that were in place , including the lapsing in 2004 of the assault weapons ban that Reagan had supported .
The NRA and its GOP allies in Congress have similarly consistently blocked any attempt to end the situation in which individuals on the terror watchlist are allowed to buy guns .
As a result , as the Washington Post has pointed out , in the 10 years up to 2014 suspected terrorists attempted to buy firearms in the US at least 2,233 times .
Given this solid wall of opposition , signs of compromise on the right are extremely few and far between .
But there was one such opening on Thursday when the former GOP congressman who was seminal in introducing an NRA - fostered ban on federal research into gun violence announced he now wants to see the prohibition lifted .
Jay Dickey , a former US House representative from Arkansas , called for the scrapping of his 1996 amendment that banned the federal agency the Centers for Disease Control from engaging in research aimed at reducing gun deaths .
Hours after the San Bernardino rampage
Dickey wrote in a public letter : â€œDoing nothing is no longer an acceptable solution.â€ � Having recently expressed his regrets about the legislation he championed , Dickey went further and argued that from now on the CDC should be allowed to conduct research designed to reduce gun violence .
Dickey cited its other important work in investigating how to cut fatalities from car crashes .
â€œResearch could have been continued on gun violence without infringing on the rights of gun owners , in the same fashion that the highway industry continued its research without eliminating the automobile ,
â€ �
Dickey said .
In addition to voting against the gun reform measure in the Senate , one of the Republican presidential candidates â€ “ Paul , who is senator for Kentucky â€ “ introduced an amendment to allow the federal government to essentially override the District of Columbiaâ€ ™ s strict gun control laws .
It failed to achieve the necessary 60-vote supermajority to advance and failed by a margin of 54 - 46 .
Meanwhile , Cruz , who represents Texas , and is currently considered among the frontrunners in the Republican race for the White House , announced his campaign would be holding a â€œsecond Amendment eventâ€ � at a gun store in suburban Des Moines on Friday ."
2015-12-07,"Moments after Barack Obama delivered a primetime address aimed at easing Americansâ€ ™ fears in the wake of last weekâ€ ™ s terrorist attack in California , top Republicans condemned the presidentâ€ ™ s speech as insufficient and lacking a sense of urgency in the fight against the Islamic State .
Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio led the criticism in a primetime appearance of his own , receiving the first opportunity to respond to Obama in a lengthy interview with Fox News .
â€œNothing we heard in that speech tonight will assuage peopleâ€ ™ s fears , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œI fear he may have made things worse in the minds of many Americans.â€ �
The Florida senator , who has said his foreign policy experience is unrivaled in the Republican field , also rebuked what he said was a misplaced focus by Obama on discrimination toward Muslims .
The president dedicated a significant portion of his remarks to an appeal for tolerance , telling the nation it was â€œthe responsibility of all Americans of all faiths to reject discrimination against Muslims.â€ �
Rubio dubbed Obamaâ€ ™ s overtures as â€œcynicism.â€ � â€œWhere is there widespread evidence that we have a problem in America with discrimination against Muslims?â€ �
Rubio said .
â€œThis is a war on radical Islam , â€ � he added .
â€œWe are at war with a radical jihadist group more capable than any terrorist group and any armed insurgency this nation has ever confronted.â€
�
Other Republican candidates offered similar critiques - real estate mogul and frontrunner Donald Trump tweeted : â€œIs that all there is ?
We need
a new President - FAST!â€ �
Ted Cruz said if he were elected president , he would would direct the Department of Defense â€œto destroy ISIS.â€ �
â€œAnd I will shut down the broken immigration system that is letting jihadists into our country ,
â€ � the Texas senator said in a statement .
â€œNothing President Obama said tonight will assist in
either case.â€ � Former Florida governor Jeb Bush said the president lacked â€œthe resolveâ€ � to enforce a strategy against ISIS .
â€œThis is the war of our time .
It should not be business as usual , â€ � Bush said in a statement .
â€œWe need a war - time Commander - in - Chief who is ready to lead this country and the free world to victory.â€ � Carly Fiorina said the address failed to show real leadership .
She also used the opportunity to release a video detailing how she would defeat Isis .
Other Republicans dismissed the speech as â€œpatheticâ€ � and a failure .
The Republican primary has been marked of late by a focus on national security following both the San Bernardino shooting and the terrorist attacks that struck Paris on 13 November .
Candidates have jockeyed aggressively to position themselves as the most prepared to lead the country in times of uncertainty and war , although most of the Republican contenders have ruled out deploying major ground forces against Isis .
Much of the debate since Paris and now California has centered on immigration and surveillance .
The Republican candidates have uniformly come out against Obamaâ€ ™ s plan to allow 10,000 Syrian refugees into the US over the next year .
Some , such as Texas senator Cruz and Kentucky senator Rand Paul , have gone a step further by pushing for legislation that would bar immigrants and refugees from Muslim countries .
In a statement Sunday responding to Obamaâ€ ™ s speech , Paul said the US must â€œfully examine and reformâ€ � its border security .
â€œImmigration , visas , and refugees from countries with active terror networks must be halted while we determine how to better secure our borders and our people , â€ � he said .
Meanwhile , Rubio has focused his attention on surveillance , hammering both Cruz and Paul over their votes to end the National Security Agencyâ€ ™ s bulk collection on phone records earlier this year .
The Florida senator has signed on to two measures that would restore the NSAâ€ ™ s surveillance authorities and told Fox on Sunday it was â€œnot a time for ideological sillinessâ€ � while discussing the importance of the meta - data programs .
â€œThis is a time for serious action because the future security of our country is at stake , â€ � he said ."
2015-12-12,"A new poll released on Saturday showed Ted Cruz taking a potentially decisive lead in the Republican field in Iowa .
In a poll released on Saturday by Bloomberg and the Des Moines Register , the Texas senator had the support of 31 % of likely Republican caucus - goers in the first - in - the - nation state , well ahead of Donald Trump at 21 % .
The two were followed by retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson at 13 % and Florida senator Marco Rubio at 10 % .
The only other candidate to poll above the 3 % mark was former Florida governor Jeb Bush .
While the poll was only the second to show Cruz leading in the Hawkeye State , it was conducted by respected pollster Ann Selzer , who is considered the gold standard in measuring the attitudes of the Iowa electorate .
Selzer has consistently outperformed her rivals in predicting the Iowa caucuses .
The poll showed a major collapse since October in support for Carson , who had reached 28 % .
His fortunes have fading as his foreign policy acumen has been called into question , in the wake of terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino , California .
In contrast , Cruzâ€ ™ s support has nearly trebled from 10 % in October .
Trump , who leads national polls of likely Republican voters , has shown only a marginal improvement , rising from 19 % to 21 % .
The result reinforces the conventional wisdom that Iowa is a two - man race between Cruz , who has a strong base among evangelicals , and Trump , who has built an organization to turn out the voters who have flocked to his populist campaign .
During a Friday appearance in Des Moines , Trump took aim at Cruz for the first time , criticising his opposition to ethanol subsidies â€ “ a popular issue in the agricultural state ."
2015-12-13,"At the end of a week in which Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s lead in the Republican presidential race held firm despite uproar over his proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States , his rival Marco Rubio said the billionaireâ€ ™ s controversial rhetoric on Islam â€œis reminding us â€ ¦ that people are really scaredâ€ � .
Speaking to NBCâ€ ™ s Meet the Press in an interview to be broadcast on Sunday , Rubio repeatedly refused to say if Trump was qualified to be president .
Of Trumpâ€ ™ s remarks about Muslims , he said : â€œObviously I donâ€ ™ t agree with everything he says â€ ¦
but we canâ€
™ t ignore thatâ€ ™ s touched on some issues
that people are concerned about .
â€œIf you look at the statements he made this week , obviously I think he made them partially to recapture the limelight after having lost it.â€ �
According to a new poll â€ “ released on Sunday â€ “ carried out by NBC and the Wall Street Journal , Trump has not lost the limelight with Republican primary voters .
The poll put him at 27 % nationally , up four points on the previous such survey and ahead of the Texas senator Ted Cruz at 22 % .
Cruzâ€ ™ s rise came at the expense of Ben Carson , who fell steeply to place fourth behind Rubio , who attracted 15 % support .
In a Bloomberg - Des Moines Register poll of Iowa voters released on Saturday night , Cruz had a commanding lead over Trump .
Trump made his controversial remarks at a rally in South Carolina on Monday , in the aftermath of a reportedly Isis - inspired shooting in California in which 14 people were killed .
In the face of worldwide condemnation , he has since doubled down .
Rubio said : â€œI do think we lost some of the focus on the attacks in San Bernardino and focused on a plan that isnâ€ ™ t really a plan and is never going to happen .
But he [ Trump ] is reminding us in that process that people are really upset and theyâ€ ™ re really scared .
And theyâ€ ™ re worried.â€ � Rubio , who said â€œwe are going to need the cooperation of Muslim communities in this countryâ€
� to combat terrorist threats , refused to say if Trump was fit to command US armed forces in such combat .
â€œAs of now
, obviously I think Iâ€ ™ m the most qualified , â€ � he said .
To a restatement of the question , he said : â€œAgain , I just have very strong reservations about what heâ€ ™ s expressed up to this point about his understanding on some of these critical issues before our country .
He still has another month before the Iowa caucus .
So weâ€ ™ ll see if he does it.â€ �
Rubio has characterized the international effort against Islamic State militants in Iraq as a â€œclash of civilisationsâ€ � .
On NBC he was asked if such belligerent phrasing might be helpful to Isis , for propaganda purposes .
â€œIf
you interpret that phrase as meaning weâ€ ™ re at war with Islam and all Muslims , â€ � he said ,
â€œthatâ€
™ s not what Iâ€ ™
m saying and itâ€ ™ s
ridiculous.â€ � Rubio also criticised the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s handling of the effort against Isis and the presidentâ€ ™ s Oval Office address on the subject last week .
Asked if his calls for more airstrikes , a ground coalition comprising mainly Sunni Arabs and the deployment of US and international special forces were effectively just a more aggressive re - voicing of current White House strategy , he said : â€œI donâ€ ™ t agree thatâ€ ™ s part of their strategy .
Maybe rhetorically some of it is , but most of it is not.â€ �
Rubio also said there could be no prospect of working with Iran , because â€œthe Iranian Shia government wants to defeat Isis but for purposes of instituting their version of a global caliphate , their version of an apocalyptic interpretation of Islamâ€ � .
Cooperation with Russia , which is carrying out its own air strikes in Syria in support of the Assad regime , would â€œdepend [ on ] what Vladimir Putin is trying to doâ€ � .
The Meet the Press interview also covered NSA surveillance reform â€ “ on which Rubio has clashed with Cruz â€ “ Obamacare , which he called a â€œjob killerâ€
� , the rising cost of sugar and his position as a Florida politician , the rights and wrongs of affirmative action and the role of his Christian faith in determining his policy positions , particularly on same - sex marriage .
Asked how he felt about his present label of â€œestablishment favouriteâ€ � , as he competes with non - politicians Trump and Carson and the renegade senator Cruz , Rubio said : â€œI know that itâ€ ™ s meant as a slight.â€ �"
2015-12-15,"Donald Trump has once again commanded centre stage â€ “ or at least the attention of the media , if not the world â€ “ with a controversial plan to ban Muslim immigration into the United States , with the release of his health records and with his knack for television ratings .
But as nine Republican candidates eyeing the White House prepare for the partyâ€ ™ s fifth presidential debate on Tuesday night , conservatives are bracing for another narrative to prevail at the Venetian casino and hotel here : the emergence of Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio as the most viable alternatives to the mogul who refuses to go away .
Both Cruz and Rubio have steadily risen in the polls behind Trump , prompting many political observers to forecast a scenario in which Republican primary voters will ultimately break away for the first - term senators instead .
Although Trump has shown no signs of fading , questions loom over whether his base of supporters will actually turn out to choose the bombastic businessman as the partyâ€ ™ s nominee .
Cruz and Rubio have until now steered clear of sparring with each other directly on the debate stage , but that dynamic has noticeably shifted since the last time they met five weeks ago .
The two senators , who at 44 are the youngest candidates in the race , have escalated their attacks on each otherâ€ ™ s record while seeking to consolidate support among grassroots conservatives ahead of the Iowa caucuses in early February .
And as issues such as national security and immigration have taken prominence amid terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino , California , Cruz and Rubio have increasingly sought to exploit what they view as the otherâ€ ™ s weakness .
The contrast is expected to take a sharper turn at the debate , which CNN has already pledged to focus on national security â€ “ even if , as moderator Wolf Blitzer admitted , Trump is â€œprobably rightâ€
� that many viewers come to watch the frontrunner .
With growing concerns among Americans over their safety at home , Rubio has renewed the debate over intelligence gathering and hit Cruz repeatedly over his vote earlier this year to reduce the National Security Agencyâ€ ™ s surveillance authorities .
The Florida senator has also looked to portray Cruz as weak on defense more broadly , questioning his tough talk against the Islamic State ( Isis ) and vote against boosting defense spending .
Cruz has taken hold of another angle of the national security debate to make his case against Rubio , seizing on anxiety toward migrants among a faction of conservatives to paint Rubio as weak on border security .
The Texas senator has drawn attention to Rubioâ€ ™ s role in crafting a comprehensive immigration bill in 2013 â€ “ an anathema to many conservatives over its inclusion of a pathway to citizenship for the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US .
There are caveats to both arguments : many Republicans , including some who have endorsed Rubio , also voted with Cruz to end the NSAâ€ ™ s bulk collection of phone records , and while Cruz has fashioned himself as an immigration hardliner , he has refused to outline a plan for undocumented immigrants and consistently ducked questions from reporters on whether he supports at least a path to legal status .
But those are mere details as Rubio and Cruz seek to blunt each otherâ€ ™ s momentum , no less at the casino and resort owned by Republican mega - donor Sheldon Adelson .
The billionaire , who in the 2012 election spent roughly $ 100 m in support of Republicans , is notoriously fixated on national security .
Some reports have suggested Adelson is close to endorsing Rubio , while others have noted his wife Miriam favors Cruz .
Cruz took a 10-point lead in the influential Des Moines Register / Bloomberg poll of likely Iowa caucus - goers over the weekend , furthering his position as the latest candidate on the rise .
His sudden surge could also open up Cruz to attacks from other contenders , including Trump , who at a pre - debate rally Monday evening dismissed Cruzâ€ ™ s ascent as a fabrication of the media .
Cruz could receive an assist from Kentucky senator Rand Paul , who has also taken to criticizing Rubio over immigration and , like Cruz , is a staunch defender of reforming the NSA .
On foreign policy too , Paul favors a less interventionist approach and has used similar jabs as Cruz in tying Rubio to so - called â€œmilitary adventurismâ€ � favored by neoconservatives .
In an ad leading up to the debate , Paul attacked both Rubio and Cruz over their prior support for taking in more Syrian refugees â€ “ a position the two senators no longer hold .
But Paul has focused the bulk of his ire on Rubio , seeking to dredge up the immigration issue in a host of interviews with conservative media outlets .
The final debate of the year will also be significant for a host of other candidates who are either on the cusp of rising to the next level â€ “ or one step removed from descending into irrelevance .
New Jersey governor Chris Christie has benefited from the national security focus in New Hampshire , the site of the second nominating contest with a hawkish Republican electorate .
Christie , who last month was relegated to the undercard debate , will be back on the main stage Tuesday evening and looking to pick up steam with no clear establishment choice .
( Mike Huckabee , Rick Santorum , George Pataki and Lindsey Graham will spar in the early edition this time around . )
The establishment mantle was once thought to be held by Jeb Bush , whose dramatic fall from presumed frontrunner has made for one of the more unexpected storylines of the political year .
While debates have not been Bushâ€ ™ s forte , a good enough performance will enable the former Florida governor to fend off calls to drop out the race .
Other candidates for whom the debate could be a make - or - break evening include Paul , who barely made the polling cut for the primetime stage , and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina , who some political operatives now view as little more than a passing fad .
Trumpâ€ ™ s shadow is nonetheless expected to loom once again , as the fallout continues from his suggestion that all Muslims be barred from entering the country .
Candidates have until now been reluctant to rally against him , but with the debate marking the final high - profile event of 2015 , it could be the last opportunity with millions watching for Republicans to recapture the party from the corrosive effects of Trump â€ “ if it isnâ€ ™ t already too late ."
2015-12-15,"â€œDefeat Obamacareâ€ � is not a health policy , though you could be forgiven for believing otherwise .
Senator Marco Rubio , who is covered under the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , quietly inserted a provision in this yearâ€ ™ s spending bill that prevents some insurance companies from recouping losses under the shared risk pool agreement .
He and his congressional colleagues vow to dismantle the bill , and chip away piece by piece .
But for now , the ACA stands , and Tuesday is the deadline for anyone needing health insurance under the ACA for 2016 .
Although technically you have until 31 January of next year to enroll , signing up by midnight tonight ensures coverage as of 1 January .
The ACA is far from perfect , but you should use and support it .
Despite the valid downsides that some are experiencing , like untenable hikes in premiums and high â€ “ sometimes impossibly high â€ “ deductibles , the ACA is still an improvement for many Americans over how healthcare used to be .
The number uninsured Americans dipped to under 12 % in early 2015 â€ “ and most sharply among Hispanic people and lower income earners ( below $ 36,000 annually ) .
Nearly 50 million people , about 18 % of the population , lacked health insurance in the years just prior to the ACA .
The law has also helped reduce racial and ethnic disparities in access and outcomes .
Recommended immunizations , annual well visits and necessary screenings , like mammograms and colonoscopies , are covered free .
For the first time , many are getting care before they get sick , rather than using emergency departments as â€œfallbackâ€ � providers .
Emergency room care costs the health system millions because itâ€ ™ s the most expensive kind of treatment and , long term , itâ€ ™ s ineffective for preventing or managing disease .
Coverage of pre - existing conditions is a lifeline for many who could never before get health insurance , or opted to go without due to impossibly high cost .
Under the law , they canâ€ ™ t be denied coverage , or have benefits limited or dropped .
Ask anyone with cancer or the parent of a child with a life - threatening illness , or anyone thatâ€ ™ s had to declare bankruptcy to pay off hospital bills , if they prefer â€œthe way
it wasâ€
� .
It can be difficult to think of the â€œcollective goodâ€ � of the ACA when an insurance company raises your rates beyond what you can afford .
However , this supports the entire premise of the ACA â€ “ caring for the millions of people who were sick and without insurance and , often , without any care at all .
So when they did get coverage , they were already sicker and cost more to care for .
And despite the increases , an analysis by the Commonwealth Fund found that for the most part , marketplace plans are affordable .
Whatâ€ ™ s the alternative ?
Do we scrap it all and attempt single payer , as Senator Sanders and others want ?
Some argue itâ€ ™ s a better approach â€ “
but as friends in Canada and the UK warn , itâ€ ™ s not exactly the utopia many in the US think .
Single payer is not going to be politically feasible here anytime soon , so
itâ€ ™ s best to try and improve on the program we have .
Medicare and Medicaid are still being tweaked decades after their implementation .
Just this fall , Medicare agreed to start paying physicians to discuss advance care planning and reimbursing for more telehealth services .
Change is part of the process .
The Affordable Care Act itself included roughly 165 provisions to improve Medicareâ€ ™ s finances .
Medicare expenditure projections have dropped significantly , which means relatively lower out - of - pocket health costs for current and future retirees .
Healthcare is by definition imperfect because itâ€ ™ s never a â€œone size fits allâ€ � solution .
Everything from medication management to patient compliance to provider testing drills down to an individual level .
It also underscores why healthy individuals must participate .
Spreading out the risk pool ultimately lowers the cost of care for everyone .
Itâ€ ™ s no stretch to anticipate , should Obamacare go , a return to emergency rooms clogged with patients using them for primary care , healthcare costs again creeping up and lower wage earners going without care because itâ€ ™ s too expensive .
If the ACA is really so horrible , then letâ€ ™ s hear a better plan .
It must be one that will get all of the stakeholders on board , and cover everyone , and cut costs and improve outcomes and be affordable .
And , get it done in the first two years of the next administration ."
2015-12-16,"Less than 12 hours after the end of the last Republican debate of 2015 , Marco Rubio was back on the campaign trail in a hotel ballroom in Ankeny , Iowa .
Rubio , who has devoted a disproportionate amount of time to campaigning in this prosperous suburb , gave a relatively short , breezy version of his stump speech where he seamlessly incorporated his opening statement from last nightâ€ ™ s debate and then spent just as long working the rope line , taking selfies and shaking hands with the crowd of about 100 who filled the room .
The Florida senator , who has emerged as an establishment favorite in recent months , focused on his hawkish foreign policy world view during his brief speech .
He referred to the two perpetrators of the San Bernardino terrorist attack as â€œanimalsâ€ � and took shots at NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden , whom he called a traitor .
â€œIt is unfathomable to me that there are people running for president who think he did a great public service to America , â€ � said Rubio .
Rubio didnâ€ ™ t mention any of his rivals by name although he obliquely referenced Texas senator Ted Cruz , with whom he repeatedly sparred in Tuesdayâ€
™ s debate .
He derides those Republican rivals who talked tough without adequately supporting the military , a clear reference to Cruz , who his campaign has repeatedly attacked for voting against the Defense Authorization Act .
â€œEveryone on that stage talks tough , â€ � said Rubio .
â€œI can stand here and say we are going to utterly destroy Isis , we are going to blow them up , we are going to make the sand glow , but what are you going to do it
with?â€ �
Previously , Cruz has pledged to â€œcarpet bomb Isis into oblivion ,
â€ � adding :
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know if sand can glow in the dark , but weâ€ ™ re going to find out.â€ �
Afterward Rubio worked the rope line , chatting with voters and trying to move quickly to avoid knotty policies .
When one voter pressed him on nuclear disarmament , Rubio warned of the threats that the United States faces : â€œIran is probably going to have a [ nuclear ] weapon at some point.â€ � Dave Niffenegger , a veteran who likes Rubio , thought the Florida senatorâ€ ™ s comments on foreign policy were spot - on .
He appreciated how Rubio thought it was important to have â€œour friends and neighbors engage in the Middle Eastâ€ � and his cautious approach toward committing ground troops .
But not everyone in the crowd shared Rubioâ€ ™ s foreign policy approach .
Dennis Dietz of Polk City , a registered Democrat , told the Guardian : â€œI switched out of the Republican party because of this kind of fear - mongering.â€ �
A self - described â€œBob Dole kind of personâ€ � , Dietz was disappointed with Rubioâ€ ™ s hawkish rhetoric .
â€œThey are all saying that fear stuff and trying to use it for their own benefit .
But Iâ€ ™ m not as fearful as them.â€ �"
2015-12-16,"The US governmentâ€ ™ s right to monitor citizensâ€ ™ phones and data in an effort to catch potential terrorists took centre stage early in Tuesday nightâ€ ™ s Republican debate in Las Vegas .
Candidates clashed over the balance between surveillance and privacy as they sought to prove their security credentials as potential commander - in - chief .
Texas senator Ted Cruz defended his Senate vote earlier this year in favour of the USA Freedom Act , which restricted bulk data collection from millions of people and was hailed as a â€œmilestoneâ€ � by privacy activists .
It improved the previous legislation , he claimed , because it allowed the National Security Agency ( NSA ) to monitor mobile and internet phones as well as landlines .
â€œThe old programme covered 20 to 30 % of phone numbers to search for terrorists , â€ � he said .
â€œThe new programme covers nearly 100 % .
That gives us greater ability to stop acts of terrorism.â€ �
But Marco Rubio , the Florida senator , went on the offensive , saying the authorities had lost an important tool for keeping America safe .
â€œLet me just be very clear : there is nothing that we are allowed to do under this bill that we could not do before , â€ �
he said .
He also warned that the bill took away agenciesâ€ ™ ability to quickly access phone records , adding : â€œI promise you the next time there is an attack on this country , the first thing people are going to want to know is why didnâ€ ™ t we know about it and why didnâ€ ™ t
we stop it , and the answer had better not be because we didnâ€ ™ t have access to records or information that would have allowed us to identify these killers before they attacked.â€ �
Rubio himself then came under attack from Rand Paul .
â€œI think Marco gets it completely wrong , â€ �
he said .
â€œWe are not any safer for the bulk collection of all Americansâ€ ™ records ; in fact I think we are less safe.â€
�
â€ �
In 2013 , whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed in the Guardian the US governmentâ€ ™ s ability to see phone records , follow people from location to location through their phones and track their emails and website visits .
The USA Freedom Act was hailed as an important victory for individual privacy but the rise of Islamic State , and recent terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino , have led to calls from the CIA and others for greater surveillance .
Pressure is also growing on tech companies in Silicon Valley to allow access to encrypted data .
In the wake of terrorist attacks in San Bernardino , Rubio has pushed for restoring the NSAâ€ ™ s phone and data collection programs â€ “ and attacked Cruz for voting in favor of the USA Freedom Act earlier this year .
Asked if he regretted his vote to end the NSAâ€ ™ s bulk collection , Cruz said the reform bill had been mischaracterized .
â€œWhat the Obama administration keeps getting wrong is whenever anything bad happens , they focus on law - abiding citizens instead of focusing on the bad guys , â€ � Cruz said .
Rubio bluntly said Cruz was wrong and said more tools were needed for intelligence gathering .
Law enforcement authorities â€œneed the tools and the tools involve encryption , where we can not hear what theyâ€ ™ re even planning , and when we see red flags â€ “ a father , a mother , a neighbour who says weâ€ ™ ve got a problem here
â€ “ then we have to give law enforcement the ability to listen so they can disrupt these terrorist attacks before they
occurâ€ � said Ohio governor John Kasich .
â€œWe can do this but we got ta get moving .
Pay me now , or pay me a lot more later .
This is the direction we need to go.â€ �
Kasich added : â€œWe have to give the local authorities the ability to penetrate and disrupt .
Encryption is a major problem and Congress has got to deal with this , and so does the president , to keep us safe.â€ �
Asked if Silicon Valley firms should be forced to surrender encrypted data , Carly Fiorina , former chief executive of Hewlett - Packard , said : â€œThey do not need to be forced .
They need to be asked to bring the best and brightest , the most recent technology to the table .
I was asked as a CEO .
I complied happily and they will as well .
But they have not been asked.â€ �
Fiorina told an anecdote about how she had worked with the NSA shortly after the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks .
â€œSoon after 9/11
I got a phone call from the NSA .
They needed help ; I gave them help .
I stopped a truck load of equipment .
I had it turned around .
It was escorted by the NSA into headquarters .
We need the private sectorâ€ ™ s help because government is not innovating .
Technology is running ahead in leaps and bounds .
The private sector will help , just as I helped after 9/11 , but they must be engaged and they must be asked .
I will ask them ; I know them.â€ � Yahoo !
News reported earlier this year that , after 9/11 , Fiorina received an urgent phone call from the then NSA director Michael Hayden asking her to quickly provide his agency with HP computer servers for expanded surveillance .
The leader in the polls , Donald Trump , had little to say on the subject of the NSA but , asked if he wanted to close parts of the internet to combat Isis , he replied : â€œI would certainly be open to closing areas where we are at war with somebody .
I sure as hell
donâ€ ™ t want to let people that want to kill us and kill our nation use our internet.â€ � Chris Christie , meanwhile , was unimpressed by Cruz and Rubioâ€ ™ s wrangling over the intricacies of legislation .
â€œIf your eyes are glazed over like mine , this is what itâ€ ™ s like to be on the floor of the United States Senate , â€ � he said .
â€œEndless debates about how many angels on the head of a pin from people who never had to make a consequential decision from an executive position.â€ �"
2015-12-16,"Long story short from Las Vegas on Tuesday : It was long on substance .
Candidates were asked about national security issues , immigration policy , government surveillance and naughty things the candidates have said about each other on the campaign trail .
Florida senator Marco Rubio and Texas senator Ted Cruz locked horns ... ...
over Rubioâ€ ™ s support for immigration reform and over Cruzâ€ ™ s support for reining in NSA surveillance .
Both fought expertly .
No clear winner declared .
Donald Trump said he had no plan to run ... ... as a third - party candidate .
( Sorry . )
â€œI am totally committed to the Republican party , â€ �
Trump said as the festivities were concluding .
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush repeatedly attacked Trump He called him the â€œchaos candidateâ€ � and said : â€œYouâ€ ™ re not going to insult your way to president of the United States.â€
�
Was it such a combative night ?
Not really â€ “ neither Cruz nor Rubio , nor New Jersey governor Chris Christie , opted to totally tangle with Trump , who himself passed on an invitation to go after Cruz .
( Christie did , however , call President Obama a â€œfeckless weaklingâ€ � . )
Did Trump botch a question ?
There was one about the countryâ€ ™ s triad of nuclear defenses .
He didnâ€
™ t answer a question about which needed updating most urgently .
Rubio left the door open on a path to citizenship on immigration
At least for some undocumented migrants , which is considered heresy in some corners of the Republican party .
â€œI personally am open to people having the possibility of applying for a green card , â€ � he said â€ “ after 10 yearsâ€ ™ probation and strict tests .
Rand Paul , the Kentucky senator , did go after Trump
Because , you know , Trump said he wanted to shred the Constitution .
But Trump pretty much ignored him .
A
( sort of ) substantive big - picture debate broke out !
Over whether itâ€ ™ s better for the US national security to have dictators in the Middle East .
This , however , remains unresolved .
And former Hewlett - Packard CEO Carly Fiorina quoted Thatcher â€œMargaret Thatcher once said , if you want something talked about , ask a man .
If you want something done , ask a woman.â€ �"
2015-12-16,"The Republican partyâ€ ™ s next - generation candidates Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz went head - to - head on immigration reform , surveillance and US foreign policy in the final presidential debate of the year , battling to claim the mantle as the most viable alternative to the bombastic frontrunner Donald Trump .
The pair of first - term senators , who have been on a collision course for weeks , dominated the stage in Las Vegas , Nevada , with a series of fiery exchanges in a debate devoted almost entirely to national security following terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino , California .
As Rubio and Cruz sparred over how to respond to the threat posed by the Islamic State , Jeb Bush instead took on the challenge of countering the Trump phenomenon .
The former Florida governor came out swinging early on in the debate , questioning Trumpâ€ ™ s ability to serve as commander - in - chief after his controversial plan to ban all Muslim immigration into the United States .
â€œDonald is great at the one - liners , but heâ€ ™ s a chaos candidate .
And heâ€ ™ d be a chaos president , â€ � Bush said .
â€œHe would not be the commander - in - chief we need to keep our country safe.â€ �
Trump , who tolerated him at first , eventually turned on Bush in a tart and petty exchange which scarcely rose above the level of playground taunts about who was toughest .
The debate at the Venetian hotel was arguably the most charged performance by Bush , whose campaign is in desperate need of a boost after struggling to take off despite his family legacy and mighty war chest .
The evening was nonetheless dominated by the escalating feud between Rubio and Cruz , which has spilled out into the public arena over the last five weeks .
The two senators , both 44 , exposed a deep rift within the Republican party and competing visions of the future : on military intervention amid global chaos ; on the federal governmentâ€ ™ s spying authorities ; and on how the US should reform its broken immigration system .
Perhaps the most consequential exchanges between the two were on the subject of the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants already living in the United States â€
“ a contentious and potentially defining issue of the Republican primary .
Cruz , joined by Kentucky senator Rand Paul , resurrected Rubioâ€ ™ s role as the co - author of a comprehensive immigration bill in 2013 that provided a path to citizenship for the undocumented , in an attempt to tie the senator to a so - called â€œamnestyâ€ � policy reviled by grassroots Republicans .
Rubioâ€ ™ s immigration efforts , a continued source of skepticism among conservatives , had not been raised in the four previous debates .
The Cuban - American Florida senator stood by what he deemed his â€œpersonalâ€ � support for eventually allowing law - abiding undocumented immigrants to apply for green cards â€ “ and attempted to turn the tables on Cruz for having a position not too dissimilar to his .
Cruz supported legalization for the undocumented and a massive expansion of visas for high - skilled workers , Rubio argued â€ “ an analogy Cruz likened to comparing â€œthe fireman and the arsonist â€ ¦ because they were both at the scene of the fireâ€ � .
Cruz nonetheless continued to dodge the question of what he would do with the millions of undocumented immigrants living in the country , simply stating , â€œI have never supported legalization
and I do not intend to support legalization.â€
�
An even lengthier back - and - forth occurred over the issue of surveillance , with Rubio making an aggressive push for the restoration of the National Security Agencyâ€ ™ s power to collect phone and data records in bulk .
Bush and Trump also lined up with him , while Cruz and Paul resisted .
â€œI promise you the next time there is an attack on this country ,
the first thing people are going to ask is why didnâ€ ™ t we know about it , â€ � Rubio said , while adding that Cruz , Paul and other Republicans had voted to â€œweakenâ€ � the federal governmentâ€ ™ s intelligence - gathering methods .
Rubioâ€ ™ s claim was rebuffed by both Cruz and Paul , who accused the Florida senator of misleading on the effectiveness of the NSA programs .
â€œWhat [ Rubio ] knows is that the old program covered 20 - 30 % of phone numbers to search for terrorists , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œThe new program covers nearly 100%.â€ �
Paul added that the country was â€œnot any saferâ€ � after its bulk collection , but in fact less safe due to the distraction of having millions of Americansâ€ ™ records rather than focusing specifically on potential terrorists .
The use of American military might also drew sharp divisions between Rubio , who took on a traditional hawkish tone , and the less interventionist approach favored by Cruz and Paul .
Cruz , who has advocated against US involvement in the Syrian civil war , argued it was not in the countryâ€ ™ s interest to join in the toppling of foreign governments .
â€œWe keep hearing from President Obama and Hillary Clinton and Washington Republicans that theyâ€ ™ re searching for these mythical moderate rebels , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s like a purple unicorn .
They never exist .
These moderate rebels end up being jihadists.â€ �
Paul also pushed back against engaging the US military in the fight against Isis , focusing instead on the need to close borders and halt immigration from â€œhigh - risk terrorist countriesâ€ � .
At one point , he rebuked the hawkish New Jersey governor Chris Christie , telling the audience : â€œIf you are in favor of World War III , you have your candidate!â€ �
Not everyone on stage was enthused by the dominance of the three senators .
Christie looked to position himself as a candidate who actually had direct knowledge of combating terrorism , drawing on his experience after the terrorist attacks on September 11 2001 .
In his trademark blunt style , Christie looked into the camera to speak with the audience watching on television .
â€œIf your eyes are glazing over like mine , this is what itâ€ ™ s like to be on the floor of the United States Senate , â€ � Christie said .
â€œI mean , endless debates about how many angels on the head of a pin from people
whoâ€ ™ ve never had to make a consequential decision in an executive position .
â€œThe fact is , for seven years , I had to make these decisions after 9/11 , make a decision about how to proceed forward with an investigation or how to pull back , whether you use certain actionable intelligence or whether not to .
And yet they continue to debate about this bill and in the subcommittee and what â€ “ nobody in America cares about that.â€ �"

a lot of arguments involving two senators , the fight rests on a complicated argument over policy , procedure , and tactics , â€ � Sarlin writes .
The two argued about where they stand now on handling the estimated 11 m undocumented migrants in the United States , where they stand now on the question of admitting more immigrants legally , and where they stood in 2013 , when a group of senators including Rubio led the passage of an immigration reform bill .
Hereâ€ ™ s Sarlin on a shift in Cruzâ€ ™ s position on what to do with undocumented immigrants :
But on illegal immigration , things get more complex .
Cruz has spent months and months and monthsducking questions as to what he would eventually do with undocumented immigrants , usually saying itâ€ ™ s a â€œconversationâ€ � for another time once the border is secure .
Read this exchange with Chuck Todd onMeet The Press from July .
Itâ€ ™ s almost painful how much Cruz does not want to address this topic .
That changed on Tuesday , though , when Rubio challenged Cruz to say whether he favors legal status or not .
For the first time , Cruz appeared to shift decisively against it .
â€œI have never supported legalization , and I do not intend to support legalization , â€ � Cruz said .
Rubioâ€ ™ s camp pointed to the phrase â€œintendâ€ � as an obvious weasel word ...
Thereâ€ ™ s much more where that came from .

At his Las Vegas event , Ben Carson has speculated that his presidency , should it materialize , might only last for one term , because of the unpopular though salubrious choices he would have to work , Dave Weigel of the Washington Post reports : â€œIf Iâ€ ™ m successful in this endeavor to become president of the United States , itâ€ ™ s very likely

Less than 12 hours after the end of the last Republican debate of 2015 , Marco Rubio was back on the campaign trail in a hotel ballroom in Ankeny , Iowa , reports Ben Jacobs : Rubio , who has devoted a disproportionate amount of time to campaigning in this prosperous suburb , gave a relatively short , breezy version of his stump speech where he seamlessly incorporated his opening statement from last nightâ€ ™ s debate and then spent just as long working the rope line , taking selfies and shaking hands with the crowd of about 100 who filled the room .

But not everyone in the crowd shared Rubioâ€ ™ s foreign policy approach .
Dennis Dietz of Polk City , a registered Democrat , told the Guardian : â€œI switched out of the Republican party because of this kind of fear - mongering.â€ �
A self - described â€œBob Dole kind of personâ€ � , Dietz was disappointed with Rubioâ€ ™ s hawkish rhetoric .
â€œThey are all saying that fear stuff and trying to use it for their own benefit .
But Iâ€ ™ m not as fearful as them.â€ � Read the full piece here .

Meanwhile , at a Ben Carson rally in Las Vegas : And Trumpâ€ ™ s in Arizona : [ Google thinks itâ€ ™ s 52 in Mesa ]
As the debate unfolded in Las Vegas , House speaker Paul Ryan went to work to sell a bipartisan tax - and - spending deal to his caucus , ultimately issuing a statement of a sealed deal after midnight .
The House plans to pass the package as two separate bills , to be rolled together for the Senate to pass , likely later this week .
Congress was expected pass yet another piece of legislation to avert the risk of a government shutdown before the new package is in place .
Ryan said the spending bill puts a two - year moratorium on a tax on medical devices and postpones the â€œCadillac
taxâ€ � on costly health care plans .
Additionally , the agreement extends valuable tax reflief to lumber companies , racetrack owners , apple growers , cider makers and others , according to the New York Times .
The tax breaks are worth about $ 650bn and the spending bill weighs in at $ 1.1tn , according to the Washington Post .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not real happy with the omnibus ,
â€ �
Education and the Workforce Chairman John Kline , a Republican of Minnesota , told Roll Call .
But if youâ€ ™ re going to move forward and follow Speaker Ryanâ€ ™ s notion that weâ€ ™ re going to move on the offense this year and go back to regular order and pass all the appropriations bills
then I think many of my colleagues will look at it like I do , that we need to move past this , get this done .
Letâ€
™ s put 2015 behind us and get onto 2016.â€ � TrusTed get it Even after the final debate of the year , Republicans in the key early voting state of Iowa havenâ€ ™ t yet settled on a candidate , reports Ben Jacobs from interviews conducted last night in Waukee , Iowa : On a gloomy Tuesday night , about two dozen Republican stalwarts , many of whom were campaign staffers , came out to an Irish bar in a suburban Des Moines strip mall to watch the debate and assess the candidates .
After the debate , four caucus - goers who represented a fair cross section of establishment Republican sentiment offered mixed reviews of the moderators and the candidates .
Shane Blanchard , a member of the city council in Waukee , said : â€œI think CNN did a good job , â€ � although he expressed some concerns about the lengthy back - and - forth exchanges between candidates like Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio .
â€œI think , you know , when they get going back and forth like that
and it goes for so long
it does a disservice to the debate , â€ � he added .
Rod Shirk of West Des Moines shared these concerns : â€œIâ€ ™ d like to see more cohesiveness instead of
divisiveness.â€ �

The Bush team cuts a web video around the candidateâ€ ™ s attack lines last night on Trump : Annoyed into responding by Bushâ€ ™ s badgering , Trump last night snapped : â€œIâ€ ™ m at 42 and youâ€ ™ re at three!â€ �
A factcheck shows us that while the recent Monmouth University poll had Trump at 41 % support among Republicans and Republican - leaning voters and Bush at 3 % , the national polling averages have Trump closer to 33 and Bush clear up at 4 .
While former Florida governor Jeb Bush spent Tuesday evening attacking Trump , Chris Christie , the New Jersey governor , noticably laid off the polling frontrunner .
Christie continued to pull his punches this morning .
Not good primary politics to attack the Donald , it appears heâ€ ™ s decided .
Or maybe this is simply the way he feels .
If you missed last nightâ€ ™ s proceedings , you can experience them as if in real time here , on our live blog : The Republican debate on Tuesday in Las Vegas was so long ago that Marco Rubio has already stopped in Iowa en route to New Hampshire , Ted Cruz is already under Senate investigation and a central conjecture of the candidatesâ€ ™ discussion on national security appears to have folded .
Never fear â€ “ weâ€ ™ ll catch you up and run along the campaign trail so you donâ€
™ t have to .
Guardian politics reporter Ben Jacobs was with Rubio in Ankeny , Iowa ... ...
while Sabrina Siddiqui and Paul Lewis in Las Vegas have delivered a comprehensive analysis of last nightâ€ ™ s proceedings , for those still catching up : ( Thereâ€ ™ s this , too , from columnist Jeb Lund on the Strip . )
As for Cruz , Senate intelligence chair Richard Burr says his staff is looking into the possibility that the candidate aired classified info in his discussion onstage last night of how the USA Freedom Act changed the NSAâ€ ™
s ability to search phone numbers .
Burr didnâ€ ™ t watch the debate , though , with more urgent programming to see : UPDATE : Reuters reports that the suspects in the San Bernardino terror attacks did not describe their intentions to commit terrorist acts on social media , as has been widely reported and as discussed extensively last night be the candidates .
The â€œfactâ€ � that the department of homeland security â€œfailedâ€ � to search the suspectsâ€ ™ social media accounts , many Republican candidates said , pointed to alarming flaws in the countryâ€ ™ s procedures for screening immigrants , and to a basic incompetence at the core of the Obama administration .
Except it appears there were no social media posts .
( CNN is reporting elsewhere , however , that the FBI has concluded the suspects exchanged direct messages in 2013 stating their intentions . )
What else ?
Rand Paul was on a roll last night :
And this mashup is not representative of anything that actually happened onstage in Las Vegas and yet is mildly amusing ."
2015-12-16,"The deep fissures in the Republican race for the White House have been laid bare during a televised debate marked by profound ideological clashes between candidates desperate to be noticed amid the suffocating dominance of the Republican frontrunner , Donald Trump .
On a night that may be remembered for Trump ’s defence of a policy of deliberately killing innocent civilians if they are the family members of Islamist fighters , his rivals for the Republican nomination appeared divided on issues as fundamental as immigration , surveillance , freedom of speech and regime change abroad .
It was a debate of repeated , one - on - one duels on the debate stage in Las Vegas , the most consequential of which occurred between Texas senator Ted Cruz and Florida senator Marco Rubio .
The two candidates , who are best poised to challenge Trump in a nomination process that begins with the Iowa caucus in just seven weeks , repeatedly locked horns over the ideological battles that have been engulfing their party for years .
It was the final Republican presidential debate of the year – and the first since the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino , California , which prompted Trump ’s incendiary proposal to ban foreign Muslims from entering the country .
None of the other eight candidates on stage supported Trump ’s plan for religious discrimination at the border .
But amid polls showing as many as 59 % of Republicans supporting a halt on Muslims entering the country few candidates showed much appetite for taking on the former host of The Apprentice .
“
I understand why they feel that way , ” Rubio said of Republicans supportive for Trump ’s ban on Muslims .
Cruz chose similar language , saying “ everyone understands why Donald has suggested what he has ” .
Amid a general show of timidity toward the frontrunner , one of the exceptions was former Florida governor Jeb Bush , who stepped up to the plate to swing at Trump with uncharacteristic zeal .
Bush said the ban on Muslims was “ not a serious proposal ” and would alienate the very allies in the Middle East required to defeat Islamist fighters .
“ Donald , you know , is great at the one - liners , ” Bush added .
“
But he ’s a chaos candidate , and he ’d be a chaos president .
”
It was the first of several tense bouts between Trump and Bush , who twice told the billionaire : “
You ’re not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency .
”
Another altercation occurred when Trump defended his position of intentionally killing innocent civilians who are family members of Islamic State militants – a breach of international law .
Trump invoked the September 11 terrorist attacks to justify killing family members of militants , saying it would deter future attacks .
“
They may not care much about their lives , but they do care , believe it or not , about their families , ” he explained .
Bush hit back , insisting the real estate mogul ’s proposal was “ just crazy ” .
Trump , who tolerated him at first , eventually turned on Bush in a tart and petty exchange that scarcely rose above the level of playground taunts about whose turn it was to talk .
The fracas ended with Trump mocking Jeb ’s standing in the polls .
“
I ’m at 42 and you ’re at three , ” Trump said , referring at a poll this week that showed he has increased his already commanding lead .
“
So I ’m doing better .
”
‘ World War III’ The tussles between Trump , who has exceeded all expectations in this race , and Bush , who even allies concede has been underwhelming , set the tone for a debate that drew out the points of differences between the White House aspirants .
The most noteworthy divisions were between Cruz and Rubio , who are second and third respectively in most of the polls .
Early on , the pair became embroiled in a detailed debate over the merits of the USA Freedom Act , the legislation that halted the bulk collection of American ’s phone records disclosed by National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden .
Rubio criticised Cruz for having supported the legislation .
“
I promise you the next time there is an attack on this country , the first thing people are going to want to know is why did n’t we know about it and why did n’t we stop it , ” the Florida senator said .
“
And the answer had better not be because we did n’t have access to records or information that would have allowed us to identify these killers before they attacked .
” Other candidates quickly became involved in the debate over privacy and national security – one that will keep fact - checkers busy for days to come .
Ohio senator John Kasich called for legislation to “ solve the problem of encryption ” , after claiming secure communications impeded the FBI from viewing communications between the San Bernardino shooters and other individuals they were monitoring .
( No such evidence has been made public by the FBI . )
Meanwhile , Carly Fiorina touted her cooperation with the NSA when she was chief executive of Hewlett Packard , and claimed that other Silicon Valley tech firms “ do not need to be forced ” to cooperate with law enforcement because they will happily comply if asked .
( Companies such as Apple , Facebook and Twitter , which are all resisting what they regard as undue government interference , may beg to differ . )
Trump , on the other hand , did not show much interest in the finer points of privacy , encryption and internet freedom , instead advancing a vague notion that parts of the internet could somehow be “ closed ” .
He declined to be drawn on specifics on what that would mean , saying only that he would want “ brilliant people from Silicon Valley and other places ” to figure out a way to impede Islamic State ’s use of the internet
“
You talk freedom of speech .
You talk freedom of anything you want , ” he said .
“
I do n’t want them using our internet to take our young , impressionable youth .
”
Libertarian senator Rand Paul was left aghast at what he portrayed as multiple assaults on constitutional rights from his fellow Republicans .
The Kentucky senator took rivals to task over the the wisdom of seeking to depose dictators such as the Syrian leader , Bashar al - Assad , and the logic of shooting down Russian fighter jets found to be intruding over any future no - fly zone over Syria .
It was the New Jersey governor , Chris Christie , who is predicating his bona fides as a tough , no - nonsense commander - in - chief , who said that he would not flinch when faced with errant Russian fighter jet in the region .
“
Yes , we would shoot down the planes of Russian pilots if in fact they were stupid enough to think that this president was the same feckless weakling that the president we have in the Oval Office is right now , ” Christie said .
Paul responded that any such move would be “ reckless ” .
“
It ’s a recipe for World War III , ” the senator said .
“
If you ’re in favour of World War III , you have your candidate .
”
‘ Fireman and arsonist’
The end of the debate , hosted at the Venetian , an Italian - themed casino resort owned by Republican mega - donor Sheldon Adelson , and billed as a wide - ranging discussion of national security in its broadest terms , focused mostly on issues of defence .
The CNN moderators did not ask a single question about the historic global accord reached in Paris on Saturday to avert the most catastrophic effects of climate change – which Barack Obama and many other leaders around the world regard an issue of national security .
Neither did they ask about gun control , despite the recent spate of mass shootings .
Immigration , however , was discussed extensively , and was the source of the most significant standoff between Cruz and Rubio .
The two senators , both staunch conservatives elected on the back of Tea Party support , are vying for the position as Trump ’s chief challenger .
Both are sons of Cuban immigrants but are on opposing ends of the Republican spectrum on the vexed issue of immigration reform .
Rubio ’s achilles heel in the race is his failed attempt to pass comprehensive reform through the Senate two years ago , and his continued – albeit heavily caveated – support for a path that would enable some undocumented migrants to one day become US citizens .
It has put him at odds with the majority of his party – and at loggerheads with Cruz who , like Trump , is making an unforgiving stance on immigration a cornerstone of his campaign .
When Rubio tried to downplay the differences between the two candidates , Cruz responded with a sharp retort .
“
For Marco to suggest our record
’s
the same is like likening the fireman and the arsonist because they are both at the scene of the fire , ” he said .
Cruz added the battle against the Islamic state “ is n’t just in Iraq and Syria , it ’s in Kennedy airport and the Rio Grande ” and accused Rubio of being on the side of the “ massive amnesty plan ” pushed by Obama and other Democrats .
Yet for all his debating skills , Cruz also found himself cornered by Rubio .
After weeks of ducking questions from reporters over whether he would countenance granting undocumented immigrants any form of legal status , Cruz was finally pressed to take a position when his rival asked him whether he would rule it out .
“
I have never supported legalisation , and I do not intend to support legalisation , ” he said .
The argument was concluded when the moderator intervened and asked Trump which of the candidates – Cruz or Rubio – he sided with .
The frontrunner looked momentarily flummoxed .
“
I have a very hardline position , ” he answered , declining to take sides .
It was an apt response after a night when , despite all of the fighting talk from Republican hopefuls , there was no clear victor .
Neither was there an obvious loser , although the retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson , who has watched his support base collapse in recent weeks , struggled to make an impression .
Carson opened the night with a moment of silence for victims of the San Bernardino that lasted all of five seconds , responded to his very first question by complaining he was n’t being given enough airtime – and then declined a request to contribute to the debate over surveillance .
“
I think you have to ask them about that , ” Carson answered when CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer invited him to intervene in a discussion over reform of the NSA .
“
I do n’t want to get in between them .
Let them fight .
”"
2015-12-17,"Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s efforts to pass comprehensive immigration reform were always thought to be a vulnerability in the Florida senatorâ€ ™ s
pursuit of the Republican nomination for president .
But few expected it would be Ted Cruz , the Texas senator who has fashioned himself as an immigration hardliner , who would find himself on the defensive .
The hints of a brewing storm over immigration â€ “ a contentious issue among Republicans , exacerbated this cycle by frontrunner Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s controversial tone toward immigrants â€ “ have been evident for some time .
But a sharp exchange in this weekâ€ ™ s presidential debate between Rubio and Cruz , both Cuban American senators , exposed the fissures that could define the remainder of the Republican primary .
It is Cruz , a longtime critic of so - called â€œamnestyâ€ � policies , who has spent the greater part of the debateâ€ ™ s aftermath seeking to clarify his position .
That Americaâ€ ™ s complex immigration system needs reform is an area of widespread consensus .
But the crux of the rift among Republicans is what to do about the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US .
Itâ€ ™ s a question Cruz had ducked for weeks , despite repeated efforts by reporters to pin down the senatorâ€ ™ s position on the campaign trail .
Standing on the debate stage before millions of Americans watching at home , Cruz finally addressed the issue by coming out against legal status for undocumented immigrants .
â€œI have never supported legalization and I do not intend to support legalization , â€ � Cruz said , after Rubio pressed the Texan in a tense back - and - forth between the two senators .
It was a tepid declaration , leaving many observers â€ “ including Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign â€ “ zeroing in on Cruzâ€ ™ s use of â€œintendâ€ � to remain deliberately vague .
But Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign chairman later told reporters the senator was â€œunequivocallyâ€ � against legalization for anyone residing in the country illegally .
Cruzâ€ ™ s bullishness against legalization , however , marked a shift from two years earlier when the US Senate debated a comprehensive immigration bill co - authored by Rubio .
The 2013 legislation , at the time a landmark compromise by a bipartisan group of senators known as the â€œGang of Eightâ€ � , included a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented .
At the time the bill was debated , Cruz repeatedly advocated for an amendment that would strip citizenship from the compromise and instead stop at simply legalization for the undocumented .
On Wednesday , Cruz stumbled through an interview on Fox News when asked to reconcile his prior statements in support of legalization with the position he took in the debate less than 24 hours earlier .
â€œThe fact that I introduced an amendment to remove part of the Gang of Eight bill doesnâ€
™ t mean I support the rest of the Gang of Eight bill , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œThe Gang of Eight bill was a mess , it was a terrible bill.â€
�
Fox News host Bret Baier , armed with quotes Cruz gave during the Senate immigration debate , painted a different picture â€ “ in which the senator repeatedly pushed for legalization .
Among them was an appearance by Cruz at his alma mater Princeton University , in which he cast his pro - legalization approach as a meaningful compromise .
â€œI believe that if my amendments were adopted , the bill would pass , â€ �
Cruz said in his remarks in May 2013 .
â€œMy effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and fixed the problem.â€ �
Asked to respond in his interview with Fox , Cruz appeared somewhat flummoxed .
â€œOf
course I wanted the bill â€ “ my amendment , to pass , â€ �
he said .
â€œWhat my amendment did was take citizenship off the table.â€
�
Cruz went on to claim that his measure was a poison pill , designed to kill the broader immigration bill and expose â€œthe hypocrisyâ€ � of those pushing for its passage .
He also tied Rubio to Democrats for his role in shepherding the immigration bill through the Senate .
In his own interview with Fox on Wednesday , Rubio said Cruz was â€œclearly a supporter of legalizationâ€ � and was only now singing a different tune as he courts conservatives , skeptical of immigration reform .
â€œBasically the argument he was making is , we can pass immigration reform
but we canâ€
™ t do citizenship .
Letâ€ ™ s just do legalization and if we do that , this bill has a chance of passing ,
â€ �
Rubio said of Cruz .
â€œNow , of course , in this campaign heâ€ ™ s looking for political advantage and so he tries to obscure the lines on it.â€ �
Rubio framed his own involvement in the comprehensive immigration reform effort , which subsequently soured his appeal among grassroots conservatives , as wanting to make a difference under a Senate led by Democrats .
He has since disavowed that approach and , for nearly two years , has advocated for a piecemeal approach to immigration reform that begins with enforcement at the border .
â€œAt this point
itâ€ ™ s the prudent thing to do , â€ �
Rubio said on Fox .
â€œWe just canâ€ ™ t pass this comprehensively.â€
�
Of his showdown with Cruz , Rubio added : â€œThe point I was trying to make is , I donâ€
™ t know how he can attack me on this issue when he himself supports legalization.â€
�
The rivalry between Rubio and Cruz is expected to dominate the coming weeks , as both senators jockey to dethrone Trump of his frontrunner status when the nominating contests begin .
Both senators have steadily risen in the polls and are well positioned in two of the early states â€ “ in Iowa , Cruz surged and in one influential poll last week took a 10-point lead over Trump ; and in New Hampshire , Rubio has ranked second behind Trump in a series of polls .
There are several other areas of disagreement between the two â€ “ including on surveillance and engaging the US military overseas â€ “ but the implications of the immigration debate are arguably the most profound .
Rubioâ€ ™ s own pollster predicted that Republicans would need to secure roughly 40 % of the Latino vote to win back the White House .
In 2012 , Mitt Romney pulled in just 27 % .
Alfonso Aguilar , the executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles , said Rubio was following a smarter strategy in positioning himself for a general election .
â€œRubio has said that the Senate bill he supported wasnâ€ ™ t a perfect bill , but he thought we needed to get the ball rolling .
Now heâ€
™ s saying , look Iâ€ ™ m still committed , we just have to change tactics to get things done , â€ �
Aguilar said .
â€œCruz , on the other hand , now has a credibility problem by going after Rubio , because in the debate he moved to the extreme .
It looks like clear pandering.â€ �
While building his candidacy as an inevitable landing place for Trump supporters should the real estate mogul fall from his mantle , Cruz has flipped on other aspects of the immigration debate .
He has called for the suspension of H-1B visas for highly skilled workers , after having previously supported a five - fold expansion of the same program .
Cruz has also embraced an end to birthright citizenship , even though he once stated it was â€œa
mistakeâ€ � for conservatives to fight the protection of birthright citizenship under the US constitution .
Rubioâ€ ™ s transformation has centered more on process as opposed to principles .
The senator has maintained he is â€œpersonally openâ€ � to some of the law - abiding undocumented immigrants eventually applying for green cards , although he has yet to specify how a pathway to citizenship would be achieved under his step - by - step proposal .
Rubioâ€ ™ s Democratic opponents have argued there would be no citizenship under his administration and , along with progressive immigration advocates , labeled the Floridian no less tough on the issue than Trump and Cruz .
In a speech before the National Immigrant Integration Conference this week , Hillary Clinton previewed a line of attack against Rubio in a potential general election match - up .
â€œNow you know , Senator Rubio actually helped write the 2013 immigration bill .
Now he renounces it ,
â€ � she said .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re all moving toward the extreme.â€ �
Rubio defended his attitude toward immigration in Tuesday nightâ€ ™ s debate , speaking of the issue as one he is intrinsically tied to through his family and West Miami hometown , with its sprawling Latino community .
â€œItâ€ ™ s an issue Iâ€ ™ ve lived around my whole life , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œMy family are immigrants .
My wifeâ€ ™ s family are immigrants .
All of my neighbors are immigrants.â€ � â€œI see every aspect of this problem .
The good , the bad , and the ugly.â€ � While the consequences of adopting too hard of a line could linger should Rubio be the nominee , at least for now , the senatorâ€ ™ s main challenge is blunting Cruzâ€ ™ s momentum .
And on immigration , itâ€ ™ s a battle in which he has unexpectedly turned the tables on Cruz in this initial round .
In recent days , Cruz has gone so far as to suggest he would deport undocumented immigrants
â€ “ another question on which he had previously hedged .
â€œI would enforce the law , â€ �
Cruz told CNN after the debate .
â€œFederal immigration law provides that if someone is here illegally and is apprehended , that they should be sent back to their home country.â€ �
Arizona senator John McCain , who co - authored the Senate immigration bill with Rubio , said his impression was that Cruzâ€ ™
s posturing did indeed amount to a flip - flop .
â€œSenator Cruz has done a remarkable 180 , but you can do that nowadays when youâ€ ™ re running for president , â€ �
McCain said when asked by the Guardian if he believed Cruz genuinely supported legalization .
â€œHe used to , â€ � McCain said , before adding in a mocking tone : â€œHe wanted to expand the H1-B visas â€
“
that was an amendment he had on that
â€˜terribleâ€ ™ Gang of Eight proposal ... that evil plot to destroy America.â€ � Craig Robinson , an Iowa Republican strategist , dubbed the Rubio campaignâ€ ™ s move as â€œpretty savvyâ€
�
given the obstacles Rubio will face if he is successfully defined as being â€œpro - amnestyâ€ � .
â€œNow
itâ€ ™ s
Cruz that has to do the explaining , â€ � Robinson said .
â€œCruz is the one who has to say how his position is really all that different from what Rubioâ€ ™ s position is , which puts him at odds with some of the more conservative candidates in the race.â€ �
â€œThis is new to a lot of people.â€ �"
2015-12-25,"Marco Rubio recognized the question immediately â€ “ a knowing expression overtaking the young senatorâ€ ™ s face as a voter nearly twice his age began to draw the comparison .
â€œOne of the concerns that I have is that eight years ago , I heard the same kind of articulation â€ ¦ an element of hope and youth coming forward , an attractive family , â€ � said 78-year - old Bill Doherty , teeing up a familiar query for Rubio that would close out a three - day swing through New Hampshire .
â€œI have no idea who youâ€ ™ re talking about , â€ � Rubio deadpanned , as laughter spread across the crowd of around 150 who had packed into a room on the day before Christmas Eve for a pancake breakfast with the Republican presidential candidate .
â€œMy concern is , we have heard this before from someone who had no experience but yet had a great story and was very articulate in getting it across , â€ � Doherty continued .
The comparisons to Barack Obama are anything but new .
They have loomed over Rubio , who if elected president in 2016 would be the first Latino to occupy the White House , ever since the 44-year - old Florida senator launched his campaign as a â€œcandidate of the futureâ€ � .
Just the day before , Rubio fielded the same question twice in the town of Littleton , from both an older couple who approached the senator during a retail stop and from a much younger voter at a town hall .
Danielle Matteson , 29 , asked Rubio for his response to those â€œwho question your ability to hold this nationâ€ ™ s highest executive role , given that many of your competitors have had previous executive experience either at the private sector or at the state levelâ€ � .
In that exchange , it was Rubio who raised the Obama analogy of his own volition .
â€œThat question often comes up in the following context , â€ � Rubio , the youngest candidate in the race , explained to his audience .
â€œObama was a senator , youâ€ ™ re a senator .
He was there for two years , youâ€ ™ ve been there for four years .
Explain to us how itâ€ ™ s going to be different.â€ �
In New Hampshire , Rubio provided an answer consistent with what he has told crowds across the other early voting states , from Iowa to South Carolina to Nevada .
â€œThe reason why Barack Obama failed is because his ideas donâ€ ™ t work , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not that he didnâ€ ™ t have the experience .
Itâ€ ™ s that his ideas were the wrong ones.â€
�
He then drew a contrast between their parallel career trajectories : Obama had been a â€œbackbencherâ€ � in the Illinois state legislature , Rubio said , whereas he had been speaker of the Florida House .
Obama had served just two years in the US Senate , while he would close out a full six - year term if inaugurated in 2017 .
Rubio also noted that Obama had been successful in pushing through â€œliberalâ€ �
priorities â€ “ such as the Iran nuclear accord , Wall Street reform and the healthcare law â€ “ suggesting he would accomplish the same for conservatives .
Doherty , while still preferring a more seasoned candidate , said he found Rubioâ€ ™ s response to be effective â€ “ as did the applauding crowd .
Rubioâ€ ™ s Republican rivals have nonetheless sought to turn what he views as a key asset into a liability : his relative youth .
Much like Jeb Bush , New Jersey governor Chris Christie criticised the first - term senatorâ€ ™ s leadership skills , as he seeks to infringe upon Rubioâ€ ™ s standing in New Hampshire , where the Floridian is polling in second place behind frontrunner Donald Trump .
â€œThere are a bunch of shiny new trucks in this race but they havenâ€ ™ t been in the mud , â€ �
Christie said at one stop last weekend after criticizing Rubio .
â€œThey havenâ€ ™ t been tested.â€ �
Despite the efforts by Rubioâ€ ™ s opponents to question his experience , itâ€ ™ s the governors in the race who are laboring to break through .
Christie , Bush and Ohio governor John Kasich stand behind Rubio in both the early states and nationally .
The first three candidates to drop out of the race â€ “ Rick Perry , Scott Walker and Bobby Jindal â€ “ were all governors .
Rubioâ€ ™ s main competition has come not from the chief executive of a state , but from another first - term senator â€ “ Ted Cruz , of Texas , who is just a few months his senior .
Trump , the real estate mogul who has commanded the polls for six months , is older in age , at 69 , but has never held public office .
Pushing back on the governors , Rubio echoed a line from his stump speech at his town hall in Littleton : â€œAnyone who tells you
â€˜When
I was governor , we created a million jobs , â€ ™ I would be concerned , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œBecause if theyâ€ ™ re telling the truth , that means they grew government by a million jobs .
Thatâ€ ™ s the only way a politician creates a million jobs.â€ �
When a voter in the riverside city of Berlin asked the fresh - faced senator if he was essentially old enough to sit across the table from Vladimir Putin and the â€œmullahs in Tehran , â€ � Rubio touted his foreign policy bona fides , a core argument of his candidacy .
â€œIt is true that there are people running for president that have lived longer than I have , â€ � he said .
â€œWhat is not true is that anybody running for president has a better understanding or shown better judgement on the issues we face than I do â€ “ particularly foreign policy.â€
� â€œIâ€ ™ m
the only one running for president that has carefully and repeatedly , for a long time now , explained what Vladimir Putin is doing .
Iâ€ ™ ll go in knowing exactly who he is , and heâ€ ™ ll know I know exactly who he is.â€ � Christian Burnett , a 30-year - old from the defense industry who grilled Rubio on military spending after his last event , said he did not view the senatorâ€ ™ s youth negatively .
â€œI think heâ€ ™ s one of the most knowledgeable ones up there â€ “ in terms of foreign policy issues , heâ€ ™ s very intelligent , â€ � he said .
â€œCompare that to the frontrunner , Donald Trump , who doesnâ€ ™ t have a clue about any of those issues.â€ � â€œI donâ€ ™ t
think you have to have executive experience to be president of the United States , â€ � he added .
â€œThere have been plenty of presidents who had executive experience , and they were terrible presidents.â€ �
Most voters , including Burnett , said they remained undecided as to whom they planned to support in New Hampshireâ€ ™ s primary on 9 February .
Less concernedwith candidatesâ€ ™
resumes ,
several of those who attended Rubioâ€ ™ s events expressed the need for a serious alternative to Trump .
Kimberly Parker said she was impressed with Rubioâ€ ™ s â€œspecificityâ€ � and overall tone .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a lot of extreme statements being made , a lot of bombast ,
â€ �
she said , adding of Rubio : â€œHe struck me as more middle - of - the - road .
I was pleasantly surprised.â€ �
Speaking before crowds occasionally large enough to necessitate extra rows of chairs , Rubio repeatedly weaved his personal biography into a wide range of issues .
Throughout his appearances , Rubio has emphasized a different kind of experience that he argued would better inform his decision - making as president : unlike other candidates , the senator said , he was raised in a working class family and had faced the same financial challenges as many Americans .
On immigration , the senator pointed out that he and his wife Jeanette were both born to immigrant parents and that their entire West Miami community comprised immigrants .
On college affordability , Rubio recalled that he was saddled with student loan debt until just a few years ago .
In his lighter moments , too , Rubio presented a more relatable demeanor .
His wife and children accompanied him on several stops , including to a local candy store where at least one of his sons appeared ready for a Rubio presidency .
Anthony , 10 , rushed over to his dad with a toy he had grabbed from one of the shelves : secret service earbuds .
â€œWell , you donâ€ ™ t need those , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œYes , I do , â€ � his son replied , adding , â€œYouâ€
™ ll
see.â€ �
Rubio let out a sigh , then channeled any other dad : â€œShow it to your mom.â€ �"
2015-12-29,"Marco Rubio faced a fresh round of attacks on Tuesday from his Republican rivals over the Florida senatorâ€ ™ s penchant for skipping votes while running for president .
As Rubio embarked on a bus tour across the critical battleground of Iowa , the New Jersey governor , Chris Christie , told voters at a town hall in the same state that his opponent should consider resigning his Senate seat .
â€œDude , show up to work , â€ �
Christie told voters in Muscatine .
â€œShow up to work and vote no .
And if you donâ€ ™ t like it , quit!â€ � â€œHe gives a good speech , Marco , and I want to hear his stirring speech thatâ€ ™ s going to try to persuade people on the floor of the Senate not to vote for this awful spending bill .
Except he never showed up â€ ¦ Only in Washington could you have the guts to stand up and say ,
â€˜Iâ€ ™ m against somethingâ€ ™ that you have a vote to vote no on , and then just not go and then put out a press release after it gets passed and say , â€˜This is why I was opposed to itâ€ ™
.â€ �
Christie has escalated his criticism of Rubio in recent weeks , particularly while seeking to blunt the senatorâ€ ™ s momentum in New Hampshire â€ “ a state where Christie has invested heavily but trails Rubio , who is in second place behind frontrunner Donald Trump .
The governor has similarly gone after Rubio while campaigning in New Hampshire for missing a vote this month on a $ 1.1tn omnibus spending bill , although he had yet to suggest Rubio quit his day job .
Rubio hit back at Christie hours later for pulling back from his own day job in New Jersey .
â€œYou know , Chris has been missing in New Jersey for half the time ,
â€ �
Rubio told reporters in Iowa after a town hall event .
â€œCandidates , as we get down the home stretch , some of them get a little desperate and a little nasty in their attacks.â€ � Christie , according to reporters , will have spent all or part of 60 % of the days in 2015 outside of his home state .
Earlier on Tuesday , a Super Pac supporting former Florida governor Jeb Bush unveiled a $ 1.4 m ad buy against Rubio that will air across Iowa over the next two weeks .
Its primary charge : that the senator missed classified briefings on the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino to instead fundraise for his campaign .
â€œOver the last three years Rubio has missed important national security hearings and missed more total votes than any other senator , â€ � the narrator says in the ad , by Right to Rise USA .
â€œPolitics
first â€ “
thatâ€ ™ s
the Rubio way.â€ � Rubioâ€ ™ s team pushed back aggressively against the ad , pointing out that the senator attended a Senate intelligence committee meeting that was among â€œthe highest - level briefingsâ€ � on the Paris attacks .
â€œNo other candidate for president has received more classified intelligence briefings or better understands the threats facing our nation today than Marco , â€ �
Rubioâ€ ™ s spokesman , Alex Conant , said in a statement .
In a reference to Bushâ€ ™ s pledge earlier this year to campaign â€œjoyfullyâ€ � , Conant added :
â€œItâ€ ™ s sad to see Jebâ€ ™ s â€˜joyfulâ€ ™ campaign reduced to such intellectual dishonesty.â€ �
A Super Pac backing Rubio , Conservative Solutions PAC , chimed in with a video showcasing the many times Bush â€ “ a former ally of Rubioâ€ ™ s in Florida â€
“ praised the senator before competing against him for the Republican nomination for president .
â€œI am his friend , and heâ€ ™ s mine .
And Iâ€ ™ m never going to disparage him , â€ � Bush says in one of the clips when asked about Rubio .
The former governor nonetheless set his sights on Rubio in the fall , as the senator began to rise in the polls and emerged as a favorite among top Republican donors .
After questioning whether Rubio had adequate experience to hold the nationâ€ ™ s highest office , Bush attacked his Senate attendance during the third Republican presidential debate in October .
â€œI mean , literally , the Senate â€ “ what is it , like a French work week?â€ �
Bush asked Rubio .
â€œYou get , like , three days where you have to show up.â€ �
Rubio defended himself by noting that many other senators who sought the presidency â€ “ such as John McCain , John Kerry and Barack Obama â€ “ all missed as many , if not more , votes than he did .
In a memorable blow , he turned to Bush and added : â€œSomeone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.â€ �
Rubio repeated that line on Tuesday when asked for his response to the pro - Jeb Super Pac ad , adding that the attack â€œisnâ€ ™ t accurateâ€ � .
â€œAs
a member of the intelligence committee , I have access to information that isnâ€ ™ t even shared with others that are not on the committee , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s par for the course that as we get closer to election day , and millions of dollars of spending have not changed his fortune , heâ€ ™ s become increasingly negative in his attacks .
This is not new.â€ � Several analyses have shown that Rubio does hold a record low attendance relative to his current counterparts in the Senate , where he is not seeking re - election in 2016 .
Rubio has acknowledged the missed votes , but has said many of them were inconsequential and he will return to Washington if his vote can influence the outcome .
â€œLook , Iâ€
™ m running for president because I want to change the direction of this country , â€ � Rubio said Tuesday .
â€œAnd it will require for the time being to miss some votes in the US Senate , because I want those votes to matter again.â€ �
Whether that response will satisfy voters remains unclear , but thus far there is little evidence that the attacks on Rubioâ€ ™ s Senate attendance have stuck .
The senator is polling among the top three Republican candidates in most national and early state polls .
He has also continued to pick up endorsements from a growing list of members of Congress , adding to his list on Tuesday Representative Trey Gowdy â€ “ who rose to national prominence for chairing the House select committee on Benghazi .
The South Carolina congressman joined Rubio for a multi - county bus tour across Iowa , where he praised Rubioâ€ ™ s â€œability to communicate our message of principled conservatism in a hopeful , aspirational , persuasive wayâ€ � .
â€œI am going to vote for Marco Rubio and I will tell you why .
National security , public safety are the most important issues to me .
And there is nobody better on those two issues than Marco Rubio , â€ � Gowdy said .
â€œWhen
I say national security , I mean border security , interior security , and I mean employment security .
And if I did not think Marco Rubio was good on border security , interior security , and employment security , I would have kept myself in South Carolina .
I wouldnâ€
™ t be in Iowa right now.â€ �"
2016-01-03,"As Republicans entered the home stretch of selecting a candidate to win back the White House , Marco Rubio asked voters to envision a general election in which Hillary Clinton could â€œlectureâ€ � him on the lives of struggling Americans .
Speaking on Sunday before a crowd of roughly 200 on the first stop of a swing through New Hampshire , which will hold the first primary in just over a monthâ€ ™ s time , Rubio underscored the importance of what he called â€œone of most important elections in a generationâ€ � .
Clinton was also in the state on Sunday .
Regardless of criticism sent her way by Rubio , Donald Trump and more in the Republican field , she largely stuck to her stump speech .
Rubio , who is among the top three Republicans in most national and state polls , focused his fire on the Democratic frontrunner .
â€œHow is Hillary Clinton going to lecture me about people living paycheck to paycheck?â€ �
he asked , reviving the case he made for his candidacy in the first Republican presidential debate last summer and has often referred to since .
â€œI actually lived paycheck to paycheck .
I grew up living paycheck to paycheck .
I want to know how sheâ€ ™ s going to lecture me on student loans , since I had one up until four years ago .
How is she going to lecture me on how to raise children in the 21st century , when my wife and I are actually doing that?â€
� Rubio , 44 , launched his presidential campaign in April with a pitch rooted in his youth and a denunciation of â€œnames of the pastâ€ � .
The jab was aimed not only against Clinton , the former senator and secretary of state , but also Jeb Bush , the son and brother of US presidents who then stood as the Republican frontrunner .
But the run - up to the election year was fraught with unexpected twists .
On the Republican side , that mostly meant the rise of Trump â€ “ the bombastic real estate mogul who remains the frontrunner with only 27 days to go before the Iowa caucuses .
On the Democratic side , Clinton holds a commanding lead nationally but has been forced to contend with an unexpected threat posed by Bernie Sanders .
â€œNone of our candidates is a socialist , â€ � Rubio quipped of the Vermont senator on Sunday , to laughs .
He nonetheless paid most attention to the frontrunner .
â€œWe canâ€ ™ t afford to elect Hillary Clinton , â€ � he said .
â€œWe canâ€ ™ t afford another four years like the last seven.â€
�
The emphasis on Clinton marked something of a departure from Rubioâ€ ™ s stump speech over the last year , which has been based on national security and his personal story as the son of Cuban immigrants who worked as a bartender and a maid .
Although he has consistently criticized the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s foreign policy â€ “ and tied Clinton to it in her role as his first - term secretary of state â€ “ in recent days Rubio has painted a portrait of an American society where critical values are at stake .
On Sunday , he called the election â€œa referendum on our identity as a nation and as a peopleâ€ � .
â€œIf youâ€ ™ re pro - life , youâ€ ™ re waging a war on women .
If you believe in traditional marriage , youâ€ ™ re labeled a bigot , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œWe live in a world where Isis is beheading people ; we live in a world where Isis is burning people in cages .
And yet we have a president who says climate change is the biggest threat facing America.â€ � Clinton , speaking later at a town hall in Derry , less than an hour away , also discussed the culture wars .
She warned that Republicans were intent on â€œturning back the clockâ€ � .
â€œI will defend a womanâ€ ™ s right to choose .
I will protect Planned Parenthood , â€
�
she said to thunderous applause , adding that she would also work to expand LGBT rights and to protect marriage equality .
The former secretary of state also mocked what she said was â€œa particular fixationâ€ � among Republicans
â€œon blaming President Obama and me for everything that happens in the worldâ€ � . â€œTheyâ€ ™ re back to the Crimean War and theyâ€ ™ re on their way to the Roman Empire , â€ �
she said , drawing laughter from an audience of roughly 750 .
â€œThe fact is , if you donâ€ ™ t have a foreign policy , you donâ€ ™ t have much to say except to try to criticize the other people , â€ � Clinton said , before launching into an assessment of the Republican view on international conflict and the rise of terrorism .
â€œNo 1 , send American troops anywhere at any time to do something and , while youâ€ ™ re at it , bomb something â€ “ preferably carpet bomb , whatever that means , â€ � she said ,
the latter comment a reference to the Texas senator Ted Cruz , who has said he would â€œcarpet bomb Isis into oblivionâ€ � .
Clinton largely stuck to her stump speech , laying out her proposals for issues ranging from providing debt - free college and allowing students to refinance loans at lower interest rates to tackling substance abuse and combating climate change through clean energy policies .
Republicans , she said , refused to even acknowledge that global warming was real , because they were beholden to special interests within the fossil fuel industry .
Rubio , meanwhile , is well - positioned in New Hampshire , holding the second - place position in most polls , and he was well received by a crowd which awarded his speech a standing ovation and applauded in particular his push for a stronger military .
One voter did , however , point out that a Rubio - Clinton presidential debate would require the elimination of a more immediate threat .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re going to have to beat Trump to have a shot at Hillary , â€ � the man said , invoking the reality TV star whose support is nearly double that of Rubioâ€ ™ s in New Hampshire .
Rubio , rather than criticizing Trump , acknowledged how his chief opponent has so successfully channelled anger among voters to top a crowded field , which has fallen from 17 to 13 candidates .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s a legitimate thing to be angry about the direction of our country .
You should be upset , â€ � Rubio said , adding that many of his colleagues in Congress spend more time working toward their next elections than representing the people they serve .
â€œThey fall in love with Washington .
They fall in love with the institutions , â€ � he said .
Rubio himself has been criticized by opponents for his long absences from the Senate , where he has the worst attendance record of all 100 senators .
Rubio nonetheless urged voters in New Hampshire â€ “ which prides itself on its record in â€œpicking presidentsâ€ � â€ “ to bring home an election that has until now been marked by chaos .
â€œThatâ€
™ s why Iâ€ ™ m here .
Ultimately the choice is up to you , â€ � he said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not up to the polls , and itâ€ ™ s not up to the commentators.â€ �"
2016-01-04,"Marco Rubio on Monday framed the presidential election as a choice that would define Americaâ€ ™ s role on the global stage .
In doing so , he took direct aim at both Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s record as secretary of state and Republican candidates he called â€œisolationistsâ€ � .
In response , a spokeswoman for one such opponent , Senator Ted Cruz , called Rubioâ€ ™ s stance on foreign policy â€œincoherentâ€ � and â€œdangerousâ€ � .
Wrapping a visit to New Hampshire , which will hold the first presidential primary in just over a monthâ€ ™ s time , Rubio accused Clinton of lying in her response to the September 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi .
He also called her â€œincompetentâ€ � and criticised her policy regarding Russia and Syria .
But the senator , polling in the top tier of a crowded Republican field , reserved some of his sharpest criticism for his own party .
Although he did not mention any candidate by name , he took subtle shots at Cruz , Kentucky senator Rand Paul and the frontrunner , Donald Trump .
â€œOn the other side of this election is the party of Reagan , the party of strong national defense and moral clarity , â€ �
he said .
â€œYet we have Republican candidates who propose that rulers like [ Syrian president Bashar al- ]
Assad and [ Russian president Vladimir ]
Putin should be partners of the United States , and who have voted with Barack Obama and Harry Reid rather than with our men and women in uniform .
â€œWe have isolationist candidates who are apparently more passionate about weakening our military and intelligence capabilities than about destroying our enemies.â€ �
Of Saudi Arabia cutting diplomatic ties with Iran , amid regional anger over the Saudi regimeâ€ ™ s execution of an Iranian cleric , Rubio told reporters after his speech that despite his not being â€œa big fan of the judicial system in Saudi Arabiaâ€ � , â€œour response should be to stand with our alliesâ€ � .
â€œOne of the things
thatâ€ ™ s hurt this country in the Middle East
has been this presidentâ€ ™ s betrayal of our allies in favor of Iran with this deal , â€ �
he said , referring to the multinational agreement regarding Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear ambitions .
â€œThe other thing , â€ � he continued , â€œis
it [ the situation with Saudi Arabia ] reveals the true nature of the criminal government that governs Iran â€
“ they allowed protesters to storm a diplomatic facility .
â€œThey allowed them to storm a wing or section of the Saudi embassy and trash it , and it just gives you an indication of who weâ€ ™ re dealing with here , which is a country that has no respect for international laws , has no respect for norms of governance.â€ �
As the start of voting approaches , Rubio has been especially critical of Cruz and Paul on national security â€ “ namely their support for ending the National Security Agencyâ€ ™ s bulk collection of phone records .
As president , Rubio said , he would not only restore the NSAâ€
™ s
authorities but strengthen them .
â€œIsis does not use carrier pigeons to communicate , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œThey use sophisticated encryption and carefully secured networks .
It was already difficult to infiltrate them ; now it is even harder.â€ �
Like Rubio , Cruz is a first - term senator of Cuban descent with a strong hold over grassroots conservatives .
In his stump speech , Rubio often questions Cruz , if never by name , for suggesting he would â€œcarpet bomb Isis into oblivion â€ ¦ until the sands glowâ€ � .
On Monday , Rubio said â€œwords and political stunts can not ensure our securityâ€ � ; nor could Isis â€œbe filibusteredâ€ � . â€œWhile
some claim they would destroy Isis , that they would make the sands of the Middle East â€˜glow in the darkâ€ ™ , my question is :
â€˜With what?â€ ™ â€ �
Rubio said , before charging some of his Republican opponents with voting to lower defense cuts .
Later on Monday , in response to Rubioâ€ ™ s speech , Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign offered its own assessment of the senatorâ€ ™ s worldview .
â€œSo Rubioâ€ ™ s foreign policy and national security strategy
is to invade Middle Eastern countries , create power vacuums for terrorist organizations , allow their people to come to America unvetted , give them legal status and citizenship , then impose a massive surveillance state to monitor the problem , â€ �
Alice Stewart , a national spokeswoman for Cruz , said in a statement to the Guardian .
â€œIâ€ ™ m trying to figure out if it is more incoherent than dangerous or vice versa.â€ � Alex Conant , a Rubio spokesman , hit back : â€œNo amount of false rhetoric will cover up the fact that Cruz voted for Rand Paulâ€ ™ s isolationist budget to slash military spending and gut US intelligence programs .
Cruz might talk tough , but he would endanger America by partnering with rulers like Assad and Putin .
Marco has consistently fought to strengthen Americaâ€ ™ s military , intelligence programs and border security , and as president his top priority will be to keep Americans safe.â€ �
National security , a top priority among Republican voters , has been central to Rubioâ€ ™ s platform .
Since the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino , he has cited his knowledge of foreign policy as what separates him from the rest of the Republican field â€ “ he sits on the influential Senate foreign relations and intelligence committees .
His opponents have pointed out that several of Rubioâ€ ™ s congressional backers also voted in favor of reforming the NSA , and by pointing to his vote in the foreign relations committee against authorizing US strikes in Syria in 2013 .
After his speech on Monday Christina Reynolds , a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign , accused Rubio of hypocrisy .
â€œMarco Rubioâ€ ™ s attempts to curry favor among the Republican base by blasting Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration on foreign policy are ironic considering he backed many of the very policies he now points to as problematic , â€ �
Reynolds said in a statement .
â€œRubio supported the US intervention in Libya , saying the administration â€˜did the right thingsâ€ ™ .
At various points , Rubio supported arming the moderate opposition in Syria , a position Hillary Clinton advocated .
And in fact , when President Obama sought congressional authorization to strike Syria for using chemical weapons on their own people , which Hillary Clinton supported , it was Marco Rubio who voted against it.â€ �
Rubio has defended that vote by saying the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s proposal to launch air strikes against Assad would have been â€œcounterproductiveâ€ � , while additional air power deployed against Isis would be appropriate .
On Monday , Rubio said he has been clear about his aim to confront Isis : â€œWhen you vote for me , you know exactly what youâ€ ™ ll get .
Youâ€ ™ ll get a president who will destroy terrorists overseas by authorizing whatever tools our commanders need.â€ �
And as the Pentagon prepares to transfer more detainees from GuantÃ¡namo Bay in the coming week , Rubio vowed to fully utilize the facility for interrogation and imprisonment â€ “ including of American citizens .
â€œWhen
I am president , foreign terrorists caught overseas will receive a one - way ticket to GuantÃ¡namo , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œAnd if youâ€ ™ re an American who has committed the ultimate act of betrayal against our country , I will have no qualms about treating you like the enemy combatant
you are if you have actionable information and refuse to cooperate.â€ �"
2016-01-05,"The more cynical among us might poke fun at , and poke holes into , the idea of â€œthe American Dreamâ€ � in this era of unprecedented inequality .
But the majority of Latino millennials still believe in it , according to a 2014 study contrasting Latino millennials to their non - Latino counterparts .
And much as it pains me to say it , Marco Rubio tells the American Dream â€ “ child of immigrants ; working class childhood ; scholarship and community college ; law school ; marriage and children ; an imperfect but aspirational career â€ “ story better than any other presidential hopeful currently in contention .
Thatâ€ ™ s why , though Iâ€ ™ m a lifelong Democrat , and most fellow Latino voters are too , I spend a lot of time thinking about him , worried that he would carry a great number of fellow Latino votes in a general election despite his ultra - conservative views .
Iâ€ ™ ve heard plenty of concern expressed by Latino millennials about Rubioâ€ ™ s slide from his â€œgang of eightâ€ � comprehensive take on immigration , which argued for granting amnesty to undocumented immigrants , to his current , more stridently â€œenforcement - firstâ€ � stance .
But immigration isnâ€ ™ t the only issue on which Rubio and US Latinos part ways .
Rubio doesnâ€ ™ t believe human activity is the cause of climate change , but 66 % of Latinos do ( it is a matter of pride for many of them that Latin America has taken the lead in the fight against climate change ) .
And the Affordable Health Care Act , which most US Latinos support , has been undermined by provisions Rubio slipped into a spending bill late last year .
But Rubio code - switches from English to Spanish as effortlessly as second generation Latino - Americans do .
That , combined with the continuing pull of his rags - to - riches narrative , may help explain why , as the editor of a code - switching , Philadelphia - based news media organization centered on the US Latino experience , Iâ€ ™ ve lost count of the millennial , US - born children of immigrants who tell me that they like Rubio anyway , believing that if he were elected heâ€ ™ d return to a more measured immigration position .
In a recent conversation with national faith leaders and immigration advocates ( who asked not to be identified ) I was told that Rubio is considered someone with whom advocacy organizations will be able to work fruitfully , as opposed to Ted Cruz , the other Latino Republican presidential candidate , whom they consider a lost cause where immigration is concerned .
Multiple liberal and Latino political wonks spent much of 2015 assuring readers that Rubio can not and will not appeal to Latino voters .
And plenty of Latinos agree , pointing to the difference in Cuban Americans and Mexican Americans ( the largest share of the Latino population by far ) and their very different paths to citizenship in the United States as a large obstacle to earning Rubio broad Latino support .
But I am not reassured , because the right story can trump a host of provable realities .
I look at Rubio and understand that not only is he the choice of some of my young Latino colleagues , but if my â€œup by my bootstrapsâ€ � father were still alive , Rubio would have been his choice as well ."
2016-01-06,"Marco Rubio has made the critical political mistake of not dressing like a complete schlub .
Everyone , it seems , is talking about his kinky boots .
The Florida senator and Republican presidential candidate came close to pulling off an acceptably frumpy look as he boarded his campaign bus in New Hampshire on Monday : mildly unkempt hair ; creased black dress pants before noon ; a lumpy blue sweater .
But Rubioâ€ ™ s decision to don what Vanity Fair delicately dubbed â€œstatement footwearâ€ � has turned his three - inch heels into a ball and chain .
A chance tweet from a New York Times political reporter and former fashion correspondent spurred snark from Senator Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s communications director ( â€œA vote for Marco Rubio is a vote for menâ€ ™ s high - heeled bootiesâ€ � ) , teasing from fellow Senator Rand Paul ( â€œCute new boots!â€ � ) , and a sideswipe from fellow Floridian Jeb Bush ( â€œTheyâ€ ™ re not high - heeledâ€ � ) .
â€œThis is straight out of an Austin Powers movie , â€ �
laughed MSNBC host Joe Scarborough , in an entire Morning Joe segment devoted to Rubioâ€ ™ s sartorial slip - up .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re shagalicious!â€ �
All because Rubio broke the unwritten rule of American campaigning that requires would - be Oval Office occupants to replace the contents of their closets with heavily starched white dress shirts , three - inch wide red ties and boxy suit jackets at least two sizes too large .
The only embellishment allowed , perhaps , is the candidateâ€ ™ s choice of American flag pin .
The dress code projects maturity , responsibility , and above all , hyper - masculinity , which means that for a presidential hopeful to don footwear in the same vein as that worn by teen Britpop idols is a fashion faux pas of the highest order .
But Rubioâ€ ™ s shoes havenâ€ ™ t garnered attention solely from men still uneasy about the mainstreaming of the word â€œmetrosexualâ€

Nearly eight years after then - vice - presidential nominee Sarah Palin faced scorn and scandal for her $ 150,000 wardrobe makeover â€
“
the tab for which was picked up by the Republican National Committee â€ “ Republican candidates have stuck to fashion tastes as conservative as their politics as a method of separating themselves from the urban elite .
Fancy shoes , snug suits , and $ 1,250 haircuts are the mark of effete liberals who never sit down to supper in their undershirt , no matter how hot the weather gets .
The result has been a generation of candidates in unsuitable suits .
Current speaker of the House Paul Ryan may have shared a ticket with Mitt Romney , but he certainly didnâ€ ™ t share a tailor ; Cruzâ€ ™ s overcoat makes him look like three children stacked on top of each othersâ€ ™ shoulders ; Bush apparently sported the same grey half - zip jumper for four straight days in December .
One candidate , at least , didnâ€ ™ t think that Rubioâ€ ™ s heels were too tall .
Carly Fiorina , a former chief executive and the only woman running in the Republican presidential primary , scoffed at the senatorâ€ ™ s pitiful mid - rises : â€œYeah , Marco , but can you rock these?â€ �
she told Independent Journal , with an accompanying picture of her 3.5-inch heels ."
2016-01-06,"North Koreaâ€ ™ s self - proclaimed successful testing of a hydrogen bomb has succeeded in uniting the bifurcated field of Republican presidential candidates against a common enemy : Barack Obama .
By the time the worldâ€ ™ s great powers joined together in universal condemnation of the hermit kingdomâ€ ™ s latest nuclear provocation at a UN security council meeting on Wednesday morning , more than half a dozen contenders for the Republican nomination had issued statements decrying Obamaâ€ ™ s â€œweaknessâ€ � , which they see as facilitating North Koreaâ€ ™ s nuclear ambitions .
Senator Marco Rubio of Florida led the charge with a late - night tweetstorm following news of the test , calling the detonation â€œjust the latest example of the failed Obama - Clinton foreign policyâ€ � .
â€œI have been warning throughout this campaign that North Korea is run by a lunatic who has been expanding his nuclear arsenal while President Obama has stood idly by , â€ �
Rubio said in a statement .
â€œOur enemies around the world are taking advantage of Obamaâ€ ™ s weakness .
We need new leadership that will stand up to people like Kim Jong - un and ensure our country has the capabilities necessary to keep America safe.â€ �
Rubioâ€ ™ s critique was echoed by New Jersey governor Chris Christie , who decried Obamaâ€ ™ s â€œweak responseâ€ � to North Korean nuclear aggressions under his watch .
â€œThree out of the four nuclear detonations that the North Koreans have done have happened under Barack Obama and Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s watch , â€ �
Christie said during an appearance on Fox and Friends .
â€œThey have just not acted strongly at all around the world .
This is just another example , piled on top of Iran , on top of Syria , on top Crimea and Ukraine ...
this is what weak American leadership gets you.â€ �
On CNN , Kentucky senator Rand Paul , who has been labelled a â€œcommitted isolationistâ€ � on foreign policy by Rubio and other rivals for the Republican nomination , redirected the question of North Korean nuclear aggression to a criticism of the comprehensive deal on Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear programme .
â€œI would say that there are many parallels to the Iran agreement , â€ � Paul said .
â€œMany of us said that thatâ€ ™ s the danger of the Iran agreement â€ “ once they get nuclear weapons , itâ€ ™ s hard to know what to do and how you will respond.â€
�
The test , North Koreaâ€ ™ s fourth since first detonating a â€œfizzledâ€ � atomic weapon in October 2006 , prompted other candidates to join the coalition of the willing on social media : Largely missing from the condemnation of Obamaâ€ ™ s perceived lack of action on North Korea was condemnation of North Korea itself : beyond Paul , who on CNN criticized the northâ€ ™ s â€œfailed economic systemâ€ � as indicative of the superiority of capitalism over â€œsocialismâ€ � , no would - be nominee has directed much ire in the direction of the repressive communist autocracy responsible for the test itself .
Part of this may be rooted in the Republican fieldâ€ ™ s general lack of coherent policy on North Korea , which has taken a back seat to the Islamic State , Russia and the Syrian civil war in most discussions of foreign policy this cycle .
When asked for their candidateâ€ ™ s positions on increased sanctions , boosting US troop presence on the 38th parallel or other possible responses to North Korean aggression , for example , press representatives for candidate Carly Fiorina provided the Guardian with a copy of a speech she gave on China in July .
( The word â€œKoreaâ€ � never appears in the transcript . )
Obama has repeatedly imposed economic sanctions on North Korea as part of a policy of â€œstrategic patienceâ€ � .
Yet the universality of Republican condemnation of Obamaâ€ ™ s perceived â€œweaknessâ€ � on North Korea was almost absolute , with the notable exception of billionaire frontrunner Donald Trump .
The real estate tycoon , whose foreign policy bona fides is largely limited to his ownership of a golf course in Scotland , declined to pin the thermonuclear test on Obama , instead putting the lionâ€ ™ s share of the blame on China .
â€œChina has total control , believe me ,
â€ �
Trump told Fox and Friends on Wednesday .
â€œThey have total control over North Korea .
Without China , they wouldnâ€ ™ t eat , â€ �

2016-01-06,"If youâ€ ™ re in a state with an early presidential primary , you wonâ€ ™ t be able to escape political advertising during the Super Bowl .
Republican candidates have spent more than $ 1 m on splashy ads during the game among just six tactically critical TV stations in advance of the early primaries .
At local stations in key primary states , the media war between Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio is already raging , thanks to the ad - friendly combination of a Super Bowl scheduled for 7 February and a New Hampshire primary slated for two days later .
In New Hampshire and South Carolina , where the following primary will take place on 20 February , contenders have dumped more than $ 1 m into the Sunday evening event , according to a Guardian review of FCC filings , possibly with more cash to come .
Local TV ads in those two states â€ “ which customarily range in the four and five figures â€ “ have stretched into the hundreds of thousands .
And if the overall political season seems too contentious and mean - spirited , at least itâ€ ™ s been good for someone : independently run TV stations are seeing a windfall not just during the football game but also throughout the usually leaner midwinter season .
Several campaigns are parting with tens of thousands of dollars a week per station â€ “ far more in larger markets like Boston .
Nick Hasenecz , of Vermont station WCAX , which serves New Hampshire , said he has been deluged with new orders and that , at any other time of year , he would have struggled to get .
â€œItâ€
™ s not an uncontrollable amount , but itâ€ ™ s more than weâ€ ™ ve ever seen in this timeframe , â€ � Hasenecz said .
â€œThankfully January is typically a softer time of year for TV advertising , so
itâ€ ™ s raising us in a time .
Weâ€
™ re very well sold out and January is usually not one of those months.â€ �
The reason , as he sees it , is simple : â€œThey need to win Iowa and they need to win New Hampshire or theyâ€ ™ re out of it.â€ �
Though traditional TV viewership , especially for broadcast , is on the skids , the Super Bowl reliably outdoes itself each year as the highest - rated TV program in history .
In 2015 the total viewership reached 114.4 million viewers .
And while politicians canâ€ ™ t be charged more than the standard rate , the skyâ€ ™ s the limit when it comes to their Super Pacs .
Rubio for President might be able to buy a Super Bowl ad from Charlestonâ€ ™ s WCSC for $ 7,500 , but the station â€ “ which serves an estimated 0.277 % of the US population â€ “
isnâ€ ™ t budging for Right to Rise without $ 20,000 .
WBZ - TV in Boston had the record among the filings reviewed â€ “ Jeb Bush - supporting political action committee ( Pac )
Right to Rise spent $ 600,000 on two 30-second ad buys from the station .
Those numbers are buoyed by stiff competition to see who can stand up to Donald Trump when the polls open .
Trump is currently leading by at least 10 points in both states , with Marco Rubio behind him in New Hampshire and Ted Cruz coming in second in South Carolina .
Rubio is well ahead of Bush , but heâ€ ™ s not taking any chances : while Bush is content to let
Right to Rise buy football ads for him , Rubio has doubled down with his own buys on top of the airtime purchased by his own Super Pac , Conservative Solutions .
Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign is the only other candidate to buy a Super Bowl ad so far , and just one , though he has spent heavily in Iowa .
Of course , the cash outlay pales in comparison to the price for a national spot â€ “ last year CBS chairman Les Moonves announced that the network had pulled down $ 5 m per spot for the coming contest .
But networks rarely offer them to politicians â€ “ theyâ€ ™ re not worth the trouble , and even at its current exorbitant rate , Super Bowl airtime tends to be a sellerâ€ ™ s market ."
2016-01-06,"Julian Borger , and Justin McCurry report increasing scepticism about North Koreaâ€ ™ s claims in the Guardianâ€ ™ s latest wrap up all the key developments .
With that weâ€ ™ re going to bring this blog to a close , but there will be more reports and all the latest on the UN security council meeting on the North Korea section of the Guardianâ€ ™ s site .
US Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio has used the test to criticise Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s â€œfailedâ€ � foreign policy , Reuters reports .
â€œIf this test is confirmed , it will be just the latest example of the failed Obama - Clinton foreign policy ,
â€ �
Rubio , said in a statement .
â€œI have been warning throughout this campaign that North Korea is run by a lunatic who has been expanding his nuclear arsenal while President Obama has stood idly by , â€ � Rubio said .
Rubio said Obama should â€œstand up to people like Kimâ€ � but did not elaborate .
Of all the international statements denouncing North Koreaâ€ ™ s move , Chinaâ€ ™ s is the most significant , writes Simon Tisdall .
Beijing formally protested , expressed concern over radioactive fallout in areas bordering North Korea , and indicated it would support new , punitive UN security council action as demanded by South Korea , among others .
Maybe Beijingâ€ ™ s undisguised wrath will give Kim Jong - un pause .
But maybe not .
In a deliberate poke in the eye for Chinaâ€ ™ s leaders , he failed to inform them of the test in advance .
Kim has refused to rejoin the Chinese - led six - party nuclear talks .
In September , he snubbed President Xi Jinpingâ€ ™ s invitation to attend celebrations marking the end of the second world war .
In fact , Kim has never visited his Chinese ally A visit to Pyongyang last October by Liu Yunshan , a senior Chinese party official , suggested relations were warming up .
Now Kim has slammed the door again .
In truth , China has less leverage over Pyongyang , both politically and in terms of trade and oil supplies , than is commonly believed .
So perhaps the boyish Kim , self - styled â€œSupreme Leaderâ€ � , does not really care what â€œBig Daddyâ€ �
Xi wants .
Or perhaps â€ “
a more alarming thought â€ “ Kim does not know what he is doing .
Conventional diplomatic wisdom suggests China will not break with North Koreaâ€ ™ s regime for fear of internal collapse , a refugee crisis , and a US - South Korean takeover .
But there is more than one way to skin a cat .
Tough bilateral Chinese sanctions in addition to UN measures are one option , plus a halt to Chinese aid , investment and joint projects .
If China does not act , it is unclear who will .
AP mops up more reaction : Melissa Hanham , senior researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute for International Studies in Monterrey , California , said : â€œIâ€ ™ m pretty skeptical . ...
The seismic data indicates it would be very small for a hydrogen test .
It would be very , very remarkable if they had achieved it already . ...
It seems just too soon to have this big technical achievement .
But North Korea has always defied expectations.â€ �
Song Chol , a resident of Pyongyang , said : â€œThe United States is the aggressor with all kinds of nuclear weapons , waiting to invade our country , so having a hydrogen bomb is the right thing , the legitimate right of a sovereign state , which nobody can complain about .
It would be stupid to put down your gun as you are faced by fierce wolves rushing at you.â€ � Hazel Smith , director of the International Institute of Korean Studies at Britainâ€ ™ s University of Central Lancashire , said : â€œThe North Koreans are not led by diplomatic strategy anymore .
They are led by a view that the military is what allows the regime to survive ...
You have a group of ( ruling ) families who donâ€ ™ t want to see their power go , who donâ€ ™ t want to end up in ( the International Criminal Court in )
The Hague .
â€œEvery nuclear test that theyâ€ ™ ve had has caused massive consternation in China .
But the North Koreans have never been susceptible to letting China tell them what to do.â€ �
_ Lassin Zerbo , executive secretary of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear - Test - Ban Treaty Organization , said : â€œI sincerely hope that this will serve as the final wake - up call to the international community to outlaw all nuclear testing.â€ �
John Delury , a professor at Seoulâ€ ™ s Yonsei University said North Koreaâ€ ™ s powerful military and nuclear weapons bureaucracies â€œare continuously looking for ways to improve their programs , â€ �
Delury said .
â€œI figure they are constantly asking to test.â€
�
He said that since â€œthereâ€ ™ s not much in playâ€ � with North Korea diplomatically with the US , South Korea or even China , leader Kim Jong Un â€œtakes a little bit of a blowâ€ � with the test while gaining international attention and placating powerful officials in his regime .
Chinaâ€ ™ s
Xinhua news agency has video footage of children and staff evacuating a school in an area close to North Koreaâ€ ™ s border after tremors from the test .
Trying to figure out North Korean motivations is difficult as the regime is so opaque , but the New York Times gives it a go in a comprehensive q&amp;a .
In the past , United States administrations and South Korean governments managed to tamp down periodic heightened tensions with North Korea by offering concessions , including much - needed aid , in return for the Northâ€ ™ s promising to end its nuclear weapons programs .
Many analysts believe that North Korea is again seeking aid and other concessions , while some suggest that it merely wants to be recognized as a nuclear state , like Pakistan .
Still others suggest that the North genuinely fears an attack by the United States or South Korea and views the warnings as deterrence .
Highlighting a perceived threat from abroad is also a favorite tool the North Korean government uses to ensure internal cohesion in an impoverished country that has experienced enormous privation , including devastating famine and continuing pervasive hunger .
North Koreaâ€ ™ s nuclear program and its repeated nuclear tests are serious threats to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula , according to Germanyâ€ ™ s foreign ministry Frank - Walter Steinmeier .
In his statement of condemnation he said : North Korea is against the principles of the international community and threatens the regional and international security .
We urge North Korea to refrain , to behave according to the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and return to the negotiating table .
Hilary Benn , the shadow foreign secretary , called for a resumption of the stop - start six - party talks aimed at terminating North Koreaâ€ ™ s nuclear programme .
Involving China , Japan , South Korea , Russia and the US , they began in 2003 , but have been moribund since 2009 .
Angela Stanzel , a policy fellow in the Asia programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations , summed up the state of the talks in this piece for Al Jazeera .
Time and again , the talks stopped and were relaunched , until eventually collapsing completely in 2009 , after a North Korean satellite launch prompted the UN security council to expand sanctions on North Korean firms .
Ever since , China has been attempting to reconvene the talks but has failed as the other parties ( mainly the US ) do not wish to resume negotiations without imposing preconditions on North Korea .
When Kim Jong - un succeeded his father Kim Jong - il in December 2011 , hopes rose again that the son would be more willing to re - engage in negotiations .
Those who had this hope were disappointed soon .
In December , 38 North , a US research institute that tracks North Korea , reported that a new tunnel was being excavated at the Punggye - ri nuclear test site .
38 North said - presciently as it turned out - that the new tunnel gave North Korea increased capability to conduct additional explosions .
Recent commercial satellite imagery indicates that North Korea is excavating a new tunnel for nuclear testing at the Punggye - ri nuclear test site .
This tunnel is in a new area of the site in addition to the three others where the North has either conducted nuclear tests or excavated tunnels in the past .
While there are no indications that a nuclear test is imminent , the new tunnel adds to North Koreaâ€ ™ s ability to conduct additional detonations at Punggye - ri over the coming years if it chooses to do so .
Nato says the test undermines regional and international security .
In a statement secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said : The nuclear weapons test announced by North Korea undermines regional and international security , and is in clear breach of UN Security Council resolutions .
I condemn the continued development by North Korea of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes and its inflammatory and threatening rhetoric .
I call on North Korea to fully respect its international obligations and commitments .
North Korea should abandon nuclear weapons and existing nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in a complete , verifiable and irreversible manner , and engage in credible and authentic talks on denuclearisation .
Hilary Benn , who survived Labourâ€ ™ s reshuffle as shadow foreign secretary , has added his voice to the stream of condemnation .
In a statement he said : â€œIf verified , the nuclear test carried out by North Korea represents a clear violation of numerous UN Security Council Resolutions and I condemn it in the strongest possible terms .
â€œThe countryâ€ ™ s nuclear programme poses a grave threat to international peace and security and does nothing to improve the prospects of the people of North Korea , who continue to pay the price for the countryâ€ ™ s misguided policies .
â€œI call on the North Korean government to recognise its commitments under international law , and urge it and the international community to reinvigorate efforts towards the goal of denuclearization of the Korean peninsula , ideally through the resumption of the Six Party Talks.â€

Hereâ€ ™ s a round up of where things currently stand
: North Korea claims it has successfully detonated a miniaturised hydrogen bomb .
The underground test took place on Wednesday at 10 am local time ( 1.30am GMT / Wednesday 12.30pm AEDT / Tuesday 6.30pm ET ) at a known nuclear test site at Punggye - ri , in the east of the country .
Pyongyang said the test and was â€œself - defence against the US having numerous and humongous nuclear weaponsâ€ � .
In a TV announcement it also said the test went â€œperfectlyâ€ � .
If true , this would be North Koreaâ€ ™ s fourth nuclear test , and its first using a hydrogen bomb , significantly more powerful than an atomic bomb .
There has been no independent verification of North Koreaâ€ ™ s claims .
An artificial earthquake of magnitude 5.1 was detected close to Punggye - ri .
The UN organisation monitoring the world for signs of nuclear testing confirmed it had detected â€œan unusual event in the Korean peninsulaâ€ � , but some experts have cautioned that claims of a hydrogen bomb could be exaggerated .
The UN security council is expected to meet in New York on Wednesday 11 am ET ( 4 pm GMT ) to discuss the North Korean claims .
Russia and China have joined the international chorus of countries condemning the test .
China , once seen as an ally of North Korea , said it â€œfirmlyâ€ � opposed the test .
It also said it was given no warning .
There has also been widespread scepticism of Pyongyangâ€ ™ s claims about the test .
The White House said it could not yet confirm the test , but reiterated that the US â€œwill not accept [ North Korea ] as a nuclear stateâ€ � .
South Korea and Japan have condemned news of the test , labelling it a threat to their security .
Statements of concern have also been issued by the European Union and the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Australiaâ€ ™ s foreign minister
Julie Bishop said her country â€œcondemns in the strongest possible terms the provocative and dangerous behaviour of the North Korean regimeâ€ � .
The UK foreign secretary , Philip Hammond , said any test would be a â€œgrave breachâ€ � of UN resolutions and â€œa provocation which I condemn without reservationâ€ � .
Swedenâ€ ™ s former prime minister , Carl Bildt , encapsulates the international response in single tweet by condemning North Koreaâ€ ™ s test while expressing doubts about its claims .
The test can be seen as snub to China and sign of Beijingâ€ ™ s waning influence over North Korea , analysts have told the Washington Post .
â€œIn a way , this is a protest against Beijing , â€ � said Bo Zhiyue , director of the New Zealand Contemporary China Research Centre at the Victoria University of Wellington .
â€œThey are saying : â€˜we can do whatever we want .
This shows our independence and we donâ€ ™ t need your approval.â€ ™ â€ � ...
No one is expecting a complete breakdown in Sino - North Korean ties , nor are they expecting Pyongyang to abandon a nuclear program that has become a key pillar of its regimeâ€ ™ s
declared legitimacy , at least not in the foreseeable future .
â€œBeijing will face increased pressure both domestically and internationally to punish and rein in Kim Jong Un and to ultimately force Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons , â€ � said Yanmei Xie , senior China analyst with the International Crisis Group in Beijing .
â€œBut there is likely to be a repeat of the worn playbook of denunciation , tightening of sanctions , and calling for resurrection of the six party talks.â€ �
Nuclear experts have questioned whether the size of the blast was large enough to have been from a hydrogen bomb test , the BBC reports .
Bruce Bennett , an analyst with the Rand Corporation , was among those casting doubts on Pyongyangâ€ ™ s test : â€œThe bang they should have gotten would have been ten times greater than what theyâ€ ™ re claiming .
â€œSo
Kim Jong - un is either lying , saying they did a hydrogen test when they didnâ€ ™ t , they just used a little bit more efficient fission weapon - or the hydrogen part of the test
really didnâ€ ™ t work very well or
the fission part didnâ€ ™ t work very well.â€ �
A South Korean politician , Lee Cheol - woo , said he was briefed by the countryâ€ ™ s intelligence agency that the blast â€œprobably falls shortâ€ � of a hydrogen detonation .
Sanctions and resolutions will not stop North Korean engineers from working hard to build bigger and better weapons , warns Andrei Lankov .
More likely , in the next few weeks we will see a repeat of the same cycle we have seen so many times over the last 10 years .
The UN security council will have an urgent meeting that will introduce sanctions targeting North Korea .
Such sanctions will allow politicians to explain to their voters that they are punishing a rogue regime in all ways imaginable â€ “ for instance , depriving the leadership of Hennessey cognac and Godiva chocolate .
Credulous voters will agree and feel placated , but in actuality , such measures will make little if any difference .
Even if sanctions were to inflict damage on the North Korean economy â€ “ which has exceptionally low dependence on foreign trade â€ “ the only victims will be common North Koreans , who will just suffer more .
Of course , the top leadership might lose access to champagne , but in their eyes , this is a small price to pay for escaping the fates of Muammar Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein .
We seem to be caught in a cul - de - sac ...
Nothing good about this situation is in sight , but seemingly thereâ€ ™ s nothing to be done .
Japanâ€ ™ s defence ministry has deployed three T4 training planes to collect possible radioactive material in the air following North Koreaâ€ ™
s claimed hydrogen bomb test , AFP reports citing officials â€œTo understand the impact of possible radioactive materials released by the test , Air Self - Defence Force planes have collected dust in the air , â€ �
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga , the governmentâ€ ™ s top spokesman , told a press conference .
â€œIt is currently being sent to the Japan Chemical Analysis Center , â€ �
he said .
Suga added that the planes flew in Japanese airspace , while the Sankei Shimbun daily reported that the aircrafts took off from three separate bases in different parts of the country .
The cabinet secretary also said no abnormal levels of radiation have so far been detected through monitoring posts installed across Japan as of 4:45 pm Wednesday ( 0745 GMT ) .
The results collected by the planes are expected to be released on Thursday , an official with Japanâ€ ™ s Nuclear Regulation Authority told reporters .
The FTâ€ ™ s Seoul correspondent , Simon Mundy , says North Koreaâ€ ™ s claimed status as a nuclear power â€œhas become a major domestic propaganda trope in recent years.â€ �
In a video primer on the test he suggests Pyongyang will see it as a â€œuseful asset for a regime that has precious few economic achievement to boast ofâ€ � .
Koryo Tours , who have been taking western tourists to North Korea since 1992 , said it does not epect the nuclear test to affect any of their upcoming tours , writes Maeve Shearlaw .
The companyâ€ ™ s general manager Simon Cockrell is due to travel to Pyongyang tomorrow and Vicky Mohieddeen , who got back from New Yearâ€ ™ s
Eve tour yesterday , described everything in the country as normal : â€œWe had 54 tourists from all over the world in Pyongyang seeing in 2016 on a boat on the Taedong Riverâ€
�
â€œThe only things that have caused tours to be cancelled in the last few years have been Sars in 2003 , and Ebola in 2014 - 2015 .
The nuclear tests previously havenâ€
™ t had any effect on tourismâ€ � says Cockrell .
He described the people who sign up to their tours as â€œsafety - awareâ€ � and said this â€œextends to knowing the difference between an underground nuclear test in a remote area , and being in normal tourist areas above ground â€ “ a test is not the same as the actual danger from nuclear weapons.â€ � Koryoâ€ ™ s next tour is scheduled for 11 January .
Russia has joined the international chorus of condemnation of North Koreaâ€ ™ s test .
â€œSuch actions are fraught with further aggravation of the situation on the Korean peninsula , which is anyway marked by very high potential of military and political confrontation , â€ � said Russia foreign ministryâ€ ™ s spokeswoman , Maria Zakharova .
Japanâ€ ™ s government said the test was a â€œgrave threat to Japanâ€ � but appealed to the Japanese public to remain calm .
Hereâ€ ™ s video of Foreign Secretary Philip Hammondâ€ ™ s statement on the test .
The International Atomic Energy Agency said if confirmed the test is clear violation of UN resolutions .
In a statement its director general , Yukiya Amano , said the agency remains ready to resume nuclear verification in North Korea .
He said : The DPRKâ€ ™ s nuclear test , if confirmed , is in clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions and is deeply regrettable .
I strongly urge the DPRK to implement fully all relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council and the IAEA .
The IAEA remains ready to contribute to the peaceful resolution of the DPRK nuclear issue by resuming its nuclear verification activities in the DPRK once a political agreement is reached among countries concerned .
Justin McCurry in Tokyo and Michael Safi in Sydney wrap up the key developments and reaction to the test .
The European Unionâ€ ™ s
high representative on foreign affairs has added her voice to those condemning the test .
In a statement , Federica Mogherini said : If confirmed , this action would represent a grave violation of the DPRKâ€ ™ s international obligations not to produce or test nuclear weapons , as determined by several United Nations Security Council Resolutions , and a threat to the peace and security of the entire North East Asia region .
I call on the DPRK to re - engage in a credible and meaningful dialogue with the international community , in particular in the framework of the Six - Party Talks , and to cease this illegal and dangerous behaviour .
I will speak this morning with the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Korea Yun Byung - se and the Foreign Minister of Japan Fumio Kishida to discuss the way forward .
We will work with the UN Security Council , which will meet later today in urgent session to address this issue .
Chinaâ€ ™ s news agency
Xinhua has more on Beijingâ€ ™ s opposition to the test .
China â€œfirmlyâ€ � opposes the latest nuclear test conducted by the Democratic Peopleâ€ ™ s Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) , according to a statement on Wednesday from the Chinese Foreign Ministry .
The ministry made the statement after the DPRK announced Wednesday that it has successfully carried out its first hydrogen bomb test .
â€œChina is steadfast in its position that the Korean Peninsula should be denuclearized and nuclear proliferation be prevented to maintain peace and stability in Northeast Asia , â€ �
foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced at a press briefing .
â€œWe strongly urge the DPRK to honor its commitment to denuclearization , and to cease any action that may deteriorate the situation ,
â€ �
Hua said .
This timeline shows the key developments in North Koreaâ€ ™ s nuclear programme since it started operations on a nuclear reactor in 1986 .
North Koreans gathered in a square in Pyongyang to watch state television announcements of the successful miniaturised hydrogen bomb detonation .
Reuters video shows many reacting to the news with smiles and applause .
Maeve Shearlaw rounds up reaction from some of the most clued - up North Korea watchers .
Although North Koreaâ€ ™ s state media website KCNA appeared to creaking under the pressure : As for the timing , perhaps Kim was treating himself to an early gift ?
Human Rights Watch has put out a strongly worded statement condemning the test and picking out that it comes on the eve of Kim Jong - unâ€ ™ s birthday .
Deputy Asia Director Phil Robertson said : â€œKim Jong - un may think it appropriate to celebrate his birthday early with a nuclear test , but even a hydrogen bomb should not cause the world to forget that the Kim familyâ€ ™
s
hereditary dictatorship is built on the systematic brutalization and abuse of the North Korean people .
The only birthday present that Kim Jong - Un should get from the international community is a one way trip to the International Criminal Court in The Hague , where he should be put on trial for crimes against humanity.â€ � Chosen Exchange , which runs regular business workshops in North Korea , said the test and the likely sanctions to follow , will disrupt trilateral corporation between South Korea , Russia and China .
It will probably mean business as usual , with new sanctions creating a slightly more inconvenient environment , but with Koreans and their Chinese ( and other ) partners finding ways to evade enforcement .
The most significant effect may well be the death of potential North Korea - Russia - South Korea cooperation on major economic development projects .
Certainly , new UN sanctions seem inevitable , designating more companies , individuals and industries as out of bounds , while also reaffirming everybodyâ€ ™ s frustrations .
As usual , China will be the pivot .
Beijing has shown a willingness to pass resolutions after each nuclear test , but has been less interested in enforcement than Washington would like it to be .
How much pressure can the US apply to have China tighten up on transactions and trade of sensitive or luxury goods ?
China is frustrated with the DPRKâ€ ™ s nuclear program , for sure , but they still want to see Pyongyang experiment with economic policy and integrate its economy with the Chinese northeast .
Residents on Chinaâ€ ™ s border with North Korea have been evacuated from buildings after feeling tremors from the nuclear test , AFP reports citing state media .
People near the frontier with North Korea â€œclearly felt tremorsâ€ � on Wednesday morning when Pyongyang said it detonated a hydrogen bomb , state broadcaster China Central Television ( CCTV ) said on a verified social media account .
The areas on the border included Yanji , Hunchun and Changbai in Jilin province , it added - some of the counties closest to the Northâ€ ™ s nuclear test site .
Residents in Yanji saw desks and chairs shake for several seconds and some companies evacuated employees from their offices , CCTV said .
Students at a senior high school were dismissed during an examination after its recreation grounds cracked , it added .
Chinaâ€ ™ s foreign ministry on Wednesday said authorities were evaluating the environmental impact of the nuclear test , adding currently the radiation level in the area was â€œnormalâ€ � .
Environmental officialsâ€ ™ monitoring showed indicators within normal ranges , foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular briefing , so that â€œso far the nuclear tests have had no impact on the public and healthâ€ � .
Hereâ€ ™ s video of Chinaâ€ ™ s foreign ministry spokeswoman denouncing North Koreaâ€ ™ s test .
She also urged Japan to â€œstop deteriorating the situationâ€ � , according to a translator on CCTV .
China knew nothing about the North Koreaâ€ ™ s nuclear test before it was announced , according to foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying .
In comments on the foreign ministry website , China also urged North Korea to honour its commitment to denuclearisation and called on Pyongyang to stop taking any action that could cause a deterioration of the situation on the Korean peninsula .
An image purporting to show Kim Jong - unâ€ ™ s hand - written text ordering the nuclear test has been published by South Koreaâ€ ™ s Yonhap news agency and republished by the Chinaâ€ ™ s Peopleâ€ ™ s Daily .
Hereâ€ ™ s a clip of North Koreaâ€ ™ s state - owned broadcaster announcing the test .
The broadcast from Pyongyang includes images of former North Korean leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il , as well as newsreel footage of scientists working at a nuclear facility .
Britainâ€ ™ s foreign office has issued a statement from Philip Hammond accusing North Korea of a â€œgrave breachâ€ � of UN resolution .
In a addition to his remarks to journalists ( see earlier ) the foreign secretary said : â€œIf a nuclear device has been detonated by North Korea , this is a grave breach of UN security council resolutions and a provocation which I condemn without reservation .
â€œIt underlines the very real threat that North Korea represents to regional and international security .
â€œWe will be working with other UN Security Council members to ensure the international community responds urgently and decisively to this latest activity.â€ � â€œI have discussed this matter today in Beijing with my Chinese counterpart , State Councillor Yang Jiechi , and we have agreed to work with other members of the UN Security Council towards a robust international response.â€

The UKâ€ ™ s former ambassador to North Korea has described the nuclear test as â€œdeeply worryingâ€ � and warned that Pyongyang could launch a nuclear strike .
Speaking on BBC Radio 4â€ ™ s Today programme John Everard , said : â€œAnything that produces a seismic shock of 5.1 is dangerous ... an explosion of that size is quite enough to wipe out a city , and that of course is deeply worrying.â€ �
Everard warned that Pyongyangâ€ ™ s leaders believed they could survive a nuclear counterstrike by sheltering in tunnels .
He said : â€œNorth Korea has a defensive tunnel system that makes the Tora Bora look like a childâ€ ™ s play pen in comparison .
If they believe they can hide away in their tunnels and survive a nuclear counterstrike , the possibility that they could launch a nuclear first strike remains.â€ �
Asked whether he believed that North Korea would seriously considered a nuclear strike , Everard said : â€œYes , because the North Koreans have a deep sense of victimhood â€ “ that they are aggrieved by the international community .
They also have a warrior tradition which would mean that they would probably prefer to go down fighting rather than be absorbed by South Korea.â€ � Everard also claimed that relations between China and North Korea have become so strained over nuclear weapons that Beijing could side with the international community in condemning the test .
â€œIt looks like the China / North Korea love in has soured very quickly .
The Chinese have said they will cooperate with the international community in the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and I have a hunch , that when the UN security council meets later today that , we will see a rather different Chinese attitude from the one that we seen in the past.â€ �

The UK foreign secretary , Philip Hammond , said any test would be a â€œgrave breachâ€ � of UN resolutions and â€œa provocation which I condemn without reservationâ€ � .

This isnâ€ ™ t particularly easy to read , and weâ€ ™ re working on a more legible transcript , but here is the full version of the North Korean state TV broadcast announcing the test : Weâ€ ™ re expecting official reaction from Beijing soon .
Meanwhile , Xinhua , the official news agency , has published a Chinese - language editorial on the test .
Christy Yao in our Beijing bureau has translated some of the key lines : The test of a nuclear bomb by North Korea runs counter to the relevant UN resolutions and the internationally - backed Korean peninsula denuclearisation efforts .
It is not good for anyone for there not to be peace on the Korean peninsula .
Any act that disrupts stability in north - eastern Asia is undesirable and unwise .
All relevant parties should refrain from unilateral steps that are detrimental to regional peace and stability .
Philip Hammond , the British foreign secretary , has just sat down with a small group of foreign correspondents in Beijing , where he is on an official visit .
Hereâ€ ™ s what he had to say on North Korea
: We are anticipating that there will be an emergency session of the UN security council in New York later today , when both countries [ UK and China ] will condemn â€ “ along with , I expect ,
everybody else in the world except perhaps for one or two mavericks â€ “ any nuclear test carried out by the DPRK .
I think I can say that Britain and China are pretty much completely aligned on North Korean nuclear .
We both strongly oppose the acquisition or testing of nuclear weapons by North Korea and we both want to see a resumption of the six - party talks .
So far as I think any of us can tell , there is no reason to doubt what the North Koreans are claiming : that they have carried out a test detonation of an H - bomb .
It is clearly very bad news for the non - proliferation agenda generally and for security in the East China Sea region specifically .
France has now condemned the nuclear test and has called for a â€œstrong reaction from the international communityâ€ � , president FranÃ§ois
Hollandeâ€ ™ s office said in a statement .
The statement said the claims of a hydrogen bomb detonation were â€œan unacceptable violation of [ UN ] security council resolutionsâ€ � .
South Korea President Park Geun - Hye called the test a â€œgrave provocationâ€ � at an emergency meeting of the countryâ€ ™ s national security council .
â€œThe test is not only a grave provocation to our national security but also a threat to our future â€ ¦ and a strong challenge to international peace and stability , â€ �
she said , calling for strong sanctions on Pyongyang .
In an earlier statement , Seoul said it would â€œtake all necessary measures including additional sanctions by the UN security council â€ ¦ so that the North will pay the price for the nuclear testâ€ � .
Japan â€œThe nuclear test that was carried out by North Korea is a serious threat to the safety of our nation and we absolutely can not tolerate this , â€ �
prime minister Shinzo Abe said in Tokyo .
â€œThis clearly violates UN security council resolutions and is a grave challenge against international efforts for non - proliferation , â€ �
he said , adding his country would seek to coordinate efforts among UN members to tackle North Koreaâ€ ™ s actions .
United States
In Washington , the White House said it could not yet confirm the test , but vowed to â€œrespond appropriately to any and all North Korean provocationsâ€ � .
It said the US â€œwill not accept [ North Korea ] as a nuclear stateâ€ � .
China
There was no immediate response from China , but in a report from Pyongyang , the official Xinhua news service said that the â€œtest apparently runs counter to relevant UN resolutionsâ€ � and â€œis set to cause repercussionsâ€ � .
Australia Foreign minister Julie Bishop said her country â€œcondemns in the strongest possible termsâ€
� the test , which â€œconfirms North Koreaâ€ ™ s status as a rogue state and a continuing threat to international peace and securityâ€ � , adding that Canberra would express its concerns to Pyongyang directly and call for stronger UN sanctions .
United Kingdom Foreign secretary Philip Hammond said : â€œIf North Korean H - bomb test reports are true , it is a grave breach of UN [ security council ] resolutions and a provocation which I condemn without reservation.â€ � Verifying â€ “ or disproving â€ “ North Koreaâ€ ™ s claim that it has tested a miniaturised hydrogen bomb could take days or weeks , experts say .
For now , other nations and expert bodies are treating the claim with caution .
However , according to South Korean media , the defence ministry in Seoul has said a small amount of hydrogen may have been added to the device North Korea tested on Wednesday .
The MoneyToday online news service quoted ministry spokesman Kim Min - seok as saying : We will find out after closely analysing it
but we understand a small amount of hydrogen may have been added to the fourth nuclear test .
Should we believe North Koreaâ€ ™ s claims to have tested a hydrogen bomb ?
John Carlson , the former head of Australiaâ€ ™ s nuclear safeguards and non - proliferation Office , said the veracity of the claim would be difficult to determine â€œuntil we can analyse any gases emitted , and it could take several days for those to show up , if it allâ€ � .
He said it would be a â€œmajor
challengeâ€ � for the North Korean regime to develop a thermonuclear weapon , particularly a miniaturised version , which required even greater expertise .
â€œTheir claim would be far more convincing if it was a larger size , â€ � he said .
Carlson , who headed Australiaâ€ ™ s safeguards office for more than two decades , said it was possible
Pyongyang had actually produced a lower - yield â€œboosted explosionâ€ � , in which the hydrogen isotope tritium undergoes partial fusion , allowing them to describe the device as a hydrogen bomb .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s feasible that theyâ€ ™ ve done that and theyâ€ ™ re claiming that theyâ€ ™ ve done more , â€ � he said .
North Korea claims it has successfully detonated a miniaturised hydrogen bomb .
The underground test took place on Wednesday at 10 am local time ( 1.30am GMT / Wednesday 12.30pm AEDT / Tuesday 6.30pm ET ) at a known nuclear test site at Punggye - ri , in the east of the country .
An announcement on state television claimed the test â€œworked perfectlyâ€ � and was â€œself - defence against the US having numerous and humongous nuclear weaponsâ€
� .
If true , this would be North Koreaâ€ ™ s fourth nuclear test , and its first using a hydrogen bomb , significantly more powerful than an atomic bomb .
There has been no independent verification of North Koreaâ€ ™ s claims .
An artificial earthquake of magnitude 5.1 was detected close to Punggye - ri .
The UN organisation monitoring the world for signs of nuclear testing confirmed it had detected â€œan unusual event in the Korean peninsulaâ€ � .
The UN security council is expected to meet in New York on Wednesday 11 am ET ( 4 pm GMT ) to discuss the North Korean claims .
The White House said it could not yet confirm the test , but reiterated that the US â€œwill not accept [ North Korea ] as a nuclear stateâ€ � .
South Korea and Japan have condemned news of the test , labelling it a threat to their security .
Australiaâ€ ™ s foreign minister
Julie Bishop said her country â€œcondemns in the strongest possible terms the provocative and dangerous behaviour of the North Korean regimeâ€ � .
The UK foreign secretary , Philip Hammond , said any test would be a â€œgrave breachâ€ � of UN resolutions and â€œa provocation which I condemn without reservationâ€ � .
Chinese border residents were evacuated from buildings after feeling tremors from North Koreaâ€ ™ s nuclear test on Wednesday , state media has reported .
People near the frontier with North Korea â€œclearly felt tremorsâ€ � on Wednesday morning after Pyongyang said it detonated a hydrogen bomb , state broadcaster China Central Television ( CCTV ) said .
The areas included Yanji , Hunchun and Changbai in Jilin province , some of the counties closest to the nuclear test site .
Residents in Yanji saw desks and chairs shake for several seconds and some companies evacuated employees from their offices , CCTV said .
Students at a senior high school were dismissed during an examination after its recreation ground cracked , it added .
Pyongyang said the North Korean leader , Kim Jong - un , had signed the order for the test on 3 January and has released this picture of him apparently doing so :
Casting further doubt on North Koreaâ€ ™ s claims , South Koreaâ€ ™ s intelligence agency says the device tested on Wednesday may not have been a hydrogen nuclear bomb , Yonhap news agency reports .
South Koreaâ€ ™ s meteorological agency said separately that it has not detected any radiation after North Korea said it successfully conducted a hydrogen nuclear test .
The UK foreign secretary , Philip Hammond , has responded to the North Korean claims :
He â€ “ like the White House
â€ “ adds the caveat that we do not yet know if the North Korean claims are true or an aggrandisement .
US experts have said it will take at least a number of days , and possibly weeks , to investigate and confirm ( or otherwise ) the claim that a miniaturised hydrogen bomb was detonated .
According to John Carlson , the former head of the Australian safeguards and non - proliferation office , , a thermonuclear bomb , colloquially known as a hydrogen bomb , is essentially a two - stage explosion : one a nuclear fission reaction , the a other nuclear fusion reaction .
The â€œprimaryâ€ � explosion is the fission reaction â€ “ as for a conventional nuclear bomb â€ “ that emits
x - rays which cause the â€œsecondaryâ€ � explosion , triggered by the fusion of tritium and deuterium , two hydrogen isotopes .
These two isotopes naturally repel each other , but the x - rays weaken this repellent force , causing the pair to fuse together .
It is the fusion of these two isotopes that triggers the enormous energy release that make thermonuclear explosions so destructive .
How does this differ to past North Korean nuclear tests ?
Past nuclear tests in 2006 , 2009 and 2013 were purely the primary stage , a nuclear explosion , â€œand
fairly low yield at thatâ€ � , Carlson says .
South Korea says it will consult with allies and regional powers to get North Korea to face the consequences of the nuclear test it says it has carried out , including possible additional UN sanctions .
Presidential security official Cho Tae - yong said â€œwe strongly condemnâ€ � the Northâ€ ™ s fourth bomb test .
He said North Korea must abide by UN resolutions that require the country to scrap its nuclear and ballistic missile programs completely and irreversibly .
South Koreaâ€ ™ s defence ministry also says it is bolstering security and monitoring on North Korea .
Public reaction inside North Korea â€ “ as far as it is possible to report â€ “ has been enthusiastic , Associated Press says : Crowds dressed in thick winter coats have gathered outside a large video screen near a Pyongyang train station to cheer and take video and photos on their mobile phones of the state TV anchor announcing the country had carried out a nuclear test .
Some people raised their hands and applauded .
Many smiled and cheered .
Australiaâ€ ™ s foreign minister Julie Bishop has issued a statement on the nuclear test claims : Australia condemns in the strongest possible terms the provocative and dangerous behaviour of the North Korean regime .
Todayâ€ ™ s nuclear test confirms North Koreaâ€ ™ s status as a rogue state and a continuing threat to international peace and security .
Bishop added that Australia would make its concerns known directly to the North Korean government and would work to strengthen sanctions aimed at reducing funding to North Koreaâ€ ™ s weapons of mass destruction programs .
A successful fourth test could deepen North Koreaâ€ ™ s international isolation if the UN security council decided to respond with more sanctions ,
the Guardianâ€ ™ s
Japan and Korea correspondent , Justin McCurry , reports .
Pyongyang is thought to have developed several crude nuclear weapons .
Since becoming North Korean leader in late 2011 , Kim Jong - un has stepped up condemnation of joint US - South Korean military drills he believes are preparation for an invasion .
In early 2013 , Kim responded to UN sanctions imposed after North Koreaâ€ ™ s third nuclear test by unleashing a barrage of threats aimed at South Korea , the US and Japan .
Kim appears to have caught the world off - guard yet again .
He did not mention his countryâ€ ™
s
pursuit of a nuclear deterrent in his New Yearâ€ ™ s address
â€ “ an omission some analysts was designed to improve the prospects of a summit with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping .
China joined other countries in condemning North Koreaâ€ ™ s 2013 test â€ “ conducted in defiance of international sanctions
â€ “ leading to a deterioration in traditionally warm ties between Pyongyang and Beijing .
Last month , Washington dismissed Kimâ€ ™ s claims that his country had developed a hydrogen bomb â€ “ a development that , if true , would mark significant progress in North Koreaâ€ ™ s nuclear capability .
Hydrogen bombs are capable of producing a far more powerful blast than basic atom bombs .
KCNA quoted Kim as saying at the time that he was continuing the work of his grandfather â€ “ and North Koreaâ€ ™ s founder â€ “ Kim Il - sung , to turn North Korea into a â€œpowerful nuclear weapons state ready to detonate a self - reliant A - bomb and H - bomb to reliably defend its sovereignty and the dignity of the nationâ€ � .
The claim was greeted with scepticism in Washington , however , with White House spokesman Josh Earnest saying Washington had evidence that â€œcalls into serious questionâ€ � Pyongyangâ€ ™ s claim .
Here is the full statement from the White House , which is cautious ahead of confirmation of the claimed hydrogen bomb test , but reiterates that the US â€œwill not accept [ North Korea ] as a nuclear stateâ€ � .
Markets in Asia have reacted to the news , with Japanâ€ ™ s Nikkei share average falling as much as 1.7 % on Wednesday afternoon .
â€œNorth Korea woes added to investor fears and hit further the Japanese market , which was already battered by geopolitical worries about the Middle East and volatility in Chinese shares , â€ �
Norihiro Fujito , senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities , told Reuters .
The Nikkei share average recovered but was down 1.4 % at 18,123.30 points by mid - afternoon .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s
Beijing correspondent , Tom Phillips , says China has yet to comment officially on news of the test :
But Shi Yinhong , a government foreign policy adviser , says he believes Chinese president Xi Jinping will have been infuriated by the test .
â€œOf course he will be very angry and Xi Jinping will further delay his intention in the process [ towards ] improved relations with North Korea .
With this kind of action you have no choice , â€ � Shi said .
Shi , who is a professor of international relations at Beijingâ€ ™ s Renmin University , said China had been attempting to improve ties with North Korea , sending Liu Yunshan , one of the Communist partyâ€ ™ s most powerful leaders , to visit last October .
â€œOnly a few months ago China tried to improve relations with North Korea by sending Liu Yunshan to Pyongyang .
But of course this process â€ ¦ will be very much more difficult now ,
â€ � he said .
The test showed those attempts had failed â€œin some ways [ because of ] Kim Jong - unâ€ ™ s own actionsâ€ � .
With Wednesday morningâ€ ™ s test
Kim was sending a signal that he was prepared to defy anyone ,
â€œincluding Xi Jinping himselfâ€
� .
â€œBeijing - Pyongyang relations already for years are quite bad so of course it further damages them , â€ � Shi added .
First report of a response from the White House , which says it can not confirm North Koreaâ€ ™ s claims to have detonated a miniaturised hydrogen bomb .
Nonetheless , it says , it condemns any violation of UN security council resolutions , which ban North Korea from testing nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology .
The UN security council will meet in New York on Wednesday 11 am ET ( 4 pm GMT ) to discuss the North Korean claims .
The UN organisation monitoring the world for signs of nuclear testing confirms it has detected â€œan unusual event in the Korean peninsulaâ€ � .
The head of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation , Lassina Zerbo , said : Our international monitoring system detected an unusual seismic event in the Korean peninsula at latitude 41.27 longitude 129.10 .
The location on the map places the epicenter at North Koreaâ€ ™ s Pyunggye - ri testing site in its north - eastern mountains , where all of its nuclear tests have been conducted .
North Korea claims it has successfully detonated a miniaturised hydrogen bomb .
The test took place on Wednesday at 10 am local time ( 1.30am GMT / Wednesday 12.30pm AEDT / Tuesday 6.30pm ET ) at a known nuclear test site at Punggye - ri .
An announcement on state television claimed the test â€œworked perfectlyâ€ � and was â€œself - defence against the US having numerous and humongous nuclear weaponsâ€
� .
If true , this would be North Koreaâ€ ™ s fourth nuclear test , and its first using a hydrogen bomb , significantly more powerful than an atomic bomb .
There has been no independent verification of North Koreaâ€ ™ s claims .
An artificial earthquake of magnitude 5.1 was detected close to Punggye - ri .
Japan has condemned news of the test , labelling it a threat to Japanâ€ ™ s security .
Yonhap reports that South Korean president Park Geun - hye will chair a national security council meeting to discuss reaction to the hydrogen bomb test .
A standoff between North and South was â€ “ temporarily â€ “ resolved last August , following talks between the two nations after tensions soared on the peninsula .
North Korea had declared a semi - state of war and an exchange of artillery fire heightened fears that the situation could escalate .
Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe said the nation would make a firm response to North Koreaâ€ ™ s challenge against nuclear non - proliferation , calling its latest nuclear test a threat to Japanâ€ ™ s security .
Abe , speaking to reporters , said Japan absolutely could not tolerate North Koreaâ€ ™ s nuclear testing .
Reaction from China , North Koreaâ€ ™ s most important supporter , will be key .
After the 2013 nuclear test , China expressed â€œits firm oppositionâ€ � and warned North Korea to avoid any actions that could worsen the situation on the Korean peninsula .
South Koreaâ€ ™ s Yonhap news agency said North Korea had not informed China that it was about to conduct the test .
The Pyongyang bureau of Xinhua , Chinaâ€ ™ s official news agency , is reporting the claims of the â€œsuccessfulâ€ � hydrogen bomb test .
We are , bit by bit , getting translated quotes from the North Korean TV broadcast :
The republicâ€ ™ s first hydrogen bomb test has been successfully performed at 10 am on January 6 , 2016 , based on the strategic determination of the Workersâ€ ™ party .
With the perfect success of our historic H - bomb , we have joined the rank of advanced nuclear states .
NK News reports the KCTV news announcer as saying : The US has gathered forces hostile to DPRK and raised a slanderous human rights issue to hinder DPRKâ€ ™ s improvement â€ ¦
It is just to have H - bomb as self - defence against the US having numerous and humongous nuclear weapons .
The DPRKâ€ ™ s fate must not be protected by any forces but DPRK itself .
North Korea says leader Kim Jong - un signed the order for the hydrogen bomb test on 3 January .
The test â€œworked perfectlyâ€ � , according to the official announcement .
This map shows Punggye - ri , site of the artificial earthquake set off by North Koreaâ€ ™ s nuclear detonation .
It is difficult to verify North Koreaâ€ ™ s claims and other nations will be rushing to investigate its announcement that it has successfully conducted a test of a miniaturised hydrogen nuclear device .
A hydrogen bomb , also known as a thermonuclear bomb , uses more advanced technology to produce a significantly more powerful blast than an atomic bomb .
If the hydrogen bomb claim is true , it would indicate significant advances in the Northâ€ ™ s pursuit of nuclear weapons .
In December , Kim Jong - un announced that North Korea had a hydrogen bomb â€ “ although others , including South Korea , expressed scepticism .
Kim suggested that North Korea had the capacity to launch a hydrogen bomb , a step up from the less powerful atomic bomb , citing the achievements of his father Kim Jong - il and his grandfather , Kim Il - sung .
The work of Kim Il - sung â€œturned the DPRK into a powerful nuclear weapons state ready to detonate a self - reliant A - bomb and H - bomb to reliably defend its sovereignty and the dignity of the nationâ€ � , Kim Jong - un was quoted as saying .
North Korea claims the reason for the test is its â€œlegal rightâ€ � to defend the country against the United States .
The broadcast claimed that if the US does not threaten North Korean sovereignty , it will not need to use nuclear weapons .
The
â€œself - defenceâ€ � claim is one that Pyongyang has attempted to use before .
North Korea says the test was of a hydrogen bomb and it was successful .
Yonhap says North Korea announces that it has conducted a hydrogen bomb test .
Korean Central Television , which is of course state - run , has begun broadcasting its official statement .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s
Japan and Korea correspondent , Justin McCurry , sends this dispatch : North Korea is thought to have conducted its fourth nuclear test , after a â€œman - madeâ€ � earthquake was detected near the countryâ€ ™ s main nuclear testing site on Wednesday morning .
Speculation that the regime in Pyongyang had conducted a surprise nuclear test rose after seismologists from South Korea , China and other countries said they were confident the earthquake , which struck at around 10 am local time , had been caused by an explosion .
A fourth nuclear test could bring North Korea a step closer to developing a nuclear warhead small enough to be mounted on a long - range missile , and possibly bringing the US mainland within striking distance .
South Koreaâ€ ™ s Yonhap news agency said North Korea had not informed the US or China â€ “ its traditional ally â€ “ that it was about to conduct a test .
Yonhap added that North Korea was due to make a â€œmajor
announcementâ€
� around midday local time on Wednesday .
The tremor was a â€œsuspected explosionâ€ � , the China Earthquake Network Centre said on its website .
It gave the magnitude as 4.9 .
The US defense department said it was â€œlooking into reports of a possible seismic event near North Koreaâ€ ™ s nuclear facilitiesâ€ � , according to a US official .
â€œWe are looking into the reports of a possible seismic event near North Korean nuclear facilities , â€ � the official said on condition of anonymity .
The United States Geological Service , meanwhile , said it had detected a 5.1 magnitude quake .
South Korean meteorological officials said the epicentre of the quake was 49 kms ( 30 miles ) from the Punggye - ri site in North Hamgyong province , where North Korea has conducted nuclear tests in the past .
The European Mediterranean Seismological Center said it had also detected unusual seismic activity in North Korea .
South Korean news agency Yonhap reports that the foreign minister Yun Byung - se has convened an emergency meeting in response to the possible nuclear test .
A ministry official said : The foreign ministry is currently holding a meeting presided over by the minister to immediately determine the situation following the reports .
Cheong Wa Dae , South Koreaâ€ ™ s presidential office , plans to hold a session of the national security council over the issue , Yonhap says .
Tremors detected on Wednesday by South Korean officials are a strong indication that Pyongyang has conducted its fourth atomic test .
North Korea drew widespread condemnation in 2013 conducting a nuclear test in defiance of international bans .
Two previous â€ “ and smaller â€ “ nuclear tests were carried out in 2006 and 2009 .
In 2013 , experts put the earthquake prompted by the test at between magnitude 4.7 and 5.2 .
Those in 2006 and 2009 were 3.9 and 4.5 respectively .
Wednesdayâ€ ™
s quake has been preliminarily recorded at magnitude 5.1 .
North Korea will make what it calls a â€œmajor
announcementâ€
� at 3.30am GMT ( 2.30pm AEDT/10.30pm ET )
following reports of an earthquake â€ “ believed to be artificial â€ “ close to what is known to be a nuclear testing site .
The United States Geological Service reported a 5.1 magnitude quake that South Korea said was 49 km ( 30 miles ) from the Punggye - ri site where the North has conducted nuclear tests in the past .
An official from the South Korean meteorological administration said : â€œWe suspect a man - made earthquake and are analysing the scale and epicentre of the quake with the geoscience and mineral resource institute of South Korea.â€

This live blog will have news of the announcement as it comes , along with reaction from North Koreaâ€ ™ s neighbours .
Iâ€ ™ ll also be tweeting key developments @Claire_Phipps .
You can read our early news on this developing story here :"
2016-01-10,"Marco Rubio tore into his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination on Sunday , suggesting that Ted Cruz helped Isis by limiting US surveillance powers and that an elected Chris Christie would amount to a third term for Barack Obama .
Rubio and Cruz have increasingly traded barbs as they have steadily risen in the polls behind the Republican frontrunner , Donald Trump .
And as the early state contests draw closer , the two first - term senators , from Florida and Texas respectively , have sharpened their attacks .
On Sunday Rubio emphasized a sharp disagreement with Cruz on the National Security Agencyâ€ ™ s power to sweep up phone records and metadata .
â€œThere is no doubt that groups like Isis will benefit from us having a diminished intelligence capacity , â€ �
Rubio said in an interview with ABCâ€ ™ s This Week .
He added that he stood by an earlier claim that the terrorist group would have supported the surveillance bill if it had lobbyists in Washington .
Rubio then noted that Cruz had praised Edward Snowden , the former NSA contractor who leaked surveillance documents to the Guardian in 2013 .
â€œI never believed Edward Snowden was a good public servant the way that Ted Cruz once said , that he had done a public service for America , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œHe took our intelligence information and gave it to the Chinese and gave it to the Russians .
We can not afford to have a commander - in - chief who thinks people like Edward Snowden are doing a good public service.â€ �
Snowden has said that he lost possession of the tens of thousands of documents when he gave them to journalists , before he sought asylum in Russia .
Neither the US nor UK have ever publicly claimed that Russia or China gained access to Snowdenâ€ ™ s cache before he handed it over to journalists , though disputed reports have alleged as much .
The debate over security versus privacy in the US has calmed since 2013 , with fewer outcries of betrayal and more interest in reforms .
But many in Congress and the intelligence agencies are still seeking vengeance .
And while Cruz has criticized Rubio for his role in an immigration reform bill in 2013 that included a pathway to citizenship , the Florida senator fired back on Sunday that Cruz had â€œchanged his position on immigration all over the placeâ€ � .
â€œHe used to be for birthright citizenship , now he says heâ€ ™ s against it .
He used to be for legalizing people that were here illegally .
Now he says heâ€ ™ s against it , â€ � Rubio said , adding that Cruz had also backed away from his support for doubling green cards and expanding the H1-B visa program for high - skilled workers .
â€œThis is not consistency
â€ “
this is calculation , as heâ€ ™
s changed this position on these issues as we get closer to election day , â€ � Rubio said .
Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign said Rubio was simply trying to distract from his role as the co - author of immigration reform .
Rubio helped shepherd the legislation through the Senate , but has since disavowed the approach in favor of a piecemeal plan that prioritizes border security .
â€œItâ€ ™ s understandable why Senator Rubio would launch these false attacks , â€ �
Cruzâ€ ™ s spokesman , Rick Tyler , told the Guardian .
â€œBut as much as he now regrets joining upâ€ � with Democrats , he continued , â€œthe record is exceptionally clear.â€
� â€œHe supported dangerous policies that would have encouraged more illegal immigration , left our border wide open , and allowed Syrian terrorists acting as refugees into the country , â€ � Tyler said , adding that Cruz â€œled the fightâ€ � against the bill .
â€œThe American people are not confused on these points no matter how many times Senator Rubio says otherwise.â€ �
In Iowa , which will hold its caucus on 1 February , Cruz has overtaken Trump in some recent polls .
In New Hampshire , the state to hold the first primary voting on 9 February , Rubio currently sits in second place behind the real estate mogul .
Nipping at Rubioâ€ ™ s heels in New Hampshire , according to a new NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist poll released on Sunday , is the New Jersey governor , Chris Christie .
The pair have also engaged in a back - and - forth in recent weeks that has at times grown unusually testy .
In recent interviews , Christie said he did not think Rubio could â€œslime his way to the White Houseâ€ � and argued that Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton would â€œpat [ Rubio ] on the head and then cut his heart outâ€ � in a general election .
Asked for his response on Sunday , Rubio looked to frame Christieâ€ ™ s record as more in line with the Obama administration than that of a Republican .
â€œChris doesnâ€ ™ t want to have a debate about his record , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œChrisâ€ ™ s record , for a Republican , is not what we need.â€ �
â€œHeâ€ ™ s a supporter of Common Core .
Heâ€
™ s personally given a donation to Planned Parenthood .
Heâ€ ™ s a supporter of gun control , â€ � he added .
â€œThe last thing we need in our Republican nominee is someone who agrees with Obama and Hillary Clinton on many of the key issues before this country.â€ �
Christie has since reversed his stance on the issues Rubio cited , but said in his own interview on Sunday on CBSâ€ ™ s Face the Nation that he was â€œhappy to stand by my record of having made decisionsâ€ � .
â€œFor him to be trying to characterize my conservative record in that way is contrary to what Marco himself said ,
â€ �
Christie said of Rubio .
â€œMarco himself has said that I was a conservative reformer in New Jersey .
So hereâ€ ™ s the thing , Iâ€ ™ m not going to spend my time talking about Marco Rubio ,
OK?â€ �
Pressed nonetheless on whether he had contributed to Planned Parenthood , the womenâ€ ™ s health organization Republicans have looked to defund ,
Christie denied having done so .
â€œI
never donated to Planned Parenthood , so
thatâ€ ™ s wrong , â€ � he said .
The declaration runs counter to what Christie said in 1994 , while running for local office in New Jersey .
According to a Star - Ledger article from the time , Christie said : â€œI support Planned Parenthood privately with my personal contribution , and that should be the goal of any such agency , to find private donations.â€ �
A spokeswoman for Christieâ€ ™ s campaign reiterated that the governor had not made a donation to Planned Parenthood when asked about the conflicting statements .
Christie , as governor , has repeatedly vetoed funding for Planned Parenthood and also supports defunding the organization at the federal level .
He has said he changed from pro - choice to pro - life after hearing the heartbeat of his unborn daughter in the mid-1990s ."
2016-01-11,"Presidential candidate Marco Rubio escalated his criticism of his opponent Ted Cruz this week by suggesting a central component of the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s
tax plan was both â€œintentionally sneakyâ€ � and a â€œdangerous expansion of Washingtonâ€ ™ s powerâ€ � .
Although he did not mention Cruz by name , Rubio used an economic policy speech in his home state of Florida on Monday to suggest his rival would transform America into Europe by enacting a value - added tax ( VAT ) .
As if to rub salt in the wound , Rubio name - checked Republican hero Ronald Reagan as an opponent of a VAT and President Barack Obama as one of its proponents .
â€œBelieve it or not , multiple Republican candidates for president support new taxes on the American people , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œSome even support imposing a new tax that generations of conservatives have fought against , called a Value Added Tax â€ “ also known as a VAT .
â€œIt attempts to trick people into believing their taxes are being lowered , when in reality theyâ€ ™ re simply being shifted to employers â€ “ meaning everyday Americans would feel its impact through higher prices and lower wages.â€ �
Cruz has proposed to dramatically transform the existing tax code with a plan that would implement an individual 10 % flat tax on income and replace corporate income and all payroll taxes with a 16 % â€œBusiness Flat Taxâ€ � .
The latter is essentially a rebranded name for a value - added tax ( VAT ) , commonly used around the world but viewed with skepticism by many conservatives who see it as a vehicle for big government .
According to an analysis of Cruzâ€ ™ s tax plan by the conservative - leaning Tax Foundation , the US government â€œwould raise 71 % of all revenue from the new broad - based value - added tax , â€ � which would be levied on companiesâ€ ™ profits but not purchases from other businesses or capital investments .
Rubio on Monday said the implementation of a VAT in America would mirror Europe , where he argued the government has â€œgrown in sizeâ€ � â€œItâ€ ™ s no wonder that fans of the VAT include [ House Democratic leader ] Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama , who called it a â€˜novelâ€ ™ idea , â€ � the Florida senator said .
Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pushed back on Rubioâ€ ™ s characterization in a statement to the Guardian .
â€œAnyone who has read the Cruz plan knows it doesnâ€ ™ t feature a European - style national sales tax , â€ � Frazier said .
â€œInstead , his business flat tax is a proportionate tax on labor and capital , it dramatically simplifies taxes for businesses , and it is more competitive for capital investment and trade .
It allows us to eliminate numerous other taxes , flatten the income tax rate down to 10 percent and provides full expensing of business investment.â€ �
She added that Rubioâ€ ™ s attacks on Cruz were designed to change the conversation from his record on immigration .
â€œRather than misconstruing our tax plan ,
Marcoâ€ ™ s time is probably better served explaining to voters why he continues to support amnesty and has recently tripled - down on offering in - state tuition for those who are here illegally , â€ � Frazier said .
â€œThe reality is Marco will do and say anything to distract voters from his support for the Gang of Eight amnesty bill.â€ �
Rand Paul has also embraced a VAT , under the moniker of a â€œBusiness Transfer Taxâ€ � , but there was little doubt Rubioâ€ ™ s criticism was largely aimed at Cruz .
The two senators are competing in the early states behind Republican frontrunner Donald Trump , whereas Paul barely registers in most polling .
Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign has , in the past , pointed to a number of influential conservatives who have embraced the idea of a VAT .
But Rubio argued that by renaming it a â€œBusiness Flat Taxâ€ � , Republican candidates were attempting to veil their support for the essence of the proposal .
â€œDonâ€
™ t be fooled , â€ � he said .
â€œIf it acts like a VAT , taxes like a VAT , and grows government like a VAT â€
“
itâ€ ™ s a VAT.â€ � Rubio also took thinly veiled jabs at the New Jersey governor , Chris Christie , and former Florida governor Jeb Bush , again without invoking their names , for backing an internet sales tax .
â€œThe internet is the marketplace of the 21st century and itâ€ ™ s unacceptable that anyone who claims to be a conservative would join the liberal call for an online tax , â€ � Rubio said .
The senator added he did not support new taxes â€œof any kindâ€ � , and would look to reform entitlement programs such as Medicare and social security to solve the nationâ€ ™ s debt crisis .
Rubio introduced a plan last year that would eliminate taxes on interest , dividends and capital gains , lower the corporate tax rate to 25 % from 35 % and set the top rate on wage income to 35 % from 39.6 % .
The senatorâ€ ™ s opponents have said Rubioâ€ ™ s plan disproportionately favors the wealthy .
Rubio has also proposed creating a new , partially refundable child tax credit of up to $ 2,500 per child , and a tax break for employers that offer paid family leave ."
2016-01-12,"Marco Rubio on Tuesday introduced legislation that would eliminate automatic federal benefits for Cuban immigrants .
The Republican presidential candidateâ€ ™ s bill would alter a decades - old policy under which the US government has given Cuban immigrants â€ “ unlike other those from other countries â€ “ immediate access to programs such as Medicaid , welfare and food stamps .
Rubio , who is the son of Cuban immigrants , has stated on the campaign trail in recent weeks that the special treatment afforded to those fleeing the island must be re - examined in light of â€œoutrageous abuseâ€ � of the existing law .
His proposal would require immigrants from Cuba to prove they were persecuted in order to qualify for public assistance , as refugees and asylum - seekers from most countries must do .
In a statement on Monday , Rubio said that it was â€œoutrageous whenever the American peopleâ€ ™ s generosity is exploitedâ€ � .
â€ � â€œIt is particularly outrageous when individuals who claim to be fleeing repression in Cuba are welcomed and allowed to â€ � collect federal assistance based on their plight , only to return often to the very place they claimed to be fleeing , â€ � the Florida senator said .
â€œThe weaknesses in our current law not only allow the flow of American tax dollars into the Castro regimeâ€ ™ s coffers ; it also undermines the legitimate cause of those Cubans who are truly fleeing repression and political persecution.â€
�
A growing number of Cuban Americans in Congress have advocated for reforms to the conditions under which the federal benefits are provided , amid increased scrutiny over how the program is being used .
A lengthy investigation by the Sun Sentinel in October found that current federal aid to Cuban immigrants had expanded to at least $ 680 m a year , up from the $ 1 m allocation in 1960 .
Critics have also argued that Cubans are increasingly travelling to the US for reasons that are less political and more economic , and that many recipients of the benefits quickly return to Cuba .
Since the recent thaw in relations between Washington and Havana , the number of Cuban migrants attempting to reach the US by sea or through Central America has surged .
Migration experts say the rush has been triggered by fears that the recent dÃ © tente may prompt the US to revise its â€œwet - foot , dry - footâ€ � policy , which also grants unique immigration privileges to Cubans .
Under a 1995 revision of the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act , any migrant intercepted at sea is sent back , but those Cubans who make it to land can stay , and can apply for permanent residency after a year and a day .
In addition to Rubioâ€ ™ s bill , Florida Republican Carlos Curbelo filed similar legislation in the House of Representatives last month that has since gained bipartisan support â€ “ including from Debbie Wasserman Schultz , a Florida congresswoman who chairs the Democratic National Committee .
The efforts have thus far focused on federal benefits and do not affect the process under which Cubans can apply for legal residency .
Rubio has long indicated he was open to re - evaluating the special status for Cubans , telling the Tampa Bay Times in 2013 that â€œit gets very difficult to justify someoneâ€ ™ s status as an exile and refugeeâ€ � if they return home soon thereafter .
He reiterated the point in an interview with the Associated Press in November , saying : â€œWhen you have people who are coming and a year and a day later are travelling back to Cuba 15 times a year , 12 times , 10 times , eight times , that doesnâ€ ™ t look like someone who is fleeing oppression.â€ �
While campaigning in New Hampshire last week , Rubio also took aim at how Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s renewal of diplomatic ties with Cuba might impact the influx of immigrants into the US .
â€œI think at this point , the migratory policy with Cuba has changed dramatically .
Youâ€ ™ ve seen a huge upsurge now after the deal the president made with the Castro brother and itâ€ ™ s becoming a real crisis , â€ � Rubio said .
The Florida senator is an ardent opponent of Obamaâ€ ™ s shift in Cuba policy and told the Guardian last year he would reinstate the 50-year - old diplomatic freeze if elected president ."
2016-01-13,"As Barack Obama sought to ease the fears of an anxious nation in his final State of the Union address , the Republicans seeking to replace him in the White House said it was the president who had sown divisions among the American public .
Presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz , senators of Florida and Texas , respectively , reacted swiftly to Obamaâ€ ™ s address by criticizing both his tone and focus .
During an interview with Fox News , Rubio said Obama had â€œbitterly divided this country , and done so for his own gainâ€ � .
â€œThis president has been the single most divisive figure this country has had over the last decade , â€ � Rubio said .
In his own appearance on Fox , Cruz said the president was â€œout of touchâ€ � and more concerned with â€œpolitical correctnessâ€ � than with national security .
â€œThis was less a State of the Union than it was a state of denial , â€ � said Cruz , who chose to skip the address in favor of the campaign trail .
Although Obama did not mention any candidates by name , he dedicated a lengthy portion of his speech to what many interpreted as a rebuke of the Republican primary â€ “ particularly its tenor on immigration and refugees .
â€œAs frustration grows , there will be voices urging us to fall back into tribes , to scapegoat fellow citizens who donâ€ ™ t look like us , or pray like us , or vote like we do , or share the same background , â€ � Obama said , in a clear reference to Republican frontrunner Donald Trump .
He went on to deliver a forceful critique of anti - Muslim rhetoric , while warning of the implications of ascribing the actions of terrorists to an entire faith .
â€œThis is not a matter of political correctness .
Itâ€ ™ s a matter of understanding what makes us strong ,
â€ � Obama said .
Many of the Republican candidates , including Rubio , Cruz and former Florida governor Jeb Bush , have consistently attacked Obama on the campaign trail for refusing to declare the war on terror as one with â€œradical Islamâ€ � .
As Obama spoke , Bush rejected the presidentâ€ ™ s characterization of terrorists as â€œkillers and fanaticsâ€ � . â€œTheyâ€ ™ re radical Islamic terrorists .
Still canâ€ ™ t call them by name , â€ � Bush tweeted .
While itâ€ ™ s not uncommon for Obama to use the bully pulpit to push back on the rhetorical arguments of Republican candidates , on Monday his message was augmented by the fact that he will soon be succeeded by a new leader .
And he appeared intent on shaping the final major speech of his presidency around not only a defense of the worldview that has defined his time in office , but also the record he hopes his successor will carry forward .
That included economic policies to combat income inequality , expand college affordability , further access to healthcare and education , and remove the influence of money and power from politics â€ “ all of which are central themes in the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders .
Both Democratic candidates reacted to Obamaâ€ ™ s remarks on Twitter , with Clintonâ€ ™ s account expressing support for the presidentâ€ ™ s record with a warning that Republicans would â€œrip away [ his ] progressâ€ � .
Sanders said the speech was â€œimportantâ€ � , adding that â€œthe president reminded us not to be afraid of change , but to wield it to improve the lives of Americansâ€ � .
But to effect positive change , as was his hope when he arrived in Washington eight years ago , Obama urged those who may disagree with his agenda to , at the very least , step back from the doom - and - gloom that has taken hold of the 2016 race .
Alluding to the cautionary tales of American instability told by Republicans on the campaign trail , Obama offered a sharp rebuttal .
â€œI told you earlier all the talk of Americaâ€ ™ s economic decline is political hot air , â€ � he said .
â€œWell , so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker .
The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth .
Period .
Itâ€ ™ s not even close.â€ �"
2016-01-15,"Endorsements from gun - rights advocacy organizations were brandished with gusto on the debate stage on Thursday , with Jeb Bush , Ted Cruz , Chris Christie , Marco Rubio and Donald Trump dueling over who would do more to protect the second amendment rights of Americans concerned about their access to firearms .
Cruz went furthest in playing to such fears , pointing out that the next president could have multiple supreme court appointments to make , which he said meant : â€œThe government could confiscate your guns.â€ � Fox Business Network host Maria Bartiromo ignited the battle when she asked Bush whether , in light of the revelation that the suspect in the fatal mass shooting that claimed nine lives in Charleston last year was able to procure a weapon despite not passing a federal background test , there was anything that could be done to limit access to deadly weapons by those who would use them to commit violent crimes .
Bush touted his A - plus rating from the National Rifle Association and said that the failure lay not with loopholes in the law , but with the federal government .
â€œThe FBI made a mistake , â€ � Bush said .
â€œThe law requires a background check.â€
�
The true area of the federal governmentâ€ ™
s focus , Bush said , should be with mental health , rather than restrictions on firearms .
When asked if he believed in enacting any restrictions on access to guns , Trump â€ “ who has previously described himself as â€œa big second amendment
personâ€
�
â€ “ responded that such restrictions may have led to the deaths of 130 people in terrorist attacks in Paris .
â€œEven in Paris , if they had guns on the other side , going in the opposite direction , you wouldnâ€ ™ t have 130-plus people dead.â€ �
With a variation on an old line , he added : â€œThe guns donâ€ ™ t pull the trigger , the people pull the trigger.â€ � Rubio , in a bid to top Trump , declared that any president who was willing to take guns away from American citizens wasnâ€ ™ t a president worth having .
â€œI am convinced that if this president could take away every gun in America , he would , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œThe first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law - abiding citizens.â€ � Echoing Trumpâ€ ™ s insistence that gun restrictions contributed to the fatalities in the Paris terrorist attacks , Rubio said that restrictions would only aid those who would commit crimes while armed .
â€œIsis and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show , â€ �
he said .
â€œ[Obamaâ€ ™ s ] immediate answer , before he even knows the facts , is gun control .
Hereâ€ ™ s a fact : Weâ€ ™ re in a war with Isis.â€ �
Christie , in his take on the presidentâ€ ™
s
record on the second amendment , gave a variation on a line he has used before .
â€œThis
guyâ€ ™ s a petulant child , â€ �
Christie said .
He followed that up by saying that â€œweâ€ ™ re not against you â€ “ weâ€ ™ re against your policiesâ€ � and that â€œweâ€ ™ re going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fallâ€ � .
Cruz also questioned the fidelity of his rivals to the second amendment , saying that as a Republican candidate for president , â€œunless you are clinically insane , thatâ€ ™ s
what you say in the primaryâ€ � .
â€œBut peopleâ€ ™ s actions donâ€ ™ t always match their words , â€ � he added ."
2016-01-15,"Chris Christie has denied claims by Republican rival Marco Rubio that he is a political moderate who once wrote a check to reproductive health organization Planned Parenthood , and supported the nomination by Barack Obama of Sonia Sotomayor to the supreme court .
At the GOP debate in North Charleston , South Carolina , the New Jersey governor said he had supported neither Planned Parenthood nor Sotomayor .
The newspapers at the time got it wrong , he said .
He repeated this denial on MSNBCâ€ ™ s Morning Joe on Friday morning .
Sotomayor , the courtâ€ ™ s first Hispanic justice , came to the high court from a post on the second circuit court of appeals in Manhattan , where she was known for a sympathy with defendants and for her support of criminal justice reform and anti - discrimination initiatives .
Her nomination was immediately criticized on the right , by conservatives who accused her of judicial activism .
It appears Christie did endorse Sotomayor , according to a New Jersey statehouse reporter for Gannett : As for the Planned Parenthood check , the New Jersey Star - Ledger has posted its original article from 1994 in which Christie said : â€œI support Planned Parenthood privately with my personal contribution and that should be the goal of any such agency , to find private donations.â€ �
What explanation did Christie come up with to make sense of his contradicting claims ?
Morning Joeâ€ ™ s Willie Geist reports :"
2016-01-16,"On a chilly January weekend , as Marco Rubio kicked off the most important year of his political career , two voters offered competing advice on how he should address immigration â€ “ an issue that has roiled the race for the Republican presidential nomination .
Under attack over a comprehensive immigration reform bill he helped craft in 2013 , which drew widespread conservative ire over its inclusion of a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants , the Florida senator found himself on defense .
Negative advertisements , sponsored predominantly by allies of Ted Cruz , the Texas senator and immigration hardliner , painted Rubio as a proponent of so - called â€œamnestyâ€ � .
As Rubio addressed a packed crowd in Hampton , one woman asked : why not take a page from Barack Obama and deliver a speech on a â€œmore perfect unionâ€ � ?
It was a reference to the 2008 address in which the future president responded to controversial remarks by his former pastor with a sweeping address on race , religion and politics .
As the son of Cuban immigrants , the voter said , Rubio was uniquely positioned to reset the narrative .
Less than 24 hours later , less than an hour away , Rubio encountered the opposite view .
A second woman said she had discussed Rubioâ€ ™ s candidacy with others and was troubled to learn he was â€œsoftâ€ � on immigration .
He would need to assure her that was not the case .
The immigration question has been an evolving one for Rubio , who if elected president would be the first Latino to occupy the White House .
But in Thursday nightâ€ ™ s presidential debate in North Charleston , South Carolina , the senator set before millions of viewers the approach he plans to take in the home stretch of the Republican primary .
Asked about his immigration bill and its proposed expansion of green cards for foreign workers , Rubio sidestepped , seeking to recast the topic as a matter of national security .
The issue , he said , was now â€œdramatically differentâ€ � than two years ago , due to the emergence of â€œa group of radical crazies named Isisâ€ � .
â€œOur
No 1 priority must now become ensuring that Isis can not get killers into the United States , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œSo whether itâ€ ™ s green cards or any other form of entry into America , when Iâ€ ™ m president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming , you are not going to get into the United States of America.â€
�
The following morning , his campaign launched two new TV ads .
In one â€ “ a direct response to an ad by a pro - Jeb Bush Super Pac that accused Rubio of flip - flopping on immigration â€ “ Rubio vowed to undo Obamaâ€ ™ s executive orders , cut funding for so - called â€œsanctuary citiesâ€ � , finish 700 miles of border wall , add 20,000 border agents and deport â€œcriminal aliensâ€ � .
â€œWhen Iâ€ ™ m president , there will be no amnesty , â€ � Rubio said .
The urgency with which Rubio now presents a tougher demeanor stands in stark contrast to the greater part of last year .
After launching his candidacy in April at Miamiâ€ ™ s Freedom Tower , the first stop for Cuban exiles fleeing Fidel Castroâ€ ™ s regime from 1962 to 1974 , Rubio largely spoke of immigration through the story of his parents .
Only in America , he said , could immigrants who worked as a bartender and a maid leave their son in a position to run for president .
But unless asked by a voter or a reporter , Rubio seldom brought up immigration reform .
He did , nonetheless , lay out a three - step plan that would secure the border , modernize legal immigration and promote visas for high - skilled workers , and finally determine how to bring undocumented immigrants out of the shadows .
He almost never uttered the word â€œamnestyâ€ � and , when pressed , acknowledged being â€œpersonallyâ€ � open to green cards for law - abiding undocumented immigrants .
It was not until late December , as he and Cruz escalated their feud , that Rubio began to raise the subject of immigration in his stump speech â€ “ but only to emphasize that as president , he would â€œenforce the lawâ€ � .
In recent weeks , he has made the case that immigration is inextricably linked to terrorism .
There may be no other option in a primary where a majority of Republicans are rankled by national security concerns and more skeptical of immigrants than in any recent election .
Polling in recent months found that a significant faction of voters favor the extreme line drawn by frontrunner Donald Trump , including his proposed ban on Muslim immigration .
That the roughly 11 million undocumented migrants living in the US are now being conflated with the Syrian refugee crisis is a byproduct of Trumpâ€ ™ s dominance .
Trumpâ€ ™ s first TV ad invoked the mass shooting in San Bernardino , California , touted his proposed moratorium on Muslim migrants and alluded to terrorists streaming across the southern border .
Although he has rejected a religious test for entry into the US , Rubioâ€ ™ s stance on refugees has changed .
He was among the first candidates to say the US should allow them in , a stance he reversed after the terrorist attacks in Paris in November .
He then suggested he was open to the admission of â€œcommonsenseâ€ � individuals that could be vetted , such as elderly women , children and Chaldean priests .
On the stump , Rubio compares the refugee question to locking oneâ€ ™ s door .
There was a time when people did not do so , he says , before observing that the world has changed .
â€œWhen you lock your doors , itâ€ ™ s not because you hate the people outside of your home , â€ � he often says .
â€œYou lock your doors because you love the people inside.â€ �
Rubioâ€ ™ s opponents have pointed out that terrorist groups hardly cropped up overnight .
Immediately after Thursdayâ€ ™ s debate , his critics resurrected a clip from 2013 following the Boston Marathon bombing â€ “ an event that coincided with negotiations over Rubioâ€ ™ s immigration bill .
Then , Rubio urged skeptics to â€œkeep in perspectiveâ€ � that the bombers were just two migrants and any lessons learned could be worked into his legislation .
Today , he insists national security has prompted him to rethink immigration entirely .
What that means for his appeal to Latino voters remains to be seen .
For now , he must fend off attacks from his right , as from Cruz and Trump , and from those who agree with him on broader policy issues .
On Friday , Bush , who once praised Rubioâ€ ™ s work on immigration , knocked the senator over what he deemed to be a lack of leadership .
â€œMarco cut and run , plain and simple , for whatever reason , â€ � Bush told reporters in South Carolina .
The former Florida governor had just earned the endorsement of Senator Lindsey Graham , a coauthor of Rubioâ€ ™ s immigration bill in 2013 who dropped out of the race last month .
On the campaign trail , Rubio portrays his twists and turns as a matter of pragmatism .
He has also taken to reminding voters that he knows the issue .
â€œMy entire family is immigrants , â€ �
Rubio told the New Hampshire voter who suggested he had a â€œsoftâ€ � reputation , also citing his West Miami community .
â€œI understand the good , the bad , and the ugly , and every aspect of it .
I know the story of people who are here illegally , and it would break your heart .
And I know the story of people that are here legally , whose stories would boil your blood .
â€œNo one who has ever run for president understands this issue personally better than I do and thatâ€ ™ s why I can tell you and you should tell your friends that no one running for president is better prepared to fix it than me.â€
�
It brought his loudest applause of the morning ."
2016-01-17,"Vowing to defend the second amendment , Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio suggested to a packed audience in Iowa that guns might be the only tools at their disposal to protect themselves against the Islamic State .
Speaking before a crowd of roughly 600 on Saturday evening in Sioux Center , a city in western Iowa , Rubio issued a stern warning that Barack Obama and his administration were conspiring to confiscate guns .
The Florida senator added that , as president , he would uphold the US constitution and ensure that gun rights were protected .
â€œMy attorney general is not going to be someone that comes to my office to conspire about how to take away your guns , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œMy attorney general is going to be someone that defends your second amendment right to protect your family , your homes , your business and your property .
â€œBecause , if God forbid Isis pays a visit to you , to our community , the last thing standing between them and our families may be the ability to protect ourselves with our guns .
And thereâ€ ™ s
no way weâ€
™ re going to take that away from the American people , not when Iâ€ ™ m president.â€
�
Republican presidential candidates have linked the threat of terrorism from Isis to gun control since the San Bernardino shooting in December , in which 14 people were killed and 20 wounded by a couple alleged to have supported the militant group .
Rubio has been especially vocal about gun rights in the wake of Obamaâ€ ™ s executive action to expand background checks , a move taken by the president earlier this month in the face of congressional inaction .
The Florida senator has already pledged to overturn Obamaâ€ ™ s executive orders on his first day in office , should he be elected to the White House this year .
Rubio , who holds an A rating from the National Rifle Association , also talked up the issue in last weekâ€ ™ s presidential debate in Charleston .
â€œI am convinced if this president could confiscate every gun , he would , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œI am convinced if he could get rid of the second amendment , he would.â€ �
Although the crowd erupted in cheers , Fox Business moderator Neil Cavuto pushed back at the idea that Obama would actually take away peopleâ€ ™ s guns .
â€œYou donâ€
™ t think thatâ€ ™ s
extreme?â€ � Cavuto asked .
Rubio reiterated , emphatically , that Obama was intent on making it â€œharder for people to buy gunsâ€ � .
Obama has never put forward a proposal that would actually remove firearms from the possession of law - abiding citizens .
At an 8 January forum on guns hosted by CNN , Obama dismissed as conspiracies claims that he was out to grab anyoneâ€ ™ s guns .
â€œIâ€
™ m only going to be here for another year .
When would I have started on this enterprise?â€ � he said , while adding that his advocacy for stricter gun laws was not inconsistent with his support of the second amendment .
Guns sales have risen exponentially under Obamaâ€ ™ s watch , a trend Rubio has explained as evidence that Americans are fearful of losing access to firearms under the current administration .
Last week , the 44-year - old senator toured a gun manufacturer in New Hampshire , where he told employees he spent part of Christmas Eve shopping for a handgun and was surprised to find that the store was â€œpackedâ€ � .
Speaking to CBSâ€ ™ s Face the Nation in an interview to be broadcast on Sunday , he explained the purchase in light of his concerns about the Islamic State .
â€œWell , first of all , Iâ€ ™ m not home very often , â€ �
he said .
â€œSo that was one of the few days that I was there .
Second , I have a right to protect my family .
And thatâ€ ™ s why â€ “
I was previously a firearm holder , as well .
This was an additional one .
â€œI have the right to protect my family if someone were to come after us .
In fact , if Isis were to visit us or our communities at any moment , the last line of defense between Isis and my family is the ability that I have to protect my family from them or from a criminal or anyone else who seeks to do us harm .
â€œMillions of Americans feel that way.â€ �"
2016-01-25,"Popular senator Joni Ernst from Iowa appeared on stage with Republican candidate Marco Rubio on Monday â€ “ the latest piece of good news for the Florida senatorâ€ ™ s presidential campaign .
Rubio gained endorsements from two local newspapers over the past 48 hours : the Sioux City Journal and the Des Moines Register â€ “ the latter the stateâ€ ™ s largest .
â€œI am not endorsing , â€ �
Ernst said shortly after taking the stage in Des Moines to a standing ovation against the backdrop of red , white and blue signs bearing Rubioâ€ ™ s name .
But standing inside a ballroom before a crowd of roughly 200 , the appearance of the popular home - state senator alongside Rubio just one week before the Iowa caucuses had all the trimmings of a formal stamp of approval .
Iowa is the first state to vote for Republican and Democratic candidates .
Introducing Rubio as a â€œgood friendâ€ � and someone â€œnear and dearâ€ � to her heart , Ernst made an impassioned pitch for why the senator from Florida is qualified to be the next commander in chief .
Invoking her experience in the US military , Ernst lauded in particular Rubioâ€ ™ s emphasis on national security .
â€œThose boots that are on the ground fighting for our values , those are the boots that I wore .
Those are the boots that so many Iowans have worn , â€ � she said .
â€œAnd those are the boots that Marco Rubio understands .
He knows what it means to keep our country safe.â€ �
Rubio was an early backer of Ernst during her 2014 Senate campaign , in which she catapulted to national fame with an ad that likened trimming spending in Washington to castrating hogs on her farm .
â€œMake â€ ™
em squeal ,
â€ �
she memorably said , in what went on to become one of the most talked - about political ads that cycle .
Rubio , through his political action committee , spent nearly a quarter of a million dollars helping boost Ernst in that contest .
Some of his top aides additionally worked to elect Ernst , and Rubio hit the campaign trail and fundraisers to bolster her candidacy .
Now , even as Ernst officially stays neutral in the Republican race for the presidency , the timing of her attendance at Rubioâ€ ™ s rally could lend a critical jolt to to his prospects in a state where he is polling in third behind Donald Trump and senator Ted Cruz of Texas .
The Iowa senator also echoed Rubioâ€ ™ s message of restoring the American Dream , a centerpiece of his campaign .
â€œHe wants to make sure that we have an America we are going to be proud of .
Iâ€ ™ ve seen him fight for that for his children , for my children , and for your children as well , â€ � she said .
Rubio said he was â€œgratefulâ€ � to have Ernst by his side , weaving her own narrative into his stump speech to highlight what they had in common .
Both of them were underdogs in their respective Senate races , he said , taking on more establishment - friendly candidates .
â€œShe wasnâ€ ™ t supposed to win , she wasnâ€ ™ t supposed to run , â€ � Rubio said , adding he was â€œproudâ€ � to have supported her in a competitive five - way primary in 2014 .
Rubio also nodded to their shared humble beginnings .
While his personal background as the son of a bartender and a maid is an essential piece of Rubioâ€ ™ s tale , Ernst has similarly spoken of a modest childhood working on her familyâ€ ™ s farm .
She had but one nice pair of shoes , Rubio told those gathered , which her parents would wrap in bread bags when it rained to prevent them from being ruined .
Addressing reporters after the event , Rubio said Ernst â€œexemplifies what I hope the Republican party and the conservative movement will be aboutâ€ � .
â€œA party of upward mobility of empowering people that donâ€ ™ t start out in life with a lot of money and a lot of advantages but through free enterprise and limited government are able to improve their lives and the lives of their families.â€ �
After the rally , Vinita Smith of neighboring Panora made a beeline to the front of the room where Ernst and Rubio were snapping photos with eager fans .
After embracing Ernst and offering her a prayer , Smith told the Guardian she was weighing whether to caucus for Rubio or retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson .
What bearing did Ernstâ€ ™ s presence have on the decision before caucus - goers like herself ?
â€œI think it probably helps the overall perception .
Sheâ€ ™ s very well respected , â€ � Smith said , pausing for a moment before adding : â€œIt does nothing but help him.â€ �"
2016-01-26,"Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio sought to raise questions on Tuesday about the indictment of two anti - abortion activists by drawing a dubious connection between a member of the prosecutorâ€ ™ s office and Planned Parenthood .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s pretty outrageous that Planned Parenthood was investigated by some lawyer or district attorney who apparently , according to some news reports , has actually been a board member of Planned Parenthood and donated to them , â€ � Rubio said , responding to a voter question about abortion at an Iowa town hall .
â€œThey investigated Planned Parenthood and they said : â€˜We found they did nothing wrong , â€ � he added .
â€œBut weâ€ ™ re going to indict the people who filmed them talking about these things.â€ ™ Thatâ€ ™ s outrageous.â€ �
Rubioâ€ ™ s comments referred to a Texas grand jury that concluded its investigation of Planned Parenthood by indicting not the womenâ€ ™ s healthcare provider , but two of the anti - abortion activists who prompted the criminal inquiry .
The activists , David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt , used false identities to film secret videos that accused Planned Parenthood employees of selling fetal tissue in violation of the law .
Planned Parenthood of the Gulf Coast was cleared of any wrongdoing .
The indictments , which the Harris County district attorney announced Monday , put abortion foes like Rubio on the defensive after months of touting the videos in fights over Planned Parenthoodâ€ ™ s government funding .
But Planned Parenthood was quick to point out on Tuesday that the district attorney in fact has no known connections to their organization .
Dawn Laguens , Planned Parenthoodâ€ ™ s executive vice - president , said that the indictment is a sign political attacks on the group have largely failed .
â€œI think that is an accurate thing to say , given the three years of investment they made and the tremendous criminal lengths they went to try to harm Planned Parenthood , â€ �
she said on Tuesday .
â€œThe breathless reporting for weeks and months around these videotapes produced an amazing amount of material to rebut the charges â€ ¦ The Center for Medical Progress has really unravelled.â€ �
Rubioâ€ ™ s attack was likely referring to a Harris County prosecutor in the criminal family law division , Lauren Reeder .
Reeder was a member of the Planned Parenthood of the Gulf Coast board of directors at the time of the countyâ€ ™ s investigation , a connection that the anti - abortion website LifeNews.com has sought to highlight .
But Reeder was not , as Rubio stated , the district attorney who handed down Mondayâ€ ™ s indictments , nor was she involved in the broader investigation .
According to news reports from the time , Reeder disclosed that she was a Planned Parenthood board member shortly after Harris County began its investigation in August .
The district attorney , Devon Anderson , made Reederâ€ ™ s affiliation public and stated that Reeder would not have any involvement in the investigation .
The investigation was requested by Texasâ€ ™ s Republican lieutenant governor , Dan Patrick .
Anderson was appointed to her office by Republican governor Rick Perry in 2013 .
She won election as a Republican in 2014 .
Josh Schaffer , an attorney who represented Planned Parenthood of the Gulf Coast in the Harris County investigation , said on Tuesday that it was his understanding the district attorneyâ€ ™ s office created a â€œfirewallâ€ � around Reeder .
Last summer , a group known as the Center for Medical Progress filmed and released a series of sting videos edited so they appeared to show Planned Parenthood employees selling fetal tissue in violation of federal law .
In Harris County , the videos prompted an investigation into Planned Parenthood of the Gulf Coast .
Anderson convened a grand jury that wrapped up a two - month investigation on Monday when it indicted Daleiden and Merritt for tampering with a governmental record , a charge that carries between two and 20 years in prison and up to a $ 10,000 fine .
Daleiden received a second indictment under a law prohibiting the purchase and sale of human organs , which carries possible jail time and a fine up to $ 4,000 .
The indictment stems from an email he sent to Planned Parenthood offering to buy fetal specimens at $ 1,600 apiece .
Planned Parenthood never responded to his email .
Schaffer , the Planned Parenthood lawyer , said the grand jury did not find enough evidence to even vote on indictments for Planned Parenthood .
On Capitol Hill , it is not clear if Congress this year will match the intensity of Planned Parenthood investigators in 2015 .
As of October , five separate committees had kicked off their own inquiries , and several staged heated hearings with Planned Parenthood executives .
But comments by Paul Ryan , the new Republican speaker of the House , suggest that those committees may take a backseat as he strives to restore â€œregular orderâ€ � .
Ryan said in December that efforts to strip Planned Parenthood of its millions in federal funding will remain a top priority in 2016 .
Yet he has signaled that he is not willing to allow the House to keep with its pattern of voting repeatedly to defund while Obama is in office .
Abortion foes have made as little headway with investigations in the states .
Eleven states have concluded inquiries into Planned Parenthoodâ€ ™ s fetal tissue donation program without finding any evidence of wrongdoing : Florida , Georgia , Indiana , Kansas , Massachusetts , Michigan , Missouri , Ohio , Pennsylvania , South Dakota , and Washington .
Officials in another eight states â€ “ California , Colorado , Delaware , Idaho , Iowa , Minnesota , New Hampshire and Virginia â€ “ have declined to investigate Planned Parenthood , citing a lack of evidence of illegal activity .
Undeterred , nearly two - dozen Republican governors and statehouses have taken action to relieve Planned Parenthood clinics that provide contraception and STI and cancer screenings of Medicaid and family planning funds .
An executive with Americans United for Life , a legal advocacy group that provides model anti - abortion legislation to state lawmakers , told the Guardian Tuesday that the group would continue to push measures to defund abortion providers .
So far , North Carolina and New Hampshire permanently cut off funds .
But Planned Parenthood is fighting most other defund efforts in court .
And it has repeatedly won temporary injunctions against states attempting to kick its clinics out of state Medicaid programs .
( States are mostly prohibited from limiting a womanâ€ ™ s choice of Medicaid provider . )
Some investigations are still ongoing .
On Monday , after the Harris County grand jury declined to indict Planned Parenthood , Texas governor Greg Abbott , a Republican , revealed that two state offices are involved in investigating Planned Parenthood : the inspector general of the Texas health department , and the state attorney general .
( In October , without publicly acknowledging an inquiry , investigators from the health department ordered Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas to turn over thousands of pages of patient records . )
But at least one state , California , is investigating the Center for Medical Progress .
In response to calls by Democratic members of Congress , attorney general Kamala Harris agreed in July to investigate whether the center broke laws when it registered the fake corporation that activists used as their cover .
It was not the first bad outcome Daleiden and his group have faced in court .
In California , an ongoing lawsuit has set the stage for the identities of the key architects and financiers behind the centerâ€ ™ s sting to become public knowledge .
The names of the centerâ€ ™ s key bankrollers are still a mystery , although Troy Newman , an extreme abortion opponent who supports violence against providers and clinics , has been identified as a cofounder .
That lawsuit stems from video taken at an annual meeting of the National Abortion Federation in 2014 and 2015 .
Activists with the Center for Medical Progress posed as members of a biomedical research firm to obtain undercover footage .
NAF sued Daleiden , Newman , the center , and BioMax Procurement Services , the fake company that served as the activistsâ€ ™ cover , to prevent the release of any video .
It also sought the identities of the activists who infiltrated the two NAF conferences , as well as the identities of anyone who received a report on the NAF meetings that Daleiden and the center circulated .
Court records indicate that the report went out to key donors and architects of the centerâ€ ™ s undercover activities .
In December , over the centerâ€ ™ s objections that it was protected by the first amendment , US district judge William Orrick ruled that the center must turn over a list of those names and identities .
The US supreme court rejected the groupâ€ ™ s appeal .
The list remains confidential to NAFâ€ ™ s attorneys .
But a NAF spokeswoman said Judge Orrick could make the list public , or it could become public as part of a jury trial .
NAF is now asking the court to take action against Daleiden and his group for disclosing video footage of its annual conference containing confidential information to Congressman Jason Chaffetz .
Chaffetz , a Republican , leads the House oversight and government reform committee , one of several committees investigating Planned Parenthood .
In a separate lawsuit , StemExpress , a biotech firm conducting tissue research , won a restraining order against the center in Los Angeles superior court and has vowed to sue the group over invasion of privacy .
The firm had ties to Planned Parenthood , and the sting videos caused the companyâ€ ™ s CEO to receive online death threats .
The restraining order prevents the center from releasing any video footage it took of StemExpress employees .
The Thomas More Society , a conservative legal group representing Daleiden in civil suits , did not respond to requests for comment .
â€œItâ€ ™ s been telling that while the defendants have been very vocal in the media saying that they have nothing to hide , throughout the case , they have invoked the Fifth Amendment , and not cooperated with court orders to turn over information , â€ � Melissa Fowler , an NAF spokeswoman , said .
â€œThankfully , these efforts to hide their fraud and dodge discovery have not been successful â€ ¦
We hope that the grand jury indictment will be a wakeup call and that politicians will want to distance themselves from this indicted felon and his discredited campaign.â€

2016-01-27,"Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump is widely viewed as a â€œgoodâ€ � or â€œgreatâ€ � potential president by voters from his party despite his perceived lack of religiousness , a new survey has found .
The study , conducted by the Pew Research Center earlier this month , found that being an atheist continues to be one of the biggest perceived shortcomings of a candidate running for president , with 51 % of adults saying they would be less likely to vote for a candidate who does not believe in God .
But few Republican voters think Trump is a particularly religious person , when compared with other leading candidates like Ben Carson , Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio .
Of the Republicans surveyed by Pew , 44 % said Trump is either â€œvery religiousâ€ � or â€œsomewhat religiousâ€ � , while 47 % said the candidate is either â€œnot too religiousâ€ � or â€œnot at all religiousâ€ � .
In contrast , the majority of Republican voters see Carson , Cruz and Rubio as religious people .
About 80 % of Republican voters see Carson as religious , 76 % see Cruz
as religious and 70 % see Rubio as religious .
The findings are the latest of Pewâ€ ™ s research on the impact of religion on presidential campaigns .
American voters tend to see Republican candidates as more religious than Democratic ones .
While the majority of American voters view Carson , Cruz and Rubio as at least somewhat religious , only about half say the same about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton , and just 40 % of voters view Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders as a religious person .
â€œBeing seen as a religious person is generally an asset for candidates ; people who think a candidate is a religious person tend to be more likely to see that candidate as a potentially good president ,
â€ � the study authors wrote .
â€œBut many Republicans think Trump would be a good president despite his perceived lack of religiousness.â€ �
Of the 56 % of Republican voters who see Trump as a potentially good or great president , 17 % say they think he is not religious .
Republican voters surveyed exhibited a very different pattern when asked about the other leading presidential candidates .
Virtually all Republican voters who think Carson , Cruz and Rubio would be good or great presidents said they view those candidates as at least somewhat religious .
Only 2 % of Republicans said Rubio would be a good president and that he is not particularly religious ; just 1 % said the same about Carson and Cruz .
The poll also reflected that having a president who â€œshares their religious beliefsâ€ � is important to Americans , a view commonplace among Republicans .
About two - thirds of Republicans say it is â€œsomewhat importantâ€
� that their president share their religious beliefs .
For voters , a president being an atheist is a bigger drawback than one
whoâ€ ™ s had an extramarital affair , financial troubles or one whoâ€ ™ s used marijuana .
But the survey found that the share of Americans who would hesitate to vote for an atheist presidential candidate has been declining over time .
â€œAs recently as 2007
, more than six - in-10 Americans said they would be less likely to support an atheist presidential candidate , while just 51 % express this view today , â€ � the study authors wrote .
â€œOver this period , the share who say a candidateâ€ ™ s lack of belief would not be a factor in how they vote has been growing.â€ �
When it comes to religiousness and the Democratic candidates , about two - thirds of Democratic voters said Clinton is at least somewhat religious .
About half of Democratic voters said the same about Sanders .
For Clinton , views about her perceived religiousness is linked to whether voters think she would be a successful president .
About 69 % of voters see Clinton as religious , and said she would be a good or great president .
A similar link was not found for Sanders .
The survey found differences among major religious groups in views toward Clinton and Sanders , with more religiously affiliated voters who saw Clinton as a good president .
The majority of Democratic Catholics ( 69 % ) and Protestants ( 66 % ) view Clinton as a good or great president .
Among Democratic Catholics , 46 % said Sanders would make a good president , and 43 % of Democratic Protestants agreed .
But among religiously unaffiliated Democratic voters , 65 % said Sanders would be a good president , while just 57 % said the same about Clinton ."
2016-01-28,"Moments before Marco Rubio arrived at The Old Salt , a queue of voters snaking across the room and out into an overflow area were joined by some waiting staff .
Lining the exposed brick walls of the historic tavern they stood , phones at the ready , to record the arrival of the son of a bartender and a maid who could become the first Latino president of the United States .
Similar scenes have played out when Rubio has taken the stage across hotel ballrooms , country clubs and diners from the chilly borders of Iowa and New Hampshire to the warmer climes of South Carolina and Florida : wait staff and housekeepers drawn to the inspirational tale of Rubioâ€ ™ s immigrant parents that has been at the heart of his pitch since launching his candidacy for president last year .
Framed by observers as the Republican answer to Barack Obama , Rubio was quickly branded as another freshman senator in a hurry â€ “ but one who could make history by sweeping away a generation of leaders whose time was up .
But as Rubio moves back and forth between the two early states which will determine the trajectory of his campaign , his rivals have developed a narrative of their own : that the senatorâ€ ™ s forward - facing optimism has already been tried , and found wanting , in the current president .
It simply wonâ€ ™ t be enough .
The presidential race has taken a rougher tone , with the bombast of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz at one end of the spectrum , and , at the other , a circular firing squad of establishment alternatives taking shots at one another .
Rubio , elected to the Senate on the Tea Party wave of 2010 , has been the only candidate caught in between .
So when the senator commenced his fourth and final stop of this early January day , the mood was noticeably darker .
He began with a joke about how his wife had come up with a solution for cold weather campaigning by gifting him the same sweater in every color for Christmas , but he soon pivoted to a more serious note .
Launching into a critique of Obamaâ€ ™ s tenure , Rubio said : â€œThis is the first time weâ€ ™ ve had a president not interested in fixing the problems in America .
This is the first time in modern history weâ€ ™ ve had a president that is trying to fundamentally change America .
This is the first time that we have a president that believes that America is an arrogant global power that needed to be cut down to size.â€ �
The portrait only grew bleaker as Rubio , sporting the light grey version of the Christmas sweater range , continued .
Obama , by his account , had left the country in ruins â€ “ damage so irreparable that simply electing any Republican
might not be enough to reverse course .
Hopeful Rubio had apparently been subsumed by the prevailing mood of the Republican primary electorate : voters are fed up .
As the rise of Trump and Cruz â€ “ and even Democratic contender Bernie Sanders â€ “ reveals , many Americans yearn for a candidate who will channel their frustrations .
The danger for Republicans , even while Trump and Cruz rise , is that by pandering to this anger , they risk turning off supporters they will need if they are to retake the White House after eight years .
As Rubio was signing copies of his memoir and posing for photos , one tall man in a baseball cap , standing in line for the senator , lamented that most Hispanic immigrants granted US citizenship voted for Democrats .
Why not stem the flow of immigrants , he asked , to prevent a movement that would â€œdramatically change the countryâ€ � ?
Rubio , the man featured on the front cover of Time magazine in 2012 under the headline â€œThe Republican Saviorâ€ � , showed a flash of that understanding that to win , Republicans need to broaden their appeal .
He politely disagreed and argued the need for conservatives to improve their standing among immigrants by advocating free enterprise as the path to prosperity .
â€œOne of the things that motivates an immigrant community is the desire to leave their children better off than themselves .
Thatâ€ ™ s what they want
, thatâ€ ™ s why they came ,
â€ �
Rubio , the son of Cuban immigrants , said .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve got to talk about what theyâ€ ™ re facing .
If we donâ€ ™ t , they think we donâ€ ™ t care about them.â€
�
The man walked away saying he might reconsider his view .
In miniature , this is how Rubio seeks to unite â€ “ and change â€ “ the Republican Party .
He is a staunch advocate of conservative principles , but presents the softer demeanor he hopes will draw in voters from the various wings of the party and even those Americans long forgotten by the GOP .
â€œWe need to reach out to those who havenâ€ ™ t heard from us in years , â€ � Rubio often says on the stump , ticking off demographics such as minorities , single women and young people .
â€œWhenâ€ ™ s the last time we spoke to single moms struggling to raise their children ?
Whenâ€ ™ s the last time we had an agenda that spoke to students burdened with debt ?
â€œIf
I am our nominee , we will be the party of the future , â€ �
he adds .
â€¢â€¢â€¢
Attempting to unify the party in a primary upended by grassroots anger , Rubioâ€ ™ s message has been pulled in different directions â€ “ vacillating between a decidedly gloomier assessment of America while holding on to the promise of hope in the future .
In recent weeks , much of Rubioâ€ ™ s stump speech has addressed the grievances of the Republican base , eaten up by a feeling that their country is slipping away from them .
â€œThis is hard , but itâ€ ™ s the truth : America is a great nation in decline , â€ � Rubio says .
â€œWe are not a weak country .
We just have a weak president .
And this year we are going to change that.â€ �
Any mention of Trump â€ “ by concerned voters or
the media â€ “ yields only subtle criticism from the senator .
Mostly , Rubio gives credit to the real estate mogul for pointing to issues he says are important .
â€œIâ€
™ m running against him for president , so Iâ€ ™ m not in the practice of building up my opposition , â€ �
Rubio told attendees at a town hall in Ottumwa , Iowa , last week .
â€œBut I acknowledge that what heâ€ ™ s tapped into is a real frustration in this country that needs to be addressed , that politics no longer works for people.â€ � While Cruz and Trump have ridden a wave of outrage to the top of the polls , Rubio has not made significant headway â€ “ occupying the third slot in most national and early state polling .
Even so , the consensus remains that he is the most likely candidate to make a late breakthrough , with favorability ratings that are among the highest in the field .
If he is to emerge as the palatable alternative , he has a circuitous pathway to the nomination ahead .
At the moment , Rubio is neither positioned to win Iowa or New Hampshire .
But he is running in the top three in most early state polling , and his campaign is confident New Hampshire will knock out other establishment contenders .
As the field winnows , Rubioâ€ ™ s backers hope the party would rally behind him as a clear alternative to Trump and Cruz .
It remains an arduous task , given the senator is far from a comfortable second in New Hampshire â€ “ where he has borne the brunt of attacks from rivals such as Jeb Bush and Chris Christie .
Both have sought to undermine Rubioâ€ ™ s candidacy by zeroing in on his youth as a liability .
Hillary Clinton would â€œpat him on the head and rip his heart outâ€ � , Christie claimed of Rubio this month .
In a separate interview , the New Jersey governor asserted that Rubio could not â€œslime his wayâ€ � to the White House .
Bush , a one - time ally of Rubioâ€ ™ s , has largely steered clear of the senator since his attempt to attack Rubioâ€ ™ s voting record in Octoberâ€ ™ s Republican debate fizzled .
But Right 2 Rise , the Super Pac supporting Bushâ€ ™ s candidacy , has dedicated millions of dollars to attacking Rubio .
One Right 2 Rise advertisement depicted Rubio as a weathervane , blowing with the political wind on the issue of immigration .
Another flashier spot , unveiled after Rubio was photographed wearing a pair of high - heeled boots in New Hampshire , was even more belittling .
â€œOne of these dayâ€ ™ s young Marcoâ€ ™ s gon na flip , flop , upon you , â€ � a voice in the ad sang to the tune of Nancy Sinatraâ€ ™
s
These Boots Are Made For Walkinâ€ ™ , as a pair of boots danced about and the senatorâ€ ™ s varying positions were plastered across the screen .
All told , Rubio has been the target of at least $ 20 m in attack ads
â€ “ more than any other Republican seeking the nomination .
By competing in overlapping lanes , seeking to offer something to every type of voter , he is similarly seen as a threat to every type of opponent .
â€œIn many ways , itâ€ ™ s an affirmation of what Iâ€ ™ ve been saying , and that is , you donâ€ ™ t attack a candidate who is not just credible but doesnâ€ ™ t have momentum , â€ �
Rubio told Fox News on Sunday .
â€œYou only spend it if you feel someone is a threat.â€ �
In Iowa , where the evangelical Christian vote is ardently chased , Rubio emphasizes traditional values and his faith , after spending much of last year staying away from social issues unless asked .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re labeled a bigot or a hater if you believe in traditional marriage .
Youâ€ ™ re waging a war on women if you believe in protecting the unborn , â€ � he says , while lamenting how hard it is for him and his wife to raise their four young children at a time
when Hollywood and the media are â€œramming liberal values down our throatâ€ � .
Television ads airing across Iowa feature Rubio sitting in an interview - like setting , detailing his commitment to his Christian faith against a soundtrack of rising strings and piano .
â€œOur goal is eternity , the ability to live alongside our creator and for all time , to accept the free gift of salvation offered to us by Jesus Christ , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œThe purpose of our life is to cooperate with Godâ€ ™ s plan .
To those who much has been given , much is expected , and we will be asked to account for that , â€ �
he said , alluding to the biblical parable of the faithful servant .
â€œWere
your treasures stored up on earth or in heaven ?
â€ “ and to me I try to allow that to influence me in everything that I do.â€ �
In another , he emphatically defends his pro - life stance â€œnot as a political issue , but as a human rights issueâ€ � .
Such excerpts play well with the Iowa evangelicals who constitute the majority of Republican caucus - goers in the state .
Nearly 60 % of those who caucused in Iowa in the last presidential contest identified themselves as evangelical or â€œborn - againâ€ � .
But outside of the confines of the party , an overt emphasis on faith is more likely to draw pause â€ “ as it did from one voter who confronted Rubio during a town hall in Waverly , the small city north - east of Des Moines which is home to NestlÃ
© â€ ™ s powdered drinks plant .
Justin Scott , an atheist , stood up .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s talk in our community of you running as pastor - in - chief and not commander - in - chief , â€ � Scott said , adding that atheists like himself were seeking a candidate â€œthat will uphold their rights as Americans , and not pander to a certain religious groupâ€ � .
Rubio was unfazed .
â€œYou have a right to believe whatever you want , â€ � he replied .
â€œNo oneâ€ ™ s going to force you to believe in God .
But no oneâ€ ™ s going to force me to stop talking about God.â€ �
â€œNo oneâ€ ™ s going to take away my right , and your right to live out the teachings of your faith
â€ “ no one , â€ � he added , gesturing to the crowd .
â€œYou shouldnâ€ ™ t be worried about my faith influencing me .
You should hope that my faith influences me.â€ �
The room erupted into applause , with some rising to their feet .
A video of the exchange spread rapidly across the internet and was readily shared by Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign , which couldnâ€ ™ t have planned for a better moment with precious time remaining before the caucuses .
Bob Klaus , a salesman , was so impressed by the video that he came to see Rubio in Cedar Rapids a week later and approached the senator to speak at a prayer breakfast he has organized annually on Good Friday for 13 years .
â€œI thought he handled it really well , because he didnâ€ ™ t belittle the guy , â€ � Klaus said .
â€œIn fact , he made a good case for why the guy should really be for Rubio because he doesnâ€
™ t discriminate against any one group.â€ �
By contrast , Klaus noted , that Cruz came off as â€œa little divisiveâ€ � when discussing similar themes .
â€œItâ€ ™ s his way or the highway .
I donâ€
™ t think he can get elected being like that.â€ �
Scott , the atheist voter , indicated that Rubioâ€ ™ s vigor on the subject of faith might still pose hurdles down the line in a general election .
â€œHe
didnâ€
™ t actually address my question about : are you running for commander - in - chief or are you running for pastor - in - chief?â€ � Scott said .
â€œHis TV ads donâ€
™ t talk about the issues , they talk about his belief system and how that guides everything heâ€
™ s going to do as president .
Heâ€ ™ s pandering to the religious right just like a lot of them.â€
�
Asked by the Guardian at a recent campaign stop if he was running the risk of turning off voters in a general election â€ “ where in recent cycles single women and young voters have moved away from the Republican partyâ€ ™ s conservative stance on abortion and gay marriage
â€ “ Rubio expressed confidence in his positioning .
â€œPeople have a right to believe and support anything they want .
This is a free country and most certainly a republic where people can express themselves at the ballot box , â€ � he said .
â€œMy argument is that people that hold traditional values should not continue to be
stigmatized.â€ �
â€¢â€¢â€¢ Rubio returned to Iowa nine days before the caucuses with no plans to leave until their conclusion .
He never seems to publicly stop for food himself â€ “ powered apparently by coffee and Red Bull â€
“ but on one blustery day he broke off to buy pizzas and deliver them to college kids camping out overnight to buy basketball tickets .
Cars filled the parking lot and nearby snow - covered streets , as at least 300 potential caucus - goers packed two stories of a small liberal arts college in Indianola to take in Rubioâ€ ™ s final pitch .
As the senator told it , the choice before them was one of electability .
He continued to exude frustration , only this time Rubio concluded there must be more to it .
â€œI am angry , and you should be too , â€ �
he said .
â€œBut being angry about the direction of our country by itself will not be enough .
We also have to have someone for president who knows exactly what theyâ€ ™ re going to do when they get there.â€ �
â€œFrustration is a motivator -- it is not an action , it is not a solution , â€ � Rubio added .
He had just earned the endorsement of Iowaâ€ ™ s largest newspaper , the Des Moines Register .
During his speech , another paper â€ “ the Sioux City Journal , concentrated in one of the stateâ€ ™ s more conservative pockets â€ “ also gave the Florida senator its approval as the most formidable opponent to Hillary Clinton .
The Register focused its decision on the attributes some Republicans have long seen in Rubio : â€œA new direction â€ ¦ his partyâ€ ™ s best hope â€ ¦ eloquent.â€ �
But the editorial board identified some lingering concerns , among them that Rubio , of late , â€œhas pandered to rising pessimism in his partyâ€ � .
â€œHe wants to fight the battles of the past , such as the supreme courtâ€ ™ s same - sex marriage ruling , â€ � the board wrote , adding to its assessment a mention of Rubioâ€ ™ s complicated relationship with immigration reform .
While undeniably a boost for Rubio , at just the right time , such questions serve to highlight the trade - off between rhetoric that offers short - term gain but could cost a candidate the broader appeal necessary to win in November .
Rubio disagreed with observations that his tone has meaningfully changed when asked by the Guardian if he was no longer the sunny optimist in the race .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve always been realistic about the challenges before our country and
theyâ€ ™ re significant â€ “ this president has done great damage that needs to be confronted ,
â€ �
he said before a campaign event in Coralville , a suburb alongside the Iowa river .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s
no ignoring people are frustrated with the direction of our country â€ ¦ and when Iâ€ ™ m president weâ€ ™ re going to turn this country around.â€ �
Rubio started with a joke about the weather , but he soon spelled out in grave detail what he sees as the single issue that can separate him from his competitors : national security .
With terrorism concerns on the rise , national security has emerged as the top priority of Republican primary voters .
And it is on this topic that Rubio , who says his foreign policy experience is unmatched in the field , is at his most aggressive .
Dubbing the fight against the Islamic State a â€œcivilizational struggleâ€ � , he invokes the militant groupâ€ ™ s beheadings , burning of people in cages and apocalyptic worldview .
â€œEither they win or we win , â€ �
he says .
At one stop in Sioux City , Rubio said he had bought a gun on Christmas Eve believing it might be the â€œlast line of defenseâ€ � between Isis and his family .
And as the cloud of immigration reform continues to loom over him
â€
“
he was once the poster boy for comprehensive reform
â€ “ Rubio now argues that the issue is inextricably tied to terrorism .
â€œOur Number One priority must now become ensuring that Isis can not get killers into the United States , â€ � he told voters at a town hall in one of the most conservative pockets of Iowa .
â€œSo whether itâ€ ™ s green cards or any other form of entry into America , when Iâ€ ™ m president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming , you are not going to get into the United States of America.â€
�
Rubioâ€ ™ s opponents have seized on his work on a comprehensive immigration bill in 2013 , which included a pathway to citizenship that most Republican primary voters view as â€œamnestyâ€ � .
And the attacks are working , as evidenced by a woman who asked Rubio at a town hall in Oskaloosa on Tuesday to clarify his immigration stance
â€ “ citing an ad that invoked his Senate bill .
The senator countered forcefully , insisting he was â€œnot for amnestyâ€ � .
â€œAnd as the son of immigrants , I feel like I have the authority to say that enforcing our immigration laws is not anti - immigrant .
Itâ€ ™ s not , â€ � Rubio said .
Moments later , he made his closing pitch to the room of Iowans who had taken time from a weekday morning to weigh his candidacy .
â€œNo one has a conservative record thatâ€ ™ s more conservative than mine â€
“ look it up , â€ � Rubio said , adding that he was the only candidate in the race who could run on Republican principles while still defeating Hillary Clinton .
â€œIâ€ ™ m taking the conservative message to people that havenâ€ ™ t
voted for us before , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œWhen Iâ€ ™ m president , I will be president for all Americans , including the people who donâ€ ™ t vote for me , including the people who say nasty things about me on Twitter , including the people who made fun of my boots .
Iâ€ ™ m going to cut their taxes , too.â€ �"
2016-01-28,"With days remaining before the Iowa caucuses , Marco Rubio is framing the choice before voters as boiling down to one thing : defeating Hillary Clinton .
In a new television ad , shared first with the Guardian , Rubio focuses his closing argument on the need for change in the White House after two terms of Barack Obama .
â€œAmerica is exceptional .
Every generation before us met the great challenges of their time .
But after seven long years of this president , we feel our country slipping away , â€ � Rubio says , speaking straight to the camera .
â€œThis election is about defeating Hillary Clinton and about saving what makes America unique .
Iâ€ ™ m Marco Rubio .
I approved this message and I am asking for your vote so we can leave our children what our parents left us : the single greatest nation in all mankind.â€ �
The ad will begin airing across Iowa on Thursday , five days before the state holds the first nominating contest in the 2016 presidential primaries .
Rubio is currently polling in third in Iowa behind Donald Trump and Texas senator Ted Cruz , and is widely regarded as the most likely candidate to break through as an alternative who would be palatable to both conservatives and the establishment .
The Florida senator has been traveling across Iowa since Saturday , honing in on electability as he makes his final pitch to voters .
Several polls have shown Rubio as the more formidable Republican opponent to Clinton .
He also earned the endorsement this week from two local newspapers , the Sioux City Journal and the Des Moines Register , the latter the stateâ€ ™ s largest .
Editorial boards in both papers wrote that a Rubio - Clinton match - up would be best for the country .
â€œIf you nominate me , we wonâ€ ™ t just unify the Republican party , we will grow the conservative movement , â€ �
Rubio has said at a series of town halls and rallies this week .
â€œIâ€ ™ m taking the conservative message to people that havenâ€ ™ t
voted for us
before.â€ �
â€œWe can not lose this election , â€ � he has added .
â€œIf Hillary Clinton is elected president of the United States , the consequences will be extraordinary.â€ �
Rallying supporters at a pub in West Des Moines on Wednesday , on the eve of the next Republican debate , Rubio also took aim at Trump and Cruz for engaging in â€œtheatricsâ€ � .
â€œInteresting sideshow , â€ � Rubio said before a crowd of roughly 300 .
â€œBut this is not a sideshow .
This is serious .
â€œAll that makes for good television .
But thatâ€ ™ s not going to solve our problems.â€ �"
2016-01-29,"Floridaâ€ ™ s
leading candidates for the Republican presidential nomination , Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush , have both criticized federal action to combat climate change , with Rubio warning it would â€œdestroyâ€ � the US economy and Bush predicting â€œsomeone in a garage somewhereâ€ � will solve the problem instead .
Responding to a rare question about climate change in Thursdayâ€ ™ s Republican debate in Des Moines , Iowa , Rubio denied that he ever supported a â€œcap and tradeâ€ � system to lower emissions , despite his having called it â€œinevitableâ€ � in 2008 .
â€œI have never supported cap - and - trade and I never thought it was a good idea ,
â€ � the Florida senator said .
â€œAnd I do not believe itâ€ ™ s a good idea now .
I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment .
â€œAnd especially what these programs are asking us to pass â€ ¦ will do nothing to help the environment , but will be devastating for our economy .
When I am president of the United States of America , there will never be any â€˜cap and tradeâ€ ™ in the United States.â€

On the campaign trail in Iowa this week , Rubio said policies being implemented by Barack Obama will harm the economy and cost â€œhundreds of thousands of jobsâ€ � .
Obamaâ€ ™ s initial cap and trade plan was blocked by Congress .
Instead , the Environmental Protection Agency will impose greenhouse gas limits on power plants , allowing a form of emissions trading between the states .
Obamaâ€ ™ s administration has pledged to cut US greenhouse emissions from all sectors by up to 28 % below 2005 levels by 2025 .
Research released this week by scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( Noaa ) and the University of Colorado Boulder found that the US could slash emissions much further , cutting them by up to 78 % below 1990 levels within 15 years , while meeting increased demand .
These cuts , the Nature Climate Change study states , could be achieved â€œwithout an increase in the levelized cost of electricityâ€ � .
It would be undertaken via a shift to a national energy system using existing renewable sources such as solar and wind and deploying the latest electricity storage technology .
Bush , once governor of Florida , has said he supports federal government support for â€œbasic researchâ€ � into low - carbon energy but , like Rubio , places his faith in the free market to deal with rising temperatures and the extreme weather events , drought and sea level rise they bring .
â€œWhat we shouldnâ€ ™ t try to do is pick winners and losers through the federal government , â€ �
he said at a gathering in New Hampshire on Saturday , in a newly emerged video .
â€œThe market will work faster .
Thereâ€ ™ s someone in a garage somewhere
, parochially I hope itâ€
™ s in Miami , thatâ€ ™ s going to have a clue , to have an answer to this .
â€œThere are people well - intended on climate change but they need to be careful to not paint the apocalypse .
Because we are not there .
But we should be adapting.â€
�
Bush said he doubted sea level predictions for south Florida but , if they did come true , he has told his wife that they should move house .
Last week , a group of 15 mayors in Florida , including Tomas Regalado , the mayor of Miami , wrote to Rubio to call upon him to â€œacknowledge the reality and urgency of climate change and to address the upcoming crisis it presents our communitiesâ€ � .
The letter states that sea levels rose by around 8 in off the coast of south Florida during the 20th century and that a further rise of 1 ft by 2050 will wipe out about $ 4bn of Florida real estate .
Florida is considered particularly vulnerable to sea level rises as it is low - lying and sits in parts on a base of limestone , which causes excess water to seep underground and inundate areas .
Salt water intrusion is also a concern for the Everglades and the many species that rely upon the wetland ecosystem .
The League of Conservation Voters , which is backing Hillary Clinton , said Rubio had a â€œweak relationship with the factsâ€ � on the economic impact of tackling climate change .
â€œIn 2016 , the American people are making it increasingly clear they have little tolerance for candidates who willfully ignore the facts of climate change , â€ � said Seth Stein , a spokesman for the lobby group .
â€œThe other news networks should follow Fox Newsâ€ ™ lead , and finally ask the Republican candidates a question on climate change.â€ � Adam Beitman , a spokesman for environment group the Sierra Club , said : â€œRubioâ€ ™ s views on climate action have gotten more dangerous as the threat to his home town has gotten more severe and the Koch brothersâ€ ™ influence on his positions has gotten more pronounced.â€
�
Beitman said Bushâ€ ™ s comments showed that Republicans were paying â€œlip
serviceâ€
� to action on climate change while opposing serious solutions to it .
â€œWhen your plan is to wait around and hope that someone in their garage fixes the climate crisis , itâ€ ™ s clear youâ€ ™ re not taking the issue seriously at all â€ “ especially while seas are rising around your home state.â€ �
Last year was the hottest year on record , according to Noaa and Nasa , beating the record set in 2014 by a â€œwide marginâ€ � .
Of the 15 hottest years in the 150-year - old temperature record , 13 have occurred since 2000 ."
2016-01-29,"The seventh Republican presidential debate â€ “ and the first without Donald Trump , who decided to hold an event of his own elsewhere in Des Moines , Iowa â€ “ is in the can .
Hereâ€ ™ s what we learned : The knives were out for Texas senator Ted Cruz , who is polling second behind Trump in Iowa .
Florida senator Marco Rubio said Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign was built on a â€œlieâ€ � of shifting positions for votes .
It was a substantive debate .
Body cameras for police , Libya , Iran , Kim Davis , mental illness , Bridgegate , immigration , Isis , Obamacare , veteransâ€ ™ affairs , Bill Clintonâ€ ™ s affairs â€
“
it was all in there .
Speaking of shifting positions , the moderators strived to pin Cruz and Rubio down on immigration , using video medleys of their most blatant calls for a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants to prove that they had in the past supported a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants .
The pair waffled .
The absent Trump came under early attack .
â€œIâ€ ™ m a maniac , and everyone on this stage is stupid , fat and ugly , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œAnd Ben , youâ€ ™ re a terrible surgeon .
And now that weâ€ ™ ve got the Donald Trump portion out of the way ...
â€ �
For multiple candidates it was their peppiest outing yet .
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush was notably animated , accusing Rubio of having â€œcut and runâ€ � on immigration .
Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson produced the memorable line : â€œPutin is a one - horse country : oil and energy.â€ �
The crowd seemed against Cruz , booing him when he tried to wrest more time from the moderators .
The candidates , especially New Jersey governor Chris Christie , attacked Clinton .
Rubio said : â€œHillary does not want to run against me , but I can not wait to run against her.â€ �
Kentucky senator Rand Paul took a stand against government surveillance .
â€œThe bulk collection of your phone data ... did not stop one terrorist attack , â€ � he said .
A dutiful John Kasich explained how his experience as Ohio governor would help him deal with everything from the Flint , Michigan , water crisis to health care reform to the challenge of cyber warfare .

2016-01-31,"As polling day looms and the cameras turn only toward the contenders to win the Iowa caucuses , at least some around nation canâ€ ™ t help but wonder : what happened to the other guys ?
On the final weekend before the Iowa caucuses , the presidential candidates straggling behind the leaders â€ “ Donald Trump , Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio for the Republicans , Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders for the Democrats â€ “ carried on with brave faces , despite sinking poll numbers and ambivalent voters .
Underdog candidates could , however , have an outsize effect on the campaign : their supporters represent the spread between the leaders .
Sway voters who prefer a third- ( or fourth- or fifth- ) tier contender could bring another candidate closer to the nomination .
For example supporters of the third Democratic candidate , Martin Oâ€ ™ Malley , polling at 3 % in Iowa could ultimately sway the race on Monday .
According to caucus rules , a candidate must have support from 15 % of caucus - goers in any given precinct to reach â€œviabilityâ€ � .
If too few voters support a candidate , they are free to support another .
Both the Clinton and Sanders camps have sought to win over Oâ€ ™ Malley backers .
Nonetheless , on Saturday in Boone , Iowa , the former governor of Maryland told supporters not to waver .
â€œHold strong in that first alignment , â€ � he said .
â€œWe have to beat expectations .
Iâ€ ™ m hoping and working to make my campaign the surprise that comes out of Iowa.â€

Touring the state he won eight years ago , meanwhile , Republican Mike Huckabee projected the aura of a tired heritage act as he spoke to Iowans in small - town clubs and bars .
One part preacher to two parts standup guy , the former Arkansas governor charmed the room at the Inspired Grounds coffee shop in West Des Moines .
But after visiting all 99 counties these past eight months , he is nowhere in the polls .
â€œIâ€ ™ m going to be glad
, â€ � he told the gathering , â€œwhen we finally actually base this whole election on votes rather than some east coast pollster who has never spent a night in Iowa , and doesnâ€ ™ t have a clue about voters who are going to be going to the caucuses.â€ �
In the age of Instagram and viral videos , Huckabee spoke up for â€œthe old - fashioned wayâ€ � of electioneering .
â€œHard work and handshakesâ€ �
, he said are the real way to pass your audition for a job at the White House .
There was no policy pitch , except for a moment to hymn the value of lawmaking experience and warn of the danger of appointing as president another untried freshman senator â€ “ a swipe at Ted Cruz , Marco Rubio and Rand Paul .
Outside , Gary Leffler , a resident and Huckabee supporter , said the former governor is â€œa man of faith , a man of Godâ€ � , and that â€œyou have to vote on principle and Iâ€ ™ m a principled manâ€ � .
Asked about the long odds of his preferred candidate , Leffler said he would at least vote Republican no matter what .
Huckabeeâ€ ™ s
rival Ben Carson , a retired neurosurgeon whose support in the state peaked at 25 % but has now dropped to 10 % , pledged to voters that he would defy the odds .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re seeing a lot of movement on the ground , thereâ€ ™ s a lot of shifting going on right now , â€ �
Carson told the Detroit News on Friday , in south - east Iowa .
â€œIt almost feels like an earthquake .
And I think a lot of it is shifting in our favor .
So weâ€ ™ re actually looking forward to a very good night , which would be quite surprising , I think , to a lot of pundits.â€ �
Another one - time frontrunner , former Florida governor Jeb Bush , has seen his numbers steadily decline to the point that he found 2 % support in the Register poll â€ “ neck - and - neck with â€œundecidedâ€ � .
In recent days Bush has traveled with his wife Columba and daughter Noelle .
Next month , they will be joined in New Hampshire by their four grandchildren and former president George W Bush .
In Sioux City , he told reporters : â€œThis is a family deal , especially when you get to the beginning of the end.â€ �
Chris Christie , the governor of New Jersey , made the rounds in Iowa , with a stop at the Chrome Horse Saloon in Cedar Rapids .
â€œWhen
you see me in a place like this ,
â€ �
he told the crowd , â€œI become smarter and more charming and better looking and funny .
By the time you walk out of here , you are going to be , â€˜Damn , man , that guy should be emperor.â€ ™ â€ � Christie , the Financial Times reported , cautioned the crowd against supporting Trump , the Republican frontrunner .
â€œShowtime is over , â€ � he said .
â€œWe are not electing the entertainer - in - chief , everybody
â€
¦ we are electing the commander - in - chief .
This isnâ€ ™ t a game .
This isnâ€ ™ t a TV show .
This is the real world.â€ � Carly Fiorina , too , has walked a long road in Iowa , pushing her program to â€œtake our government backâ€ � .
In Mason City , USA Today reported , the former Hewlett - Packard CEO tried to explain her concept of zero - based budgeting .
â€œIt means you can examine any dollar , you can cut any dollar and you can move any dollar .
All the government does now is discuss the rate of increase.â€ �
Senator Rand Paul , too , predicted he will surprise in Mondayâ€ ™ s caucus , arguing that polls are skewed toward older voters , not the younger voters who rally to his pro - liberty positions .
He told NBC on Sunday that his campaign has called â€œa millionâ€ � Iowans : â€œI think weâ€ ™ ve called them so much we know them by name by now.â€ �
And Ohio governor John Kasich , recently endorsed by the New York Times as their editorial boardâ€ ™ s Republican of choice , gave up on Iowa almost completely .
He campaigned in New Hampshire , accompanied by a guitarist , and said he was â€œthrilledâ€ � by the newspaperâ€ ™ s endorsement .
â€œIt really illustrates for a lot of people that Kasichâ€ ™ s a conservative but he has wide appeal , â€ � Kasich told reporters .

2016-02-01,"Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz , the two Republican candidates each vying to prove themselves the most viable alternative to Donald Trump , have been locked in a heated battle over immigration in the run - up to the Iowa caucuses on Monday night .
Speaking to the Guardian as voting in the key state was about to begin , Rubio maintained that his record on immigration had been clear whereas Cruz , he said , had misled the American public .
â€œTed Cruz presents and portrays himself as this purist whoâ€ ™ s never supported anything that even comes close to legalization [ for undocumented immigrants ] when in fact he did
, â€ � the Florida senator said after a town hall in Cedar Rapids on Sunday .
â€œHe helped design George W Bushâ€ ™ s legalization policy as a candidate , he openly and repeatedly talked about reaching a compromise on people that are here illegally â€
¦
He said he wanted to see immigration reform pass , he wanted to see people come out of the shadows .
And now heâ€ ™ s pretending that that never happened and it did .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not about immigration .
Itâ€ ™ s about the calculation that he thinks he can say and do anything and people arenâ€ ™ t going to notice , â€ � Rubio said .
Rubio did not enter the final stretch of the Iowa caucus at the top of the polls , but nonetheless his rivals felt sufficiently threatened to spend at least $ 20 m on ads attacking him â€ “ largely focused on his record on immigration .
At present he stands third in polling behind Cruz and frontrunner Donald Trump in Iowa , and third in the national Republican race .
Cruzâ€ ™ s closing argument across Iowa drew heavily on Rubioâ€ ™ s support in 2013 for a comprehensive bill to make the case that â€œa vote for Marco Rubio is a vote for amnestyâ€ � .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve been clear , â€ �
Rubio told the Guardian .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t think we can fix this comprehensively , Iâ€ ™ ve been very clear about that .
That was tried .
It failed , for good reason , because Americans donâ€ ™ t trust the federal government and weâ€ ™ re going to have to do this in stages beginning with enforcement.â€ � Immigration has been at the forefront of the Republican primary , spurred by a grassroots anger that has helped send Trump and Cruz to the top of the polls .
The Texas senator has adopted an especially hardline position , shifting his stance on work permits for foreign workers and birthright citizenship .
While he maintains he never supported legalization for undocumented immigrants , and was simply using procedural tactics to derail Rubioâ€ ™ s bill in 2013 , it was not until December that Cruz explicitly ruled out providing the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US with a path to legal status .
In last weekâ€ ™ s Republican debate , Cruz sought to once more shift the focus back toward Rubioâ€ ™ s prior efforts to pass comprehensive immigration reform .
He was joined , somewhat unexpectedly , by former Florida governor Jeb Bush â€ “ who charged that Rubio â€œcut and ranâ€ � from his own bill when faced with resistance from conservatives .
Asked by the Guardian to respond to the criticism , Rubio said his legislation â€ “ known as the â€œGang of Eightâ€ � after the bipartisan group of senators who worked on it
â€ “ was no longer relevant .
â€œThe bill has no chance of passing .
There is no support for a path that does not first involve bringing illegal immigration under control .
Period , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œAnyone who continues to insist , like Jeb does , that it needs to be done comprehensively and through one massive piece of legislation is not being realistic .
Theyâ€ ™ re not being serious about it .
â€œThere is no way to solve this issue until first we bring illegal immigration under control and prove to the American people that itâ€ ™ s under control , â€ � he added .
Voters have nonetheless taken notice of the barrage of attack ads against Rubio , particularly some that recycle clips of him advocating a path to citizenship during the 2013 debate .
At town halls here over the past week , there were several instances in which potential caucus - goers said they were confused about where , precisely , he now stood on so - called â€œamnestyâ€ � .
Rubio pushed back emphatically , insisting he has never been , and will never be , for â€œblanket amnestyâ€ � .
He also drew on his roots , as the son of Cuban immigrants and from a predominantly immigrant community in West Miami , to cast himself as speaking with particular authority on the issue .
â€œAs the son and grandson of immigrants , I can say that enforcing immigration laws is not
anti - immigrant , â€ �
he told the hundreds who packed his town halls and rallies throughout Iowa .
As for his current position , Rubio has said he continues to support eventually providing green cards to law - abiding undocumented immigrants â€ “ only after the border is secure , legal immigration is reformed , and after they first receive work permits for 10 years .
He has also reframed the immigration debate as one of national security , pointing to the threat posed by the Islamic State and the potential infiltration of terrorists across US borders .
As president , Rubio told the Guardian , his plan for undocumented immigrants would be shaped by the will of the American public , a debate he emphasized would only occur once illegal immigration was under control .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think the American people are going to support anything until border security is first in place .
After that , weâ€ ™ ll see what people are willing to support , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve outlined a way forward .
Weâ€ ™ ll see if people support it .
Weâ€ ™ re not going to force it on them.â€ �"
2016-02-01,"In the 2016 Republican presidential candidate debates , climate change has rarely been discussed .
In last Thursdayâ€ ™ s debate , the last before tonightâ€ ™ s Iowa caucus votes , on Fox News of all networks , there was one brief climate question directed at Senator Marco Rubio ( R - FL ) .
Unfortunately it was framed as a â€˜gotcha , flip - flopâ€ ™ question , with Rubio asked about his apparent support 8 years ago for a carbon cap and trade system in Florida , versus his current opposition to the concept .
Rubio responded : I have never supported cap and trade and I never thought it was a good idea .
And I was clear about that at the time .
And I do not believe itâ€ ™ s a good idea now .
I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment .
And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment , but will be devastating for our economy .
When I am president of the United States of America , there will never be any cap - and - trade in the United States .
In another debate 4 months ago on CNN , Rubio made similar comments , adding : Americaâ€ ™ s a lot of things , the greatest country in the world , but America is not a planet .
And we are not even the largest carbon producer anymore , China is , and they are drilling a hole anywhere in the world that they can get ahold of .
Fact checking Marco Rubio Politifact ruled it â€œmostly trueâ€ � that Rubio never supported cap and trade .
However , the rest of his comments are mostly false .
First , â€œblame Chinaâ€ � is no longer a viable option .
Despite having much lower cumulative historical carbon emissions than the USA , China has agreed to take serious action to curb its coal consumption and carbon pollution , and has announced that it will launch the worldâ€ ™ s largest carbon cap and trade system .
Using China to oppose an American carbon cap and trade system simply doesnâ€ ™ t make sense .
Second , the â€œour pollution is too small to matterâ€ � argument is known as the Tragedy of the Commons fallacy .
If the USA can make that argument , then so can every country .
If every country uses this excuse , then none cut their carbon pollution , and climate destabilization becomes inevitable .
The good news is that the opposite is already happening .
Virtually every country in the world agreed to cut carbon pollution as a result of the Paris climate negotiations , including the United States and China .
Third , there are already cap and trade systems in place in the United States .
The George H.W. Bush administration invented the concept of cap and trade to tackle the problem of acid rain with an economically optimal , free market approach .
Under that cap and trade system , emissions of the pollutants that were causing acid rain were cut more quickly and cheaply than expected , and the estimated economic benefits have outweighed the costs of the system 40-to-1 .
California and a collaboration of nine northeastern states also already have successful carbon cap and trade systems in place .
In order to comply with proposed EPA carbon regulations , many more states are likely to implement carbon cap and trade systems , or join these existing networks .
Fourth , as these successful existing cap and trade systems demonstrate , the concept hasnâ€ ™ t been devastating for the economy .
Quite the opposite â€ “
the economies of the nine northeastern states , which implemented their regional cap and trade system in 2008 , and of California , where it was introduced in 2013 , have fared better than the national average .
There is also a consensus among economic experts that we should cut carbon pollution , with most favoring a cap and trade system or carbon tax .
In fact , in a March 2007 speech , Rubio wisely argued that Florida should take advantage of the economic opportunities created by this type of free market solution .
This nation , and ultimately the world , is headed towards emission caps and energy diversification .
Those changes will require technological advances that make those measures cost effective .
The demand toward such advances will create an industry to meet itâ€”Florida should become the Silicon Valley of that industry .
Unfortunately there was no more debate about optimal climate policies last Thursday .
Rubio rejected the possibility of a carbon cap and trade system , and the moderators moved on to another topic .
However , the other Republican presidential candidates would likely have answered in a similar fashion .
Governor Chris Christie pulled New Jersey out of the northeastern states carbon cap and trade system , Ted Cruz denies that the Earth is even warming , many of the candidates are science deniers , and the only Republican candidates who think we should take action to curb global warming ( Lindsey Graham and George Pataki ) have dropped out of the race .
Ideology vs. Reality Climate change has sadly turned into an ideological litmus test .
Republican candidates fear that if they admit human - caused global warming is a problem that we need to solve , they wonâ€ ™ t be able to win their partyâ€ ™ s nomination .
As Graham and Patakiâ€ ™ s candidacies showed , that may be true .
However , a growing number of Republican thought leaders and even a majority of Republican voters support a revenue - neutral carbon tax .
The problem is that while they represent a majority of the party , the conservative right wing of the party that imposes ideological purity tests dominates the primary election voting .
This may be a flaw in the American political system , since the Republican Party now stands alone as the only climate - denying major political party in the world , and a candidate who can pass the right wing ideological purity test is unlikely to win a nationwide general election .
Itâ€ ™ s a problem that the Republican Party must solve , because we need them to participate in the climate policy debate .
Their candidatesâ€ ™ current strategy of denying the consensus of climate science and economics experts just wonâ€
™ t cut it when the entire world is moving forward with efforts to solve the problem , taking advantage of the resulting economic opportunities that Rubio recognized eight years ago ."
2016-02-01,"They have bloviated about carpet bombing , bickered about walls , and waxed anti - Muslim and -migrant , but over more than 16 hours of debate , the Republican candidates for president have almost entirely ignored what most of the world fears most : the rising tides and temperatures of climate change .
Last week , Fox News moderators asked only one question relevant to climate change , about whether Florida senator Marco Rubio would support regulation to lower emissions .
Rubio said he would not : â€œI do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.â€
�
On the trail , former Florida governor Jeb Bush interjected to say the free market would resolve climate change before government could .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s someone in a garage somewhere
, â€ � he said , â€œparochially I hope itâ€ ™ s in Miami , thatâ€ ™ s going to have a clue , to have an answer to this.â€ �
Miami will settle for anyone doing something â€ “ so long as itâ€ ™ s before environmental changes driven by humans destroy the cityâ€ ™ s economy .
Late last week , Mayor TomÃ¡s Regalado joined 14 other south Florida mayors in signing an open letter to Rubio , asking him to give up his opposition to climate change action .
The low - lying city and its nearby resorts and islands suffer near annual floods from rising sea levels , costing the city hundreds of millions .
The mayors warned that a 1 ft increase in sea level could â€œwipe out as much as $ 4bnâ€ � in real estate , and 3 ft could cost $ 31bn and swallow large sections of the Florida Keys and greater Miami area .
â€œWe need a realistic national plan to slow global warming emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change , â€ � the mayors wrote .
â€œThe science is well established : protecting the long - term future of our cities must include preventing global temperatures from rising.â€ �
One of the signatories , South Miami mayor Philip Stoddard , was more blunt a few years before Rubioâ€ ™ s presidential bid .
â€œRubio is an idiot , â€ �
he told the Guardian at the time .
â€œHe says he is not a scientist so he doesnâ€ ™ t have a view about climate change and sea - level rise and so wonâ€
™ t do anything about it.â€ �
Rubioâ€ ™ s professed ignorance has shifted to skepticism â€ “ a sign that many Republicans have reluctantly accepted that the issue exists for voters , if not that the issue matters .
Last year , Rubio and two of his rivals , senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul , agreed in a symbolic vote that climate change is â€œis real and not a hoaxâ€ � .
Of the three , only Paul voted to agree that human activity causes global warming .
None have agreed that climate change exacerbates threats to national security and the economy , although the point is agreed on by Pentagon officials , Nasa scientists , foreign policy experts , dozens of Republican and Democratic leaders , international researchers and the pope .
The candidates might be playing simple politics
â€ “ no one wants to be seen agreeing with Barack Obama or Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton , who called climate denial a â€œcharadeâ€ � on Sunday night â€ “
but they have also tried out several arguments to discredit the dangers and science of climate change .
What â€˜global warming alarmists donâ€ ™ t want to talk aboutâ€ ™ That not all data indicates constant warming is one of the preferred arguments of Ted Cruz , who held a Senate hearing last month titled Data or Dogma .
To testify , Cruz called a retired Princeton physicist who believes the planet needs more carbon dioxide ; a controversial climate scientist convinced of corruption in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) ; a climate scientist who insists basic models need reinvention ; and a Canadian jazz vocalist who frequents the Rush Limbaugh Show and recorded an album about cats .
With the help of his witnesses and RSS satellite data since 1998 , Cruz argued : â€œThere has been no significant global warming for the past 18 years.â€ �
But the senator chose a very specific set of data : an extraordinary El NiÃ±o set record temperatures in 1998 , and by the RSS metric global warming has slowed in the 18 years since .
The result was a chart that began with a peak and spanned not quite two decades of slow warming .
Carl Mears , the senior research scientist whose data Cruz used , told the Guardian that Cruz was guilty of the crime with which he charges scientists : presenting a very partial argument .
â€œHe ignores other time periods , and other types of data , â€ � said Mears , stressing surface temperatures â€œthat do not support his hypothesis .
He asserts that the satellite temperatures are more accurate than the surface temperature without providing any supporting evidence.â€ �
Despite his own work with satellite data sets , Mears said he suspects surface data sets are more accurate .
â€œI agree with Mr Cruz that policy should follow science and data ,
â€ � he said .
â€œBut it is important to follow all the data , not just the part that supports one side of the argument.â€
�
A partial picture Rubio has also spoken of the â€œhiatusâ€ � , which Mears and others are studying and which remains only part of the picture .
Last year was the hottest on record by far , smashing a record set only a year earlier .
A witness called by Democrats to Cruzâ€ ™ s Senate hearing , David Titley , a Penn State meteorologist and former navy admiral , rebuffed Cruz .
Titley noted that science by definition contains error and revision â€ “ demonstrated , for instance , by the corrections made to satellite data produced by his fellow witnesses .
He also showed a clear curve of rising temperatures and carbon dioxide levels since 1880 .
â€œThere are plenty of other signs that are far less equivocal , and perhaps even more relevant to those of us who live on the Earthâ€ ™ s surface , â€ �
he said .
â€œLand and ocean surface temperatures are increasing , sea ice is declining
, glaciers are shrinking , oceans are rising , the list goes on.â€ �
Cruz mentioned a ship that got stuck in ice around Antarctica , arguing that the polar ice caps are not melting .
Charles Bentley , an expert on Antarctica at the University of Wisconsin - Madison , told the Guardian that sea ice floats .
â€œIf someone says sea ice in the same sentence as related to sea level change , a red flag goes up.â€
� Bentley called the argument â€œa little bit misleadingâ€ � , because sea ice , although an indirect sign of change around the poles , â€œdoesnâ€ ™ t directly indicate anythingâ€ � .
Cruzâ€ ™ s argument also ignores the clear melting of ice and glaciers on and around the north pole , where Russia , Canada and the US are competing over newly open ocean .
â€˜Destroying the economyâ€ ™ Rubio and Cruz have both said they would pull the US out of the historic Paris climate accords , and with Bush and New Jersey governor Chris Christie said they oppose any measures that would â€œdestroyâ€ � the economy or stifle business .
Donald Trump , Bush and John Kasich have mocked the Paris summit as an unnecessary diversion .
If the US withdrew from the Paris deal , it would join North Korea , Syria , Libya and Venezuela among the handful of nations who refuse to sign .
The aversion to all regulation is a major departure from the policies of Republicans past .
Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency , Ronald Reaganâ€ ™ s staff invented the cap and trade system , George HW Bush signed the Clean Air Act and Teddy Roosevelt protected 230 m acres of land .
But the candidates have largely agreed with Rubio , who in a debate said : â€œWe are not going to destroy our economy , make America a harder place to create jobs , in order to pursue a policy that will do nothing , nothing to change our climate.â€ �
How climate change action might affect the economy depends on the measures involved ; most of those proposed affect the worst emissions producers , such as coal â€ “ an industry in decline in the US for decades .
In 2014 , about 67 % of electricity generated in the US was from fossil fuels , according to the EIA , though oil only accounted for 1 % .
The US natural gas industry faces more pressure from cheap Opec oil than investment in renewable energy .
But in 2011 , before the industry was rocked by low oil prices , the five main fossil fuel industries still accounted for less than 2 % of all US non - agricultural employment .
Doing nothing also has its consequences , as south Florida businesses have tried to remind Republicans .
By exacerbating flooding , water and energy crises and mass migration , climate change threatens to devastate the world economy â€ “ US gas industry included â€ “ according to a survey of 750 economists , conducted last year .
Economists at Stanford and UC Berkeley also published a study last year that found rising temperatures will likely exacerbate inequality ."
2016-02-01,"New Hampshire was supposed to be where Jeb Bush made his comeback .
Or where Chris Christie had his breakout moment .
Or where Marco Rubio solidified his momentum .
In the last few days , though , Governor John Kasich of Ohio has had New Hampshire all to himself .
The rest of the Republican field is in Iowa , in search of last - minute votes .
On Sunday , Kasich held his 85th and 86th town hall events in the eastern state .
â€œIâ€ ™ m a lot more interested in talking about what Iâ€ ™ m for than the people who are in the primary up here in New Hampshire , â€ �
Kasich said to dozens of voters who came out on a sunny winterâ€ ™ s day in Salem .
â€œI want to raise the bar .
I want us to regain hope in this country .
We can make this country work again.â€
�
The audience broke into applause .
While his opponents tap into voter frustration , preaching doom and gloom , Kasich is wooing moderate Republicans and independents at schools , churches , gymnasiums and community centers across the state with a decidedly sunny vision for the country .
It seems to be working .
A series of recent state polls have shown Kasichâ€ ™ s steady rise â€ “ and complicated path forward .
Most place him in a virtual tie for second place with three candidates : Bush , Rubio and Ted Cruz .
A realclearpolitics.com average of state polls confirms his second - place standing in New Hampshire , behind the longtime Republican frontrunner , Donald Trump .
In Bow on Sunday night , with a national debt clock ticking behind him , Kasich cast himself as a conservative , pointing to his record on fiscal issues in Congress and as governor of Ohio .
He also pitched himself as a man willing to work across the aisle .
He told the crowd he had a plan for ending gridlock in Congress .
Part of his initial 100-day plan in the White House would include obtaining the phone numbers of the parents of each member of Congress , so he could call them on their birthdays .
â€œThat way I can get them to say to their son or daughter , â€˜Hey , the president called me today , you better not cross him because I like him .
He wished me a happy birthday , â€ ™ â€ � Kasich said .
â€œYou laugh , but you know thatâ€ ™ s how it works.â€
�
With New Hampshire voters , Kasich deploys a mix of predictable humor
( â€œIâ€ ™ ve not had that many town halls yet .
This is only my 85th.â€ � ) and the folksy touch ( â€œHereâ€ ™ s the thing , kiddo.â€ � ) that seems to be paying off .
He has picked up endorsements from seven of the eight local newspaper editorial boards and on Saturday he won endorsements from the Boston Globe and the New York Times .
The latter paperâ€ ™ s editorial board called Kasich the â€œonly plausible choice for Republicansâ€ � .
Kasich said on Sunday he was â€œthrilledâ€ � to have won such high - profile endorsements .
â€œIt really illustrates for a lot of people that Kasichâ€ ™ s a conservative but he has wide appeal , â€ � he told reporters .
â€œHe can get people to come who traditionally donâ€ ™ t go .
And the last guy I can think of who could do that is Ronald Reagan.â€
�
In two campaign stops on Sunday , Kasich was asked about climate change , religious freedom , immigration , creationism and American exceptionalism .
In each case , he replied carefully â€ “ no doubt wary of attacks from his opponents that his views are too liberal and or inconsistent .
His answers were nonetheless decidedly , even confidently moderate .
â€œIf youâ€ ™ re in the cupcake business
and somebody comes in and wants cupcakes , sell them cupcakes , â€ � Kasich told a voter who was concerned about the erosion of religious liberties .
â€œThatâ€
™ s my feeling about that .
I wonâ€
™ t have an argument about who youâ€ ™ re selling the cupcake to , I just donâ€ ™ t agree with that.â€ �
When a first - time voter asked him why Republicans shy away from the topic of climate change , Kasich told him : â€œDo I believe that human beings affect the climate ?
I do .
But we donâ€ ™ t
quite know how much .
But that doesnâ€ ™ t mean that there arenâ€ ™ t things we need to do.â€ �
However , on abortion and defunding Planned Parenthood , the nationâ€ ™ s largest womenâ€ ™ s health organization , Kasich is staunchly conservative .
He has declared himself â€œpro - lifeâ€ � , except in cases of rape or incest or if a womanâ€ ™ s life is in danger .
New Hampshire and beyond On Monday , in the final hours
before Iowa voters go to the caucuses , Kasich was scheduled to hold three town hall meetings in New Hampshire .
He has mostly forsaken the race in Iowa , placing his best hopes in a state he hopes will power his campaign through the next few primaries and on to Super Tuesday and beyond .
Tom Rath , a senior adviser to the Kasich campaign , said the governorâ€ ™ s aim was to be â€œthe storyâ€ � coming out of the New Hampshire primary on 9 February .
A strong finish in New Hampshire , emerging as the clear establishment favorite , would position Kasich to compete for the blue and purple midwestern states , including his homestate of Ohio , Rath said .
But if Kasich does place favorably in New Hampshire , he will still face a long road ahead to the nomination .
Heâ€
™ ll have to clear the so - called â€œestablishmentâ€ � lane of the Republican contest , which he currently shares uncomfortably with Rubio , Christie and Bush .
Itâ€ ™ s also a lane voters seem to be turning away from in droves , borne out by the support for the anti - establishment , outsider candidacy of Trump .
Kasich , Rath said , stands a good chance of becoming the nominee if voters choose the path of least resistance rather than the road less traveled .
â€œThere are some people who are ideologically center - right .
I call them â€˜governing
conservativesâ€ ™ ,â€
�
Rath said , refusing to use the â€œestablishmentâ€ � label .
â€œThatâ€
™ s the lane
I think people fit him in and thatâ€ ™ s the lane
I think
heâ€ ™ s clearly gaining traction in .
â€œIf we color too far outside the lines and donâ€ ™ t get somebody in that lane , especially if Secretary Clintonâ€ ™ s on the other side , we run a big risk.â€ �
Stacey Gobron , one of the stateâ€ ™ s coveted undecided independent voters , said her husband , Bob , had brought her to the Kasich event in Salem .
She had been disappointed by the Republican partyâ€ ™ s frontrunners and was hoping to hear something different .
â€œI want low taxes like a Republican but Iâ€ ™ m also not so [ socially ] conservative , â€ �
Gobron said .
After hearing Kasich speak , Gobron said she believed she had found a candidate to support and was optimistic others like her would come around as well .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s so genuine and I feel thereâ€ ™ s an honesty about him , â€ � Gobron said .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s the opposite of Trump .
I really believe people are going to get tired of the show .
Eventually they will want the genuine.â€ �
But voters arenâ€ ™ t the only ones paying attention to Kasichâ€ ™ s quiet town hall meetings .
His steady climb in the New Hampshire polls has attracted the attention of at least three outside groups opposing him or supporting his opponents .
Those groups have attacked him with television and mail advertisements in New Hampshire and Iowa .
The Bush - supporting Super Pac Right to Rise targeted Kasich with New Hampshire mail advertisements over his decision to expand Medicare in Ohio and for his record on guns .
In mail sent to New Hampshire voters America Leads , a Super Pac supporting Christie , branded Kasich a tax - raiser .
Kasich called it â€œfantasticâ€ � that his opponents , particularly Bushâ€ ™ s well - financed allies , view him as a rival â€ “ especially in Iowa where he hasnâ€ ™ t been competitive .
â€œWell , they got like $ 110m , â€ � Kasich told reporters outside the event in Salem .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ ve spent $ 40 m or $ 50
m trying to sell Jeb in a positive way â€ “
that didnâ€ ™ t work .
So now heâ€ ™ s playing whack - a - mole .
And heâ€ ™ s just beating everybody that pops up .
â€œSo I was totally amused to find out that Iâ€ ™ ve spent $ 140,000 in Iowa and heâ€ ™
s spent $ 40 m and theyâ€ ™ re beating me up in Iowa .
Fantastic.â€
�
On Sunday evening in Bow , Kasich ended his fifth town hall of the weekend with a final pitch .
â€œCome on ,
â€ � he teased .
â€œGimme the vote , would ya?â€ �"
2016-02-02,"Two Cuban American senators representing the future of US conservatism are now locked in a battle to reshape the Republican primary and attempt to make history as the first Latino president of the US .
Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio , from Texas and Florida respectively , both defied expectations in the Iowa caucuses on Monday .
The two first - term senators , long viewed as rising stars within the GOP , had been jockeying for weeks to claim the mantle of the partyâ€ ™ s alternative to Donald Trump .
Their biographical similarities , although superficial , are nonetheless striking : both rode a Tea Party wave to the US Senate â€ “ Rubio in 2010 and Cruz in 2012 â€ “ often drawing on the inspirational tale of their immigrant parents to underscore the promise of America .
Both graduates of law and in their mid-40s , born only six months apart , they are also the youngest candidates in the race .
And while their attacks on each other may call it into question , there is little in their record to indicate that Rubio and Cruz are anything but staunchly conservative .
However , the parallels end there .
In their short tenure in elected office , Rubio and Cruz have played dramatically different roles both in Washington and the 2016 Republican primary .
Since arriving in the Senate in 2013 , Cruz quickly earned the reputation of a rabble rouser .
A conservative firebrand who boasts of â€œtaking on the Washington cartelâ€ �
, the Texan rose to national prominence by almost single - handedly leading the nation into its first government shutdown in 17 years .
He infamously decried Mitch McConnell â€ “ the leader of Senate Republicans â€ “ as â€œa liarâ€ � in a stunning breach of congressional decorum .
Such tactics have made Cruz arguably the most unpopular senator in either party , a tag he has worn as an asset in an election fuelled by frustration with Washington .
Needless to say , he has not been endorsed by any of his colleagues in the Senate â€ “ securing instead the support of the House GOPâ€ ™ s right wing .
In his quest for the Republican nomination , Cruz has united the partyâ€ ™ s evangelical and Tea Party wings and assembled support from a variety of influential figures on the right .
This , combined with a strong grassroots campaign that makes extensive use of technology , has led to some comparisons of the Texas senator with another young first - term senator , Barack Obama .
The similarities with Obama go deeper .
A fellow graduate of Harvard Law , Cruz clerked for supreme ourt chief justice William Rehnquist and argued a number of cases before the US supreme court as the solicitor general for the state of Texas .
And yet it is Rubio , 44 , who has drawn the most comparisons to Obama : a young senator in a hurry and a dynamic speaker pitching an optimistic message calling for a new generation of leadership .
He first ran for office at the age of 24 , setting off one of the more rapid ascensions in national political ranks in recent memory .
Elected to the Florida legislature in 1999 , Rubio went on to become both the stateâ€ ™ s youngest and first Cuban American speaker of the House .
Rubioâ€ ™ s unbridled ambition took him even further in 2010 , as he launched a long - shot bid for Floridaâ€ ™ s Senate seat against the will of the political establishment .
Charlie Crist , then the stateâ€ ™ s Republican governor , was the prime choice of party elders and national operatives .
But Rubio rose from polling at just 3 % to pull off an upset victory that made him an overnight star .
Rubio hopes to pull off another upset in 2016 , an election that was once thought to belong to his former mentor Jeb Bush .
Again , Rubio refused to wait his turn .
And although the establishment has yet to unite around Rubioâ€ ™ s candidacy , he has ratcheted up key congressional endorsements and the support of high - dollar donors .
Despite this , he is no moderate â€ “ holding high marks from some of the largest conservative groups in the country .
But his prior support for comprehensive immigration reform remains a liability among the grassroots , and it is on this issue that he and Cruz are most at odds and have sparred in recent months .
They are also diametrically opposed on surveillance , with Rubio wishing to restore the NSAâ€ ™ s dragnet intelligence gathering methods and Cruz having voted to end its bulk collection of phone records .
And they hold a different view of what US foreign policy should resemble , with Rubio embracing more traditional neoconservatism and Cruz gravitating toward the non - interventionist leanings typically associated with libertarians .
Unlike Cruz , Rubio is well - liked among his colleages in the Senate â€ “ which may be viewed with scepticism by Republican primary voters but could enable him to rally the party around his candidacy .
His goal , he has said , is to unite the Republican party .
To do so , he will have to persuade those leaning toward Cruz and Trump that anger alone is insufficient ."
2016-02-02,"Texas maverick Ted Cruz dramatically burst the bubble of Donald Trump on Monday in a surprise victory over his Republican rival in the Iowa caucus that supporters hope will herald a rightwing resurgence to match that of Ronald Reagan .
Ignoring the media - friendly bombast of Trump in favor of a purer strain of anti - establishment conservatism , Republicans in the state voted in favor of Cruz , according to initial projections by the Associated Press .
Florida senator Marco Rubio had a strong night , snapping at Trumpâ€ ™ s heels and running a close third .
With 99.9 % of votes in , Cruz held a 27.7 % to 24.3 % lead over Trump , with Rubio at 23.1 % .
In the Democratic camp , former secretary of state and first lady Hillary Clinton was locked in a virtual tie with Vermont socialist Bernie Sanders with more than 99 % of the precincts counted .
The Associated Press and multiple outlets said the race was simply too close to call .
In a victory speech in Des Moines , Cruz told a cheering crowd : â€œGod bless the great state of Iowa ...
To God be the glory.â€
�
The Texas senator said his victory was a victory for the grassroots and â€œcourageous conservativesâ€ � across the state and the country .
â€œIowa has sent notice that the Republican nominee and the next president of the United States will not be chosen by the media , will not be chosen by the Washington establishment , will not be chosen by the lobbyists , but will be chosen by the most incredible powerful force where all sovereignty resides in our nation : by we the people , the American people.â€ �
He said he had won the most votes ever cast for any Republican caucus winner in Iowa .
â€œTonight
Iowa has proclaimed to the world : morning is coming , â€ � he said .
â€œWhatever Washington says , they can not keep the people down.â€ �
The vote , he said , showed that his supporters were yearning to get back to free market and â€œJudeo - Christian
valuesâ€ � .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re thrilled , â€ � said Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier .
â€œThis is what we have been working towards â€ “
we spent months building a ground game unparalleled to any campaign and itâ€ ™ s paid off .
Weâ€ ™ re excited about the momentum we have going into the next states and national organization that will carry us through to the end.â€ �
She praised â€œhow hard Senator Cruz has worked in Iowaâ€ � and his â€œability to bring conservatives in Iowa on board the campaignâ€ � .
No one would have considered him a â€œNo 2 pickâ€ � for next
weekâ€ ™ s
New Hampshire primary , she added .
Trump congratulated Cruz in a concession speech after the result was called .
â€œOn June 16 , when we started this journey , I was told by everybody , do not go to Iowa .
They said , â€˜Donâ€ ™ t do it.â€ ™
I said I have to do it .
â€œAnd we finished second , and let me tell you something , Iâ€ ™ m honored , Iâ€ ™ m just honored ...
Weâ€ ™ re just so happy with the way everythingâ€ ™ s worked out.â€
� He praised Iowa and Iowans , adding :
â€œI think I might come here and buy a farm.â€ �
And he looked ahead to the next two races , saying : â€œWe love New Hampshire and we love South Carolina.â€
�
The mood at his party in western Des Moines went from subdued when it emerged he had been pushed into second place by Cruz to outright downbeat when it became apparent he had almost tied with third - place Rubio .
Behind Cruz and Trump , Rubio dominated over Jeb Bush , Chris Christie and John Kasich , who are now left in a battle for survival .
None of the other establishment figures had expected to make many waves in Iowa , but they barely registered on a dismal night .
Defiant Rubio A defiant Rubio echoed the words of Barack Obama in 2008 when he took the stage at his caucus night party in Des Moines .
â€œSo this is the moment they said would never happen .
For months , they told us we had no chance , â€ �
Rubio told a raucous crowd inside a ballroom at the downtown Marriott .
â€œThey told me I needed to wait my turn .
They told me we had no chance because my hair wasnâ€ ™ t gray enough and my boots were too high , â€ �
he said , referring to a minor media storm about his Cuban heel boots .
â€œBut tonight , here in Iowa , the people of this great state have sent a very clear message after seven years of Barack Obama : we are not waiting any longer.â€ � Rubio made an aggressive push in the final weeks before the Iowa caucus , ramping up his appearances in the state and racking up endorsements from a wide array of faith leaders .
He focused his closing argument on electability , arguing that only he could unify a fractured Republican party .
Cruz had inched ahead in recent opinion polls but appeared to have stumbled when Trump raised questions over whether his birth to a US mother in Canada invalidated his right to serve as president .
But despite this distraction and a position against ethanol subsidies that was thought to be unpopular among rural voters in a state where corn is the biggest export , Cruz overcame the setbacks with the help of strong support from evangelical voters and the Republican Tea Party wing .
Trumpâ€ ™
s
fate hung on whether he could translate the widespread support expressed to pollsters and remarkable turnouts at his rallies into turnout among Republicans taking part in the caucuses .
â€œI wondered if they would really turn out to vote and it turns out that they werenâ€ ™ t real , and reality started tonight , â€ � said Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler .
The threat of bad winter weather barreling towards the western end of the state Monday evening did not become a factor .
Turnout appeared to be high , with reports of some precincts running out of paperwork to register first time caucus - goers .
It had been anticipated that high turnout would be good for Trump , but the New York tycoonâ€ ™ s lack of organization on the ground cost him .
By contrast , Cruz had a highly sophisticated ground game that had recruited caucus captains and volunteers across the state and made aggressive use of data capture on Facebook , using detailed psychological profiling techniques to sway voters .
As the night unfolded , Cruz soon opened up a three - point lead , which he was able to sustain .
With half of the precincts reporting , he had hit 28.9 % to Trumpâ€ ™ s 25.2 % .
Rubio , on 21.1 % , was closing in and the rest of the field floundering .
On Monday , shortly before voting began across the state , the senator visited his 99th county since campaigning began â€ “ a clean sweep of the sparsely populated Hawkeye state known as the â€œfull Grassleyâ€ � â€ “ named after Chuck Grassley , the senator from that state who pioneered such high - intensity campaigning .
Though fractionally less prone to headline - grabbing outbursts than Trump , Cruz has nonetheless fought one of the most extreme conservative campaigns for many years and offers a stark contrast with the Democratic nominee .
His foreign policy in particular eclipses even that of the New York property magnate in its belligerence , including calls to â€œcarpet bombâ€
�
Islamic State forces in Syria until the sand â€œglowedâ€ � .
Cruz has also become unpopular among Republican colleagues in the Senate for a history of obstructionism that saw him play a leading role in a government shutdown , part of a failed bid to force Barack Obama to roll back his healthcare reforms .
Nevertheless , the senator has also been a champion of civil liberties , joining Kentucky colleague Rand Paul in promoting surveillance reform after revelations by National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden .
â€œWho do you know who will kill the terrorists , defend the constitution and repeal Obamacare?â€ �
Cruz boasted to supporters in Hubbard , Iowa , this weekend .
Cruz remains behind Trump in polls in New Hampshire , the next state to vote , in eight daysâ€ ™ time , but has strong support in the largely southern â€œSuper Tuesdayâ€ � states that mark a potential turning point in the race on 1 March .
With Trumpâ€ ™ s once unstoppable momentum slowed in Iowa , attention is now likely to focus on the battle between Cruz and Florida senator Marco Rubio , whose strong third place showing in Iowa puts him in a strong position to do well in New Hampshire next week ."
2016-02-02,"If youâ€ ™ re waking up to the news that Donald Trump lost to Ted Cruz in Iowa , you might be surprised â€ “ especially if you were closely following the polls that said he would defeat Cruz by almost six percentage points .
That wasnâ€ ™ t the only upset on Monday night .
It looks like Marco Rubio , who was expected to take about 17 % of the vote , will have actually walked home with 23 % by the time all votes are counted .
And the Hillary Clinton victory by a four percentage point margin ahead of Bernie Sanders failed to materialise â€ “ instead , the two candidates appear to have finished neck and neck .
In the end , even turnout was a bit of a surprise ; 5.6 % higher than in 2012 , according to exit polling from Edison Media Research .
But itâ€ ™ s premature to forecast the demise of polling accuracy based on those errors .
For one thing , general election polls tend to perform better while caucuses are notoriously difficult to predict â€ “ there are just so many uncertainties about everything from weather ( would snow keep people at home ? )
to the effect college term dates might have on turnout .
Thatâ€ ™ s not the only factor that makes Iowa results hard to interpret .
At national elections , vote share matters .
In Democratic caucuses though , itâ€ ™ s state delegate equivalents ( SDE ) that count and those are calculated based on how many county delegates candidates manage to amass .
That means that even if Iowa were demographically similar to the rest of the US ( itâ€ ™ s not ) , results here wouldnâ€ ™ t necessarily be indicative of national sentiment .
Confused ?
Iâ€ ™ m not surprised , but this video should help .
In other words , caucuses are weird .
But that doesnâ€ ™ t mean Monday nightâ€ ™ s results are inconsequential .
Winning here can dramatically shape a candidateâ€ ™ s
public image â€ “ no wonder then that Clintonâ€ ™ s speech in Iowa sounded suspiciously like a winnerâ€ ™ s acceptance despite the fact that at the time of delivering it , she was no such thing .
And , after repeatedly quoting Walter Hagenâ€ ™ s words : â€œNo one remembers who came in secondâ€ � , Donald Trump might regret his Twitter stream as well as his overall â€œloserâ€ � election rhetoric strategy .
Those aforementioned Iowa SDEs can also have a long - lasting effect on Democratic nominations further down the line .
An analysis from the Cook Political Report found that Sanders needed to not just tie with Clinton in Iowa ; to be in with a real chance , he needed to walk away with two - thirds of delegates .
What next ?
It would be unwise to draw firm and definitive conclusions from the outcome of a single contest that represents about 1 % of the Democrat and Republican delegate tally .
Iowa matters , though .
It finally brings some clarity to a race after months of speculation and it sets the scene moving forward .
There are at least two signals that can be discerned from the caucusesâ€ ™ results : first , how the candidates performed against expectations .
And second , Iowa provides a tangible hint of the candidatesâ€ ™ demographic strengths and weaknesses .
On the basis of these two measures , the Democratic lane of the race is more straightforward .
Expectations were for a close election .
And with Sanders and Clinton virtually tied it could not have been closer .
However , demographically , Iowa is a Sanders - friendly state : more white and liberal than the country as a whole .
Sandersâ€ ™ path to the nomination should , in theory , have passed through a big win in Iowa .
Although Sanders may well go on to win New Hampshire next week ( he is leading in the polls there and
the stateâ€ ™ s fundamentals are even more akin to his support base ) , the Vermont senator is unlikely to dent Clintonâ€ ™ s chances in larger more diverse states .
There is one unknown in this theory : the perception , however manufactured , of momentum .
A scenario where Clinton does not claim a clear victory until South Carolina ( 27 February ) is not inconceivable â€ “ and would mean weeks of nervous headlines .
But until there are signs that Sanders is making a breakthrough with older voters and minorities â€ “ and there arenâ€ ™ t any yet â€ “ it would be premature to put your chips on the momentum argument .
The Republican contest is a lot more difficult to read .
Cruz needed a win â€ “ and he got a clear one .
An ideologically conservative candidate won in a state that is more conservative and evangelical than the nationwide average .
Although he is behind in the polls in New Hampshire , it would be a mistake to equate Cruz to Rick Santorum or Mike Huckabee , whose campaigns imploded after winning Iowa in 2012 and 2008 respectively .
By winning Iowa , Cruz has probably shut the door on the already slim chances of the other more conservative candidates â€ “ but make no mistake , his appeal goes beyond just the Christian vote and his campaign is better organised than that of the two previous Iowa winners .
The big question ahead of Iowa was whether
Trumpâ€ ™ s polling numbers were â€œrealâ€
� .
They did not live up to the hype .
Trump was closer to coming third than to winning .
However , the billionaire candidate entered Iowa with a small lead in the polls , while in New Hampshire his numbers are far more substantial and he still benefits from a crowded field .
The question now though is can he recover from being a loser ?
The other winner on the night was Marco Rubio .
He outperformed the polls , placed clear daylight between himself and the other â€œmainstreamâ€ � candidates â€ “ Jeb Bush , Chris Christie and John Kasich â€ “ and , crucially , his campaign is perceived to be on the rise .
In a field so packed , and dominated for months by one person , such a strong third place finish is quite remarkable .
The Florida senatorâ€ ™
s result is uncomfortable reading for Bush , Christie and Kasich .
There is not much time left ( â€œsuper Tuesdayâ€ � , with many states simultaneously in play , is on 1 March ) for them to emerge as the mainstream alternative to the Cruz - Trump show before the contest eventually thins into a more conventional affair .
On this particular front , Rubio now has a leg up on all three ."
2016-02-04,"Rick Santorum ended his presidential campaign and endorsed rival Marco Rubio on Wednesday .
In an interview with Greta Van Susteren on Fox News , the former Pennsylvania senator announced he was suspending his campaign and switching his support to Rubio for the Republican presidential nomination .
â€œThe best way that I can do what I set out to do when we announced to run for presidentâ€
¦ [ is ] by not continuing our campaign
, â€ � said Santorum , who won the Iowa caucuses during his first presidential campaign in 2012 .
â€œWe are suspending our campaign as of this moment.â€ �
Announcing his backing for Rubio , Santorum said the freshman senator from Florida was â€œin a better position to win this raceâ€ � .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s a tremendously gifted young man , and heâ€ ™ s a born leader , â€ �
he said .
â€œHe is the next generation.â€ �
Although Santorum had long been heavily courted by Donald Trump , several sources told the Guardian that his decision was animated by a strong desire to thwart the candidacy of Ted Cruz as much as by enthusiasm for Rubio .
John Brabender , Santorumâ€ ™ s longtime strategist and confidant , told the Guardian : â€œI think that Rick has some problems with Ted Cruz â€ “ he says too many things to get elected and sometimes questions his core convictions on immigration.â€ �
The veteran Republican operative added : â€œI think that he sees the difference between Cruz and Rubio is that Ted is someone who is very good at saying how we are going to tear down the system and he sees Marco as someone who is going to take whatâ€ ™ s great about America and rebuild us to what we are capable of being.â€ �
Santorum , who won the Iowa caucuses in 2012 and kept up a strong presence in the state since ending his first campaign , finished in a disappointing 11th place in the caucuses on Monday .
An ardent social conservative , Santorum faced a crowded competition against new faces such as Cruz and Ben Carson , and was never able to catch fire in polls .
The size of the GOP field , which at one time included 17 candidates , meant that Santorum never appeared in a single main debate .
Instead , the reigning winner of the Iowa caucuses was the only Republican candidate to appear in each and every undercard debate .
According to Brabender , Santorum weighed a number of candidates to back , including Jeb Bush , who was â€œsomeone [ the former Pennsylvania senator ] gave a lot of consideration toâ€ � .
The longtime aide also pushed back on speculation that the outgoing candidate might have endorsed Trump .
While Santorum does have â€œa lot of respectâ€ � for Trump , Brabender said , a choice between Trump and Cruz would have been â€œa very hard endorsementâ€ � .
In a response to question about the endorsement from reporters in New Hampshire , Rubio said : â€œWell , it means a lot .
I have tremendous respect for Rick.â€ �
The Florida senator added : â€œWe look forward to teaming up .
We hope heâ€ ™ s going to be very active in our campaign.â€ �
Santorum is the third Republican candidate to drop out of the race since the Iowa caucuses , joining Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul .
Neither Paul nor Huckabee have endorsed a former rival ."
2016-02-04,"Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s decision to visit a mosque on Wednesday ( his first such visit as president ) was not popular with Republican candidate Marco Rubio â€ “ nor among many American voters if public polling is anything to go by .
Addressing voters in New Hampshire on Wednesday , Rubio said : Look at today â€ “ he gave a speech at a mosque .
Oh , you know , basically implying that America is discriminating against Muslims .
Of course thereâ€ ™ s going to be discrimination in America of every kind .
But the bigger issue is radical Islam .
Data isnâ€ ™ t needed to show that many types of discrimination exist in America .
But hereâ€ ™ s some anyway : 45 % of white Americans say that black Americans donâ€ ™ t have the motivation or the willpower to pull themselves out of poverty .
One - third of Americans donâ€
™ t think society should accept homosexuality and 8 % of Americans think that adults with intellectual disabilities should all be institutionalized .
Those numbers are besides the point though .
Civil rights in the US like freedom from discrimination donâ€ ™ t have to meet a quantitative threshold in order to be respected .
Obamaâ€ ™ s visit was not motivated by the belief that American Muslims are the most discriminated group in America , it was an effort to explain : â€œYouâ€ ™ re not Muslim or American .
Youâ€ ™ re Muslim and American.â€ �
Those remarks arenâ€ ™ t just addressed at American Muslims
â€ “ they speak to the 49 % of the country that believes Muslims in America are anti - American .
That figure comes from Pew Research , who published a study this week about American opinion towards Muslims .
The study found that attitudes varied significantly depending on the respondentâ€ ™ s education level , religion and political values .
The people most likely to say that Muslims in the US are anti - American are those that havenâ€ ™ t finished college , white evangelicals and Republicans ( especially conservative Republicans ) .
No surprises , those groups just so happen to be a substantial part of Rubioâ€ ™ s existing support base and
the possible voters heâ€ ™ s hoping to snatch from other candidates .
Rubioâ€ ™ s comments about the scale of discrimination against Muslims will also resonate well with those groups .
White evangelicals and Republicans were also the Americans least likely to agree with the statement in Pewâ€ ™ s study that â€œUS Muslims face â€˜a lotâ€ ™ of discriminationâ€ � .
Overall , 35 % of all US respondents agreed that anti - Muslim sentiment is not a big deal .
Are they right ?
In 2014 , Pew asked over 3,000 US respondents to rate members of religious groups using a â€œfeeling thermometerâ€ � that ranged from 0 to 100 : zero indicated the coldest , most negative possible rating and 100 the warmest , most positive rating .
Muslims scored just 40 .
That score excludes Muslim respondentsâ€ ™ views about other Muslims .
The only other group to fare similarly badly were atheists as rated by religious respondents who also scored 40 .
But thereâ€ ™ s a big difference between those two scores : there are far more atheists in America than there are Muslims .
Just under 1 % of Americans identify as Muslim while 3 % of Americans identify as atheist ( as well as 4 % who say theyâ€ ™ re agnostic and 16 % who say theyâ€ ™ re nothing in particular ) .
Pewâ€ ™ s
study this week also found that those who were most likely to say that they donâ€ ™ t know a single Muslim were those that finished college , white evangelicals and Republicans ( especially conservative Republicans ) .
This matters .
Writing for FiveThirtyEight , Iâ€ ™ ve found a correlation between familiarity and favorability .
The fact that Rubio is speaking to individuals who donâ€ ™ t know Muslims who can challenge their assumptions makes it all the more easy for prejudice to take root .
Rubio isnâ€ ™ t the only candidate to have a support base that is likely to be responsive to such rhetoric .
Speaking about Obamaâ€ ™ s mosque visit on Wednesday , Donald Trump said : â€œI think that we can go to lots of places .
Right now , I donâ€
™ t know if heâ€ ™ s â€ “ maybe he feels comfortable thereâ€ �
â€ “ appearing to imply that Obama is himself a Muslim .
What that lacks in factual accuracy is more than made up for by its political acuity .
Last September , 29 % of Americans ( and 43 % of Republicans ) stated that they believe Obama is a Muslim , according to a poll by CNN and the Opinion Research Corporation .
American attitudes towards Muslims are alarming in part because some individuals will act on those attitudes .
In December , criminologist Brian Levin , director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism , found that crimes against American Muslims and US mosques had risen sharply .
As is so often the case , though the data shows correlations clearly , causation is much harder to understand .
Does anti - Muslim rhetoric from Republican candidates legitimize existing views , allowing more people to express themselves honestly or does the rhetoric actually encourage more people to adopt those views ?
What is less questionable is that Republican rhetoric â€ “ whether itâ€ ™ s Trumpâ€ ™ s endorsement of a database on Muslims , his calls for Muslims to be banned from entering the country or Ben Carsonâ€ ™ s belief that no Muslim should ever be a US president â€ “ directly contradicts Rubioâ€ ™ s suggestion that discrimination against Muslims isnâ€ ™ t all that bad ."
2016-02-04,"Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio criticized Barack Obama on Wednesday for giving a speech at a mosque that focused on discrimination against Muslims .
â€œIâ€ ™ m tired of being divided against each other for political reasons like this
presidentâ€
™ s done , â€ �
Rubio , a senator from Florida , said at a town hall in New Hampshire .
â€œAlways pitting people against each other .
Always.â€ � â€œLook at today : he gave a speech at a mosque .
Oh , you know , basically implying that America is discriminating against Muslims .
Of course thereâ€ ™ s discrimination in America , of every kind .
But the bigger issue is : radical Islam .
And by the way , radical Islam poses a threat to Muslims
themselves.â€
� Obama marked his first visit to a mosque as president on Wednesday , addressing thousands of attendees at the Islamic Society of Baltimore .
The president used the speech to emphasize the contributions of Muslims to American society , while urging those in the Muslim community to speak out against terrorism .
Obama also condemned what he said was â€œinexcusable political rhetoricâ€ � on the part of Republican presidential candidates , referring to Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s proposal to ban Muslims and suggestions by others that there should be a religious test for Syrian and Iraqi refugees .
A spokesperson for Rubio did not immediately return a request for comment when asked if the Florida senator had seen Obamaâ€ ™ s speech .
Jeb Bush , the former Florida governor , acknowledged he hadnâ€ ™ t seen Obamaâ€ ™ s remarks but said the mosque visit was â€œappropriateâ€ � .
â€œIf
it was a good speech , Iâ€ ™ m happy , because I think
itâ€ ™ s important for the president to lead in this regard , â€ �
Bush told conservative radio show Hugh Hewitt .
Hewitt offered rare praise for the president , deeming it â€œa superb speechâ€ � , to which Bush responded : â€œSometimes , you have to give someone credit for a job
well
done.â€
�
Bush also criticized the signal Trumpâ€ ™ s proposed Muslim ban sends â€œto the millions of peaceful Muslims that are as American as you and I.â€ �
Bushâ€ ™ s brother , George W Bush , had also given a speech at a mosque that was centered around tolerance .
Speaking days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks , Bush had said : â€œIslam is peace.â€ � Obama touched upon similar themes in his remarks on Wednesday , saying he did not want to give â€œlegitimacyâ€ � to the warped view of Islam perpetrated by terrorists .
He also made a direct appeal to young Muslims who may feel disenfranchised in the current climate .
â€œLet me say as clearly as I can as president of the United States : you fit right here , â€ � Obama said .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re right where you belong .
Youâ€ ™ re part of America too .
Youâ€ ™ re not Muslim or American .
Youâ€ ™ re Muslim and American.â€ �
Rubio has been critical of Obamaâ€ ™ s tone on such matters before , offering a congruous reaction when the president used a national security address after the terrorist attack in San Bernardino to push for unity and acceptance of peaceful Muslims .
â€œWhere is there widespread evidence that we have a problem in America with discrimination against Muslims , â€ �
Rubio said in an interview at the time ."
2016-02-05,"The Las Vegas Review - Journal , now under the ownership of billionaire casino mogul and GOP donor Sheldon Adelson , has endorsed senator Marco Rubio in the presidential race .
The high - profile endorsement comes after months of speculation surrounding Adelsonâ€ ™ s initially secretive purchase of Nevadaâ€ ™ s largest newspaper , with the news organizationâ€ ™ s own staff forced to investigate the identity of their new boss .
The endorsement published Friday afternoon includes a prominent disclaimer distancing Adelson from the decision : â€œThe RJ met with Sen. Rubio on Oct. 9 , two months before the announcement of the newspaperâ€ ™ s sale to the family of Las Vegas Sands Chairman and CEO Sheldon Adelson .
The Adelsons have detached themselves from our endorsement process , and our endorsement of Sen. Rubio does not represent the support of the family.â€ �
That disclosure , however , is unlikely to quell speculation that Adelson had a hand in selecting Rubio in advance of the Republican caucus in Nevada on 23 February .
The timing of the sale and purchase of the Review - Journal as the 2016 presidential race was heating up sparked widespread rumors that Adelson was interested in using the paper to exert his influence over the race in Nevada , a key swing state .
Adelson donated more than $ 92 m to conservative Super Pacs in an effort to help elect a Republican in the 2012 race .
Adelson has interests in the stateâ€ ™ s gaming and tourism industries as the principal owner of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation .
Rubio , meanwhile , has aggressively courted Adelsonâ€ ™ s backing , having met with the billionaire several times in Las Vegas and often staying in close contact by phone .
Immediately after the purchase of the Review - Journal , Adelson was silent , leading staffers to demand on Twitter that the buyers disclose themselves .
Reporters at the paper eventually revealed the new owner and Adelson himself published a page - two note saying : â€œIt was always our intention to publicly announce our ownership.â€ �
In a front - page editorial in December , the paper said it would not allow Adelson to skew coverage : â€œWe will fight for your trust .
Every .
Single .
Day .
Even if our former owners and current operators donâ€ ™ t want us to.â€
�
Fridayâ€ ™ s
editorial stated : â€œOur reasons for endorsing Sen. Rubio are many .
Notably , the Florida senator has deep personal connections to the state .
He lived in the Las Vegas Valley from age 8 to age 14 , the son of immigrants employed by the hotel industry .
The driving force behind the 44-year - oldâ€ ™ s compelling story is his familyâ€ ™ s pursuit of better opportunities and a better life .
The policies he champions in his campaign are intended to provide all Americans as much.â€ �
Although Adelsonâ€ ™ s wife , Miriam , reportedly prefers Ted Cruz , the casino magnate is rumored to be inching closer to endorsing Rubio himself .
Rubio has been vocal in his support for Israel in legislation and speeches in the US Senate .
He has also sponsored legislation against online gambling , which is one of Adelsonâ€ ™ s priorities .
Rubio , however , has denied that Adelson has shaped his agenda .
He told reporters last year : â€œPeople buy into my agenda .
I donâ€
™ t buy into theirs .
When I run for office , I tell people where I stand â€ ¦
My stands are not influenced by my contributors .
I hope my stands influence my contributors.â€ �"
2016-02-05,"The people Marco Rubio thanked in his speech after the Iowa caucuses on Monday night checked all the Oscars acceptance - speech boxes .
He thanked the people of Iowa .
He thanked his wife .
He thanked Mike Huckabee , mostly for suspending his campaign .
And twice , Rubio thanked â€œalmighty Godâ€ � .
The senator from Florida , who is surging as the Republican establishmentâ€ ™ s alternative to Donald Trump and Ted Cruz , identifies as Roman Catholic .
But he tends to speak of faith in general terms whenever he can .
In the partyâ€ ™ s last debate , Rubio was asked how he felt about the people who thought he could save the Republican party from its current state .
â€œLet me be clear about one thing
â€ “
thereâ€ ™ s only one savior and itâ€ ™ s not me , â€ �
he answered , somewhat eagerly .
â€œItâ€
™ s Jesus Christ who came down to Earth and died for our sins.â€
�
Though he is often accused by secular commentators of being â€œrather scriptedâ€ � until heâ€ ™ s not , Rubio has a gift for the kind of rhetorical style evangelicals love .
He comes by it honestly .
As his campaign readily admits , Rubio also â€œsometimesâ€ � attends Baptist services at a church located in Palmetto Bay , California .
A presidential candidate changing churches is hardly unusual .
Jeb Bush , Scott Walker and Rand Paul have all aligned themselves with different faiths throughout their lives .
But as Rubio is being billed as the â€˜establishmentâ€ ™ candidate , one positioned to unite all Republicans , understanding his evangelical faith â€ “ and specifically , the beliefs of the pastor who led him to adopt Christ Fellowship as his church â€ “ is critical .
One only needs to look to Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s controversial relationship with pastor Jeremiah Wright to understand how big an issue allegiances of faith can be .
Rubio has followed Christ through three churches .
Christened in the Roman Catholic church as a young child in Miami , he converted to Mormonism â€ “ the Church of Latter - Day Saints â€ “ at the age of eight when his family lived for a time in Utah .
In his 2012 memoir , American Son , Rubio describes himself as the driving force of the change .
â€œI immersed myself in LDS theology , â€ � he writes .
But the family eventually left LDS and returned to Catholicism .
Rubio can be vague about what happened next , though he insists he continued to be a practicing Catholic and was married in the church .
It was his wife , Jeanette Dousdebes Rubio , who first became involved with the budding Miami - area megachurch known as Christ Fellowship .
The main attraction for Jeanette Rubio was the churchâ€ ™ s pastor , Rick Blackwood , who Marco Rubio called â€œa gifted preacher very adept at connecting real - life experiences to biblical teachingâ€ � .
It was Blackwoodâ€ ™ s charismatic style , Rubio says , that pulled his entire family back to the word of God , himself included .
â€œBy the end of 2003 , Christ Fellowship was the church where we regularly attended services , â€ � he recalls in American Son ,
â€œand the church we tithed to as well .
It was our church.â€ �
In choosing to worship at a megachurch
â€ “ loosely defined as a church that claims more than 2,000 congregants â€ “
the Rubios are not alone .
The Hartford Institute on Religion Research , an evangelical thinktank in Connecticut , reported last year that the median growth of megachurches over five years amounts to 26 % .
That is an incredible number in an age where fewer Americans identify as Christian .
â€œThey have great coffee and very comfortable seats instead of pews ,
â€ �
Scott Thumma , a professor of sociology of religion at the Hartford Institute for Religion Research , said of the rising popularity of the megachurch .
â€œThey train their hospitality teams to be welcoming .
They are intentional about creating a professional , high - quality worship service.â€ �
Tech - savvy sermons Blackwood , 59 , the pastor of Christ Fellowship , has the manner of a professional himself .
Short , energetic and with a sunny demeanor , he is fond of button - up shirts in muted colours and khakis .
He likes to dart around the stage of Christ Fellowship while he talks , never using a pulpit .
He has a kind - looking face and is the sort of person who punctuates every third sentence with â€œfolksâ€ � .
In fact , as I sat in the audience of a service last December , it was not hard to see why his congregants like him .
Most of Blackwoodâ€ ™ s sermons use a close reading of the Bible to offer general instructions and platitudes to his congregation .
His sermons have the tech - savvy polish of a TED talk .
The one I attended was entitled How to Live an Unforgettable Life .
( The answer , based on the story of Martha in the book of John , turns out to be giving money to Christ Fellowship . )
After his sermon , Blackwood invites congregants to follow along with a reading guide , filling in words of key themes on the churchâ€ ™ s app .
( A typical prompt : â€œYou honor God by _ _ _ _ _ to him.â€
� )
Thatâ€ ™ s why the service at Christ Fellowship Miami is punctuated by quite a lot of music ( Christian pop songs , not hymns ) , and video segments with professional production standards .
Thereâ€ ™ s a teleprompter in the room when Blackwood is teaching , too .
All of these devices appear to be designed to keep congregants hooked in an age where an entire sermon could fly by in a few rounds of Candy Crush .
As he states in his book The Power of Multisensory Preaching , the main challenge facing modern - day churches is not theological .
Instead , itâ€ ™ s more a matter of style , of keeping their viewershipâ€ ™ s attention .
A gentle approach to faith
It is difficult to dig behind Blackwoodâ€ ™ s polish at Christ Fellowship Miami .
He has not granted any major interviews ( and did not respond to the Guardianâ€ ™ s request for one ) , so it remains difficult to discover much detail about his background .
Before coming to Miami as a pastor , he preached in North Carolina .
In sermons he sometimes mentions a childhood in west Texas , an alcoholic father who once threatened him with a gun .
He says he was â€œsavedâ€ � at 17 .
He attended Grace Theological Seminary in Winona Lake , Indiana .
He came to what was then First Baptist Church in 1996 .
He has written no serious theological works that might illuminate his views , and his preaching tends to be too simple to suggest any really coherent interpretation of the Bible .
Christ Fellowship is associated with Southern Baptist Convention , of course .
The SBC believes , among other things , that homosexuality is â€œnot an unforgivable sinâ€ � and that life begins at procreation and must be protected , â€œwhatever the circumstances of conceptionâ€ � .
Christ Fellowshipâ€ ™ s employment application also demands that applicants certify that they are not â€œa practicing homosexual in accordance with scriptures ( Leviticus 18:22 , 20:13 , Romans 1;26 - 27 , I Corinthians 6:9 - 10 , I Timothy 1:10 ) and do not engage in an intimate sexual relationship with anyone other than my legal spouseâ€ � .
And Blackwood does use the standard vocabulary of most evangelical and Baptist preaching ; Satan and demons make frequent cameos .
But the fire - and - brimstone sound of that is muted in practice .
In a sermon explicitly devoted to â€œdemon possessionâ€ � â€ “ which argues , among other things , that people are possessed by demons when they illogically deny the existence of God â€ “ Blackwood stops short of validating some of the more extreme versions of Christian demonology .
â€œThe answer to demons is not some spooky exorcism , â€ � Blackwood says .
â€œThe answer to demons is not some weird , bizarre ritual like throwing holy water or whatever.â€ �
Instead , to drive out demons , one simply talks to God .
It is this sort of gentler approach , of course , that can easily pull in a strayed believer like Rubio .
And he has put his money where his mouth is .
Between 2005 and 2008 , he admitted in his former senatorial campaign , he donated at least $ 50,000 to Christ Fellowship .
A request to his campaign to clarify whether he still tithes to the church was not returned at time of publication .
In a November speech Rubio acknowledged that heâ€ ™ d often been criticized for straddling the Catholic and Protestant faiths .
In his book , he said that the church had actually led him back to Catholicism , that without Christ Fellowship he would never have returned to the catechism .
Still , in a speech this past November , Rubio said : â€œWe have retained our relationship with Christ Fellowship.â€ �
â€œAnd Iâ€ ™ ll tell you why , â€ � he said .
â€œBecause they preach from the same Bible .
Because I donâ€ ™ t know why we wouldnâ€ ™ t be involved in the Spirit .
Now , we donâ€ ™ t go every weekend anymore to Christ Fellowship , but we remain involved with the church and remain very close friends with the people there .
And in many instances on Sundays we find ourselves attending both or listening to the podcasts of Rickâ€ ™ s sermons because he does an excellent job of applying biblical truths to everyday life.â€
�
The divisions of denomination are over , he continues to say .
Rubio , in fact , seems determined to present himself as a uniter of all American Christians .
Which , when you think about it , is not unlike how heâ€ ™ s positioning himself in the Republican party ."
2016-02-07,"Defenders of the long , arduous process by which the United States elects a president often say the marathon campaignâ€ ™ s chief value is that it finds people out .
On Saturday night that old saw was confirmed once again â€ “ and the candidate being found out was Marco Rubio .
The freshman Florida senator went into the final Republican debate before New Hampshire votes on Tuesday as the rising favourite .
Many tipped him if not to win outright then at least to become the standard bearer of the partyâ€ ™ s establishment or ( relatively ) moderate wing , the man who could take on the ultra - conservative Ted Cruz or the untamed fire - breather Donald Trump .
A good performance tonight would seal the deal .
Instead , Rubio had a disaster .
His chief antagonist was New Jersey governor Chris Christie , who seized the earliest opportunity to put the young senator through the mincer .
Building on a theme that he had tried out at a packed rally earlier that day , Christie taunted Rubio as a callow ingenue who could do no more than regurgitate a â€œmemorized 25-second speechâ€ � .
Rubio proceeded to make Christieâ€ ™ s point for him .
Instead of answering the question put to him , he repeated the soundbite he had just uttered â€ “ a riff about Barack Obama having a deliberate plan to transform America .
Christie pointed this out to the watching audience , Rubio doing exactly as he had described , retreating to the comfort zone of a well - rehearsed stump speech .
Rubio promptly repeated the soundbite again .
It was a damning , jaw - dropping moment .
It looked like that sequence from the 1970s thriller the Stepford Wives , when a software glitch reveals that a human - like character is in fact a robot .
â€œI thought we were friends
, â€ � the android says over and over again .
Rubio never recovered .
A small comfort , of a sort , came later when a close - up showed the Florida senator sweating under the lights and under pressure .
At least it showed he was human .
Pretty soon , though , there was a video mash - up of those broken - record answers and a parody Twitter account : @rubioglitch .
Social media branded him the â€œmarcobotâ€ � .
It meant that in just a few moments Christie had achieved what he set out to do : he had both wounded Rubio and got himself noticed .
Given that he came 10th in Iowa , that was the very least he had to do .
But the New Jersey governor did himself more good than that .
He also gave strong answers â€ “ on drugs , saying that his definition of â€œpro - lifeâ€ � meant he cared about life beyond just the â€œnine months in the wombâ€ � , and on Muslim Americans , condemning those who demonized them â€ “ that will have appealed to moderate Republicans and perhaps to New Hampshireâ€ ™ s registered independents , who will be able to vote in the Republican contest on Tuesday and traditionally play a big role in this state .
Still , Christie does not have the constituency of those repelled by Trump and Cruz all to himself .
He had competition from two other members of the governor class : Ohioâ€ ™ s John Kasich and the onetime presumed frontrunner Jeb Bush of Florida .
Both did better than they had in previous encounters .
Bush caught the eye when he took on Trump over the â€œeminent domainâ€ � rule .
The property tycoon tried to swat Bush aside by suggesting Bush was trying to play the â€œtough guyâ€ � .
Referring to a specific case , Bush shot back : â€œHow tough is it to take property from an old woman?â€ �
Kasich fired off no zingers , but his aura of sunny competence might also play well with New Hampshireâ€ ™ s independents .
Alone in refusing to go negative against his opponents , he was the candidate of good , if unthrilling , governance .
Some Republican activists believe the Ohio governor may spring the big surprise of Tuesday night : that , on the quiet , he has won over voters one by one , speaking at no fewer than 100 town hall meetings in the state â€ “ including braving Fridayâ€ ™ s snowstorm to address a few dozen folks in a barn in the village of Hollis for his 99th such gathering .
He may not be the most focused speaker , but New Hampshire citizens respect that kind of attention .
Of course the big obstacle for all these hopefuls remains the man who stood at the centre of the stage and was granted both the first and last words .
The polls still say Trump is in front , even if his lead is said to be shrinking .
He had a good night in that he was not the chief target of the othersâ€ ™ attacks .
He was able to repeat his usual lines about China and making the US a winner again , adding a pledge to â€œbring back waterboarding and bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboardingâ€ � .
But he was barely challenged .
Thatâ€ ™ s because there was another man in the candidatesâ€ ™ sights .
Marco Rubio was the designated victim â€ “ and he emerged looking younger , smaller and more vulnerable ."
2016-02-07,"If Marco Rubio had just had one of the rougher nights of his presidential campaign , he refused to show it .
The senator set off on a barnstorming tour of New Hampshire on Sunday , the morning after he was widely panned in the Republican debate for coming off as scripted .
Striking a tone that was defiant , if also slightly defensive , Rubio continued pushing the idea that Barack Obama has intentionally weakened the US .
Speaking to a crowd of more than 700 people packed into a high school cafeteria in Londonderry , the senator from Florida wasted little time before he nodded to the criticism out in the media and among his rivals .
â€œPeople said : â€˜Oh , you said the same thing , â€ ™ â€ � he said .
â€œIâ€ ™ m going to say it again .
â€œThese things [ Obamaâ€ ™ s ] done to America are not accidents.â€
�
The night before , Rubioâ€ ™ s repetition of that line led to a tense exchange with New Jersey governor Chris Christie , who attacked the senator as an inexperienced candidate who could not stray from his pre - arranged talking points .
Playing directly into Christieâ€ ™ s charge , Rubio repeated himself at least four times in the first hour of the debate , as if stuck on a loop .
Until then , Rubioâ€ ™ s relentless commitment to message had been one of his major assets in a chaotic primary race .
But opponents have eagerly transformed such polish on the stump into a liability , as they too try to claim the role of consensus alternative to frontrunners Donald Trump and Ted Cruz .
In an interview with ABCâ€ ™ s
This Week , Rubio defended his debate performance .
â€œActually , I would pay them to keep running that clip , because thatâ€ ™ s what I believe passionately , â€ �
he said , repeating yet again that he believes Obama deliberately harms the country .
The talk show host interjected to tell Rubio he was repeating himself despite â€œgetting poundedâ€ � during the debate , but Rubio pressed on .
He noted that his campaign raised more money online in the first hour of the debate than any previous event .
â€œAs far as that message , I hope they keep running it and Iâ€ ™ m going to keep saying it because itâ€ ™ s true , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s one of the reasons Iâ€ ™ m running for president â€ ¦ Iâ€ ™ m going to keep saying that , because not only is it the truth , it is at the core of our campaign.â€ �
At a second town hall in Bedford , later in the day , he doubled down on the double down .
â€œI said this last night and Iâ€ ™ m going to say it every chance I get , â€ � he said .
â€œBarack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change America , to make us more like other countries .
But I donâ€ ™ t want to be any other country .
I want to be America.â€
�
His crowds , which at several events throughout the day spilled into overflow areas , were largely receptive and broke into applause when he delivered the line .
And while many acknowledged that Rubio came across as rattled during the debate , they were reluctant to cast him aside over one hiccup â€ “ however major that hiccup might seem to politicians and pundits .
When Rubio worked the rope line in Londonderry , several undecided voters approached to say he had won them over in his town hall meetings .
Among them was Mary Alice B , a woman who did not wish to give her surname .
She had been deciding between Rubio and Cruz , the senator from Texas who is considered the main competition in the quest to overtake Trump .
She acknowledged that she was â€œconcernedâ€ � by Rubioâ€ ™ s debate performance but ultimately concluded from his Londonderry town hall that he was â€œa very dynamic speakerâ€ � and the most electable Republican in the field .
â€œI was even more impressed with him today here in person , â€ � she said .
â€œOf all the candidates I think he has the best chance to beat Democrats â€ “
I think he has the best shot at defeating Hillary [ Clinton].â€ � Lisa Foley , who attended Rubioâ€ ™ s Bedford town hall , was mulling a vote for Rubio or John Kasich , the Ohio governor who has pinned his entire campaign on New Hampshire .
She said that while Rubio had seemed â€œtaken abackâ€ � by Christieâ€ ™ s attack in the debate , the senator was able to seal the deal in person .
â€œI
didnâ€ ™ t like Christie very much for what he did to Rubio .
I thought he really hammered him too much , â€ � she said .
Christie , for his part , relished the aftermath of the debate .
â€œThe lights were bright last night and all of America saw whoâ€ ™ s ready and whoâ€ ™ s not , â€ �
Christie told voters at a campaign event in North Hampton on Sunday morning .
â€œIâ€
™ m ready , heâ€ ™ s
not.â€ �
Appearing on CNNâ€ ™ s State of the Union , the governor twisted the knife further , in an attempt to cast his exchange with Rubio as a moment that would change the race .
â€œI think the whole race changed last night , because you know , there was a march amongst some in the chattering class to anoint Senator Rubio ,
â€ �
Christie said .
â€œI think after last night , thatâ€ ™ s over â€ ¦ you canâ€ ™ t trust Senator Rubio to be the nominee of this party.â€
�
Voters who turned up to see Christie on Sunday had not all seen the debate , but many said they had deduced from clips that the governor had â€œwonâ€ � .
That was enough for them to venture out of their homes on a Sunday and see him .
â€œIn this sport , thatâ€ ™ s how youâ€ ™ ve got to play it
â€ “ sort of like what Trump tries to do , â€ � said Dan Horgan .
â€œYouâ€ ™ ve got to throw some punches .
The votes are really what keeps the score , though , not the local news.â€
�
A new poll by Monmouth University released on Sunday found that Christie , despite his aggressive show in the debate , was still far behind Rubio and others .
Christie , according to the tracking poll , was at 6 % while Rubio tied former Florida governor Jeb Bush for 13 % .
Kasich enjoyed a late upward trend at 14 % , but Trump led the pack with an overwhelming 30 % of the vote from those likely to participate in the Republican primary on Tuesday .
Whether Rubioâ€ ™ s underwhelming debate display will have any bearing on the numbers going into Tuesday remains unclear , but aides to the senator sought to tamp down the reaction by citing their biggest spike in online fundraising in any debate thus far .
â€œHereâ€ ™ s how I view that exchange
, â€ � Todd Harris , a senior Rubio aide , told the Guardian .
â€œChristie had one singular goal last night and that was to take out Marco Rubio , to leave us dead on the floor .
And he utterly failed.â€ �

2016-02-07,"Marco Rubio on Sunday defended his performance in Saturday nightâ€ ™ s Republican presidential debate , in which he was widely panned for coming off as scripted in a tense exchange with Chris Christie .
In an interview with ABCâ€ ™ s
This Week , the Florida senator was asked to explain why he repeated the same line â€ “ about Barack Obama intentionally weakening America â€ “ at least four times in the first hour of the debate , when pressed by the New Jersey governor on his relative inexperience .
Rubio , according to most observers , played directly into Christieâ€ ™ s attack line , that he is rehearsed and incapable of straying from the same set of talking points .
â€œActually , I would pay them to keep running that clip , because thatâ€ ™ s what I believe passionately , â€ � Rubio said , reiterating once more his point about Obama deliberately harming the country .
Host George Stephanopoulos interjected , telling Rubio he was choosing to repeat himself despite â€œgetting poundedâ€ � for having repeated himself .
Rubio pushed back , noting , as his aides did the night before , that his campaign raised more money online in the first hour of the debate than any previous event .
â€œAs far as that message , I hope they keep running it and Iâ€ ™ m going to keep saying it because itâ€ ™ s true , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s one of the reasons Iâ€ ™ m running for president.â€
�
Obama was changing the country , he said ,
â€œin a way that is robbing us of everything that makes us special .
â€œIâ€
™ m going to keep saying that , â€ � he said , â€œbecause not only is it the truth , it is at the core of our campaign.â€ �
Pressed by Stephanopoulos again on his repetition , as Christie taunted him for that very attribute , Rubio again doubled down :
â€œItâ€ ™ s what I believe and itâ€ ™ s what Iâ€ ™ m going to continue to say .
â€œThis is the greatest country in the history of mankind because of a set of principles .
Barack Obama wants us to abandon them.â€ � Speaking at a town hall in Londonderry shortly after his ABC interview , Rubio brought up the debate criticism before a packed crowd at a high school cafeteria .
â€œPeople said , â€˜Oh , you said the same thing , â€ ™ â€ � he said .
â€œIâ€ ™ m going to say it again .
â€œThese things [
Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s ] done to America are not accidents.â€ �"
2016-02-07,"Marco Rubio found himself stuck on repeat while fending off debate attacks from his Republican rivals on Saturday night , stumbling in his effort to claim the mantle of establishment presidential alternative ahead of New Hampshireâ€ ™ s crucial primary .
The Florida senator , who gained momentum with a third - place finish in the Iowa caucuses and a wave of endorsements , has focused on a second - place finish in this less stridently conservative state in hopes of muscling rivals like Jeb Bush , Chris Christie and John Kasich out of the race .
Instead , in a fiery final debate before Tuesdayâ€ ™ s crucial vote , Rubio had one of the worst nights of his entire campaign â€ “ and may have inadvertently offered a more mellow Donald Trump a clearer path toward victory in New Hampshire and perhaps even crowded the field all over again .
During a prolonged exchange that quickly went viral on social media , he repeated himself three times as he struggled to defend himself against Christie , the New Jersey governor who brought out the knives over Rubioâ€ ™ s relative inexperience .
The second - term senator quickly pivoted to vice - president Joe Biden , who , Rubio said , â€œhas been around for 1,000 yearsâ€
� and would not be fit to be commander - in - chief himself .
Rubio then made the case that Barack Obama , to whom he is often compared by his opponents , was not as unsuccessful as critics suggested in terms of pursuing his own agenda .
Christie , who in seeking his own opening in New Hampshire has condemned Rubio as â€œscriptedâ€ � , interjected .
â€œMarco ,
you shouldnâ€ ™ t compare yourself to Joe Biden , â€ � he said , before pointing out Rubio named as an achievement passing sanctions against Hezbollah despite skipping the vote on the actual legislation .
Rubio sought to fight back by going after Christieâ€ ™ s record in New Jersey , a state that has undergone several credit downgrades .
But the Florida senator quickly pivoted to his talking points , going on to repeat the same answer three times in a row in a brutal back - and - forth .
About half an hour later , he repeated the same talking points yet again .
â€œThere it is , there it is , â€ � Christie said .
â€œThe memorized 25-second speech .
There it is , everybody.â€ �
Even Rubioâ€ ™ s camp acknowledged the repetitive moment was a difficult one on a night when his rivals sought â€œto utterly destroy Marco Rubio , knock him out and leave him dead on the floorâ€ � , according to Rubio aide Todd Harris .
â€œWe had a tough exchange with Governor Christie , â€ �
he told the Guardian after the debate , â€œbut Marco continued to get stronger and stronger throughout the night.â€ � Mike DuHaime , a top Christie strategist , was more blunt : â€œIf youâ€ ™ re not ready for a human exchange with another person on stage , â€ � he told the Guardian ,
â€œyouâ€ ™ re not ready to be president.â€ �
Bush , the former Florida governor who has avoided explicit attacks on Rubio , chimed in to curse his erstwhile protÃ
© gÃ
© with faint praise .
â€œMarco Rubio is a gifted , gifted politician , and he may have the skills to be president of the United States , â€ � Bush said .
â€œBut we tried it with Barack Obama.â€
�
The Rubio barrage came relatively early in the debate , which sprawled nearly three hours with blustery exchanges on torture , immigration and abortion , but not before a bumbling start to the debate that included Ben Carson missing his cue to walk on the stage after being announced by the ABC moderator .
The retired neurosurgeon was left standing awkwardly backstage , but Kasich , the Ohio governor , was not even introduced .
Ted Cruz , who won in Iowa but is trailing Trump in New Hampshire , took more heated criticism from Carson over the accusation that the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s campaign had spread a false rumor that Carson was dropping out of the race .
Cruz then promptly reiterated his apology but tried to blame CNN , which had reported that Carson would be going home to Florida for a day or two on Iowa caucus night .
Trump , who has been at the center of the storm for the Republicansâ€ ™ previous seven debates before what pundits are calling a historically â€œself - destructiveâ€ � night for Rubio , did not take too many direct assaults onstage .
But he did react shakily to a question about eminent domain , the power of the government to seize property for â€œpublic
useâ€ � .
While its use is not controversial for government projects like roads or bridges , eminent domain is a hot - button issue here in New Hampshire for economic development projects led by private - property owners .
The mogul has been accused of trying to have an elderly womanâ€ ™ s
house in Atlantic City seized for a limousine parking lot for one of his casinos .
Bush used the opportunity to draw blood , insisting to Trump that â€œa limousine parking lot for his casinos is not a public useâ€ � .
Trump once again mocked Bush as â€œa tough guyâ€ � , holding a single finger to his lips , setting off a cascade of boos from the audience , which Trump welcomed .
Instead of rebutting Bush on the facts , Trump used the opportunity to play the villain to the crowd as if he was a heel in professional wrestling .
â€œAll of his donors and special interests , you know has tickets , â€ � the real estate mogul said .
â€œThe reason they are not loving me is because I donâ€ ™ t want their moneyâ€ � .
The audience of 1,000 at St Anselm College , which the Republican National Committee said consisted of 75 donors , kept booing .
Moments before the debate began , North Korea launched a long - range rocket , offering Rubio a moment to seize on foreign policy .
Trump pivoted to trade : â€œWe have â€ “ tremendous â€ “ has been just sucked out of our country by China .
China says they donâ€ ™ t have that good of control over North Korea .
They have tremendous control .
I deal with the Chinese all of the time .
I do tremendous â€ “ the largest bank in the world is in one of my buildings in Manhattan.â€
�
The back - and - forth left Cruz in an awkward position in a series of pointed questions about whether waterboarding constituted torture or whether the seven candidates onstage would reinstitute it : â€œI would not bring it back in any sort of widespread use , â€ � he said .
The debate marked Bushâ€ ™ s strongest showing to date , after tepid performances last year that dogged his flailing presidential campaign .
His growing confidence comes at a time when the former governor is looking to New Hampshire to salvage his bid to become the third in his family to serve in the White House .
Immigration reform was also discussed again in a state with a long history of supporting candidates such as Pat Buchanan who have been staunchly opposed to such reform .
In particular , Rubio was targeted for his role authoring a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013 , which he later disavowed after conservatives revolted over its inclusion of a pathway to citizenship for the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US .
Asked by debate moderators if he â€œcut and runâ€ � from his own bill , Rubio said the legislation â€œhas no chance of passingâ€ � and laid out how he would address immigration reform as president .
Christie again stepped in to note that Rubio had not answered the essence of the question â€ “ over whether he had shown effective leadership on the issue of immigration .
â€œIt is not leadership to continue to try something that has no chance of happening , â€ � Rubio said .
Kasich sounded a comparatively dovish note as well on the issue .
â€œAmericans would support a plan like this , â€ �
he said .
â€œI think Congress would pass a plan to finish the border , guest worker , pay a fine , a path to legalization , and not citizenship.â€ �
Trump was relatively quiet on what has become his trademark subject , telling voters he would â€œbuild a real wall and not a toy wallâ€ � with Mexico .
Ironically , in New Hampshire , a state known for its socially moderate electorate , the candidates had the most extended discussions about reproductive rights in the campaign so far .
Rubio doubled down on his social conservative credentials , reiterating his opposition to abortion even in cases of rape and incest .
â€œI would rather lose an election than be wrong on the issue of life , â€ � the Florida senator proudly proclaimed .
While that social conservative message may help him in the nominating fight , concerns about Rubioâ€ ™ s viability in a general election may be more academic than they were heading into the weekend .
With strong showings from both Bush and Christie , Rubioâ€ ™ s grasp on second place in the Granite state appeared less clear after a night that could alter the momentum he so meticulously gained less than a week before ."
2016-02-07,"The eighth Republican presidential debate , all three hours of it , has come and gone .
Hereâ€ ™ s a summary in case
you missed it :
New Jersey governor Chris Christie ambushed Florida senator Marco Rubio by laying bare his rhetoric as repetitive , rehearsed and off - point .
â€œYou have not been involved in a consequential decision , â€ �
Christie told Rubio .
Rubio seemed shaken by the attack , repeating a single sentence , about the fiction of Barack Obama not knowing what he was doing , three times .
The debate got off to a rocky start , as retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson declined to take the stage upon being introduced , apparently not having heard the moderator introduce him .
He lingered awkwardly .
Very awkwardly : Donald Trump handled a question about his use of eminent domain to evict an elderly lady from a planned New Jersey casino parking lot with aplomb , saying the Keystone XL pipeline , for example , â€œwould not get 10 feetâ€ � without eminent domain .
But Trump was booed when he attacked the crowd for booing him .
â€œWe needed tickets .
You canâ€ ™ t get them.â€ � Booed and booed and booed .
Ohio governor John Kasich told voters that if heâ€ ™ s elected president , they better â€œgo out and buy a seatbeltâ€ � , because heâ€ ™ s going to hit the gas in his first 100 days .
Trump and Cruz both said they would â€œbring backâ€ � waterboarding , which both said did not constitute torture .
Bernie Sanders was on Saturday Night Live !"
2016-02-07,"The eighth Republican presidential debate is in the can .

Bernie Sanders was on Saturday Night Live !
The moment ragamuffin Bernie enters shaking his finger at upscale David , via a RT by Sanders feed , which is working not to squander the media moment : OK , why not .
Whatâ€ ™ s
everybody think of 1975 ?
How many people are in this band ?
Theyâ€ ™ re back - Sanders and David .
Just onstage , dressed like themselves .
â€œSo Bernie
, â€ � David asks .
â€œHow are things going in New Hampshire?â€ � â€œOK , â€ � Sanders says .
â€œJust OK?â€ �
â€œWell itâ€ ™ s pretty , pretty , pretty pretty good , â€ � Sanders says , in a Curb Your Enthusiasm line .
Then they introduce the musical act , 1975 .
And hereâ€ ™ s Sanders !
He has a cameo in the shipwreck skit .
The setup is that Larry David is a distinguished passenger who tries to take a lifeboat on his sinking ship based on his wealth and social position .
Enter Sanders , in a social justice intervention .
â€œHold on hold on wait a second .
I am so sick of the 1 % getting this preferntial treatment .
Enough is enough .
We need to unite and get together if weâ€ ™ re going to get through this!â€ �
Sanders says .
Heâ€ ™ s dressed like a ragamuffin from 100 years ago .
â€œSounds like socialism to me , â€ � says the David character .
â€œDemocratic socialism , â€ � says Sanders .
â€œWhatâ€ ™ s the difference?â€ � asks David .
Fun back - and - forth here , with them both leaning on the sinking - ship - rail .
â€œYuge difference , â€ � says Sanders .
â€œHuge?â€ � â€œYuge !
Huge with a â€˜yâ€ ™
.â€ � â€œWho are you?â€ � asks David .
â€œI am Bernie Sandersowsky , but weâ€ ™ re going to change it when we get to America
so it doesnâ€
™ t sound quite so
Jewish.â€ �
â€œThatâ€ ™ ll trick â€ ™ em.â€ �
Punch line : Sanders :
â€œShare a cab?â€ �
David : â€œEh .
I think weâ€ ™ ve talked enough.â€ �
Sanders points followers to Saturday Night Live , which now is airing a Titanic skit .
Or a story of some other high - society shipwreck from a hundred years ago .
The shtick is that Sanders shares all of Davidâ€ ™ s worst inclinations , famous from Davidâ€ ™ s show , Curb Your Enthusiasm .
David - as - Sanders just told a member of staff to Eff Off .
The spot is supposedly directed by Bernie Sanders .
UPDATE :
While there was a title card that said as much , Bernie Sanders did not in fact direct this Saturday Night Live skit .
D - a - S runs into a voter who has dislocated her shoulder in a car accident .
She needs his help to â€œpop it back inâ€ � to get to the polls before they close .
D - a - S
: Are you nuts ?
Go to a hospital ?
I donâ€ ™ t pop .
Iâ€ ™ m not a popper .
Voter :
But the polls close in an hour .
If you want my vote , pop it back in .
D - a - S :
I donâ€
™ t want it that bad .
The skit ends with D - a - S watching results come in from Iowa .
â€œPoint-2%!?!â€ � he yells .
â€œHow many people is that?!â€
�
â€œItâ€
™ s like five people!â€ �
â€œFive people!â€ ™
The gag is that theyâ€ ™ re watching a Clinton victory celebration on TV , and there in the crowd ... is the car - crash voter , with her arm in a sling , and a Clinton sticker on the sling .
Oh wait , here we are :
Bern Your Enthusiasm , is the premise of the Sanders / David skit .
Although for now we only get David , as Bernie Sanders at a presidential rally .
In this skit , Sanders shares Davidâ€ ™ s phobias about germs , and refuses to shake the hand of a voter who had coughed into her hand .
David - as - Sanders gets into a fight with the voter .
â€œI am running for president , I do not shake disgusting hands!â€ � he says .
The voter replies : â€œReally , Bernie?!?â€ � Weâ€ ™ re not going to blog portions of Saturday Night Live not starring Bernie Sanders .
Weâ€ ™ re not going to blog portions of Saturday Night Live not starring Bernie Sanders .
Hereâ€ ™ s a picture from the debate spin room , where Guardian political reporter Ben Jacobs is chasing interviews :
NB :
Larry David is 68 years old .
Six years younger than Bernie Sanders .
David is on to the topic of dating .
Do we need to narrate this portion of the monologue to you , our politics audience ?
Bernie Sanders isnâ€ ™ t onstage .
This is pretty funny though .
Tune in , weâ€ ™ d say .
If you made it through that three - hour debate broadcast , there is literally no possible way on Earth you will be disappointed .
Hereâ€ ™ s the monologue .
Larry David walks out .
The actual Larry David not Bernie Sanders - as - Larry David .
Not that anyone expects Sanders to try a David impression tonight .
What do we expect ?
We donâ€ ™ t even know .
Thatâ€ ™ s part of the thrill .
David says something about having a dipless house .
And his transition from a poor shmuck to a rich prick .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not that much happier as a prick than a shmuck , â€ � he says .
Itâ€ ™ s a seamless transition from the Republican debate .
Here comes Bernie Sanders and Saturday Night Live .
Itâ€ ™ s the cold open of the show .
A Ted Cruz impersonation .
That guy
doesnâ€ ™ t look a thing like Bernie Sanders .
Oh itâ€ ™ s Taran Killam .
But this is a pretty good line :
Folks , weâ€ ™ ve had presidents who were governors , generals .
Isnâ€ ™ t
it time we had a president who was just a nasty little weasel ?
Christie is already fundraising off his mauling of Rubio tonight .
Agree ?
( h / t : @lgamgam )
Marco Rubio won the debate ... in terms of Google searches coming out of New Hampshire .
Which may only indicate that Granite Staters were trying to figure out what the buzz about Rubio getting into some kind of trouble was ?
Note that the Rubio searches , rankings - wise at least , seemed to intensify later in the evening â€ “ a while after his memorable encounter with Chris Christieâ€ ™ s fists : We asked , you answered â€ “ and hereâ€ ™ s a sampler : Extra credit to Huples , who was brave enough to take on every single question we posed â€ “ though weâ€ ™ re not sure Jeb Bush is going to win American Idol :
Was Isis onstage tonight ?
Is Rubioâ€ ™ s abortion stance â€œevolvingâ€ � , asks Lucia Graves ?
Tonight Christie sought to draw a distinction with Rubio on abortion , an area where the candidates have diverged in the past .
While Rubio only supports abortions to save the life of the mother - and not for cases of rape or incest - he has indicated in interviews that he would sign abortion legislation without such provisions were he president .
Tonight he seemed to go a step further calling a womanâ€ ™
s right to make choices about her body â€œa real rightâ€ � .
Christie has attacked Rubio over not making exceptions for rape in his personal politics before , and when a moderator asked if he was being â€œharmful to the pro - life causeâ€ � by doing so Christie was happy to argue the point .
â€œIf a woman
has been rapedâ€ ¦
this is not a womanâ€ ™
s choice but a woman being violated , â€ � he said .
It would seem to be impossible to argue with that statement but welcome to the Republican debates on womenâ€ ™ s health ...
Nevertheless , both Rubioâ€ ™ s rhetoric and Christieâ€ ™ s retort signal we may be seeing some progress , or uh , evolution here .
Hereâ€ ™ s how Twitter experienced the debate tonight â€ “ with thanks to the Twitter metrics team : Top moments on Twitter : 1 .
Trump tells Bush to be quiet .
Continues to be booed by audience .

Carson :
The political class and pundits and media try to bury me .
Guess what ?
Iâ€ ™ m still here , and Iâ€ ™ m not going anyplace , either .
Faith , integrity and common sense .
Rubio :

I was reminded whatâ€ ™ s at stake .
[ Cut to TV shot of kids .
Wow cute kids .
Vote Rubio . ]
Single greatest nation etc .

Everybody says theyâ€ ™ ll stand up to Washington .
Last week in Iowa I opposed ethanol .
[ Itâ€ ™ s true . ]

Iowa put country above cronyism .
We can fix it .
The ethanol close .
Trump : â€œThatâ€ ™ s because he got Ben Carsonâ€ ™ s votes by the way , but we wonâ€ ™ t say that.â€ � Ooh !
Our country doesnâ€

New Hampshire is addicted to heroin .
China is killing us on trade .
If Iâ€ ™ m elected president , we will win and we will win and we will win .

--- UPDATE :
Sports fact check from the Guardian US sports editor Tom Lutz :
Kasich , Rubio , Trump and Cruz are right .
And technically Ben Carson too .
Tough luck , Christie and Bush .
After all that work on the ground in New Hampshire , too . ---
Pretty shamelessly shallow from all on a night when Rubioâ€ ™ s scripted campaigning spirit has set the pundits afire : Rubio is asked how to speak to millennials on same - sex marriage and abortion ?
Guess what : Rubio has a smooth answer about same - sex marriage and abortion .
â€œThe issue of life is not a political issue , it is a human rights issue , â€ � Rubio says .
He calls the womanâ€ ™ s right to choose what to do with her body â€œa real rightâ€ � .
But the right of the foetus to life outweighs .
He calls Democrats â€œextremists on the issue of abortion.â€ �
Heâ€ ™ s vigorously applauded .
Then a bit of a mini - debate breaks out on abortion : Bush says heâ€ ™ s pro - life , except for cases of rape , incest , and the motherâ€ ™ s life being in danger .
He calls it a â€œsweet - spotâ€ � position for the Republican nominee .
Not that there are political calculations going into his thinking here .
Rubio : â€œI do support an exception for the life of the mother , because Iâ€ ™ m pro - life.â€ � Which isnâ€ ™ t new ... ...
but : Rubio says he would â€œrather lose an election , than be wrong on the issue of life.â€ �
What do you think , is that true ?
Christie , after equating abortion to â€œthe murder of childrenâ€ � , says that in cases of rape and incest , abortion should be an option , as a â€œself - defenseâ€ � .
â€œThat woman should not have to carry that child.â€ � Lucia Graves examines Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s comments about whether waterboarding is torture .
â€œUnder the definition of torture , no itâ€ ™ s not , â€ � Cruz said .
â€œUnder the law , torture is excruciating pain that is equivalent to losing organs and systems , so under the definition of torture , it is not .
It is enhanced interrogation , it is vigorous interrogation , but it does not meet the generally recognized definition of torture.â€
� Torture has been defined as â€œany act by which severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental , is intentionally inflicted on a personâ€ � by the United Nations .
And in 2014 The International Committee of the Red Cross ruled that waterboarding fit the definition of torture .
The technique , which involves covering a personâ€ ™ s face with cloth and pouring water over it repeated to simulate the effect of drowning , was dubbed one of many â€œenhanced interrogation techniquesâ€ � infamously used by the George W Bush administration administration .
And that is how Cruz argued it should be classified tonight .
But since those techniques were employed by the Bush administration , and in particular following the release of a Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA interrogations in 2014 - a 500-plus page report detailing the effectiveness of some of the harshest interrogation techniques employed by the United States - â€œenhanced interrogation techniquesâ€ � has widely come to be viewed as a euphemism for torture .
Technically speaking , whether waterboarding fits the definition of torture depends on whether it can be said that making a person feel like theyâ€ ™ re drowning can be considered enacting severe suffering .
Itâ€ ™ s a somewhat subjective matter but Iâ€ ™ m going to go with yes .
Trump takes the question .
â€œI know Diane Foley
[ Jamesâ€ ™ mother ] very well ,
â€ �
Trump says .
â€œI raised a lot of money for the foundation.â€ �
â€œThat said , you can not negotiate this way with terrorists .
If you do that , youâ€ ™ re going to have so many other James Foleys.â€
�
And on the vets , Trump does not let to go unmentioned :
â€œDuring the last debate , I raised $ 6 m for the vets.â€
�
Now a question about James Foley , a New Hampshire native , and a journalist killed by Isis militants in Syria .
Should families be allowed to raise money for ransom for loved ones ?
â€œPutting in place legal regimes that encourage the payment of ransom has the effect of putting a bounty on other Americans , â€ � Cruz says .
Is Cruz tired ?
He tries to refer to â€œloved ones and family membersâ€ � and calls them â€œlove members.â€ �
Then he calls Bowe Bergdahl â€œJames Bergdahl.â€ � Kasich says that experience in the military should translate to civilian licenses , college credits and other accreditations based on their military experience .
â€œEverybody wants to hire a veteran , â€ � Kasich says .
â€œThere should be no unemployment among veterans.â€ � â€œLetâ€ ™ s lift them .
Theyâ€ ™ re the greatest people taking care of the United States of America , and we need to take care of them , and we will .
We will.â€ �
Next question : how to fix the veterans administration ?
Bush says people in the VA should have been fired when routine long waiting lists were revealed .
He says he met someone at a town hall this morning who was a veteran informed by the VA that he had died .
â€œThis is outrageous , â€ � he says .
â€œI met him .
And
heâ€ ™ s voting for me!â€ � Only 40 minutes to go !
Can Rubio claw back ?
The opinionators are already beginning to call this one of his worst sweatiest performances yet : Or maybe itâ€ ™ s working ?
Christie says he has two daughters and if a young woman wants to fight for her country , she should be allowed to do so .
â€œAnything they can dream , anything they want to aspire to , they can do.â€
�
Carson jumps in too , on the draft .
â€œFourteen per cent decrease in the number of people applying for military service , â€ � he says .
And mentions veteran suicide .
He strays from the point of the draft to his plan for veterans .
â€œThey should have health empowerment accounts ...
If we start taking care of our veterans the right way , we wonâ€ ™ t ever have to worry about the draft again.â€ � Unclear how that tracks .
Hereâ€ ™ s the asterisk for Bush .
â€œThe draftâ€ ™ s not going to be reinstituted .
We donâ€ ™ t have a draft .
Iâ€ ™ m not suggesting we have a draft.â€
�
So heâ€
™ s OK with women being required to sign up for selective service ,
so long as thereâ€ ™ s no possibility of them being called up ?
Rubio is asked about young women signing up for selective service in case the draft is reinstated .
Rubio says there are already women serving today in roles that are like combat .
He says he supports women in combat .
And he believes that selective service should be opened up for both men and women .
The deeper problem , he says , is the shrinking of the military .
Bush agrees with Rubio on selective service subscription .
â€œIf women can meet the minimum requirements for combat , they ought to be allowed to do it .
Carson is asked about Zika .
â€œThis is going to be obviously a big deal , â€ � Carson says .
But he would not â€œwilly - nilly go out and quarantine a bunch of people because theyâ€ ™ ve been to Brazilâ€ � .
Christie takes a question about Zika virus â€ “ and his decision to quarantine an American nurse who had traveled to Ebola - infected West Africa .
Would he maybe quarantine people , if Zika virus deepens , whoâ€ ™ d traveled affected areas in Brazil ?
â€œYou bet I would .
You have to remember what happened with that nurse .
She was showing symptoms .. had been treating patients.â€
�
He stands by the decision .
Rubio is asked whether he would visit a mosque as president .
He says he would , but that the country has to confront the threat posed by radical Islamic terror .
Theyâ€ ™ re back !
Trump us asked how he would bridge the divide between police and communities they serve , as ABCâ€ ™ s Muir cites the discredited , unscientific so - called â€œFerguson effectâ€ � invoked by the FBI director .
Trumpâ€ ™ s sympathies lie with the police .
â€œThe police in this country have done an unbelievable job of keeping law and order , â€ � he says .
â€œMinorities all over the country , they respect the police of this country , â€ �
Trump says .
He says police are afraid about their pensions because of videos on the local news .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re afraid for their jobs , â€ � he says .
â€œWe have to give great respect ... to our really fantastic police.â€ �
But how would he bridge the divide ?
Of the families , Trump says : They sue .
Everybody sues .
They go out .
They sue .
We have so much litigation .
You know what ?
We donâ€
™ t want to have excessive force .
But at what point can you do his job ...
youâ€ ™ re going to have abuse and youâ€ ™ re going to have problems ..
but you have to weed out the problems .
Kasich jumps in : â€œThere can be a win - win here.â€ �
He talks about a law - enforcement - community - leaders collaborative he formed to make recommendations on police recruiting , hiring and the use of deadly force .
â€œWe love the police , but weâ€ ™ ve got to be responsive to the people and the communities.â€ � Applause for trickeration .
Talk times so far : Low for Kasich .
Second commercial break !
Theyâ€ ™ re doing them hourly .
Doesnâ€ ™ t give us much time to dip into the comments .
How are you reading this thing ?
That second hour was not quite as electrifying as the first .
Note to Bush , Christie , Carson , maybe Kasich â€
“ when you come back , you may in effect have an hour left to make your 2016 presidential campaigns breathe .
( Unless debates donâ€ ™ t matter . )
Same question for Carson :
First of all , I think it would be a fairly easy contrast between myself and Hillary Clinton .
He says Clinton is â€œknown to be deceitful , â€ � then he starts talking about Benghazi , which he says he will never let go .
â€œI would simply make it a referendum on honesty and integrity versus deceit and the Washington way.â€ �
Rubio says the changing of the narrative of the arrival of the first woman president is â€œalready happening.â€ �
He cites Iowa turnout and attendance at Republican rallies .
â€œHereâ€ ™ s what Hillary Clinton needs to understand ...
weâ€ ™ re going to bring this party together , and we are going to defeat Hillary Clinton , because she is unqualified to be president.â€ �
Question for Trump :
How do you run against Hillary Clinton , who will be running to make history as the first woman president ?
Trump points to the polls , of course .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve created a movement , â€ �
Trump says .
â€œWe will galvanize the people of this country , and we will beat Hillary Clinton.â€ � â€œI will win the election and we will win it by a lot .
We will win it handily.â€ � Q for Christie : Would you chase drug enforcement into Mexico , without the cooperation of Mexican government ?
â€œOf
course I would ,

Christie says .
He says that first - time drug offenders in New Jersey go to treatment , not to prison , and the result has been dropping prison populations .
â€œThis is a disease .
Itâ€ ™ s not a moral failing .
Itâ€ ™ s a disease and we need to get people help.â€ �
Christie says heâ€ ™ s pro - live , and that means support for addicts .
Next question : 48 % of New Hampshirites knows somebody who has abused heroin .
Question is for Cruz , who told a personal story about a family member who struggled with addiction .
What can you say to show people you understand the danger of the problem ?
And Cruz tells a tragic and moving story about his older half sister Miriam .
Cruz says her older half sister struggled her whole life with drug and alcohol addiction .
She went to jail .
â€œShe ended up spending some time in a crack house.â€ �
She says she drove with his dad to try to get his sister , Miriam , out of the crack house .
She wouldnâ€ ™ t come .
â€œShe was angry.â€ �
About five or six years ago , she died of an overdose .
â€œThis is an absolute epidemic .
We need leadership to solve it.â€
�
More here on the crisis : Kasich says as president , you need to have an agenda in â€œthe first hundred days.â€ �
Then he rattles off what he would do .
Kasich :
If I get elected tomorrow , go out tomorrow and buy a seatbelt , because thereâ€ ™ s going to be so much happening , itâ€ ™ ll make your head spin!â€ � Thatâ€ ™ s applauded with some vigor .
Kasich says the problem with Washington is not that there are too many deals .
Itâ€ ™ s that thereâ€
™ s no leadership .
â€œThe point is , you have to work with people ....
â€ � and Obama does not .
â€œSince heâ€ ™ s given up on working with Congress , he thinks he can impose anything he wants .
Heâ€ ™ s not a king , heâ€
™ s a president.â€ �
In Ohio , Kasich says , â€œI donâ€ ™
t trump the legislature , because if you do , you aggravate them ,
you anger them.â€
�
Trumpâ€ ™ s invited to talk about making deals as president .
This is his dream question ?
â€œA good dealmaker will make great deals but will do it in a way our founders thought it should be done .
People will get together , theyâ€ ™ ll make deals , â€ �
he says .
You have to get people in , grab â€˜em , hug â€˜em , kiss â€˜em and get the deal done .
But it has to be the deal that you want .
Ted Cruz says â€œon day one , I will rescind every single illegal and extra - constitutional executive action Barack Obama has done.â€
�
â€œObama is abusing executive power.â€
�
He says he would also change Obamaâ€ ™ s foreign policy and also be better at legislation .
Because he has so many friends in Congress .
Q for Cruz : Is waterboarding torture ?
â€œWell , under the definition of torture , no , itâ€ ™ s not , â€ � he says .
â€œUnder the law , torture is excruciating pain that is equivalent to losing organs and systems , so under the definition of torture , it is not .
It is enhanced interrogation , it is vigorous interrogation , but it does not meet the generally recognized definition of torture.â€
�
But this from Cruz : I would not bring it back in any sort of widespread use .
And indeed Iâ€ ™ d join with Senator McCain in prohibiting line officers from employing it .
Trump takes the waterboarding question .
He breathes fire on the issue .
â€œIn the Middle East , we have people chopping the head off Christians ...
we have never seen before whatâ€ ™ s happening right now . ...
I would bring back waterboarding , and I would bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.â€
�
Some guy in the audience goes , â€œYeah!â€ �
Same for Bush : â€œIt was used sparingly , Congress has changed the laws and I think where we stand is
the appropriate place.â€ �
Same for Rubio :
We shouldnâ€ ™ t talk about specific tactics in the war on terror .
But weâ€ ™ d get them .
Hereâ€ ™ s Marco Rubio saying his rehearsed line several times over the course of three minutes earlier this evening : Thatâ€ ™ s from a rival campaign , but , well : Carson takes the question .
I want to talk about this , he says , â€œbecause Iâ€ ™ m not just here to lend beauty to the stage.â€ � â€œI would support the possibility of renewed airstrikesâ€ � if the military people agreed , in Libya , Carson says .
He basically says he would punt the question to the Pentagon : â€œNone of us up here is a military expert ... if we actually sit down and talk with [ the Pentagon ] and get their impression ...
we can decide.â€
� Raddatz vs Bush :
You supported strikes on Libya .
Would you support renewed air strikes ?
â€œI would .
And I would do it in concert with Arab allies and Europe.â€
�
Then this , from the brother of George W Bush : This is the lesson learned in history , if you bomb something and not do anything with the aftermath of this , you end up with [ chaos ] , you end up with Libya .
You have to lead .
With out the United States , nothing seems to work .
Now Raddatz confronts Trump :
How would you get rid of Isis â€˜quicklyâ€ ™ as youâ€ ™ ve said ?
Four years ago , he says , â€œI said bomb the oil and take the oil.â€ �
He talks about bombing the oil .
â€œYou have to knock the hell out of the oil , you have to take the oil , and you also have back channels of banking ...
we have to stop those circuits .
Nobody knows banking better than I do .
They have back circuits , back channels .
Follow - up :
What about Isis - occupied cities full of civilians ?
Trump says â€œWhen you stop the oil and take the oil ... when you do that , itâ€ ™ s going to dry up very quickly , theyâ€ ™ re going to become a very weakened power , quickly .
Rubio calls for increased air strikes on Isis â€œnot just in Iraq and Syria , but around the world.â€ � He supports a regional ground force led by the United States .
Raddatz presses him : youâ€ ™ ve called Isis â€œthe most dangerous group in history.â€ �
Why not commit a large US ground force ?
Because they occupy Sunni cities , Rubio says .
â€œIt will take Sunni fighters themselves in the region to take those cities and villages and to hold them.â€ �
If not , Rubio says , â€œyou are going to have a successor group to Isis , just as it is a successor group to al Qaeda.â€
�
Heâ€ ™ s handling himself well in a high - pressure line of questioning from Raddatz .
Cruz is asked whether he would expand the rules of engagement to fight Isis and other militant groups in Iraq and Syria .
Cruz says yes .
â€œWe are sending [ soldiers ] in to fight with their arms tied behind their backs ...
it is wrong .
â€œWe should use overwhelming force , kill the enemy and then get the heck out.â€ �
Then loosen the rules of engagement ?
â€œAbsolutely , yes , â€ � Cruz says .
Then Raddatz asks Cruz about his strategy to carpet - bomb Isis .
What kind of strategy is that ?
â€œNow when I say saturation carpet bombing , thatâ€ ™ s not indiscriminate , â€ � Cruz says .
Doesnâ€ ™ t sound like it .
Then Christie gives a super - solid Republican answer on the dangers of taxation .
To the 68 % of Americans who believe there need to be higher taxes on the rich , â€œI want to tell you the truth .
Youâ€ ™ re wrong , and hereâ€ ™ s why youâ€ ™ re wrongâ€ � :
After New Jersey raised taxes on millionaires , we lost in the next four years , $ 70bn in revenues .
Itâ€ ™ s a failed idea , itâ€ ™ s failed policy , itâ€ ™ s class warfare .
Rubio elbows in , because Christie attacked him .
And once again Rubio attacks Obama .
A non - response to Christie .
Rubio is booed a bit , as if the crowd has ingested Christieâ€ ™ s critique of him as a one - note piano .
Then Rubio takes a tax question .
He says business taxes are too high and â€œthe solutions to the problems we have today are not a tax increase.â€ � Bush takes the tax question .
68 % of Americans believe that the richest should pay higher taxes , Muir says .
Does Bush agree ?
Iâ€ ™
d like to see more millionaires .
I think we need to grow more millionaires ...
this notion that weâ€ ™ re undertaxed as a nation is just foolhardy .
The three biggest questions in America right now , apparently : Google Trends also tells us that searches for â€œIs Ben Carson still running for President?â€ � went up by 275 % around the beginning of tonightâ€ ™ s debate ... back when this happened :
This , too : Unlike Marco Rubio , frontrunner Donald Trump has not taken too many direct assaults , or â€œincomingâ€ � as he calls it in his speeches , so far tonight , points out Ben Jacobs in Manchester .
However , Trump reacted shakily to a question about eminent domain , the power of the government to seize property for â€œpublic useâ€ � .
While its use is not controversial for government projects like roads or bridges , it is for economic development projects led by private property owners .
In particular , Trump has been criticized for trying to have an elderly womanâ€ ™ s house in Atlantic City seized for a limousine parking lot for one of his casinos .
Jeb Bush used the opportunity to draw blood .
He insisted to Trump â€œa limousine parking lot for his casinos is not a public useâ€ � .
Bush went on to brag that , in Florida , â€œbased on what we did we made that impossible as part of the constitution.â€ �
Trump used the opportunity to mock Bush as â€œa tough guy , â€ � and held a single finger to his lips to urge Bush to be quiet .
This set off a cascade of boos from the audience which Trump welcomed .
Instead of rebutting Bush on the facts , Trump used the opportunity to play the villain to the crowd as if he was a heel in professional wrestling .
â€œAll of his donors and special interests , you know has tickets , â€ � the real estate mogul said .
â€œThe reason they are not loving me is because I donâ€ ™ t want their moneyâ€ � as the audience kept on booing .
Christie is asked about Kasich questioning his success at creating jobs in New Jersey .
He says Kasich deserves credit for his record on jobs .
But unfortunately Johnâ€ ™ s using old numbers , he says .
â€œNew Jersey had its best year of job growth in the last 15 years this year , â€ � Christie says .
Then Christie tries to get another hit on Rubio .
Heâ€ ™ s dinged .
But he keeps talking .
â€œHe acts as if heâ€ ™ s somehow disembodied from his bill ... it was his bill .
It was his idea.â€ � â€œI like my record .
And by the way , I like Governor Kasichâ€ ™ s record too , heâ€
™ s a good governor.â€
�
Turns into a bit of a love fest between Kasich and Christie .
Kasich says common - sense regulations , lower taxes and a fiscal plan to balance the budget are the keys to economic growth , and he has put in place all three in Ohio .
It was evident within minutes of the debate that Marco Rubio had walked on to the stage with a target on his back , writes Sabrina Siddiqui in Manchester , with the Florida senatorâ€ ™
s
rivals seeking to halt his momentum ahead of Tuesdayâ€ ™ s primary .
And Rubio , in arguably his weakest moment in any debate thus far , struggled to fend off an early attack from New Jersey governor Chris Christie over his relative inexperience .
Asked to defend himself against criticism that he has a thin resume for the nationâ€ ™ s top job , Rubio quickly cited some of his accomplishments in the US Senate before pivoting to Joe Biden .
The vice president , Rubio said , â€œhas been around for 1,000 yearsâ€ � and would not be fit to be commander in chief .
â€œMarco ,
you shouldnâ€ ™ t compare yourself to Joe Biden , â€ �
Christie said , before pointing out Rubio named as an achievement passing sanctions against Hezebollah despite skipping the vote on the actual legislation .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s not leadership , thatâ€ ™ s truancy .
I like Marco â€
¦
but he simply does not have the experience to be president of the United States.â€ � Rubio initially sought to fight back by going after Christieâ€
™ s record in New Jersey , a state that has under his stewardship undergone several credit downgrades .
But the Florida senator quickly pivoted to his talking points about Obama , going on to repeat the same answer three times in a row in a brutal back - and - forth with Christie .
Although Rubio took a few shots at Christie , charging that the governor was â€œshamedâ€ � into leaving the campaign trail to tend to New Jersey after a recent snow storm , Rubio took on the form of a broken record .
The senatorâ€ ™ s inability to regain his control fed directly into the notion pushed by his Republican opponents that he sticks relentlessly to the same set of talking points .
Jeb Bush , the former Florida governor , also chimed in to make the case that Rubio was ultimately untested .
â€œMarco Rubio is a gifted , gifted politician , and he may have the skills to be president of the United States , â€ � Bush said .
â€œBut we tried it with Barack Obama.â€
� Now for Trump
: How many jobs would you create in the first term , and how ?
Trump does not even come close to saying : â€œI will bring jobs back from China .
I will bring jobs back from Japan .
I will bring jobs back from Mexico .
â€œIâ€ ™ m gon na bring jobs back , and Iâ€ ™ m gon na start bringing them back very fast .
â€œWe will bring back trillions of dollars from offshore.â€ � Assertion , assertion , assertion .
Theyâ€ ™ re back !
Here goes Kasich .
He was endorsed by the New York Times â€ “
no recommendation in the eyes of the right .
How would you change conservatism ?
heâ€
™ s asked .
Kasich points out that the New York Times said â€œHeâ€ ™ s certainly not a moderate.â€ � â€œIn America
, conservatism should mean not only that some rise with conservative principles , but everybody should rise.â€ �
Trump gets the same question .
â€œTo me
I view the word conservative as derivative of the word conserve .
We want to conserve our money .
We want to conserve our worth ...
We want to conserve our country.â€ �
Rubio : â€œI think conservatism is about three thingsâ€ � : 1/ Limited government .
2/ Free enterprise .
3/ Strong national defense .
â€œThatâ€
™ s
conservatism , â€ � he concludes .
Good answer !
Commercial break , after a solid hour .
Whoâ€ ™ s winning ?
What do you think of those Christie - Rubio fireworks ?
What about that booing of the crowd of Donald Trump ?
Did Bush actually land a punch ?
Whereâ€ ™ s Kasich tonight ?
Why didnâ€ ™ t
Carson walk onto the stage when he was called ?
Did Cruz escape from the first few tough questions about how everybody else on stage thinks heâ€ ™ s been very naughty ?
Next question on eminent domain â€ “ the seizure of private property for the greater good , ostensibly .
Does Trump see eminent domain as a legit way to take property ?
â€œSo many people have hit me with commercials .
Eminent domain is an absolute necessity for a country .
For our country .
Without it you wouldnâ€ ™ t have roads ...
you wouldnâ€ ™ t have bridges ,
â€ �
Trump says .
â€œThe Keystone Pipeline without eminent domain , it wouldnâ€ ™ t go ten feet .
â€œWhen eminent domain is used on somebodyâ€ ™ s property , that person gets a fortune ... without eminent domain , you donâ€ ™ t have roads highways schools hospitals - none of it.â€ � Bush hits Trump , describing the â€œdifference between eminent domain for public purposeâ€ � and private purposes .
â€œWhat Donald Trump did was try to take the property of an elderly woman in Atlantic City to turn it into a limousine parking lot for his casino , â€ � BUsh says .
Then Bush and Trump really spark â€ “ and the crowd turns on Trump .
â€œJeb wants to be a tough guy .
He wants to be a tough guy .
I didnâ€
™ t take the property.â€
�
Then Trump straight - up shushes Bush : â€œHe wants to be a tough guy .
Let me talk .
Quiet.â€ � Trump is booed .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s all of his donors and special interests out there.â€ � Booed .
â€œWe needed tickets .
You canâ€ ™ t get them .
You know who has the tickets .
Donors , special interests.â€ �
Trump booed and booed and booed .
Cruz takes the question and talks and talks .
Then Carson gets the question about what to do about and with Obamacare .
â€œI was hoping to get the chance to talk about North Korea , â€ � Carson says .
But he lets it go .
â€œI have proposed a health empowerment account system ...
[from birth to death ] we pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional health care with .
Each family basically becomes its own insurance company without a middleman.â€ � â€œGo to my web site , BenCarson.com , and read about it.â€ �
Trumpâ€ ™ s asked whether , with his past support for some kind of universal health care system , he isnâ€ ™ t close - ish to Vermont senator Bernie Sanders on the issue .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think I am .
I think Iâ€ ™ m closer to common sense .
We are going to repeal Obamacare .
We are going to replace it with something so much better . ..
The insurance companies are getting rich on Obamacare ..
weâ€ ™ re going to end
it.â€
�
He says he could pull it off because heâ€ ™ s not bought and sold by the insurance lobby .
He does not mention the Congress that would have to draft and pass whatever new law heâ€ ™ s talking about .
Then Trump gets strangely ...
real :
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a certain number people who will be on the street dying .
As a Republican , I donâ€ ™ t want that to happen .
You canâ€
™ t have people dying on the street .
Youâ€ ™ re not going to let people die sitting in the middle of the street , in any city in this country.â€ �
Christie gets to punch Rubio again !
â€œHe
didnâ€
™ t answer the question , â€ � Christie says .
Heâ€ ™ s applauded .
The crowd likes his critique of Rubioâ€ ™ s rhetoric .
â€œThe question was did he fight for his legislation ?
Itâ€ ™ s abundantly clear that he didnâ€ ™ t , â€ � Christie says .
â€œ ...
The fact of the matter is , a leader has to fight , not to handicap it and say if I canâ€ ™ t handle it , Iâ€ ™ ll run .
Thatâ€ ™ s not leadership , thatâ€ ™ s
Congress.â€
�
Rubioâ€ ™ s apt retort : â€œLeadership is about solving the problem.â€ �
Rubio is asked about the â€œGang of 8â€ � immigration bill , which provided a path to citizenship for some undocumented migrants .
Rubio gives his usual answer , which is that his legislation didnâ€ ™ t work .
For some reason this is seen as a viable defense .
â€œHereâ€ ™ s the bottom line : We canâ€ ™ t get that legislation passed , â€ � Rubio says .
Then he calls for a secure border .
â€œDid you fight for the legislation at the time , or did you run from it?â€ � follow - up question .
â€œWell the legislation passed [ the senate ] , but it has no support!â€ � Rubio says .
On to Cruz .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to build a wall!â€ � he says .
Trump reacts with a huge eyeroll and waved arms .
He recognizes the policy proposal .
Itâ€ ™ s familiar from somewhere .
â€œSince Donald enjoyed that , I will simply say that weâ€ ™ ve got somebody in mind to build it , â€ � Cruz quips .
Cruz is pressed : What about the families ?
â€œWhat you do is enforce the law , â€ � Cruz says .
He says under federal immigration law , if someone is here illegally they should be deported .
â€œEnforcing the law is feasible , what is missing is the political will.â€
�
On to immigration .
Kasich gets the question .
No commercial breaks for this crew .
Maybe they couldnâ€ ™ t sell any ads against this .
Kasich is asked whether he disagrees with Rebuplican voters on the topic of immigration .
â€œWe have to have practical solutions , â€ � Kasich says .
â€œWe have to finish the border ..
the country has to be able to lock its doors.â€ �
Then Kasich says he supports legal status for undocumented migrants who pay back taxes and other fines .
Out of step with Republican voters .
â€œTaking a mom and dad out of a house who havenâ€ ™ t commited a crime since theyâ€ ™ ve been here ?
Leaving the children in the house?â€ � says Kasich .
â€œThat is not in my opinion the kind of values we believe in.â€
�
Next to Christie : Would you negotiate with North Korea ?
He says he learned as a federal prosecutor , â€œYou never pay ransom to the criminals.â€ �
â€œThey do not understand anything but toughness and strength ..
we need to engage with the Chinese .
â€œThis president and his secretary of state are for paying ransom for hostages.â€ � Not true , in serial publicly known cases , in Syria at least .
Trump is asked if he has any red lines on North Korea .
He says he disagrees with Rubioâ€ ™ s assessment of Obama as intelligent .
â€œI think he has no idea
what heâ€ ™ s doing , and our countryâ€ ™ s going to hell.â€ �
He says he deals with the Chinese â€œall the time.â€
�
â€œThey have absolute practical control of North Korea , â€ � he says .
â€œI would get on with China .
Let them solve that problem.â€ �
Rubio gets the question back , and says North Korea should go back on the list of terrorist nations .
But he seems , ever so slightly , shaken , perhaps wounded from Christieâ€ ™ s abrasions earlier , pointed directly at what Rubio usually does so well , which is speak .
Hereâ€ ™ s a brief round - up of Twitter reaction to that bizarre opening : A tweet just before the debate from the Observerâ€ ™ s Michael Cohen seems eerily prescient ...
Kasich finally gets the mic , on the North Korea question .
â€œWell weâ€ ™ ve got to step up the pressure ,
â€ � he says .
Then he critiques the conversation that came before .
â€œEvery one of my 100 town hall meetings in New Hampshire were a lot more fun than what we saw here.â€ �
Kasich calls for sanctions on North Korea , a la Iran .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve got to be very tough on this .
I think we couldâ€ ™ ve let the Japanese know , that if you want to take action , you will have our support .
â€œWe can not continue to be weak in the face of North Korea and the rest of the world.â€ �
Cruz is asked about the North Korea ballistic missile launch announced just before the debate began .
Cruz says the launch is the fault of the first Clinton administration , and the easing of sanctions on North Korea negotiated by Wendy Sherman who â€ “ Cruz notes significantly â€ “ also led negotiations on the Iran deal .
Then Cruz jumps into the electromagnetic pulse exploding satellite scenario .
EMP !
The Republicansâ€ ™ favorite doomsday scenario .
Cruz is asked whether he would blast a North Korean launch from afar .
Cruz replies that he doesnâ€ ™ t have the intelligence .
Then he says the North Korean threat points to the danger of the Iranian nuclear deal .
Heâ€
™ s applauded .
Jeb Bush gets the floor .
He beats on Rubio too , saying that Barack Obama was another young senator who was good at speaking but couldnâ€ ™ t lead .
But that came at the end of a minutes - long Bush speech that did not live up to the drama that had come before .
Rubio says under Christie in New Jersey , his stateâ€ ™ s credit rating was downgraded nine times .
Then Christie seriously lifts the curtain on Rubio , trying to reveal a tiny Wizard behind the mighty Oz .
â€œThatâ€
™ s what Washington DC does .
The drive - by shot at the beginning , with incorrect information , and then the memorized 25-second speech that his advisers gave him , â€ � Christie says .
â€œThe 30 second speech doesnâ€ ™ t solve one problem.â€ �
Rubio jumps back in and says Christie did not want to go back for the snowstorm that hit New Jersey two weeks ago .
Go back from New Hampshire campaigning .
Then Rubio shifts to attacking Barack Obama .
Christie is not letting up .
Truly great guns .
And Christie appears to be winning , heâ€ ™ s applauded while Rubio is ... booed ?
â€œThere it is .
There it is .
The memorized 25-second speech .
There it is everybody , â€ � says Christie .
Cheers .
Rubio : â€œYou didnâ€ ™ t want to go back!â€
�
Christie : â€œIs that one of the skills you get as a United States senator , ESP also?â€ � Big cheers !
Christie attacks Rubio directly : â€œYou have not been involved in a consequential decision , where you had to be held accountable , you just simply havenâ€ ™ t.â€
�
The crowd goes ooooh .
The Republicans are taking a cue from the Democrats here , trading real punches .
Christie says Rubio wasnâ€ ™ t even around to vote on the Hezbollah sanctions act , which Rubio listed as an accomplishment .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s not leadership , thatâ€ ™ s
truancy.â€ �
Rubio is asked what successes he has to show in his years in electoral politics that show heâ€ ™ s ready to be president .
He skims through his work in Florida , including protecting the VA .
If the presidency becomes electing the people who have been in Congress the longest , we should rally around Joe Biden .
Heâ€
™ s been in Congress a thousand years .
Carson rebuts Cruz .
He points out that CNN corrected its report on Twitter in One Minute - not hours later as Cruz said .
â€œWhat happened to that one is unclear , â€ � Carson says .
â€œEverybody can see what happen and you can make your own judgments.â€ � Cruzâ€ ™ s offense in question was to allow his camp to send an email saying that Carson had withdrawn .
â€œWhen this transpired
I apologized to him then , and I do so now .
Ben , Iâ€ ™ m sorry , â€ �
Cruz says .
Cruz blames CNN , Jake Tapper and Dana Bash by name .
â€œMy political team saw CNNâ€ ™ s report , breaking news , and they forwarded this report to volunteers ...
I knew nothing about this.â€ �
Then he says his staff should have double - checked the report .
Carson is asked about his campâ€ ™ s assessment of Cruzâ€ ™ s Iowa shenanigans as being â€œdeceitful.â€ � â€œWhen
I wasnâ€ ™ t introduced number two as the plan I thought that maybe you thought that Iâ€ ™ d already dropped out , â€ � Carson quips .
Then Carson invokes Reagan , the birthday boy .
â€œHis 11th commandment was not to speak ill of another Republican ...
Iâ€ ™ m not going to savage the reputation of Ted Cruz ...
I was very disappointed that members of his team thought so little of me ... to think that I would just walk away ten minutes before the caucus , and just say forget about you guys â€ “ who would do something like that?â€ �
He calls it â€œa good example of Washington ethics.â€ �
Cruz takes the question .
â€œI am convinced anyone standing on this stage would make a much better commander in chief than Barack Obama or Hillary clinton or Bernie Sanders , â€ �
Cruz says .
Cruz is pressed about specifically questioning Trumpâ€ ™ s temperament , specifically .
â€œI think that is an assessment the voters are going to make , and theyâ€ ™ re going to make it of each and every one of us , â€ � Cruz waffles .
Trump is leering at him .
â€œFirst of all I respect what Ted just said .
But if you noticed , he didnâ€ ™ t answer your question .
And thatâ€ ™ s whatâ€ ™ s going to happen with our enemies ...
weâ€ ™ re gon na win with Trump .
And people back down with Trump.â€ �
Trump uses Cruz as a stand - in for China and Mexico under the Trump candidacy .
The debate starts with Trump asked about Cruz saying
Trump would â€œnuke
Denmarkâ€
� if he were president .
â€œI actually think I have the best temperament ,
â€ �
Trump says .
He says heâ€ ™ s gotten along with people for â€œyears and years.â€ �
He points out , correctly , that he broke the ice for Republicans on immigration and other signpost issues in this campaign .
â€œI talked about Muslims .
We have a problem .
Nobody else wanted to mention the problem.â€ �
Trump says his opposition to the Iraq war proves his calm .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not one with the trigger .
Other people up here believe me would be a lot faster.â€
� Muir has to specifically ask Carson to take the stage .
And he finally ... does .
Then the moderators forget to introduce Kasich .
Christie reminds them .
Here comes Kasich .
Action !
Well that part was difficult .
But now they are all safely installed behind the lecterns .
In the moderatorsâ€ ™ defense , that was a seriously strange curveball from Carson , with the collusion of Trump .
The candidates are being introduced .
First is Chris Christie , who storms the stage like a bull .
Second is Dr Ben Carson ... who extremely awkwardly lingers offstage .
Carson is not moving .
A producer is trying to wave him onto the stage .
What is happening ?
Carson refuses to take the stage .
There goes Bush .
Trump has stopped to talk with Carson .
Ha !
Thereâ€ ™ re Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain , doing Statler and Waldorf , the beloved Muppet peanut gallery , in an ABC News promo for the debate .
Short spot :
McCain : I donâ€
™ t think this one will be very good , Lindsey .
Graham : Whyâ€ ™ s that ?
McCain :
Because weâ€ ™ re not in it .
Guess who was born on 6 February ?
A certain Republican president who just might receive some birthday wishes from the stage in Manchester :
Donald Trump canâ€ ™ t emphasize enough his excitement to join tonightâ€
™ s debate , after skipping the last one , in New Hampshire â€
“ after he cancelled an event here Friday on account of snow .
Very exciting !
More exclamation points ! ! !
The chairman of the Democratic National Committee accuses the Republican party of seeking to conceal their debate tonight by scheduling it ... on the weekend with the heaviest TV viewership of the year , Super Bowl weekend .
Particularly befuddling given the Democratsâ€ ™ original plan to host only six debates , and scheduling the majority on weekend nights over three - day holiday weekends .
Seriously ?
With the onward rush of the Republican debate cycle itâ€ ™ s easy to lose the narrative thread ( could it be that thereâ€ ™ s actually no thread ? ) .
For those in whom the untraceable twists induce a sense of malaise â€ “ we refer you to our live coverage of the previous debate , which we summarized like so : The knives were out for Texas senator Ted Cruz , who is polling second behindTrump in Iowa .
Florida senator Marco Rubio said Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign was built on a â€œlieâ€ � of shifting positions for votes .
It was a substantive debate .
Body cameras for police , Libya , Iran , Kim Davis , mental illness , Bridgegate , immigration , Isis , Obamacare , veteransâ€ ™ affairs , Bill Clintonâ€ ™ s affairs â€
“
it was all in there .
Speaking of shifting positions , the moderators strived to pin Cruz and Rubio down on immigration , using video medleys of their most blatant calls for a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants to prove that they had in the past supported a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants .
The pair waffled .

Read the full piece here : Did you sleep through the week in politics ?
Hereâ€ ™ s what you missed : Marco Rubio won Iowa by coming in third , everybody ganged up on actual winner Ted Cruz , Donald Trump threw a Twitter fit and said he was robbed , the Democrats staged an unusually pugnacious debate , and Jeb Bush was reduced to pleading for applause .
Itâ€ ™ s all right here in our two - minute video roundup : Gloria Steinem appears to have offended a large group of Bernie Sanders supporters by suggesting that his young female supporters are only backing the senator because of â€œboysâ€ � , Adam Gabbatt reports from North Hampton , New Hampshire .
The feminist writer and activist made the comments on Bill Maherâ€ ™ s show on Friday .
Steinem suggested young women prefered Sanders to Hillary Clinton because : Women are more for [ Clinton ] than men are .
Men tend to get more conservative because they gain power as they age , women get more radical because they lose power as they age .
Theyâ€ ™ re going to get more activist as they grow older .
And when youâ€ ™ re younger , you think : â€˜Where are the boys ?
The boys are with Bernie.â€ ™ Many young female Sanders supporters were unhappy with this characterization .
â€œGloria
Steinemâ€ ™ s statement was the worst kind of sweeping generalization Iâ€ ™ ve heard in years about women my age , â€ � said Moumita Ahmed , 25 .
She has been campaigning for Sanders as one of the leaders of the Millenials for Bernie movement .
â€œI was hurt because I consider her to be an icon of the feminist movement , â€ � she continued .
â€œI identify as a feminist .
Iâ€ ™ m not sure how she could admit us young women are graduating with more debt and earning less money
, then say young women are supporting Bernie Sanders to impress all the boys.â€ � Tennessee Thomas , 31 , has been hosting Sanders campaigning events at her shop
The Deep End Club in
New York Cityâ€ ™ s East Village .
She was similarly unimpressed .
â€œI am supporting Bernie Sanders because of where he stands on the issues , â€ �
she said .
â€œIt wasnâ€ ™ t a good statement .
The left needs to unify .
We should be allowed to support who we want without attacking each other.â€ �
She added : â€œI could list a million reasons why I prefer Bernie to Hillary .
She supported the KXL pipeline , was in favor of TPP and opposed gay rights until 3 years ago.â€

A tweet from Sanders on Saturday may have been a response to the controversy : Donâ€ ™ t believe in TV ?
You can watch tonightâ€
™ s debate on your computer on the ABC web site : Behind the scenes of the Republican debate â€ ¦ with reporters .
Guardian political reporter Ben Jacobs does a walking tour of the arena at Saint Anselm College in Manchester , New Hampshire .
NB :
Benâ€ ™ s peers filmed the video on Periscope , so mobile users need the app .
On a computer it should work fine , though .
Hello and welcome to our livewire coverage of the eighth Republican presidential debate of the 2016 cycle .
The action tonight is happening in snowy Manchester , New Hampshire .
Guardian political reporters Sabrina Siddiqui and Ben Jacobs are at the scene .
Tonight marks the return to the debate stage of polling frontrunner Donald Trump , who skipped last monthâ€ ™ s debate in Des Moines , Iowa , because host network Fox News hurt his feelings .
Trump ended up finishing second in Iowa , despite leading the polling averages in the run - up to the caucuses .
With just three days to go until New Hampshireâ€ ™ s first - in - the - nation primary contest , Trump enjoys an even stronger polling lead than he had in Iowa .
But his rivals , notably Ohio governor John Kasich and Florida senator Marco Rubio , have been gaining ground .
Ted Cruz , the winner in Iowa , has slipped a bit in the most recent New Hampshire polls , owing perhaps to voter wariness of aggressive Cruz campaign tactics in Iowa that retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson decried as â€œdirty tricksâ€ � and un - Christian besides .
Weâ€ ™ ll see whether and how that mini - drama plays out tonight .
Rounding out the field are former Florida governor Jeb Bush and New Jersey governor Chris Christie , both of whom have staked their campaigns on a strong New Hampshire showing â€ “ though thereâ€ ™ s reason to doubt their strategies are working .
Thereâ€ ™ s no â€œundercardâ€ � debate tonight â€ “
we commiserate with you about that â€ “
and so in just a half hourâ€ ™ s time it will be directly to the main proceedings .
If you make it through the debate , thereâ€ ™ s a special reward : weâ€ ™ re going to watch Bernie Sanders face off against Larry David on Saturday Night Live .
David is leading in the polls but Sanders has a better ground game ?
But more seriously â€ “ is Trump really on track to take New Hampshire ?
Who needs to shine tonight ?
Whoâ€ ™ s overrated / underrated ?
Let us know in the comments !
And thanks for joining us on your pre - Super - Bowl Saturday .

2016-02-10,"â€œIâ€ ™ m disappointed with tonight , â€ � Marco Rubio told supporters after his underwhelming performance in the New Hamshire primary on Tuesday .
â€œBut I want to tell you that disappointment is not on you , â€ � the Florida senator said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s on me .
Itâ€ ™ s on me.â€ �
Rubio had stumbled badly in the last Republican presidential debate , giving a robotic performance in a critical exchange with New Jersey governor Chris Christie just two days before voters took to the polls .
And despite Rubio and his teamâ€ ™ s best efforts to brush the moment aside , the senator acknowledged as the results rolled in that it mattered .
â€œI did not do well on Saturday night , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œSo listen to this : that will never happen again.â€
�
The crowd of voters and volunteers erupted at first in disagreement , seeking to cheer him on despite his lackluster showing .
But they quickly broke into thunderous applause as he switched gears to a more optimistic outlook .
â€œTonight we did not wind up where we wanted to be , but that does not change where we are going to wind up at the end of this process , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œNot all days are going to be great days , â€ � he added .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re not always going to get things the way we want , but in the end Iâ€ ™ m confident that not only will this campaign be successful , but America will be successful as well.â€ �
It was a strikingly humble concession speech from a candidate who arrived in New Hampshire riding a wave of momentum after a strong showing in the Iowa caucuses .
Before the fateful debate , Rubio looked poised to consolidate support for his candidacy by crowding out the so - called establishment lane all vying to emerge as an alternative to frontrunners Donald Trump and Ted Cruz .
But a contentious back - and - forth with Christie on Saturday at the debate got the best of Rubio , who had until then flourished in most debates .
The New Jersey governor needled Rubio over his relative inexperience , essentially portraying the first - term senator as a scripted , empty suit married to the same set of talking points .
Somewhat inexplicably , Rubio played directly into the attack by repeating the same line at least four times in response .
Rubio and his aides sought to mitigate the damage by focusing not on his repetition , but the essence of his attack on Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s agenda for the country .
But the narrative had been set , and it showed even as early exit polls from New Hampshire trickled in .
Nearly two - thirds of respondents said the most recent debates had affected their decision , according to one poll .
Another found that just under half of Republican primary voters valued experience when casting their vote , whereas only 11 % prioritized electability â€ “ the latter of which has been at the core of Rubioâ€ ™ s closing argument .
The energy among Rubioâ€ ™ s supporters remained palpable as the senator addressed the room .
Chants of â€œMar - co ! Mar - co!â€ � rang out several times , and boos were even offered when Rubio informed the crowd he had called Trump â€ “ the winner of the New Hampshire primary â€ “ to congratulate him .
â€œNo no
, he worked hard , â€ �
Rubio told them .
â€œHe earned it.â€
�
The senator then centered much of his speech on the core themes of his campaign , through which he has charted one of the more rapid political ascensions in recent years .
Speaking of his father , a Cuban immigrant who worked as a bartender , Rubio waxed poetic on the essence of the American Dream and his view of what the election was about .
â€œI am confident that when this process is done , this nation will rediscover and re - embrace the principles that made her great , â€ � he said .
Looking ahead to the next contest , now all the more critical for his presidential ambitions , Rubio concluded : â€œSouth Carolina , weâ€ ™ re on our way.â€ �"
2016-02-16,"While Marco Rubio took the stage inside a barn flanked by two South Carolina lawmakers who like him were once seen as the future of the Republican party , two hours south - east in North Charleston Jeb Bush focused on the past , with his brother George W Bush joining him for the first time on the campaign trail .
The candidates jockeying to emerge as an alternative to Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have struggled to break through in a primary season that has thus far rewarded anger over optimism , and a failure to win over South Carolinaâ€ ™ s conservative electorate might cause the race to winnow down to a two - man contest between deeply polarizing figures regarded as unpalatable by the partyâ€ ™ s top ranks .
In searching for ways to seal the deal with those voters still willing to give them a look , Rubio and Bush arrived in the state attempting to create sharper contrasts to underscore what is at stake , focusing on their opponentsâ€ ™ lack of civility , dirty campaign tactics and , in Trumpâ€ ™ s case , perceived lack of religious conviction .
â€œI promise you , if youâ€ ™ re a parent , you are not going to have to put your hands over the ears of your children at any time today , â€ �
Congressman Trey Gowdy told a couple hundred people who had packed into a barn on a tree farm in Gilbert to see Rubio .
The crowd , recognizing immediately the reference to Trumpâ€ ™ s recent headline - grabbing use of profanity , hooted in agreement .
When Rubio grabbed the mic moments later , he looked anything but diminished despite a disappointing fifth - place showing in New Hampshire .
Criss - crossing the state with Gowdy and Senator Tim Scott in tow , Rubio hit the trail encouraged by positive reviews for his most recent debate performance on Saturday â€ “ a much - needed return to form after his now - infamous encounter with New Jersey governor Chris Christie in the previous debate .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a reason I get attacked by every other Republican , â€ �
Rubio had explained to voters at an earlier town hall in Rock Hill .
â€œBecause we draw voters from them , because we can speak to every part of our party.â€
�
The Florida senator emphasized what he said was a 15-year record of applying conservative principles in public service .
And , on the other side of town , George W Bush similarly touted his brother Jebâ€ ™ s conservative bona fides as the candidate continued to attack Trump .
George W Bush echoed his brotherâ€ ™ s criticism of the Republican frontrunner on Monday , telling the crowd : â€œI understand Americans are angry and frustrated .
But we do not need somebody in the Oval Office who mirrors and inflames our anger and frustration.â€
�
The elder Bush brother also rejected the label of â€œestablishmentâ€ � that his brother â€ “ along with Rubio and Ohio governor John Kasich â€ “ has been identified as belonging to .
â€œIf being president of the United States makes me part of the establishment , â€ � Bush said , â€œwell , I proudly carry that label.â€ � Quoting his father , former president George HW Bush , he added : â€œLabels are for soup cans.â€ �
Cruz and Trump are riding high after resounding victories in Iowa and New Hampshire , respectively , and Trump is leading the polls in South Carolina , with Cruz second .
At the other end of the spectrum are Jeb Bush and Kasich , facing an uphill battle in terms of resources and the ability to expand their appeal among the more conservative wing of the party ; Kasichâ€ ™ s decision to start the week campaigning in the more moderate terrain of Michigan instead of South Carolina seemed to be an acknowledgement of this .
Meanwhile Rubio , seeking to revive the momentum he lost in New Hampshire , continued to claim a spot somewhere in between .
Despite his disappointing performance in that primary , the senator insists he is uniquely positioned to bridge the gap within the party and win the general election .
Speaking to reporters aboard his campaign bus on Monday , Rubio took aim at both Cruz and Trump as candidates whose support has a ceiling . â€œTed is not someone who can bring the party together ; heâ€ ™ s not someone who can grow the party , â€ � Rubio said , adding of Trump : â€œHeâ€ ™ s obviously got a message
thatâ€ ™ s resonated with some people ... but ultimately you also have to be able to unite our party .
â€œWe have to be able to take our conservative principles â€ “ not water them down â€
“ but convince more people to vote conservative.â€
�
He echoed one of his themes from the stump , warning voters what the consequences might be if the party allowed itself to be engulfed by â€œRepublican - on - Republican violenceâ€ � rather than keeping its sights focused on retaking the White House after eight years .
â€œWe can not lose this election , and we can not win if we are divided against each other , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œThe Democrats would pay us to continue to fight against each other well into October .
When I am our nominee , I will bring the party and the conservative movement together.â€
�
Blair Shropshire , a voter who came to see Rubio in Rock Hill on Monday morning , was mostly convinced .
For him , it was down to the Florida senator or Kasich â€ “ even if the governor was not competing strongly in the southern states .
â€œHe has a very good track record in Ohio , and I like his unifying message , â€ � Shropshire said , while adding his appreciation for the fact that neither Kasich nor Rubio appeared to attack their rivals unless prompted .
â€œI think Rubio has the best shot of defeating Hillary
[ Clinton],â€ �
he said .
â€œI
just hope he can overtake Trump and
Cruz.â€ �"
2016-02-16,"Donald Trump has upped his attacks on his Republican rivals at a rally in South Carolina , describing Ted Cruz as â€œa very dishonest personâ€ � and launching a bizarre rant about Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s â€œexcessive sweatingâ€ � .
Trump didnâ€
™ t mention his earlier threat to sue Cruz at the event in Greenville , but again characterized the Texas senator as â€œunstableâ€ � before accusing Marco Rubio of a level of perspiration that would cause problems for diplomacy .
â€œWhen we get in with Putin we need people that donâ€
™ t sweat , â€ � Trump said .
His remarks were received by a packed house , however some supporters were literally left out in the cold after being moved to a drafty overflow room that lacked chairs and a large - screen TV .
The discontent in the bowels of the TD convention center went unnoticed by Trump , who delivered a 45-minute speech focusing on his familiar topics of immigration , walls , and the ability to negotiate .
The Republican frontrunner targeted Cruz as â€œa liarâ€ � during a riff on drug prices .
He again called Cruz â€œunstableâ€ � during a section of his speech discussing the recent GOP debate .
Trump also attacked Rubio , whom he accused of excess sweating during the recent Republican debate .
â€œI thought he just came out of a swimming pool ,
â€ �
Trump said of the Florida senator .
He said that Rubioâ€ ™ s perspiration could make foreign relations difficult .
â€œCan you imagine Putin sitting there and waiting for the meeting and this guy walks in and heâ€ ™ s like a wreck ?
â€œNo , you got to have Trump walk into that meeting folks , weâ€ ™ ll do very nicely.â€
�
About 10,000 people were in the TD convention center , according to some reports .
During his speech Trump said some 3,000 supporters had been turned away from the ticket - only event .
He mentioned there were â€œsomething about the same amountâ€ � of people downstairs â€ “ in the overflow area .
The reality was rather different .
By the end of his speech there were perhaps 200 people still in the area .
Trump had mentioned in his speech the possibility of doing a second speech to those turned away .
But , when his speech finished , those in the overflow room hurried for their cars .
And , unlike Rubio , they werenâ€ ™ t sweating after their experience in the cold convention center basement .
â€œI think this is a joke .
We feel so disrespected .
There is no way I would vote for him now , â€ � said Sharon Jacobs , an erstwhile Trump supporter from Greenville .
She had purchased her ticket days earlier but arrived to be told the center was already full .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve never seen anything so poorly put together , â€ �
she said .
Jacobs had come to the event with her sister - in - law Linda Dezzi , who was similarly unimpressed .
â€œI know who wonâ€ ™ t be getting my vote ,
â€ �
Dezzi said .
The pair left rather than watch Trumpâ€ ™ s speech .
Lisa Searfoss had travelled from Piedmont and was unhappy with Trump .
â€œIâ€ ™ m pissed off at him now ,
â€ �
she said as she left just as his speech began .
Asked what she intended to do , Searfoss said : â€œLook at some of the other candidates.â€ �
Searfoss said she had booked her ticket for the Trump event two weeks ago .
She did not think the overflow area had been well organized .
â€œItâ€ ™ s smaller than the TV Iâ€ ™ ve got at home ,
â€ � she said ."
2016-02-16,"Ted Cruz was forced to pull a campaign ad after it was discovered that one of the actors in the video had previously appeared in soft pornography , while his Republican presidential rival Marco Rubio announced that it was â€œmorning in Americaâ€ � with a clip of Vancouver , Canada .
But Rubio and Cruz are far from the only presidential hopefuls to run advertisements featuring flubs or misinformation .
Hereâ€ ™ s a look at some of the ads their competitors on both sides of the aisle are currently running , many of which are even more problematic .
A recent clip promoting John Kasich suggests that he is capable of cramming an entire sleeve of Ritz crackers into his mouth and then whistling the Battle Hymn of the Republic â€ “ a feat that Kasich has repeatedly failed to pull off on the campaign trail and throughout his time in office as governor of Ohio .
Last month , an advertisement released in hopes of reviving Jeb Bushâ€ ™ s floundering presidential campaign mistakenly included Bush family home video of the teenage Jeb getting both of his hands caught in mousetraps , then getting both feet caught while trying to free himself .
A new television spot promoting Bernie Sanders to younger voters begins with Sanders claiming he is capable of performing a flawless frontside nose grind on his skateboard , but then in the ensuing ad Sanders only pulls off a few 50 - 50 grinds and a sort of sloppy kickflip .
Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s famous 3 am video from 2008 , which posited that Clinton was the best and most experienced candidate to handle any emergency situation that might befall the American people , suggested that Clinton occasionally sleeps , something that has recently been disproved by one of the 26 congressional committees investigating Benghazi .
As the committee explained at a rowdy press conference on the steps of Capitol Hill and in a 482-page report on the subject , Clinton does not sleep .
It is true that she must occasionally be plugged into a recharging chamber , but she is never actually unconscious at any point in that process .
Dr Ben Carson , onetime frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination , has released several advertisements targeting Doozers , those little green creatures from the television series Fraggle Rock .
In the ads , which Carson self - financed , he refers to the Doozers as â€œthe adorable backbone of the American infrastructureâ€ � and promises to keep them safe from Gargamel â€ ¦ who discerning consumers of childrenâ€ ™ s entertainment might know is actually the nemesis to the Smurfs , which is a completely different show .
Donald Trump has released several videos claiming that he is the only candidate who can â€œmake America great againâ€ � .
Although that is indisputably true , the commercials also suggest that Trump is a human man , and not â€ “ as is actually the case â€ “ a mass of orange clay molded into human form and given life through that ectoplasm from Ghostbusters 2 that responds to negative emotions .
A recent advertisement released only in Canada and Cuba by Cruz suggests that if he became president , his Canadian birthright and Cuban parentage would automatically make him prime minister of Canada and president of Cuba too , leading to a union - of - the - crowns - style merging of the US , Canada and Cuba .
In fact , Cubaâ€ ™ s president RaÃºl Castro has not yet agreed to this proposal ."
2016-02-17,"The simmering feud between Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz intensified in dramatic fashion on Tuesday , as accusations were hurled between the two senatorsâ€ ™ campaigns over â€œunderhanded tacticsâ€ � and an alleged â€œsmear campaignâ€ � ahead of the critical South Carolina primary on 20 February .
Rubio and Cruz , senators from Florida and Texas , respectively , are locked in a heated battle to overtake the Republican frontrunner Donald Trump .
While they have increasingly sparred over issues such as immigration and national security , Rubio has in recent days sought to undercut one of the pillars of Cruzâ€ ™ s candidacy : trust .
Speaking with reporters over lunch in Summerville , Rubio said Cruz was being deliberately dishonest with the American public .
â€œThis has been a pattern now with Ted , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œHe has spent the last two weeks literally just making stuff
up.â€
� â€œI just think itâ€ ™ s very disturbing [ that ] you can just come and make things up about people and believe no one is going to call you out on it .
And itâ€ ™ s now become a pattern , so we have to clarify that we canâ€
™ t let that stand unchallenged.â€ �
Rubio added that Cruz had misrepresented his position on a host of issues , including immigration , funding for Planned Parenthood , and same - sex marriage .
Cruz and his allies have launched a series of attacks against Rubio aimed at portraying him as insufficiently conservative â€ “ even though Rubio holds one of the most conservative records in the US Senate .
By Tuesday evening , Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign spokesman , Alex Conant , was blasting Cruz in a fundraising email with an aggressive subject line : â€œTed Cruz is a liar.â€ � â€œFirst it was lying about Marco on fundamental issues like life and marriage ; now Cruz and his supportersâ€ ™ attempts to slander and distort Marcoâ€ ™ s record have reached a new low , â€ � Conant wrote .
One ad by a pro - Cruz Super Pac was pulled down on Monday after a legal review determined it to be misleading in its charge that Rubio supported
so - called â€œsanctuary citiesâ€ � while shepherding a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013 .
Cruz also asserted that his Senate colleague shied away from standing at the forefront of the fight to defund Planned Parenthood , even though Rubio has voted numerous times to strip the womenâ€ ™ s health organization of its federal funding .
Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign also believes members of Cruzâ€ ™ s team to be behind a post that appeared on Facebook this week under the guise of Trey Gowdy , the influential South Carolina congressman who is backing
Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign .
The account , Trey Gowdy Prayers , appears to falsely speak on behalf of the Benghazi committee chairman as switching his allegiance to Cruz after determining his support for Rubio was â€œa grave
mistakeâ€ � .
Gowdy , who is campaigning across South Carolina with Rubio this week , called on Cruz to formally rebuke the tactics in a statement on Tuesday .
â€œIn the last week , we have seen a systematic effort by Senator Cruz and his allies to spread false information and outright lies in the hopes of winning votes by appealing to our lowest common denominator , â€ �
Gowdy said in reference to the Facebook incident .
â€œIâ€ ™ m demanding that Senator Cruz and his campaign repudiate these dishonest and underhanded tactics .
We can have a debate about the future of our party and our country .
But we need not leave our integrity behind.â€ �
Gowdy will also feature in new robo - calls released late on Tuesday to counter what he says are deceptive tactics by Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign .
â€œI want to alert you to the fact that voters are receiving dishonest push - polls smearing my friend Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s conservative record , â€ � Gowdy says in the call , which according to time.com will reach 500,000 South Carolina phone numbers .
While there is no direct evidence linking Cruz operatives to the misinformation , maneuvers of the sort are not uncommon in the rough - and - tumble of South Carolina politics .
In his conversation with reporters on Tuesday , Rubio implied that it would not be out of character for Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign to engage in such tactics â€ “ referring back to the night of the Iowa caucuses when Cruzâ€ ™ s staffers spread false rumors that retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson was dropping out of the race .
â€œWhat theyâ€ ™ ve been willing to do as part of their campaign
â€
¦
I think people arenâ€ ™ t going to like it the more they learn about it , â€ � Rubio said .
Rick Tyler , a spokesman for Cruz , said Rubioâ€ ™ s efforts to undermine their campaign would ultimately fail .
â€œTeam Rubio is coordinating a smear campaign , â€ �
Tyler said in a statement to the Guardian , citing the vast ground game that helped Cruz secure an overwhelming victory in the Iowa caucuses and chalk up a stronger - than - expected third - place finish in New Hampshire .
â€œMarco Rubio has resorted to name - calling and smear tactics because he canâ€ ™ t defend his record .
He doesnâ€ ™ t have a similar ground game and wonâ€ ™ t have enough money to compete in all the 1 March states like we will , so he thinks he can smear his way to winning .
But it wonâ€ ™ t work.â€ �
Cruz is nonetheless being targeted not only by Rubio but also by Trump , who holds a commanding lead in South Carolina .
In protest of a Cruz ad that highlighted the real estate mogulâ€ ™ s past as being pro - choice on abortion , Trump on Monday threatened legal action against Cruz while referring to him as â€œa totally unstable individualâ€ � .
â€œHe is the single biggest liar Iâ€ ™ ve ever come across , in politics or otherwise , â€ �
Trump said in a statement .
â€œIt is hard to believe a person who proclaims to be a Christian could be so dishonest and lie so much.â€ �
Itâ€ ™ s unclear if the knocks on Cruz , whose campaign banners bear the word â€œTrusTEDâ€ � , will stick .
At a Cruz rally in a national guard armory in Columbia , attendees dismissed the criticism as part and parcel of politics .
Voters said they were accustomed to dirtier tricks associated with the Palmetto Stateâ€ ™ s political landscape and were unlikely to be fazed .
One ardent Cruz supporter named Steve , who declined to be identified further because he was skipping work to attend the event , said it was â€œshameful on Rubioâ€ � to cry foul over what he said was fairly standard practice in a tough election .
â€œThis is beneath him , â€ � he said .
Tony Burks , an undecided voter from Columbia , said it was â€œjust part of the game right
nowâ€ � .
â€œYou got ta have your big - boy pants before you come in , â€ � he added ."
2016-02-17,"Samâ€ ™ s Town casino is a pioneer - themed resort on the working - class east side of Las Vegas famous for its laserlight waterfall show , budget - friendly gambling , a bowling alley popular with locals , and the fact that Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s father , Mario Rubio , served drinks here in the early 1980s .
â€œI knew Mario , â€ � said a casino floor bartender named Jim .
â€œQuiet guy .
His son is someone Iâ€ ™ d support.â€ � Rubioâ€ ™ s family moved to Nevada when he was eight years old .
His mother worked as a hotel maid at Imperial Palace on the strip .
And though they only spent six years in Las Vegas , the Florida senator has often referred to his familyâ€ ™ s stint there as a formative period in his life that has , in many ways , shaped his view of working - class America .
No other presidential candidate , Democratic or Republican , can claim to have such a connection with the state .
On paper , Rubio would be well suited for a strong finish in its 23 February caucus , although his standing in the Republican race has grown more precarious after a disappointing showing in New Hampshire .
Rubio has made just five swings through Nevada as a presidential candidate , having divided much of his time between the first three early voting states â€ “ Iowa , New Hampshire and South Carolina .
But the senatorâ€ ™ s few trips there have carried less an aura of a routine campaign stop than the feeling of a homecoming .
It was in Las Vegas where Rubio marched alongside his father on the picket lines for weeks , amid a strike of the Culinary Workers Union in 1984 at the hotel where the elder Rubio worked .
It was also where , as Rubio sometimes notes on the campaign trail , his father would load the family into their car to drive around a â€œreally niceâ€ � neighborhood nearby since there was not much entertainment at the time for children .
â€œOne of the houses belonged to Liberace , â€ � Rubio has recalled before crowds , before making light of its tackiness : â€œI donâ€ ™ t know why I remember that.â€ �
At the storyâ€ ™ s core is not a punchline , but rather one of the fundamental lessons Rubio says he gleaned from his father : that success was not to be demonized , but rather earned through perseverance .
â€œMy parents could have said , â€˜You see these people in nice houses , people like them have too much.â€ ™
You know what they taught us instead ?
â€˜You live in a country where if youâ€ ™ re willing to work hard , you can live in one of these houses , â€ ™ â€ � Rubio has said .
â€œIt doesnâ€
™ t matter that your father is a bartender and your mother is a maid.â€ �
At the young Rubioâ€ ™ s insistence , his family also converted to Mormonism in those years .
Although they later returned to the Catholic church , the senator long ago secured key endorsements in the stateâ€ ™ s Mormon community .
His Cuban - American roots might also pay dividends in Nevada , where around 20 % of the electorate is Latino .
Rubioâ€ ™ s first public campaign events tailored toward Latino voters were held in Nevada , just outside of Las Vegas .
Taking a makeshift stage in October at Havana Grill , a Cuban restaurant , the senator was greeted like something of a rockstar .
It was a boisterous affair , as a couple of hundred voters packed into the back of the restaurant for a glimpse of a man who might become the first Latino president .
The simplest gestures on Rubioâ€ ™ s part â€ “ from occasional lines delivered in Spanish to the sip of a cafecito ( Cuban espresso ) â€ “ prompted cheers from the crowd .
The waitstaff peered out from the kitchen corridor , serving as a reminder of Rubioâ€ ™ s ability to identify with Sin Cityâ€ ™ s thousands of hospitality workers .
â€œHe is articulate .
He is aware of whatâ€ ™ s going on , â€ � said Jim , as he placed drinks on a waitressâ€ ™ s tray .
â€œI think Trump is a little too quick with the trigger .
You canâ€ ™ t be calling people jerks and bimbos .
I want someone whoâ€ ™ s a little more experienced , more political .
And itâ€ ™ s not like Rubio had everything handed to him ,
â€ � the bartender added .
â€œHe had to work for what he got.â€ �
Another Samâ€ ™ s Town bartender was not so keen on Rubioâ€ ™ s delivery .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s still a politician .
I just got this thing against him , â€ � said Tony Spalliero .
â€œRubio is going to have a fight out here because Trump knows casinos .
I look at the Trump Towers
and I see what could be done.â€
�
In most recent Nevada polls , Donald Trump led the field by a wide margin .
But the stateâ€ ™ s complicated voting system rewards a well - organized campaign ; Rubio staffers arrived there early to outpace competitors , and have deployed high - profile surrogates to win over activists .
A new CNN / ORC poll of Nevada released Wednesday put Rubio in second place , at 19 % , with Texas senator Ted Cruz nipping at his heels at 17 % .
Trump remained well ahead of the pack at 45 % .
Heidi Wixom is a grassroots organizer in Clark Countyâ€ ™ s Mormon community who has considered , at various points in the last few months , voting for Ben Carson or John Kasich .
She was always impressed by Rubio , but only joined his cause after a convincing phone call from one of her churchâ€ ™ s most prominent figures , Nevada lieutenant governor Mark Hutchison , who is Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign chairman in the state .
A former member of Mitt Romneyâ€ ™ s finance team , Hutchison said : â€œI believe Rubio can unite the party .
He appeals to young voters , conservative voters , minority voters , and those of faith .
If the Republican party is going to win nationally , we have to increase the size of the tent , and Marco Rubio does that better than any candidate running for the nomination.â€ �
Wixom echoed that point .
â€œRubio is electable , â€ �
she said .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s fresh
and I know he has the intelligence to carry it
off.â€ � â€œElectableâ€ � is a word used often by Rubio supporters , a subtle jab at his strongest competitors , Trump and Cruz .
Yet to maintain this argument after an underwhelming fifth - place finish in New Hampshire , Rubio desperately needs those Republicans seeking an alternative to rally behind him .
Anticipating that establishment rivals would have faded from relevance by now , his campaign poised itself to harness new voters in Nevada , the fourth voting state , but the race remains fluid .
Ohio governor John Kasich pulled off a surprise second place win in New Hampshire , while Jeb Bush has vowed to keep on fighting .
Hours before the 6 February New Hampshire debate , Wixom said :
â€œIâ€ ™ ve heard lots of people say â€˜I think I may support Rubioâ€ ™ .
With the debates , you watch the patterns of all these different candidates over and over , and youâ€ ™ re left with a distinct feeling that Rubioâ€ ™ s really got it together .
Thatâ€ ™ s the guy I can support.â€ �
During that nightâ€ ™ s debate , Rubio was criticized as â€œroboticâ€ � by rival Chris Christie when caught repeating talking points in a performance that was widely deemed to have been a disaster .
Rubio ultimately slipped after a strong third place in Iowa to a devastating sixth in New Hampshire .
Even Bush , whose campaign was considered dead in the water , edged just ahead of Rubio â€ “ lending the former Florida governor a rationale to stay in the race through at least South Carolina .
Rubio has since sought to regain his momentum , buoyed by a return to form in the most recent Republican debate .
What happened in New Hampshire , he told reporters last week , is not dissimilar to the lessons he learned playing college football .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re gon na get beat , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œYou got ta put that play behind you because the next play is just as important.â€ �
It bears mentioning that Nevadaâ€ ™ s Tuesday evening caucus will likely see low turnout since shift workers , like the bartenders at Samâ€ ™ s Town , will have to work at that hour .
Nevada Democrats will hold their contest at 11 am PST on Saturday and plan to accommodate shift workers by including caucus locations inside casinos on the Las Vegas strip .
But since Republicans have made no such arrangements , turnout will likely depend more on a strong get - out - the - vote operation .
Timing the caucus according to traditional work schedules should also increase the importance of the Mormon vote .
Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints make up only 4 % of the state population , yet according to entrance polls , LDS voters accounted for 25 % of Romneyâ€ ™ s caucus support in Nevada in 2012 .
David Fott , a political science professor at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas , said the Mormon community â€œpunches above its weight .
They are involved in the community .
A lot of them are civic - minded people .
They are teachers , they are politicians , businessmen .
But they donâ€ ™ t like to make a lot of noise about that.â€ � Nevadaâ€ ™ s two senators , Harry Reid and Dean Heller , are both LDS churchgoers , as are a great number of state assembly members , mayors and city council members .
At a Rubio campaign event in Henderson , Nevada on Monday , state assemblyman David Gardner said most LDS conservatives are leaning toward Rubio or Cruz .
â€œIf youâ€ ™ re upset about what Obama is doing , Iâ€ ™ ve seen a lot of those people go to Cruz because they want somebody to bash the Democrats , â€ � Gardner said .
â€œIf youâ€ ™ re looking for somebody whoâ€ ™
s got a more positive vision , that seems to be the Marco Rubio crowd.â€
�
Another potential factor is the Florida senatorâ€ ™ s little - known baptism into the Mormon church during his boyhood in Las Vegas .
Much of his extended family in southern Nevada still belongs to the community , and in his autobiography , An American Son , Rubio credits the church with providing the â€œsound moral structureâ€ � his mother wanted for the family .
â€œWhen we left the church a few years later , mostly at my instigation , â€ � Rubio writes , â€œwe did so with gratitude for its considerable contribution to our happiness in those years.â€ �
According to the stateâ€ ™ s top political journalist , columnist and television show host Jon Ralston , Rubio has made the greatest inroads with LDS voters through active support from prominent Mormon politicians such as Hutchison .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ ve also gotten lower - profile endorsements from people who have influence in that community and are able to turn out votes , â€ � Ralston said .
â€œThe Mormons will be a factor .
Whether itâ€ ™ s 25 % or not , I donâ€ ™ t know , but they will be a factor.â€ � Local billionaire Sheldon Adelson might also play a part in the desert showdown .
His newspaper , the Las Vegas Review - Journal , endorsed the Florida senator on 5 February , and though the editorial denied the connection , most observers read the announcement as a sign that Adelson was increasingly leaning toward formally backing Rubio .
The casino magnate is expected to outdo the largess of his contributions in the 2012 election season , when he donated $ 92 m to political action groups .
A well - funded Super Pac would help with the ad war breaking out in Nevada in the run up to 23 February .
But it will be up to Rubioâ€ ™ s official campaign to get out the vote in the blue collar , Latino and Mormon communities they believe are theirs to win .
Bruce Woodbury , an LDS church member and former Clark County commissioner , is among those who plans to organize for Rubio .
â€œHe remembers his roots .
Heâ€ ™ s made it clear he understands what Nevada is all about ,
â€ �
Woodbury said .
â€œAnd when you hear him talk , a lot of his values are Christian values in common with LDS people .
But itâ€ ™ s not a religious thing with me .
Iâ€ ™ m supporting him just because I think he has the ability and vision to make an excellent president .
And I really do think , â€ � Woodbury added , â€œthat he is the one candidate who has the best chance of winning in November .
Thatâ€ ™ s a big factor with me.â€ �"
2016-02-17,"Governor Nikki Haley of South Carolina on Wednesday endorsed Marco Rubio for president , lending a major boost to the senatorâ€ ™ s campaign just days before the Republican primary in the state .
Haley took the stage with Rubio at an outdoor rally in Chapin , descending with the Florida senator from his campaign bus before hundreds of onlookers .
Drawing on their shared experience as the children of immigrants , Haley told the crowd she wanted a candidate who would show her parents â€œthat the best decision they ever made for their children was coming to America.â€ �
Rubio , she added , was best positioned to steer a fractured Republican Party back on track while advancing conservative principles rooted in limited government and free enterprise .
â€œI want a president who understands they have to go back to Washington , D.C. , and bring a conscience back to our Republicans , â€ � Haley said , before imploring voters , with three days remaining before the South Carolina primary , to take to the polls for Rubio .
â€œIf we elect Marco Rubio , every day will be a great day in America , â€ � she added .
Haley will become the third influential South Carolina official to back Rubio , who already has the support of popular Senator Tim Scott and Congressman Trey Gowdy , both popular lawmakers in the state .
Haleyâ€ ™ s endorsement was first reported by two of South Carolinaâ€ ™ s largest newspapers â€ “ the Post and Courier and the State .
Rubio said he was thrilled to have Haleyâ€ ™ s support and lavished praise on the governor before her hometown crowd .
â€œShe embodies for me everything that I want the Republican Party and conservative movement to be about , â€ � Rubio said , echoing comments he made to reporters in recent days as speculation over Haleyâ€ ™ s endorsement reached a fever pitch .
Rubio met with Haley earlier this week and learned he had earned her support on Tuesday , the senatorâ€ ™ s campaign strategist Todd Harris said after Wednesdayâ€ ™ s rally .
Moments later , Rubio and Haley appeared on Fox News for a joint interview , in which Haley said she had phoned Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz â€ “ who had also sought her backing â€
“ that day to inform them of her decision .
Haleyâ€ ™ s endorsement has long been coveted by Republican candidates , bolstered by her 81 % approval rating in South Carolina .
Although her endorsement of Mitt Romney in 2012 did not help him to secure a victory in the early voting state , Haley has risen significantly in stature since then .
Haley , the second Indian American to be elected governor and first woman to hold the post in South Carolina , resurfaced on the national scene last year after the racially motivated church shooting in Charleston .
She was widely praised for her response , which included swift action to remove the Confederate flag from the grounds of the state capitol .
She also delivered the Republican response to this yearâ€ ™ s State of the Union address , earning accolades for speaking out against the sharp anti - immigrant rhetoric that has taken hold of the GOP primary .
Rubio has often commended Haleyâ€ ™ s handling of the Emanuel AME church massacre on the campaign trail and before the media .
â€œSheâ€ ™ s very well respected in the state and sheâ€ ™ s very valuable to anyone nationally .
Sheâ€ ™ s not just someone that can help you in South Carolina , she can help a candidate all over the country , â€ �
he said over lunch with his traveling press on Tuesday .
The day before , he also told reporters that Haley would be on the shortlist for a prime role in any Republican nomineeâ€ ™ s ticket .
â€œShe would be at the top of the list for various things - from vice president to cabinet , â€ � Rubio said .
Haleyâ€ ™ s name was floated as a top pick for vice president in 2012 , but she publicly took herself out of the running at the time , saying she wanted to focus on her job as governor .
Prior to Haleyâ€ ™ s announcement , Bush told NBC News that her endorsement â€œwould be the most powerful , meaningful one in the stateâ€ � .
That the governor instead opted for Rubio was a major blow to Bush , who is fighting to keep his campaign alive and pinning high hopes on South Carolina for a showing strong enough to resist calls for him to drop out of the race .
Bush said he was â€œdisappointedâ€
� Haley did not choose him , but maintained there would be a role for her in his campaign should he secure the Republican nomination .
Bush reserved his criticism for Rubio , hitting back at the senatorâ€ ™ s assertion recent that he lacked any foreign policy experience .
â€œItâ€ ™ s hard for me to be lectured to by a gifted young guy who thinks that going to a committee meeting means that you know something about the world
, â€ � Bush said of his one - time Florida ally ."
2016-02-17,"Some quick evaluations of the performances by Ben Carson , Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz :
Ben Carson had the benefit of being the first candidate on the state tonight , with a fresh audience in both the room and in TV Land .
He was commended by moderator Anderson Cooper and by audience members for his even - keeled temperament and affect , but the candidate , already polling far below the top tier in South Carolina , may have been cursed by his own affability on a question about replacing the late Antonin Scalia on the supreme court .
â€œI probably would take the opportunity to nominate someone , â€ � Carson said .
â€œIt doesnâ€ ™ t necessarily mean that person is going to be acted on or confirmed .
Why not do it?â€ �
Carsonâ€ ™ s lamentation about the destructive nature of partisanship is noble , but will do little to endear him to conservative South Carolina primary voters who dread the prospect of Barack Obama replacing Scalia - a justice of whom Ted Cruz later said : â€œWhat Ronald Reagan was to the White House , Scalia was to the supreme court.â€ �
Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s pushback against Barack Obama - who , it bears noting , is not a candidate for the Republican nomination - on the issue of immigration was a momentary lapse in focus in what was otherwise a good night for the Florida senator .
The high point , at least in terms of combating the # MarcoBot stereotype Rubio has been fighting , may have been his comments on race and racism in America , mentioning his childhood in Las Vegas during the Mariel boatlift .
â€œWhether you agree with them or not , if a significant percentage of the American family feels that they are being treated differently than anyone else , we have a problem then we have to address that as a society and as a country , â€ � Rubio said about racism .
â€œI do not believe we can fulfill our potential as a nation unless we address that .
Iâ€ ™ m not sure there is a political solution to that problem , but there are things we can do.â€ �
Ted Cruz started out strong , deftly ignoring attempts by Cooper to goad him into attacking Donald Trump head - on and putting his Harvard law degree to good use in detailing why his Canadian birth doesnâ€ ™ t preclude him from the presidency .
But a mind - numbingly long answer on his history of antagonizing congressional colleagues in the US Senate - at least , I think thatâ€ ™ s what the original question was about - shifted dangerously close to the same stump - speech autopilot that Rubio has faced such intense criticism for .
Cruz later talked about the importance of â€œhaving funâ€ � on the campaign trail - he might want to take his own advice next time .
Thatâ€ ™ s it for
tonightâ€ ™ s
coverage of the first half of CNNâ€ ™ s Republican town hall .
Weâ€ ™
ll be back tomorrow for part two , as well as on Friday , Saturday , and every day until the sweet release of Election Day in November .
Ted Cruz said : â€œBarack Obama , in the first weeks of his administration , sent the bust of Winston Churchill back to the United Kingdom .
If Iâ€ ™ m elected president , Winston Churchill is coming back.â€
�
WHAT DOES THIS
EVEN MEAN ?
THIS IS LIKE LISTENING TO A RADIO SHOW YELL
A BUMPER
STICKER AT A PRINTOUT OF AN EMAIL FORWARD .
COULD THIS BE ANY MORE TRIFLING AND STUPID ?
[ Ed note : The bust was loaned to then - President George W Bush by then - Prime Minister Tony Blair and returned as a matter of protocol .
A separate bust of Churchill , given to then - President Lyndon B Johnson , remains in the White House today . ]
Would it kill Republicans to crack a joke ?
Actually , some of them , I think it might .
â€ “ Ted Cruz , on the need to â€œlet looseâ€ � on the campaign trail .
Which cabinet position would Cruz fill first ?
â€œIt would be a three - way tie between secretary of state , secretary of defense and attorney general ,
â€ �
Cruz says .
â€œWhen it comes to defense , we have to begin rebuilding our military immediately .
When it comes to state ... moving the embassy to Israel tells Israel , it tells our allies , it tells our enemies that America is back.â€ � â€œWe need someone strong , someone who represents this country , â€ �
Cruz says of a potential secretary of state .
â€œA secretary of state in a Cruz administration would be someone like John Bolton.â€ �
As for an attorney general , Cruz declares that â€œthe lawlessness of the Obama administration has been one of the saddest legaciesâ€ � .
â€œThe only fidelity of the department of justice will be to the laws and constitution of the United States , â€ � Cruz concludes .
This is a strange election season in many ways .
â€ “ Ted Cruz , on being called a liar by Marco Rubio and Donald Trump Ted Cruz , who sits on the Senate judiciary committee , tells Anderson Cooper that he would not endorse a committee hearing on whomever Barack Obama nominates to fill the supreme court seat formerly occupied by the late Antonin Scalia .
â€œThey should notâ€ � get a hearing , Cruz says .
â€œFor
80 years , it has been the practice that the senate has not confirmed any nomination that has occurred during an election year ...
I donâ€
™ t think it would be fair to the nominee.â€ �
Earlier Cruz was asked about Obamaâ€ ™ s planned visit to Cuba .
Is that something he would do ?
It is not as long as Castro is in power .
And I will say I was saddened to hear that [ but ] I wasnâ€ ™ t surprised .
This was foreshadowed for a long time .
â€œThe law under the constitution and federal law has been clear from the very first days of the republic , â€ � Cruz says .
â€œThe child of a US citizen is a US citizen by virtue of birth.â€ � â€œI was a citizen by birth by virtue of my motherâ€ ™ s citizenship ...
it was the act of being born that made me a US citizen , â€ � Cruz says .
Of the possibility of Donald Trump suing him on the matter - â€œyou can never write off the possibility of Donald Trump suing you , â€ �
Cruz says - â€œif he wants to file a lawsuit , he can file it and lose.â€
�
Ted Cruz thinks that the fluctuations in the oil market are created by fiat currency and thinks that a dollar tied to a fixed amount of gold is a stable dollar that would level out fluctuations in the oil market .
That is a really interesting economic idea with nothing that could contradict it apart from , say , the history of America in the 19th century .
â€œOur relationship with Saudi Arabia is , as you know , fraught with complications , â€ � Ted Cruz says .
â€œWhen it comes to Saudi Arabia , we need ot have real scrutiny and real pressure.â€
� â€œThey are not seeking our interests - they are seeking their monetary interests ,
â€ �
Cruz elaborates .
To combat the â€œstrangleholdâ€ � foreign nations have on American energy , Cruz says , we need to develop American - sourced energy sources .
â€œThis country is blessed with abundant natural resources ... but you shouldnâ€ ™ t have government picking winners and losers .
There shouldnâ€ ™ t be any subsidies.â€ �
Ted Cruz said tonight â€ “ incorrectly â€ “ that Trump had said George W Bush should be impeached during the last debate .
He said : â€œTo see , on a Republican presidential stage a candidate suggesting that we should have impeached George W Bush , that really draws into question the judgement of that candidate to be commander in chief .
But , though Trump attacked W Bushâ€ ™ s record at the last debate ( and said in 2008 that he wouldâ€ ™ ve been happy to see Pelosi impeach Bush ) , he actually deliberately avoided suggesting he ought to have been impeached .
Perhaps Cruz was banking on most South Carolinians having skipped it ?
( And , yes , it seems like one could spend all night fact checking Ted Cruz . )
A pastor asks Ted Cruz about the â€œgrowing threatâ€ � against religious values in the United States , an area of particular focus for the Cruz campaign .
â€œWe are seeing an assault on Judeo - Christian values , we are seeing an assault on religious liberty , and we need a president who will stand up and protect those values , â€ �
Cruz says , declaring that candidates should be held to a higher standard than just parroting pro - life , anti - gay marriage statements .
â€œYou shall know them by their fruits , â€ �
Cruz quotes the Bible , referencing his history of fighting Planned Parenthood in court and protecting a statue of the ten commandments in front of the Texas capitol .
â€œIn June of last year we saw a decision from the supreme court that was nothing short of tragic ...
I think
thereâ€
™ s
something really wrong when Republican candidates are echoing the talking points of Barack Obama.â€
� â€œWhen
it comes to religious liberty , if Iâ€ ™ m elected president I intend on the first day I enter office to instruct ...
every government agency that the persecution of religious liberty ends
today.â€ � â€œWe will not be drafting our daughters into the front lines ...
Iâ€ ™ m the father of two daughters .
Women can do anything , but the idea that the federal government could forcibly conscript women into service doesnâ€ ™ t make any sense.â€ �
Itâ€ ™ s like Cruz is saying Women can do anything , except this one thing , for no reason I can come up with , because I said so , and theyâ€ ™ re women .
Unless heâ€ ™ s just objecting to people being drafted into combat , in which case , please condemn that happening to men , too .
Because I am a lazy man , and there is no United States Army Nap Battalion .
When asked about Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s assertion at the last Republican presidential debate that George W Bush didnâ€ ™ t keep the United States safe because the 9/11 terror attacks happened under his watch , Ted Cruz questions Trumpâ€ ™ s judgment .
â€œI thought it was ridiculous , â€ � Cruz says .
â€œListen -
I like Donald .
I am not gon na engage in personal attacks - but his policies donâ€ ™ t make sense.â€ �
Why does Ted Cruz think that saying â€œradical Islamic terrorismâ€ � does anything to stop terrorism ?
Itâ€ ™ s so exhausting hearing the Beetlejuice theory of military policy .
How many times do you have to say it for it to work ?
Do you have to say it really loud ?
Do you have to say it in a mirror , with the lights off , holding a candle ?
Who then defeats the terrorists ?
Is it Bloody Mary or The Candyman ?
Also , itâ€ ™ s just such a funny argument to make from someone who has to constantly distort the record to advance his points .
If naming something what it actually is magically solves problems , itâ€ ™ s puzzling that Cruz is so averse to telling the whole truth and nothing but in many other circumstances .
After saying that he will â€œshamelessly waffleâ€ � and not decide between Clemson and South Carolina , Ted Cruz is asked by an undecided voter about his wifeâ€ ™ s potential role in a Cruz administration .
â€œSheâ€
™ s got a real heart for economic development , â€ �
Cruz says , in part because of her background as the child of Christian missionaries and in part because of her role as a managing director at Goldman Sachs .
â€œHeidi has a real heart here in America ... empowering them to achieve the American dream.â€ �
On Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s assertion that the majority of inmates at GuantÃ¡namo return to terrorism , the director of the National Counterterrorism Center told a Senate panel on 5 February that only 6 of the 88 detainees released by Obama are â€œdirectly involved in terrorist or insurgent activitiesâ€ � .
But when it comes to detainees released by George W Bush , heâ€
™ s right .

: Ted Cruz said that Planned Parenthood had been â€œimplicated in multiple federal feloniesâ€ � as a result of the debunked Center for Medical Progress videos .
Itâ€ ™ s factually untrue : a federal judge ruled in December 2015 that there was no evidence of a crime on the tapes .
In January 2016 , a Texas grand jury impaneled to investigate Planned Parenthood instead indicted filmmaker David Daleidan and Sandra Merritt on charges related to tampering with government records and the purchase and sale of human organs .
There has never been an administration more hostile and antagonistic toward Israel than this administration .
â€ “ Ted Cruz , on Barack Obamaâ€

Ted Cruz is the only panelist at tonightâ€ ™ s town hall to come down hard on Anderson Cooperâ€ ™ s repeated question about whether Apple should be compelled to create a backdoor for the Federal Bureau of Investigation to enter the phone of one of the San Bernardino shooters .
â€œAnytime
youâ€ ™ re dealing with issues of security and civil liberties , youâ€ ™ ve got to strike a delicate balance , â€ �
Cruz says .
â€œI think we can walk and chew gum at the same time.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ ll confess -
I laughed out loudâ€ � when I saw Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s letter threatening to sue me , Cruz says .
â€œThis letter really pressed the bounds of the most frivolous and ridiculous letters Iâ€ ™ ve ever seen ,
â€ �
Cruz says .
â€œHis argument in the letter is running his own words in the ad is defamation.â€ �
Anderson Cooperâ€ ™ s first question : â€œHow does it feel out there for you?â€ �
â€œLook
, it feels fantastic ,
â€ �
Cruz says , asserting that heâ€ ™ s rebuilding the â€œReagan coalitionâ€ � of voters .
â€œWe won among conservatives , but we also won among evangelicals .
We won among Reagan Democrats and we won among young people.â€ �
At the close , Cooper and Rubio had an interesting exchange about football , which Rubio played when he was young .
Back then , he admitted , they taught you to tackle with your head , which he admitted ( to laughs ) that the Democrats would say explains everything you need to know about Rubio .
But , in reply to Cooperâ€ ™ s question about the dangers of football , he mentioned that his daughters do competitive stunt cheerleading , and he drives a car .
Both those things have risks .
Thatâ€ ™ s true !
Unfortunately , as anyone whoâ€ ™ s done either know , brain damage from both ensues when something goes horribly wrong : CTE - related brain damage in football , even without tackling with anything at all , begins accruing on every play during the natural , normal execution of the game .
Football fans know this .
It was a silly answer to give , especially considering that even serious and informed football fans are flummoxed about what to do .
Simply throwing up his hands and saying , â€œWe need to try something!â€ � would have worked .
But just note that , on the spot , Rubio defaulted to toeing the party line and the empty rhetoric of billionaire management .
No .
No !
Iâ€ ™ ve never been to a rave !
Itâ€ ™ s a Republican primary , Anderson !
â€ “ Marco Rubio , on his fondness for electronic dance music .
Responding to Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s comment that heâ€ ™ s â€œbehaving like Donald Trump with a smile , â€ � Rubio laughs .
â€œDonald smiles !
Iâ€ ™ ve seen him smile!â€ �
Rubio says .
â€œUltimately , itâ€ ™ s not about me , itâ€ ™ s not about Ted , itâ€ ™
s not about Donald , itâ€ ™ s about what this countryâ€ ™ s gon na look like when my 15-year - old daughter graduates from college.â€ �
â€œWhen the stakes are that high , â€ �
Rubio continues , â€œthatâ€ ™ s what Iâ€ ™ m going to spend 99 % of my time talking about.â€
�
An undecided South Carolina voter asks Marco Rubio about Ronald Reaganâ€ ™ s history of being , compared to the contemporary Republican field , more moderate on immigration , particularly refugee resettlement .
â€œPolicies have to reflect the times in which you live , â€ � Rubio says .
â€œIn America , there was a time where nobody locked their doors .
Now everybody locks their doors .
Itâ€ ™ s not because we hate the people outside of our homes -
itâ€ ™ s because we love the people inside of our homes.â€ � â€œIf
we accept 10,000 , and 9,999 of them were good people , and one of them was an Isis killer ,
weâ€ ™ d have a big problem , â€ � Rubio elaborates .
â€œIf we donâ€
™ t know who you are , and we donâ€
™ t know why youâ€ ™ re coming ...
weâ€ ™ re not going to be able to let you come , because the threat is so real.â€

The most important job I will ever have is not to be president of the United States - it will be father to my four children .
â€ “ Marco Rubio
On the recent supreme court vacancy , Marco Rubio reaffirms statements he has made criticizing Barack Obama for going forward with plans to nominate a replacement for the late justice Antonin Scalia in an election year .
â€œI would respect that precedent , â€ � Rubio says , referring to disputed claims that a new justice has not been nominated and confirmed in an election year in eight decades .
â€œBottom line is , there will be someone filling that vacancy
and I think the new president should be filling that vacancy.â€
� Rubio was asked about law - enforcement discrimination against African Americans and gave a really empathetic answer .
He talked about having a young African - American friend who has been pulled over seven times and never given a ticket ; he wondered what that friend is supposed to think or friend is supposed to do .
Rubio says that when a member of the American family feels persecuted , we have a problem .
You could tell that heâ€ ™ s thought about this .
You felt like you were on the verge of seeing him connect with something â€ “ with the idea that there is systemic oppression and harassment of African Americans , even .
It seemed like he was about to have a breakthrough .
Instead , he said : â€œIâ€ ™ m not sure thereâ€ ™ s a political solution , but thereâ€ ™ s something we can do.â€
�
Then he segued into some talking points about failing public schools and mentioned a single charity group in New York .
I guess
thatâ€
™ s what we can do .
All of it .
Theyâ€ ™ re not some sort of special Jedi Council .
â€ “ Marco Rubio , on the Fed .
Anderson Cooper asks Marco Rubio if he has ever â€œfelt the sting of racism.â€ � â€œSome of the neighborhood kids , older kids , were taunting my family , â€ �
Rubio says of his childhood in Las Vegas during the Mariel boatlift in 1980 .
â€œI never saw it a reflection on America , I saw it as a reflection on those kids and what they were hearing.â€ �
Citing the record - setting racial diversity of the Republican field this year , Rubio says that â€œthat tells you a lot about the Republican party.â€ �
Rubio deservedly gets a lot of grief for being an empty suit â€ “ which , the vast bulk of the time , he is
â€ “
but he seemed human and fairly sharp on the issue of Appleâ€ ™ s encryption of the San Bernardino shooterâ€ ™ s phone .
Itâ€ ™ s a mess , but he made it sound like the thoughtful mess that it is .
He acknowledged the danger of creating backdoors to encryption that criminals could use but , pointedly , the small - government conservative did not acknowledge the ability of the government to abuse it .
That said , he also noted that companies outside the US would not be compelled to follow our backdoor encryption models , which is good point !
But , after all that , he decided , â€œWe are going to have to figure out a way
forwardâ€ � that would also acknowledge â€œexigent circumstancesâ€ � .
This is sort of a big problem for Rubio because it was relatable and thoughtful stuff , but it was not an answer .
It was definitely better than the really sharp , definitive and emphatic non - answers he normally gives , but it still wasnâ€ ™ t an answer .
Then , during the time it took me to type that , he delivered an answer to a woman in the audience on college debt full of ( clearly memorized ) examples and ideas almost verbatim from his last book ; even I could have written those statements at least halfway from memory having read it .
As he talked , he started speaking faster and faster and rhythmically rocking left and right on the balls of his feet .
Left and right , left and right , left and right .
So consider the human moment ended .
We should not lower standards for anyone , because this is not a game ...
Itâ€ ™ s not about the gender , itâ€ ™ s about the ability to do the job .
â€ “ Marco Rubio , on women in combat positions .
So , what â€œconvicted cop killerâ€ � living in Cuba was Rubio talking about when he bashed Obamaâ€ ™ s plan to visit ?
Assata Shakur
( and , if you recognize only the last name , yes , she was rapper
Tupac Shakurâ€ ™ s step - aunt and godmother ) .
Cuba considers her conviction political and has consistently refused to extradite her ; Shakur was a member of the Black Liberation Army who was driving a vehicle with two other members when pulled over by New Jersey State troopers in 1973 .
Shakur and one trooper were shot and survived ; Trooper Werner Foerster and one of her passengers died of gunshot wounds .
Shakur was convicted after a trial in 1977 that her lawyers have argued was prejudiced ( and before and during which her lawyers believe that law enforcement interfered with her defense ) , but she escaped and fled to Cuba in 1979 .
She remains on the FBIâ€ ™ s Most Wanted Terrorist List today .
Read more on Shakur here : â€œI know I havenâ€
™ t lived as long as some of the people running for president , â€ � Rubio says , to a retired Army general , â€œbut none of the people running for president has as much experience in national security matters as I do.â€
�
Citing his service in the US senate on the intelligence committee , Rubio describes his prescience in naming Isis as a major threat to the security of the United States , as well as his vote against the use of force in Syria .
â€œItâ€ ™ s the hardest vote you have to make in Congress , â€ � says Rubio .
â€œNo one running as a Republican has shown better judgment or has more experience on national security than I do.â€

A woman on the verge of entering dental school , who expects to graduate with as much as half a million dollars in debt , asks Marco Rubio about his plan for making education easier and less expensive to access .
â€œIâ€ ™ m
the only Republican candidate that consistently talks about student - loan debt , â€ � Rubio says , in part because of his own student - loan debt , which he was only able to pay off after he wrote his book American Son , â€œnow available in paperback.â€
�
Citing accreditation reform , realistic scheduling options for non - traditional students and well - educated debt education for future college students
, Rubio threw himself into this question .
Florida senator Marco Rubio says that Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s plan to visit Cuba - reported tonight - is foolish , and that he would not consider such a trip unless it was under very specific circumstances .
â€œNot if itâ€ ™ s not a free Cuba , â€ � Rubio says .
â€œA year and two months after the opening to Cuba , the Cuban government remains as repressive as ever.â€ �
â€œPresident Obama has no standingâ€ � to address immigration , Rubio says , because two years of control of the White House and both chambers of Congress yielded no action .
â€œPeople wonâ€ ™ t support a comprehensive approach to immigration , â€ � Rubio says .
â€œThe only way forward is a step - by - step approach that begins by securing our border.â€ � â€œNo progress will be made on immigration in this country until we prove to the American people ... that we secure the border.â€ �
Anderson asks Rubio how itâ€ ™ s feeling on the campaign trail , and whether heâ€ ™ s feeling the # MarcoMentum after South Carolina governor Nikki Haleyâ€ ™ s endorsement earlier today .
â€œI feel great about it -
I mean , we feel a lot of energy , â€ � Rubio says .
â€œI feel good about what thatâ€ ™ s gon na translate to , so weâ€ ™ ll see.â€ �
I ran out of new things to say about Ben Carson about three months ago .
All I could think of was to make fun of him ;
thereâ€ ™ s nothing there .
And after telling Anderson Cooper that he enjoys classical music , â€œparticularly baroque , â€ � Ben Carson exits the stage .
Next up : Florida senator Marco Rubio .
I would relish running against either one of them - it would not be a problem .
-Ben
Carson , on which Democratic presidential candidate he would rather run against .
â€œIf
you are the Republican nominee , how do you plan to get your message out over a boisterous Democrat?â€ � asks a town hall attendee , after noting Ben Carsonâ€ ™
s â€œpoliteâ€ � demeanor .
â€œThe key is not so much the volume with which you speak but its the content of what you say
- thatâ€ ™ s
whatâ€ ™ s going to make the difference , â€ � Carson says .
â€œWhen it comes to the general election , people who are running around saying things like â€˜free college for everyone , â€ ™ itâ€ ™ ll be very easy to actually educate people as to the actual financial condition to our nation.â€ � â€œI look forward to such a challenge , â€ � Carson concludes .
Ben Carson , when you decry the â€œfacilities all around the country that are sitting empty because weâ€ ™ ve decided that itâ€ ™ s too expensive to house the mentally ill ...
And then they wind up in prisonâ€ � , thank your friend Ronald Reagan for destroying public mental healthcare in the United States .
On the issue of criminal justice reform , raised by a young woman who lost a close friend to murder , Carson says that the government needs to focus on providing criminals with the tools to successfully reintegrate into society .
â€œWe have 5 % of the population of the world and 25 % of the inmates and that obviously means that something is askew , â€ � Carson says .
â€œWe need to be thinking about whether theyâ€ ™ re going there for life , or whether theyâ€ ™ re going to be reintegrated into society , â€ � and provide those who will rejoin society with practical training to become â€œa welder or a plumber or a whole host of different things.â€ �
Ben Carson believes that people should not drop out of school or go to jail , but that the government should promote the general welfare , not put people on welfare , and in fact back in the old days when people lived far apart sometimes someone would be picking apples and fall and break his leg , and his neighbors would get together and make sure that he remembered Americaâ€ ™ s values , and thatâ€ ™ s why after 15,000 operations Ben Carson is not looking for a job .
Except the presidency .
Which Anderson Cooper had to remind him he was actually looking for .
Letâ€
™ s hope he finds it !
From Guardian US opinion editor Megan Carpentier : Ben Carson , who first noted that America had to compete with the billions of people in China and India , suggested that we had to â€œnot
wasteâ€
� people in the job market .
But instead of suggesting things like paid child care and family leave , which would allow women to remain in the labor force in a cost - effective way ( or even just noting that womenâ€ ™ s labor market participation rate is lower than menâ€ ™ s ) , Carson suggested that we need to lower the high school drop - out rate from its current 20 % ( and reduce incarceration rates ) .
One problem : the Department of Education says that the high school drop - out rate is 7 % .
In his MSNBC interview , Donald Trump refused to assign blame to either side in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t want to get into it for a different reason , Joe , because if I do win , there has to be a certain amount of surprise , unpredictability , our country has no unpredictability , â€ � he told Joe Scarborough .
The Republican frontrunner added : â€œIf I win , I donâ€
™ t want to be in a position where Iâ€ ™ m saying to you , and the other side now say , â€˜We donâ€ ™ t want Trump involved , we donâ€ ™ t want ...
â€ ™ Let me be sort of a neutral guy
, letâ€ ™ s see what - Iâ€ ™ m going to give it a shot .
It would be so great.â€ �
However , Trump reiterated his longstanding belief that the conflict represented â€œthe toughest agreement of any kind to makeâ€ � and formidable obstacle even for the author of The Art of The Deal .
Donald Trump admitted during his MSNBC interview that there was one reason that he continued to attack rival Jeb Bush , even after the former Florida governor had collapsed in the polls :
â€œI hit Jeb
because heâ€ ™ s sort of easy to hit , to be honest with you.â€

I have multiple marksmanship awards from ROTC .
Ben Carson , apparently forgetting that his record with the ROTC is a bit ... checkered .
A South Carolina voter asks Carson about gun rights : â€œWhat is your plan to preserve my rights to own a gun?â€ �
â€œThe second amendment is there for a very good reason : Itâ€ ™ s so the people could assist the government in case of an invasion , â€ � as well as in case â€œthe government itself ever became tyrannical and attempted to rule the people , â€ � Carson says .
From Guardian US columnist Jeb Lund : Ben Carsonâ€ ™ s insight about the Supreme Court shatters me to my foundations .
Did you know that the founders intended for it to consist of jurists who â€œlove Americaâ€ � , who â€œfully understood its constitutionâ€ � and who understood it â€œshould preserve its constitutional traditionsâ€ � ?
Now I do , and the current court sounds so alien .
Now , in fact , we have activism .
And incorrectness .
If only we were correct .
But how to be correct ?
What we need is a litmus test based on what kind of rulings and associations jurists have had over their lives .
Not a series of questions for potential nominees , which nominees can prep for .
And we definitely have to scrap the current voting system where potential justices grab a scotch egg out of the jar on the bar , and whoever draws the rotten egg becomes the nominee .
On the issue of his lack of political experience , Carson says that his ability to solve problems is more valuable in a presidential candidate than the ability to talk : â€œItâ€ ™ s the political class that has tried to convince everybody that they are the only ones who can solve our problems.â€ �
According to Carson , the United States government was set up to be filled with â€œcitizen statesmenâ€ � , rather than political professionals .
â€œI can guarantee you that I have had more 2 am phone calls than anybody else put together , â€ � Carson said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s we the people that need to assume , once again , the pinnacle position.â€ �
Having people become dependent on others is not compassion at all .
-Ben
Carson , on Christian charity and the welfare state .
Ben Carson says he â€œprobably wouldâ€ � nominate a supreme court justice if he were president , even if it were his last year in office .
As for how he would determine who he would nominate , â€œthe litmus test would be their life , â€ � Carson says , citing previous rulings , life experiences and evaluating what their potential opinions on issues like abortion would be through their previous actions .
Anderson Cooper asks Carson about Appleâ€ ™ s refusal to unlock an iPhone belonging to the deceased perpetrator of the San Bernardino terrorist attack .
â€œApple ...
donâ€ ™ t necessarily trust the government these days , and thereâ€ ™ s probably a very good reason for people not to trust the government , but weâ€ ™ re gon na have to get over that , because today weâ€ ™ re faced with incredible threats , â€ � Carson says .
â€œWhat we need is a public - private partnership when it comes to all of these technical things and cybersecurity , â€ � Carson continues .
Anderson Cooperâ€ ™ s first question : â€œWhatâ€ ™ s harder : brain surgery , or politics?â€ � Carson laughs .
â€œBrain surgeryâ€ ™ s a lot harder!â€ �
Donald Trump also condemned Apple for not cooperating with federal investigators to crack an iPhone belonging to one of the two perpetrators of the December 2015 terrorist attack in San Bernardino , California which left 14 Americans dead .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s disgraceful that Apple is not helping on that ,
â€ �
Trump said .
â€œI think security first and I feel -
I always felt security first .
Apple should absolutely - we should force them to do it .
We should do whatever we have to do ,
â€ � the Republican frontrunner said .
In his town hall with MSNBCâ€ ™ s Joe Scarborough , Donald Trump backtracked on whether he might sue Ted Cruz over a campaign ad that uses footage of the Republican frontrunner saying that he is pro - choice . â€œI donâ€ ™ t know that weâ€ ™ re going to have a lawsuit , but we certainly want to keep somebody honest , â€ �
Trump said .
Still , Trump felt confident that he might succeed , saying , â€œIâ€ ™ ve had great success in business , Iâ€ ™ ve had great success with lawsuits , Iâ€ ™ ve had great success in things I do.â€
�
In an interview with MSNBCâ€ ™ s Joe Scarborough , Donald Trump dismissed the Wall Street Journal / NBC poll which came out earlier today which showed Cruz with a narrow 28 % to 26 % lead nationally .
It was the first time Trump had trailed in a national poll since the beginning of November .
â€œI think someone at the Wall Street Journal doesnâ€ ™ t like me .
But I never do well with the Wall Street Journal polls .
I donâ€
™ t know , they do these small samples and I donâ€
™ t know exactly what it representsâ€
� said Trump .
Meanwhile , back at the ranch ... billionaire Donald Trump - who is not scheduled to appear in tonightâ€ ™ s town hall event on CNN - will instead appear on rival cable network MSNBC in a pre - taped interview with Morning Joeâ€ ™ s Joe Scarborough .
That interview , which will run the gamut from his immigration stance to his suggested lawsuit against fellow candidate Ted Cruz , will be covered by the Guardianâ€ ™ s
Ben Jacobs - right here in this liveblog .
The winnowing field of Republican presidential candidates is about to begin the last nationally televised event before South Carolina voters take to the polls on Saturday for the first - in - the - South primary .
The first in a pair of town hall events will feature Texas senator Ted Cruz , Florida senator Marco Rubio and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson -
tomorrow nightâ€ ™ s town hall will feature former Florida governor Jeb Bush , Ohio governor John Kasich and billionaire Donald Trump .
CNNâ€ ™ s Anderson Cooper is moderating both events .
Mormon and Latino communities could offer Marco Rubio , who spent six years of his childhood in Nevada , a path to caucus success , report Sabrina Siddiqui and Daniel Hernandez : Rubioâ€ ™ s family moved to Nevada when he was eight years old .
His mother worked as a hotel maid at Imperial Palace on the strip .
And though they only spent six years in Las Vegas , the Florida senator has often referred to his familyâ€ ™ s stint there as a formative period in his life that has , in many ways , shaped his view of working - class America .
No other presidential candidate , Democratic or Republican , can claim to have such a connection with the state .
On paper , Rubio would be well suited for a strong finish in its 23 February caucus , although his standing in the Republican race has grown more precarious after a disappointing showing in New Hampshire .
Rubio has made just five swings through Nevada as a presidential candidate , having divided much of his time between the first three early voting states â€ “ Iowa , New Hampshire and South Carolina .
But the senatorâ€ ™ s few trips there have carried less an aura of a routine campaign stop than the feeling of a homecoming .
Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz called out rival Donald Trump during a news conference in Seneca , South Carolina , earlier today , telling him : â€œIf you want to file a lawsuit ... file the lawsuit.â€ �
The argument in question : a television ad the Cruz campaign ran suggesting that Trump is pro - choice , which Trump claimed is misleading and defamatory .
There are a couple things to say about the latest Wall Street Journal / NBC poll that shows Trump falling Cruz .
The first is that the poll was based on 800 registered voters of which 400 were GOP primary voters .
If you agree with Trump that those numbers are low you had better reconsider your relationship with polling in general - such small sample sizes arenâ€ ™ t unusual at all ( which is one of many reasons why polls arenâ€ ™ t all that accurate these days ) .
And Trump certainly hasnâ€ ™ t had a problem proudly sharing similar polls in the past that have showed him in the leading position .
The second point worth making is that this is just one poll - we have no idea whether itâ€ ™ s an outlier or part of a new emerging trend until we see what other survey results say over the next few weeks .
Real Clear Politics has an averageof all polls and it shows Trump safely leading Cruz by 18 percentage points .
So Trumpâ€ ™ s skepticism is right - itâ€ ™ s just being voiced at a suspiciously convenient time .
Donald Trump may have delivered the shortest speech of his campaign in an outdoor rally in rural South Carolina , the Guardianâ€ ™ s
Ben Jacobs reports from Walterboro : Donald Trump may have delivered the shortest speech of his campaign in an outdoor rally in rural South Carolina on Wednesday .
In front of a crowd of roughly one thousand , the Republican frontrunner delivered his stump speech in a crisp 24 minutes , a record pace for the normally verbose Trump .
Appearing in front of a banner emblazoned with Low Country Sportsmen for Trump , the real estate mogul accepted the groupâ€ ™ s endorsement in front of a crowd that started to shiver as the sun set .
Despite the fireworks earlier in the day , with Cruz holding a long press conference where welcomed a threatened lawsuit from Trump , the real estate mogul only took a cursory shot at the Texas senator .
â€œHereâ€ ™ s a guy he fibs , he lies , he does stuff to Ben Carson ,
â€ �
Trump said of Cruz .
Some in the crowd didnâ€ ™ t seem to mind the short speech .
As guests of the Low Country Sportsmen , they got to dig into several whole hogs that had been barbecued while drinking beverages out of red Solo cups .
Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign released a scathing new ad on Wednesday that accuses rival Marco Rubio of pushing â€œamnesty for illegals , â€ � reports the Guardianâ€ ™ s
Sabrina Siddiqui from Aiken , South Carolina : The one - minute TV spot , which will hit the airwaves in South Carolina days before the stateâ€ ™ s primary
, draws a direct link between the immigration platform of Rubio and Barack Obama .
Zeroing in on the Florida senatorâ€ ™ s sponsorship of a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013 , which Rubio has since disavowed , the ad features a mash - up of Obama and Rubio making the case to grant citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants in almost verbatim terms .
â€œMarco Rubio burned us once .
He shouldnâ€ ™ t get the chance to sell us out again , â€ � the narrator says .
Earlier in the day , Rubio told reporters Cruz was â€œlyingâ€ � about his record and spreading misinformation to bolster his campaign .
Rubio and Cruz are locked in a bitter and increasingly ugly contest to emerge as the prohibitive alternative to Republican frontrunner Donald Trump .
Recent polls have shown Rubio gaining ground in South Carolina , nipping just at the heels of Cruzâ€ ™ s second - place position .
Reached for comment by the Guardian , Rubio spokesman Joe Pounder slammed Cruz in a statement : â€œNo amount of cheap video editing can cover - up for Senator Cruzâ€ ™ s lies about his own record of wanting immigration reform to pass , advocating for a path to legal status , and wanting to â€˜compromiseâ€ ™ on illegal immigrants .
Senator Cruzâ€ ™ s millions in attack ads
canâ€ ™ t undo his lifelong record of putting politics ahead of conservative principles.â€

And the money polls kept rolling in !
At the moment a new poll dropped showing billionaire presidential candidate Donald Trump behind Ted Cruz for the first time among national Republicans , Bloomberg Politics released a poll showing the candidate holding a staggering 19-point lead over Ted Cruz among likely South Carolina Republican primary voters , with Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush duking it out in a close race for third place .
Trump dominates Cruz and the other candidates among nearly every demographic group , including besting Cruz among evangelical Christians .
Trump is most trusted by the respondents to tackle nearly every issue .
Among the areas in which Trump scores highest : as the candidate who would be most feared by Americaâ€ ™ s enemies ( 57 % ) ; take on the â€œestablishmentâ€ � ( 51 % ) ; win the general election ( 43 % ) ; tackle illegal immigration ( 41 % ) ; and , somewhat surprisingly given Cruzâ€ ™ s background as a former Supreme Court clerk , appoint the best Supreme Court justices ( 24 % ) .
Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s improbable seven - month ride atop national polls of likely Republican voters may finally be slipping : In a national poll conducted by NBC and the Wall Street Journal , the billionaire businessman has lost his national lead , slipping behind senator Ted Cruz of Texas in a poll released justthisminute .
Cruz leads with 28 % support nationwide among Republican voters , beating Trumpâ€ ™ s 26 % by two percentage points .
Senator Marco Rubio of Florida follows in third place with 17 % , trailed by followed by Ohio governor John Kasichâ€ ™ s 11 % , retired neurosurgeon
Ben Carsonâ€ ™ s 10 % and former Florida governor Jeb ( ! )
Bushâ€ ™ s 4 % .
In the last iteration of the poll , Trump topped Cruz by 13 % , 33 % to 20 % .
But this latest poll , conducted between Sunday and Tuesday , comes after Cruz beat Trump in the Iowa caucuses , and after Trumpâ€ ™ s universally panned performance in last weekendâ€ ™ s debate in South Carolina , in which he attacked former president George W. Bush over the September 11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq .
The four latest polls of Palmetto State Republicans - all conducted after the debate - show Trump with an average lead of 17.5 percentage points over Cruz .
In two other national surveys released today , Trump leads the GOP field by 15 and 20 percentage points , making the NBC / Wall Street Journal numbers a major outlier .
At a rally at the Parkway Ballroom in Chicago , Hillary Clinton promised to push for stricter gun laws and better law enforcement practices , saying the country owes it to the â€œmothers of the movementâ€ � , who have lost children to gun violence and police killings .
Clinton began by invoking the names of Sandra Bland , a black woman who was found dead in her jail cell following a traffic stop in Texas last summer , and Laquan McDonald , a young black man who was shot by a Chicago police officer in 2014 .
While Clinton spoke , Blandâ€ ™ s family nodded in agreement behind her .
â€œThese stories can not be ones that just provoke our emotions , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œThey must move us to action .
They must motivate every one of us to take on these issues reforming police practices and making it as hard as possible for people to get guns who shouldnâ€ ™ t have them in the first place.â€ �
At the start of the rally , Blandâ€ ™ s mother , Geneva Reed - Veal , joined by her daughters and husband , recited a poem she wrote about Clinton , a woman she described as having the â€œstaying powerâ€ � even after 20 years in politics .
â€œNow is the time and this is place /
Now we are ready and Hillary is the face , â€ �
Reed - Veal began .
When she spoke about her daughter , Reed Veal began to tear up .
Clinton reached out , and Reed - Veal finished her introduction .
Clinton has won the support of a coalition of mothers whose children were victims of gun violence , including Gwen Carr , mother of Eric Garner ; Maria Hamilton , mother of Dontre Hamilton ; and Lucy McBath , mother of Jordan Davis ; are planning to campaign for Clinton .
During Clintonâ€ ™ s remarks , which echoed a speech she gave in Harlem on Tuesday , she also took the opportunity to criticize Vermont senator Bernie Sanders , especially over his relationship with the president who remains wildly popular among Democrats .
â€œMy opponent has been quite critical of the president .
He has called him weak , he has called him disappointing
he even tried to advocate for somebody to run against him when he ran in 2012,â€ �
Clinton said , while some in the crowd booed and jeered .
â€œI am unapologetic , â€ � she continued , above the applause .
â€œI will build on the progress that President Obama has made.â€ �
She also implied that Sanders was a dreamer with a host of big ideas that were unachievable in the current political climate .
â€œI wonâ€ ™ t make any promises that I canâ€
™ t keep , â€ � she said .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t need any more of those.â€ � Clinton returned to her native Chicago on Wednesday both to campaign and fundraise .
After the rally , she was expected to attend two private fundraisers in the afternoon and a fundraising event in the evening .
Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio said Wednesday he hoped Apple would â€œvoluntarilyâ€ � unlock the San Bernardino shooterâ€ ™ s phone ,
the Guardianâ€ ™ s Sabrina Siddiqui reports from South Carolina : â€œUltimately , I think being a good corporate citizen is important ,
â€ �
Rubio told reporters while campaigning in Mount Pleasant , South Carolina , while adding there was â€œno easy answerâ€ � on the issue of encryption .
â€œOn
the one hand this encryption is designed to prevent people from having unauthorized access to your private information .
On the other hand there are terrorists and criminals who are using encryption to protect themselves.â€ �
The Florida senator said the government would have to work collaboratively with the private sector to reach a solution .
â€œThe question is how can we work collaboratively with Silicon Valley and the tech industry to work through this issue we now face , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œAmerica has a history in times of war , in times of challenge , of working with the private sector .
As president , he added , Rubio would seek out a way forward on encryption â€œthat protects Americaâ€ ™ s privacy but still allows [ the federal government ] access to valuable information that can prevent future attacks.â€ �
Is the Monmouth University poll showing Ohio governor John Kasich in the single digits in South Carolina spooking him out of the contest ?
Sure looks that way .
According to the Boston Globe , Kasich will not be in the Palmetto State for its Republican primary this Saturday - instead , heâ€ ™ ll be hosting a town hall meeting in Worcester , Massachusetts and will later attend a $ 2,700-per - person fundraiser in Bostonâ€ ™ s bougie Back Bay neighborhood .
The event pairing is likely an event to pave Kasichâ€ ™ s way for the Massachusetts Republican primary , to be held on March 1 .
Kasich , who has been battling for fourth place in South Carolina , has previously stated that heâ€ ™ s not expecting to win the nationâ€ ™ s second primary .
The Massachusetts primary , on the other hand , may be fertile ground for the more moderate Kasich .
Itâ€ ™ s no secret that Vermont senator Bernie Sanders represents an overwhelmingly vanilla - white state , reports the Guardianâ€ ™ s Lauren Gambino - a problem thatâ€ ™ s only going to snowball as the primaries move to the South : His critics say thatâ€ ™ s left him flat - footed in responding to issues of racial inequality .
Remember Netroots Nation , when Sandersâ€ ™ s response to Black Lives Matter protesters inspired the ironic hashtag # BernieSoBlack ?
As the primary race moves to more diverse states , Sanders is making a more concerted efforts to reach black voters .
But Vermontâ€ ™ s black leaders told the Daily Beast that their senator Sanders did little to connect with them .
One leader said Sanders only wanted to discuss income inequality and dismissed attempts to address other issues .
â€œHe just always kept coming back to income inequality as a response , as if talking about income inequality would somehow make issues of racism go away , â€ � said Curtiss Reed Jr. , the executive director of Vermont Partnership for Fairness and Diversity .
This criticism may prove problematic for Sanders as he courts voters who are dually and disproportionately affected by racial and economic inequality .
So far in his campaign , Sanders has addressed racism through the lens of economic inequality .
Rather , she would tackle it as its own ugly form of inequality that is connected to and exacerbated by economic inequality .
On Tuesday , Hillary Clinton drew a clear distinction between herself and Sanders on issues concerning race and implied that her opponent wasnâ€ ™ t up to the challenge .
â€œWe have to begin by facing up to the reality of systemic racism , â€ � she said , speaking in Harlem on Tuesday .
â€œBecause
these are not only problems of economic inequality .
These are problems of racial inequality .
And we have got to say that loudly and clearly.â€
�
On Wednesday , surrogates for Clinton piled on .
â€œIt is disturbing to read that Bernie Sanders has a record of consistently turning his back against the Black voters in his very own state of Vermont , â€ � said South Carolina representative Todd Rutherford .
â€œThe lack of confidence that African - American citizens in Vermont have about Senator Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ leadership is troubling and should be of concern to Black voters throughout the country , â€ � said former NYC mayor , David Dinkins .
Sandersâ€ ™ campaign has not yet responded to a request for comment .
Whose endorsement would you rather have ?
Governor Nikki Haley will endorse Marco Rubio for president , it was reported on Wednesday , lending a major boost to the Florida senatorâ€ ™ s campaign just days ahead of the South Carolina Republican primary , writes Guardian political reporter Sabrina Siddiqui in Aiken , South Carolina :
The Post and Courier first reported the endorsement , adding that Haley will appear alongside Rubio at an evening campaign event in Chapin .
Haley will become the third influential South Carolina official to back Rubio .
The senator already has the support of Senator Tim Scott and Congressman Trey Gowdy , two of the stateâ€ ™ s popular lawmakers .
Haleyâ€ ™ s endorsement had long been sought by Republican candidates .
Although her endorsement of Mitt Romney in 2012 did not help him to secure a victory in South Carolina , Haley has risen significantly in stature since then .
Haley , the second Indian American to be elected governor and first woman to hold the post in South Carolina , resurfaced on the national scene last year after a racially motivated church shooting in Charleston .
She was widely praised for her response , which included swift action to remove the Confederate flag from the grounds of the state Capitol .
She also delivered the Republican response to this yearâ€ ™ s State of the Union address , earning accolades for speaking out against the sharp anti - immigrant rhetoric that has taken hold of the GOP primary .
Rubio has lavished Haley with praise , particularly for how she handled the Emanuel AME church massacre , and told reporters Tuesday he would welcome her endorsement .
A spokesman for Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has dismissed charges of sexism against Sanders supporter Killer Mike , the Atlanta - based rapper , as â€œgotchaâ€ � politics .
Speaking at a Sanders rally at Morehouse College in Atlanta on Tuesday , Killer Mike argued against the Hillary Clinton candidacy in part by quoting the activist Jane Elliott as saying , â€œMichael , a uterus doesnâ€ ™ t qualify you to be president of the United States.â€ �
After a local reporter live - tweeted the line without the Elliott reference , the rapper was attacked on social media as sexist .
That charge was amplified by the Clinton campaign , with senior communications adviser Karen Finney piling on on Twitter : Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said Wednesday that Killer Mike , who has been campaigning widely for the senator , â€œdoesnâ€ ™ t believe gender should be a reason to vote for or against someone.â€ � â€œThatâ€ ™ s the point Mike was making when he quoted Jane Elliott , the internationally known educator , â€ � said Briggs .
â€œWe need to get beyond the gotcha politics and get to the issues at the heart of the election.â€ � â€œI donâ€ ™ t and never will Hate or think less of women , â€ � the rapper said in a tweet referring to former Ohio state senator Nina Turner , who also spoke at the rally .
â€œSen .
Nina Turner is my Next Great Political Champ but Iâ€ ™ m sorry
No HRC for me.â€ � Killer Mike , aka Michael Render , and his supporters circulated transcripts of his speech to illustrate the context of his â€œuterusâ€ � remark :
Thereâ€ ™ s video , too : And hereâ€ ™ s the full speech .
Elliott herself defended the rapper in an interview with the Huffington Post , saying , â€œitâ€ ™ s a ridiculous thing to be upset
aboutâ€ � :
But others who took up the discussion , including former Guardian US columnist Jill Filipovic and others , said the context did not excuse the statement .
Filipovic compared the controversy to recent consternation in Democratic circles at comments feminist icon Gloria Steinem and former secretary of state Madeleine Albright made about young women who support Sanders .
Albright warned there was a â€œspecial place in hellâ€ � for women who donâ€ ™ t support other women , and Steinem suggested that young women supporting Sanders were in it for the boys .
Both later apologized .
The local paper has the scoop : popular South Carolina governor Nikki Haley has thrown her support behind Florida senator Marco Rubio , as the stateâ€ ™ s Republicans prepare to vote Saturday .
Haley tangled with Donald Trump after her response to Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s state of the union address this year , in which she called on Republicans to reject the â€œsiren call of the angriest voices.â€ �
For some reason Trump thought she was talking about him .
The Donald Trump campaign has responded to Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s challenge to Trump to make good on a defamation lawuit threat over a Cruz ad .
â€œDonald I would encourage you , if you want to file a lawsuit challenging this ad , claiming it is defamation , file a lawsuit , â€ �
Cruz said at a midday news conference .
â€œIf I want to bring a lawsuit it would be legitimate ,
â€ �
Trump replies , in a statement obtained by the Guardian : Ted Cruz has already had one of his ads pulled off the air concerning Senator Rubio because it was totally false .
Additionally , he was forced to apologize to Dr. Ben Carson for fraudulently stealing his votes in Iowa , and was embarrassed by his phony voter violation form .
He is a liar and these ads and statements made by Cruz are clearly desperate moves by a guy who is tanking in the polls- watching his campaign go up in flames finally explains Cruzâ€ ™ s logo .
I am
pro - life and I do not support tax payer funding for Planned Parenthood as long as they are performing abortions .
I have been clear about my position on this issue for years .
I am also a strong advocate of the second amendment and a proud member of the NRA , as are my sons .
I will repeal and replace ObamaCare and I would nominate a very conservative Justice to protect our freedoms and conservative values .
If I want to bring a lawsuit it would be legitimate .
Likewise , if I want to bring the lawsuit regarding Senator Cruz being a natural born Canadian I will do so .
Time will tell , Teddy .

Our conception of how the general presidential race will look and feel is necessarily uninformed and subject to change .
Many voters havenâ€ ™ t yet gotten to know the candidates .
Minds can change depending on events or star signs or weather or who knows what .
There are months to go in which any candidate may rise or plummet .
Nonetheless , pollsters are posing questions about theoretical general election matchups to voters .
USA Today / Suffolk have dropped a new poll showing Bernie Sanders out - performing Hillary Clinton : The nationwide survey , taken Thursday through Monday , underscores how formidable an opponent the 74-year - old democratic socialist has become against one of theDemocratic Partyâ€ ™ s most established figures .
Ben Carson , the retired neurosurgeon , has scored an endorsement from an elected official !
His first , according to FiveThirtyEightâ€ ™ s endorsement tracker .
Carson gets the nod from Maryland Representative Andy Harris , a fellow doctor at Johns Hopkins known for his solitary and staunch opposition to marijuana decriminalization in Washington , DC .
Update :
Utah senator Mike Lee , possibly Cruzâ€ ™ s only friend in the Senate , plans to campaign in South Carolina tomorrow alongside Marco Rubio .
But Lee will campaign with Cruz , too , his spokesperson says .
CORRECTION :
This post has been updated to reflect the fact that Lee plans to campaign in South Carolina with both Cruz and Rubio , not Rubio alone , as initially reported , which would have been a serious burn on Cruz .
Cruz is kneecapping Rubio , too .
â€œEthics matter , â€ � says Cruz , who spread a false rumor in Iowa that Ben Carson had dropped out of the campaign and sent mailers to voters accusing them of a â€œvoting violation.â€ � â€œIt drives the narrative they want to sell , â€ �
Cruz says of Rubio campaign Cruz :
â€œMarco Rubio is behaving like Donald Trump with a smile.â€ � â€œThe one candidate who has done a push poll is Marco Rubio , â€ �
Cruz says , adding : â€œEthics matter.â€ � â€œI think Justice Scaliaâ€ ™ s passing this week elevated the stakes of this election , â€ � Cruz says .
He says South Carolina voters are asking themselves , â€˜Who
can I trust?â€ ™ Cruz says that Trumpâ€ ™ s â€œfour decadesâ€ � of writing checks for â€œleft - wing Democratsâ€ � proves that he doesnâ€ ™ t care about conservative justices .
â€œWe are one justice away from the second amendment being erased from the Bill of Rights.â€ �
In case anyone missed that , Cruz puts a finer point on it :
A vote for Donald Trump is a vote to erase the second amendment from the Bill of Rights.â€ � Cruz at peak Cruz : Even in the annals of frivolous lawsuits , this takes the cake .
And so Donald I would encourage you , if you want to file a lawsuit challenging this ad , claiming it is defamation , file a lawsuit .
â€œIt is a remarkable contention that an ad that plays video of Donald Trump speaking on national television is somehow defamation.â€ �
Cruz is going after Trump in this news conference , listing â€œpro - abortion Democratsâ€ � that Trump has contributed to :
At a news conference in Seneca , New Hampshire , Texas senator Ted Cruz is reading a cease - and - desist letter his campaign received from Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s lawyer .
Cruz says the letter singles out an ad Cruz is running tarring Trump as pro - choice and unfit to pick the next Supreme Court justice .
â€œWe can not trust Donald Trump with these serious decisions , â€ � the ad says .
On Monday , Trump threatened to sue Cruz over the senatorâ€ ™ s eligibility for president , saying that unless his rival stops telling â€œliesâ€ � he will take the issue of his birth in Canada to court .
Hereâ€ ™ s the Cruz ad : Will the South Carolina governor pick a horse in the South Carolina race ?
Speaking of polls â€ “
hey look
thereâ€
™ s another one , conducted in South Carolina by Monmouth Universityâ€ ™ s
polling institute , which agrees with the picture everyone else has taken in the state of a big lead for Trump , just three days out .
Among voters likely to participate in South Carolinaâ€ ™ s Republican primary on Saturday , the pollster reports , itâ€ ™ s :
Trump 35 â€ “
Cruz 19 â€ “ Rubio 17 â€
“ Kasich 9 â€
“ Bush 8 â€ “ Carson 7
That 16-point lead for Trump is close to his 17.5-point lead in the state in Real Clear Politicsâ€ ™ polling averages .
Monmouth sees broad support for Trump across pretty much all demographic groups : Trump is the clear favorite of voters who have not been to college ( 53 % ) , but also garners the support of about 3-in-10 voters with a college education .
He leads among both men ( 36 % ) and women ( 34 % ) ; among voters under 50 years old ( 34 % ) and those age 50 or older ( 35 % ) ; among voters in veteransâ€ ™ households ( 38 % ) as well as non - veterans ( 32 % ) ; and among evangelical Christians ( 33 % ) and non - evangelicals ( 37 % ) alike .
Cruz ( 31 % ) barely nips Trump ( 27 % ) among very conservative voters , but Trump enjoys the most support of any candidate among somewhat conservative ( 40 % ) and moderate ( 41 % ) voters .
Is Bernie Sanders a national candidate ?
The question is met with indignation by Sanders supporters , who point to repeated instances so far this election cycle of Sanders upending the conventional wisdom that heâ€ ™ s a niche candidate : by building a huge national network of donors , by drawing crowds of thousands from New Hampshire to Nevada to Michigan , by nearly beating Hillary Clinton in Iowa after trailing there in polls by double digits , by tying Clinton in two polls of Nevada voters , and by his whopping 22-point win in New Hampshire , which Clinton won in 2008 .
And yet : a new Public Policy Polling survey poses the question of Sandersâ€ ™ national viability with new urgency .
The poll finds Hillary Clinton leading the way in 10 of 12 states that will vote between 1 March and 8 March .
Clinton holds double - digit leads in nine of those states , according to the poll .
Sanders leads only in Massachusetts and in Vermont , his home state .
He appears close to Clinton in Oklahoma , which is among 14 states to vote on 1 March .
Sanders has long suffered a perceived gap with Clinton among non - white voters and voters without a college degree â€ “ groups that figure heavily in the demographics of states that will vote in early March .
Clinton has vociferously challenged Sandersâ€ ™ attempt in particular to close the gap with African American voters .
â€œYou canâ€ ™ t just show up at election time and say the right things and think thatâ€ ™ s enough
, â€ � Clinton said in a speech to civil rights leaders in Harlem on Tuesday .
â€œWe canâ€ ™ t start building relationships a few weeks before a vote.â€ �
The argument appears to be holding with South Carolina voters , who polling averages say favor Clinton by more than 20 points .
Pollsters arenâ€ ™ t always right ( ! ) and the numbers can change quickly .
But the emerging national picture does not appear , as the latest numbers come in , to hold obvious good news for the insurgent candidate .
To which his supporters might say , see you at the voting booth .
Candidates , theyâ€ ™ re just like us !
At least Texas senator Ted Cruz is , apparently .
Because Cruz needs a tanker truck of coffee in the morning to succeed at basic functions such as blinking and speech , the Washington Postâ€ ™ s
Katie Zezima entertainingly reports : There are the emails with the 1 a.m. time stamp , dinners that start when some people go to bed and meetings that stretch late into the night .
Donâ€ ™ t expect to see him bright and early on the campaign trail â€ ” in a field of GOP presidential candidates where 8 a.m. events happen with some regularity , Cruz starts late in the morning , often clutching a cup of coffee .
Cruz is a â€œnight owl , â€ � his wife Heidi says , telling voters her husband shares nocturnal tendencies with his mother .
â€œWhen he comes home from the campaign trail , theyâ€ ™ re often in the living room talking late , late into the nightâ€ � over tea , she said last month .
Enjoy the full piece here .

A long Bernie Sanders video spot featuring Erica Garner , the daughter of Eric Garner , the Staten Island man who died after being placed in a chokehold by police , is circulating widely in advance of the Democratic South Carolina primary in 10 days .
A majority of South Carolina Democratic primary - goers are African American .
Erica Garner has been appearing with Sanders on the campaign trail in the state .
â€œIâ€ ™ m behind anyone whoâ€ ™ s going to listen and speak up for us .
And I think we need to believe in a leader like Bernie Sanders , â€ � Erica Garner says in the video .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s not scared to go up against the criminal justice system .
Heâ€ ™ s not
scared.â€ �
Garner tells her fatherâ€ ™ s story and about how the family has dealt with his death : I was able to see my dad die on national TV .
They donâ€
™ t know what they took from us .
He wasnâ€ ™ t just someone that no one cared for him , or no one loved him .
He was loved dearly ...
Iâ€ ™ m just trying to get the truth out there to tell his side of the story .
He was being the loving , caring man that he was , and he was murdered .
The spot gets an approving nod from Republican strategist Rick Wilson : Donald Trump was on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert last night .
Well , Trump called into the show , at least .
Colbert is from Charleston , South Carolina , where Republicans plan to vote â€ “ apparently a lot of them for Trump â€ “ on Saturday .
Trump calls in .
Colbert asks him what heâ€ ™ s wearing .
Trump says heâ€ ™ s wearing â€œa very beautiful blue suit with a very poor tie but the tie will get better as the day goes on.â€ � Weird .
Then Trump says he hopes South Carolina will vote for him .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to make America great again.â€ �
Colbert challenges Trump on his â€œpotty mouth.â€
�
Trump : â€œIâ€ ™ ve decided to stopâ€ � talking dirty .
â€œThese are very minor words , and in many cases I actually bleep them out myself , â€ �
he says .
Go bleep yourself ?
Colbert says he should keep a swear jar and every time he cusses he should put a billion dollars in there .
Then Trump says the senate â€œhas a right ... not to vote on [ a new Supreme Court nominee ] .
Look , if I was the president Iâ€ ™
d be pushing.â€ �
Trump tries a southern accent :
â€œPlease vote for me , yâ€ ™ all.â€ � Exeunt .
After being battered on national security in Iowa by Marco Rubio , Ted Cruz is taking no chances in the ultra hawkish state of South Carolina , writes Guardian political correspondent Ben Jacobs :
Proclaiming that he wants a military with â€œmore tooth and less tailâ€ � , Cruz went on a statewide tour on Tuesday to tout his national security credentials .
Starting with a speech on board the USS Yorktown , a decommissioned aircraft carrier from the second world war , the senator from Texas laid out an approach that relied on beefing up the US armed forces with occasional doses of red meat for social conservative voters .
In a campaign stop in Columbia , Cruz pledged to increase the US armyâ€ ™ s enlistment by 75,000 troops as well as add more ships to the navy and more planes to the air force .
However , he made clear that these additional soldiers would be mostly men , casting scorn upon those Republican rivals who want to â€œdraft our daughters into combatâ€ � .

Roomâ€ � at Kensington Palace , London , Wednesday , Feb. 17 , 2016.â€
™ Hello , and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House .
Three days from now , Democrats caucus in Nevada and Republicans hold a primary in South Carolina .
Hereâ€ ™ s whatâ€ ™ s happening : Nevada neck - and - neck ?
In a CNN / ORC poll of likely caucus attendees published Wednesday , 48 % said they supported Hillary Clinton and 47 % backed Sanders .
Be advised that the Nevada caucuses have proven tricky for pollsters in the past .
This is the second recent poll to show a Nevada tie , FWIW .
The same poll showed Trump way ahead in Nevada among likely caucus - goers , with 45 % to Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s 19 % , and Clinton with a large lead in South Carolina , where Democrats vote on Saturday 27 February .
The president got some things off his mind in a news conference yesterday , including the need for the Senate to consider his next supreme court pick ...
The constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen .
When there is a vacancy on the supreme court , the president of the United States is to nominate someone .
The Senate is to consider that nomination , and either they disapprove of that nominee , or that nominee is elevated to the supreme court ...
There is more than enough time for the Senate to consider in a thoughtful way the record of a nominee that I present and to make a decision . ...
and his perception that Donald J Trump will not be the 45th US president : I continue to believe Mr Trump will not be president , and the reason is that I have a lot of faith in the American people , and
and I think they recognize that being president is a serious job .
Point , counterpoint : Then again , normal usually happens .
Our team in the field today includes Ben Jacobs with Donald Trump and Sabrina Siddiqui with Marco Rubio .
Later Sabrina will attend a town hall featuring three Republican candidates : Carson , Rubio and Ted Cruz .
As counter - programming to the town hall , Trump is holding an event of his own , some kind of love - in tonight with MSNBC host Joe Scarborough .
Hey , look , itâ€ ™ s American politics in a nutshell .
Jeb Bushâ€ ™ s America ... ... versus Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ America :
Honorable mention :"
2016-02-17,"After being battered on national security in Iowa by Marco Rubio , Ted Cruz is taking no chances in the ultra hawkish state of South Carolina .
Proclaiming that he wants a military with â€œmore tooth and less tailâ€ � , Cruz went on a statewide tour on Tuesday to tout his national security credentials .
Starting with a speech on board the USS Yorktown , a decommissioned aircraft carrier from the second world war , the senator from Texas laid out an approach that relied on beefing up the US armed forces with occasional doses of red meat for social conservative voters .
In a campaign stop in Columbia , Cruz pledged to increase the US armyâ€ ™ s enlistment by 75,000 troops as well as add more ships to the navy and more planes to the air force .
However , he made clear that these additional soldiers would be mostly men , casting scorn upon those Republican rivals who want to â€œdraft our daughters into combatâ€ � .
He said that when the subject of women in combat was brought up at a recent debate , he felt like he had â€œentered the Twilight Zoneâ€ � .
Cruz asked the audience : â€œHave we lost our facilities ?
Is political correctness so all - consuming that weâ€ ™ re not willing to say that thatâ€ ™ s just nuts?â€
�
The senator went on to state that if he is elected to the White House â€œthe time of the military being treated as a cauldron for social experiments is overâ€ � .
Cruz went to express scorn for â€œplush - bottomed bureaucratsâ€ � and insist â€œno longer is the focus going to be on gluten - free MREsâ€ � .
Cruz also veered into second world war analogies , pledging to restore a bust of Winston Churchill to the White House and comparing Barack Obama to Neville Chamberlain .
To him , the Iran deal was similar to the Munich agreement of 1938 with Obama promising â€œpeace for our timeâ€ � .
Cruz , an ardent critic of the deal , then went on to compare Iran to Nazi Germany :
â€œWhen you allow psychotic maniacs to assemble the tools of murder and warfare it does not work out well for the free world.â€ �
He also tried to contrast his fitness to be commander - in - chief to that of his closest rival , Republican frontrunner Donald Trump .
Cruz poked at Trumpâ€ ™ s active presence on social media , saying : â€œWhen radical terrorists declare jihad on us , the answer is not to tweet insults .
The answer is to unleash the holy wrath of the United States.â€ � Cruz , though , is still running behind Trump in South Carolina .
Recent polls have the real estate mogul with a 15- to 20-point lead over the senator from Texas in the crucial first - in - the - south primary .
However , Cruz did come from behind to beat Trump in the Iowa caucuses earlier in February , and his campaign is hoping that his push on national security in a state with significant military presence can help accomplish that feat again ."
2016-02-17,"Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio – and all the other Republican obstructionists who want to block Obama from nominating a new US supreme court justice – would be wise to learn their 19th century history before they ’re doomed to repeat it .
Immediately after the death over the weekend of Justice Antonin Scalia , Republican members of Congress , led by Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell , announced that they would block any nomination to the court by Obama , a call echoed by Republican presidential candidates .
But such efforts to avoid confirming a judge with opposing views may well backfire –
it ’s impossible to call in advance whether forcing a delay will work in the service of one ’s ideological agenda , or against it .
It happened both ways in the 19th century , when two supreme court justices died in election years — associate justice Henry Baldwin , who died in April 1844 , and chief justice Roger B Taney , who passed away just a month before election day in 1864 .
It might seem unfair to draw parallels between Scalia and Taney , who was almost certainly the worst chief justice in US history ; however , despite liberal colleague Ruth Bader Ginsburg ’s obvious deep affection for Scalia , there ’s no denying that he was responsible for the high court ’s conservative shift in recent years , from the Citizens United case , which unleashed the floodgates of corporate money into politics , to the overturning of the Voting Rights Act , to his constant opposition to reproductive rights and marriage equality .
Taney , who served on the court from 1836 to his death , was a staunch conservative and a proponent of slavery .
Most famously , he handed down the infamous Dred Scott decision in 1857 that ruled that African Americans could not be citizens .
In Taney ’s words , blacks were “ altogether unfit to associate with the white race , either in social or political relations , and so far unfit that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect ” .
Yes , Citizens United pales in comparison to this , but keep in mind that Scalia was the person who once compared homosexuality to “ reprehensible ” conduct , such as “ murder , for example , or polygamy , or cruelty to animals ” .
In his dissent in Lawrence v Texas , which struck down Texas ’s sodomy laws , he opined that homosexuality was akin to “ prostitution , adult incest , adultery , obscenity , and child pornography
” .
Taney , originally from the border state of Maryland , remained on the bench during the civil war and was a thorn in Abraham Lincoln ’s side , ruling against the president during the war , most famously when Lincoln suspended habeas corpus .
Taney ’s death in October 1864
delighted many ; most of Lincoln ’s cabinet refused to attend the funeral , including secretary of the navy Gideon Welles , who wrote in his diary : “ The course pursued [ by Taney ] in the Dred Scott case and all the attending circumstances forfeited respect for him as a man or a judge .
”
Despite the fact that the Senate was firmly controlled by liberal Republicans ( a party which shares little but a name with its current incarnation ) , Lincoln held off naming a successor to Taney until after his reelection , not wanting to provide any ammunition over his choice to his rival , Democrat George B McClellan .
Lincoln won reelection handily .
A month later , Salmon Chase , the former Treasury secretary , was nominated and confirmed to the bench in a single day .
His support for Lincoln ’s agenda helped the passage of the 13th , 14th and 15th amendments – all of which would have been adamantly opposed by racist Roger Taney .
Similarly , it seems that whomever Obama nominates to the high court will have a similar Chase - like effect , pointing the court in a more liberal direction and undoing some of Scalia ’s work – if the president can get the Senate to vet his eventual nominee .
There ’s a chance , however , that Obama will face the same treatment as John Tyler , the 10th president and the first vice - president to take office upon the death of a president .
William Henry Harrison , elected on the Whig ticket in 1840 , caught pneumonia at his inauguration and died 30 days later , becoming the country ’s first president to die in office ( and the one with the shortest tenure ) .
The constitution did not then have a formal right of succession , but that did n’t stop Tyler from assuming the presidency .
His rivals – basically everyone in Washington – took to calling him “
His Accidency .
”
Tyler ’s one term in office is rarely remembered today , but he had the bad luck to have two supreme court justices die in office during his term : Smith Thompson and Henry Baldwin .
When Thompson died in December 1843 , Tyler nominated his treasury secretary , John C Spencer , to the bench , but the Whig - controlled Senate saw Spencer as a traitor to the party and thwarted his appointment .
Tyler ’s next nominee , Edward King , faced a similar fate .
By that point , Tyler ’s rival , Whig Senator Henry Clay , was running for president and certainly wanted to wait until he was in office to make his own nomination and shape the court .
Then , in April 1844 , associate justice Henry Baldwin also passed away , leaving two vacancies on the bench .
Clay ’s Senate doubled down , refusing to support any Tyler nominee .
When Clay lost the 1844 presidential election , a replacement for Thompson – Democrat Samuel Nelson – was finally confirmed in February 1845 ,
Tyler ’s last month in office .
But it took the Senate a record 27 months after Baldwin ’s death before President James K Polk ’s eventual nominee , Democrat Robert Cooper Grier , was confirmed in 1846 .
Henry Clay ’s plan had backfired : he had hoped to hand pick two Whigs for the bench ; instead the supreme court was now firmly in the hands of Roger Taney ’s Democrats , whose rulings would fundamentally alter America ’s history and ultimately lead to the civil war .
Today ’s Senate Republicans should be careful what they wish for : come January 2017 , the White House and Congress may look very different – and not in the way they imagine ."
2016-02-18,"Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio addressed the issue of race in deeply personal terms on Wednesday , drawing on his experience as a Cuban American whose family was occasionally confronted with racist comments .
Speaking at a town hall forum hosted by CNN , Rubio cited his childhood years living in Las Vegas during the Mariel boat lift in 1980 .
Some neighborhood kids â€œtauntedâ€ � his family , Rubio said , by asking : â€œWhy donâ€
™ t you go back on your boat and go back to your country?â€
�
â€œI didnâ€
™ t know what they were talking about .
What boat ?
My mom doesnâ€ ™ t even swim .
[ Sheâ€ ™ s ] afraid of water , â€ � Rubio said .
But his parents â€ “ immigrants from Cuba who worked as a bartender and a maid
â€ “ raised him and his siblings to not be resentful , Rubio added .
â€œDonâ€
™ t blame the kids .
They must be hearing it from somebody , â€ �
he recalled his parents as saying .
â€œThat disturbed me as a young child .
For the most part in my life , I never saw that as a reflection on America but as a reflection on those kids .
My parents never raised us to feel that we were victims.â€ �
Rubio has often discussed race relations on the campaign trail , largely in response to questions from the audience .
But he has seldom spoken from experience .
Rubioâ€ ™ s opponents have sought to portray him as robotic after the senator repeated the same line , almost verbatim , at least four times in a memorable encounter with New Jersey governor Chris Christie at a Republican debate in New Hampshire .
The torrent of criticism over Rubioâ€ ™ s scripted demeanor prompted the Florida senator to fall to a disappointing fifth - place finish in the state , setting back his campaignâ€ ™ s momentum .
Rubio is seeking a comeback in South Carolina , where he is polling in third behind Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and businessman Donald Trump .
Cruz also appeared at Wednesdayâ€ ™ s forum , as did retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson .
Other Republican candidates will participate in a second town hall on Thursday in Columbia .
During his response on race , Rubio also brought an anecdote he has told on the campaign trail about a black friend who is frequently pulled over by police â€ “ even though he is a police officer .
â€œHe gets pulled over , never gets a ticket .
No one has any explanation .
What is he supposed to think?â€ �
Rubio said , adding that a significant number of young African American men â€œfeel as if they are treated differently than the rest of societyâ€ � .
The senator also pushed back against the notion that the Republican party lacks diversity .
â€œI got the endorsement of a governor of Indian descent , who endorsed a presidential candidate of Cuban descent , and tomorrow weâ€ ™ ll be campaigning alongside an African American Republican senator , â€ � Rubio said , in reference to South Carolina governor Nikki Haley and Senator Tim Scott .
Also discussed in the forum was late - breaking news that Barack Obama would travel to Cuba next month .
Rubio , a vocal critic of restoring diplomatic relations between Washington and Havana , said he would not travel to the island unless it was â€œa free
Cubaâ€ � .
â€œI will tell you the problem with the Cuban government .
Itâ€ ™ s not just a communist dictatorship , itâ€ ™ s an anti - American communist dictatorship , â€ � he said .
Cruz , who took the stage after Rubio , also criticized rapprochement with its government .
Asked if he would visit Cuba as president , the senator from Texas responded : â€œNot as long as the Castros are in power.â€ �
Cruz continued to focus his fire on Trump , spending a lengthy portion at the top of his Q&amp;A discussing their escalating feud .
He described his reaction to receiving a cease and desist letter from Trump over an attack ad as an incident he simply could not take seriously .
â€œIâ€ ™ ll confess , I laughed out loud , â€ � Cruz said .
Carson , who has slipped dramatically in the polls , was characterized as usual by a quiet showing .
He did , however , break with many Republican candidates on the issue of whether Obama should nominate a replacement for the late supreme court justice Antonin Scalia .
â€œI probably would take the opportunity to nominate someone .
Doesnâ€ ™ t necessarily mean that person will be acted on or confirmed , â€ � he said .
â€œWhy not do it?â€ �"
2016-02-21,"Donald Trump now has a clear path toward the Republican nomination for the White House after a victory in the South Carolina primary that confirms his insurgent campaign as a political juggernaut .
Frustrated conservatives in the first state to vote in the American south preferred his channeling of populist anger to the platforms of evangelical Texas senator Ted Cruz and the establishment Florida senator Marco Rubio , the Associated Press declared .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s nothing easy about running for president , I can tell you , â€ �
Trump told a rally in Spartanburg .
â€œItâ€ ™ s
tough , itâ€ ™ s mean ,
itâ€ ™ s nasty , itâ€ ™ s vicious â€ ¦ itâ€ ™ s
beautiful.â€ �
He added : â€œWhen you win , itâ€ ™ s beautiful.â€ � Former Florida governor Jeb Bush , the son and brother of two former presidents , dropped out after another disappointing showing in a race that was once thought to be his to lose .
With nearly 93.5 % of the vote reported on Saturday evening , Trump had captured 32.8 % , with Cruz and Rubio battling it out for second place , each with around 22 % of the vote .
Bush , Ohio governor John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson languished in the single digits .
Trump has been the Republican frontrunner since soon after he announced his bid eight months ago and launched himself into a ceaseless run of controversy , but he has now won two of the first three presidential nominating contests and is starting to build a strong lead among the delegates who officially select the partyâ€ ™ s nominee .
Paired with a closer - than - anticipated finish for the democratic socialist Bernie Sanders behind Hillary Clinton in Nevadaâ€ ™ s Democratic caucus on Saturday , the rise of the outsider in American politics appears to have gained lasting traction with voters .
â€œVoters want to change the way DC functions , â€ �
Trumpâ€ ™ s
campaign manager , Corey Lewandowski , said , â€œand the only way to do that is to elect Donald Trump.â€ � The Republicans now switch states with the Democrats and head to Nevada , where Trumpâ€ ™ s casino empire has led him to a more than 20-point lead in polling averages .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re now off to Nevada â€ “
itâ€
™ s a great state , and weâ€ ™ ve got great people ,
â€ �
Trump told his victory rally .
â€œThe only thing that stops the crowds are the walls!â€ �
On the first day of March â€ “ so - called â€œSuper Tuesdayâ€ �
â€ “
a dozen states hold their nominating contests and the once - expansive GOP field may finally start to narrow to a small number of candidates .
Trump has been leading in the polls in almost all of those states except Texas , where Cruz holds a hometown advantage .
â€œLetâ€ ™ s put this thing
away!â€ �
Trump said as he exited the stage in Spartanburg .
The bombastic billionaire had led in nearly every poll in South Carolina despite getting into homestretch fights with Pope Francis and the Bush family .
Lewandowski boasted to reporters on Friday that Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign only spent $ 1.3 m in the state , one - tenth of what Bush and his connected Super Pacs had spent .
Asked by the Guardian before he suspended his campaign outside a polling station in Daniel Island on Friday if he would consider serving as Trumpâ€ ™ s vice - president , Bush said simply : â€œNo.â€ �
â€œA number of the pundits said if a couple of other candidates drop out and add them together , itâ€ ™ s going to equal Trump .
Theyâ€ ™ re geniuses , â€ �
Trump told his victory rally with visible disdain .
He added : â€œThey
donâ€ ™ t understand : as people drop out , I am going to get a lot more votes also.â€ � Ed McMullen , Trumpâ€ ™ s state chair in South Carolina , said the campaign had â€œdispelled a lot of myths : â€˜no ground gameâ€ ™ , â€˜they wonâ€ ™ t come outâ€ ™ , â€˜just there for the showâ€ ™ .
Those myths are all gone .
They turned out hard â€ “ they come out excited and really voted hard for Mr Trump.â€
�
Trump achieved his victory despite repeatedly courting more controversy than usual , from the spat with the pope to a seeming endorsement of war crimes .
To many of his supporters , however , this comes across as straight talk .
At a rally on Wednesday , Joe Bartone , a Trump supporter from Mount Pleasant , said he found Trump â€œa lot smarter than he comes acrossâ€ � .
â€œI like Trump , but he acts like an ass
, â€ � said a sales engineer who would only identify himself as Jason R , as he finished voting for Cruz on Saturday in the suburb of Chapin to South Carolinaâ€ ™ s north - west , where voters expressed a deep distrust of government .
â€œAll politicians are filth , but Cruz is the lesser of all the evils .
Heâ€ ™ s a criminal like the rest of them , but you got ta vote.â€ �
In a state with a reputation for both political dirty tricks and now high turnout , voters witnessed rival candidates repeatedly accusing each other of lying and chicanery .
Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign sent out a statement on election day accusing Cruz of adopting a â€œstrategy to steal elections through rumors and liesâ€ � .
Trump described Cruz at a campaign rally on Friday night as â€œlying more than any human being I have
ever seenâ€ � .
In return , Cruz dared Trump to sue him and bashed Rubio as not being a true conservative .
Rubio arrived in the state at arguably the lowest point of his campaign , following a disappointing fifth - place finish in New Hampshire on the heels of a disastrous debate performance two days before that primary .
But the senatorâ€ ™ s fortunes changed quickly in South Carolina , beginning with a debate that offered him a shot at redemption going into a critical week for his campaign .
â€œAfter tonight this has become a three - person race , and we will win the nomination ,
â€ �
Rubio told supporters in Columbia .
â€œNow the children of the Reagan revolution are ready to assume the mantle of leadership.â€ �
But the reality remains that he has yet to win a primary contest .
â€œWe are the only campaign that has beaten and can beat Donald Trump , â€ � said Cruz in his speech to supporters in Columbia .
â€œOnly one strong conservative is in a position to win this race.â€ �
In the â€œupstateâ€ � city of Greenville , a 38-year - old mother of four said she was voting for the first time she could remember since turning 18 .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t even think I actually agree with everything Rubio says , but I think he has the best chance here in South Carolina and in the actual election against Hillary , â€ � said the woman , who declined to provide her name for fear of upsetting her family .
â€œI thought about voting for a Democrat , but my husband told me , â€˜No way.â€ ™ â€œI just think itâ€ ™ s kind of crazy that Donald Trump could be president , â€ �
she said .
â€œI figured it would just go away.â€ �"
2016-02-21,"After at least three victory speeches in South Carolina on Saturday night â€ “ delivered with full and earnest conviction , defying the doubters and predicting a surefire path to the presidency â€ “ you could be forgiven for thinking there were at least three Republican winners .
For a country that celebrates its winners and immediately , deliberately forgets its losers , it was a strange turn of events to watch Donald Trump , Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz all give victory speeches after Trumpâ€ ™
s win .
Republicans ( especially Trump ) like to accuse President Obama of trying to turn America into a feeble European - style home of losers ; no one in America celebrates even their respectable defeats quite like the Europeans do .
So watching Rubio and Cruz declare victory despite defeat was much like watching the British crack open champagne to celebrate sixth place at the Olympics .
Donald Trump , the real victor in South Carolina ( and now the clear frontrunner for the nomination ) , was unusually gracious in his victory speech â€ “ not to his rivals , of course , but to his family .
For the first time , Trump willingly surrendered the microphone to his wife Melania Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump .
And not since John Kerryâ€ ™ s nomination has the American voting public had to parse such a thick accent from the spouse of a candidate promising to make America strong again .
Trump initially gave some cursory praise to Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio for doing â€œquite wellâ€ �
but , when his supporters booed , he reassured them
this playacting was â€œjust one
secondâ€ � and that â€œtomorrow morning weâ€ ™ ll be back.â€
�
Back to what ?
Back to the type of campaigning he so clearly loves .
â€œItâ€ ™ s tough .
Itâ€ ™ s nasty .
Itâ€ ™ s mean .
Itâ€ ™ s vicious , â€ � he said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s beautiful.â€
�
It turns out that beauty is , like victory , in the eye of the beholder .
Because minutes after Trump finished extolling the beauty of a mean , vicious campaign , the candidates who lost to that campaign pretended , entirely shamelessly , that they had in fact won .
Rubio , who has yet to win a single primary or caucus , proclaimed that he would win the nomination .
â€œThe children of the Reagan revolution are ready to assume the mantle of leadershipâ€ �
he said , ignoring the uncomfortable fact that no state and no poll has yet handed him said mantle of leadership .
If that wasnâ€ ™ t egotistical enough , Rubio compared his arrival in South Carolina to his Cuban parents arriving in America : â€œTo me , South Carolina will always be the place of new beginnings and fresh starts.â€ �
If losing counts as a fresh start , itâ€ ™ s hard to see how Rubioâ€ ™ s speechwriters would describe his excitement in the unlikely prospect of success .
If he comes first in New Mexico , will Rubio begin his own inauguration parade straight to Washington DC ?
Ted Cruz , in his defeat - as - victory speech , at least made an attempt to identify who or what he had beaten so convincingly .
It turns out that Cruz came first against something called Expectations , a cruel and ugly opponent determined to snuff out the very spirit of America .
Cruz explained how he had won in Iowa .
But since that was a few weeks ago , he couldnâ€ ™ t countenance that being his only win , so he explained how he had also â€œdefied expectationsâ€ � in New Hampshire .
And now South Carolina had â€œgiven us another remarkable result.â€
�
â€œRemarkableâ€ � is how you describe a friendâ€ ™ s performance in a play youâ€ ™
d rather forget .
Cruz also declared victory in his effort to end Obamacare , which ( as we all know ) would certainly have been a remarkable result for the Texas senator in a one - state primary election .
â€œWe will not go quietly into the night and give up on a brighter Americaâ€ �
he said , in perhaps the truest statement to emerge from his lips : quiet , Cruz is not .
The man who truly lost _ and had the honesty to admit it _ was the former establishment pick known as Jeb!.
The Bush dynasty threw all its generational power behind its second son , and its donors threw more than $ 100 million on top of that , all to no avail .
So Bush gave a tender appreciation of his wife and family , and conceded to what his rivals refuse to acknowledge : reality .
For their part , those rivals could barely tell the truth about Bush himself .
Cruz said that Bush had not lowered himself to â€œthe gutterâ€ � with â€œinsults and attacksâ€ � which conveniently ignored Bushâ€ ™ s debate performance , his Twitter trolling and his Super PACâ€ ™ s ads .
Rubio praised Bush as â€œthe greatest governor in the history of Floridaâ€ � but conceded that he hadnâ€ ™ t yet spoken to him , probably because they are reportedly no longer on speaking terms .
Itâ€ ™
s hard to see how even one of two such delusional candidates â€ “ Rubio and Cruz â€ “ can bring themselves to stand aside and support the other to stop Donald Trump .
But if neither man can , they will be celebrating defeat for many weeks to come .
And as the great orange hope of the Republican party put it on Saturday night , thatâ€ ™ s â€œbeautifulâ€ �
â€ “ at least , it is if youâ€ ™ re either a Democrat or Donald Trump ."
2016-02-21,"Thatâ€ ™ s all for the liveblog today .
Here are some highlights from the campaign trail on Sunday : Marco Rubio talked about slavery at a rally in Franklin , Tennessee .
Donald Trump said reporters are â€œterrible , terrible human beingsâ€ � in Georgia , prompting his supporters to scream â€œyouâ€ ™ re a bitch!â€ � at the media pen .
The Guardian interviewed Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s most loyal supporter under the age of five .
Ben Carson is still running and told a gay voter in Reno that LGBT people do not make him â€œuncomfortableâ€ � .
Ted Cruz discussed insects while campaigning in the Nevada desert .
Back in Reno , Nevada , Ben Carson supporters explained why they are still backing the retired surgeon and whether they think he will stay in the race â€ “ and win the GOP nomination .
Jeff Baclet , 46 , owner of a computer store â€œHeâ€ ™ s a break from the system , and his foundation is based in the Bible , which has a lot of wisdom ...
Thereâ€ ™ s also a real peaceful demeanor about him , and even though the media says he canâ€ ™ t be tough , in some of the toughest questions , heâ€ ™ s been able to give the toughest answers that are not politically correct ...
I donâ€
™ t think
heâ€
™ s going to drop out.â€ � Eunice Detton , 77 , retired â€œI like his values , and Iâ€ ™
d like to see somebody who is honest and practices what he believes ...
Iâ€ ™ m not worried about him dropping out .
Itâ€ ™ s too early to tell.â€ �
Mary Davis , 61 , truck driver â€œI think
heâ€

and he loves Jesus .
Thatâ€ ™ s always a plus in my book ...
I was really impressed with him today .
Iâ€ ™ ve been sending pictures of him to my kids .
Theyâ€ ™ re all Democrats , but Iâ€ ™ m like â€˜yâ€ ™ all are crazy .
Heâ€ ™ s awesomeâ€ ™ ...
I hope he stays in the race .
As long as we want him there , I donâ€
™ t think heâ€ ™ ll drop out.â€ � Danette Gentry , 58 , educator â€œHis policy on education is what appeals to me ...
He has supported students in inner city schools ... and one of his goals is to make academics as appealing as sports ...
Heâ€ ™ ll stay in the race .
Heâ€ ™ s resolute.â€

The Guardianâ€ ™ s Maria L La Ganga is in Pahrump , Nevada where Ted Cruz just campaigned :
Whoâ€ ™ d have thought that Ted Cruz , the irascible senator from Texas who wants to be the leader of the free world , could do a respectable turn as a biology teacher ?
Okay , a very Republican biology teacher .
Standing in the bed of a shiny black Ford F-150 pickup truck in a motel parking lot in the Nevada desert , Cruz rallied a couple of hundred supporters Sunday with his fiery , us - against - them world view .
â€œIf you see a candidate Washington embraces , â€ � he said , â€œrun and hide!â€ �
And â€œon my very first day in office , I intend to to tell the department of justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and prosecute any and all violations.â€ �
And : â€œWe need to defend the right to privacy .
Please leave your cell phones on .
I want Barack Obama to hear every word weâ€ ™ re saying.â€
�
And then there were the invertebrates .
â€œI was in West Texas ,
â€ �
he told the cheering crowd , which was resplendent in cowboy hats and boots .
â€œI
asked â€˜Whatâ€ ™ s the difference between insects and regulators ?
You canâ€
™ t use pesticides on the regulators.â€ ™ And this old West Texas farmer leaned back and said , â€˜Wanna bet?â€ ™ â€ � Cruz even mixed a little etymology in with his entomology here in Pahrump , two days before the critical Republican caucus .
With a population of around 37,000 , this dusty town on state route 160 is what passes for urban in rural Nye County , about an hour west of Las Vegas .
â€œYou can learn a lot about a word if you look at its history , â€ �
Professor Cruz told his alfresco class .
â€œPoly means many .
And tics means blood - sucking parasites.â€ �
He added , â€œThatâ€ ™ s a fairly accurate description of Washington , DC.â€ �
Ben Carson just told a gay voter that he is not â€œuncomfortableâ€ � with gay people .
A voter told the candidate that he is religious person and also a â€œgay Americanâ€ � .
The voter asked : â€œWhy are you uncomfortable with me?â€ �
Carson responded : â€œIâ€ ™ m not uncomfortable.â€ �
The voter said he had read about Carsonâ€ ™ s record on LGBT rights on the Human Rights Campaignâ€ ™ s website and that it seemed his views were anti - gay .
Carson said : â€œWhat I have said is our constitution protects everybody regardless of their sexual orientation .
It gives everyone equal rights , but it doesnâ€ ™ t give anyone extra rights.â€ �
The crowd in Reno applauded loudly .
Carson added : â€œI donâ€ ™ t have any problem at all with people are are gay and live together.â€ �
Ben Carson told his Nevada supporters that he has no intention of dropping out anytime soon : Right now , it is way too early in the game to give up .
If you were supposed to select a nominee after just three contests , then why did w go through all of this ? ...
If you call the game after the first inning , youâ€ ™ re going to be wrong most of the time .
Now that thereâ€ ™ s only five candidates on the Republican side , Iâ€ ™ m hopeful that now we can actually talk about the real solutions ... and not just make it into a personality contest , and if thatâ€ ™ s the case , I think weâ€ ™ ll start making some real progress .
During a question and answer session , one of his supporters in the back of the room offered his gratitude : â€œI want to thank you for staying the course on behalf of the United States.â€
�
In one sign that he is moving forward with his campaign
â€ “ one day after he received 7.6 % of the votes in South Carolina , placing him at the bottom of the group
â€ “ Carson said : â€œComing out tomorrow , on bencarson.com , will be a policy paper on how to manage the federal budget ...
I may be strange , but I actually think the policies and solutions are every bit as important as stomping and shouting and hollering.â€ �
At a casino in Reno , Ben Carson delivered a confusing speech in which he joked about all that he would accomplish as president : I would have everybody hating on each other â€ “ Democrats , Republicans ...
Iâ€ ™
d have a war on women , race wars ... war on anything imaginable ...
One thing I would do is create division ...
Iâ€ ™
d be giving people free telephones .
You can go to college for free .
Iâ€ ™
d just have everybody just expecting all these gifts from the government .
And then I would destroy the military ...
Thatâ€ ™ s what I would do if I was in charge
and I was trying to destroy America .
Doesnâ€ ™ t that kind of clue you in in terms of the danger that we are in right
now?â€
�
Ben Carson is still running for president .
Hereâ€ ™ s proof : He stopped in Reno , Nevada Sunday afternoon to speak to a crowd of roughly 200 people gathered in a relatively small conference room on the second floor of a casino resort .
The retired surgeon began his speech with remarks that briefly seemed to allude to the struggles of his campaign after securing few votes in the South Carolina primary on Saturday .
Carson said he often asks himself : â€œIs it really worth everything you have [ to run for president ] , to go through people attacking you?â€ �
â€œThe answer is no , â€ � he said , to laughs .
After a pause , he clarified : â€œNot if youâ€ ™ re doing it for yourself .
But if youâ€ ™ re doing it for others , the answer is a resounding yes.â€ �
Ted Cruz is set to arrive soon in Parhump , Nevada for one of his final rallies before the Tuesday caucus .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s Maria L La Ganga caught Idaho state representative Raul Labrador rallying the troops before the candidateâ€ ™ s arrival .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s Lauren Gambino has filed this dispatch from North Charleston , South Carolina where she met Tiny Hillary :
Tiny Hillary , whose real name is Sullivan , might be the former secretary of stateâ€ ™ s most enthusiastic supporter under five .
The four - year - old loves Hillary Clinton so much that she dressed as her for Halloween , wearing a tiny navy pantsuit with an American flag pin on the lapel and a string of pearls .
She has seen Clinton speak on three occasions .
When I ask if sheâ€ ™ s met Hillary Clinton , Sullivan smiles sheepishly and nods .
She holds up two fingers .
â€œTwice , â€ � she says with pride .
Above her bed , she tells me , is a poster of the famous photo of Clinton wearing sunglasses on her blackberry .
Sullivanâ€ ™ s mother , Jennifer Jones Wood , says Sullivanâ€ ™ s obsession with Clinton probably started with her teenage sister , whose a big supporter as well .
But she believes her daughter is actually taking some of what the candidate is talking about .
â€œShe understands that Hillary is fighting for girls , â€ � Jones Wood says .
â€œShe wants girls to make the same amount of money for the same jobs.â€ �
She says her daughter begs her to take her to Clinton events whenever the former First Lady is in town .
â€œWe go to these things and we think that sheâ€ ™ s not paying attention but sheâ€ ™ s hearing everything and then on the way home we talk about.â€ �
As proof , Jones Wood says she took Sullivan to a Donald Trump event .
What did Sullivan think of The Donald ?
â€œHeâ€ ™ s mean and heâ€ ™ s orange , â€ � she recalls .
Sheâ€ ™ s also met Bill Clinton , Bernie Sanders and even Martin Oâ€ ™ Malley .
But thereâ€ ™ s no question who Sullivan would vote for if she only had 14 more years to her name .
â€œHillary!!â€ �
Sullivan exclaims as she pops an â€œHâ€ � stickers onto her shirt .
Who says Clinton has a problem with the youth vote ?
This is how Trump supporters in Georgia responded to the candidateâ€ ™ s mockery of the press , after he described the reporters as â€œterrible , terrible , terrible human beingsâ€ � :
Donald Trump in Georgia is offering his analysis on the state of the Democratic race : â€œI think itâ€ ™ s going to be Hillary.â€
�
He said Bernie Sanders never should have given Clinton a break about her email controversy :
â€œThat was the end of his campaign right there .
He gave it away.â€ �
Trump said that Sandersâ€ ™ rallies are the second - most energetic events in the race , behind his . â€œBernie is second .
But oh heâ€ ™ s fading .
I have a feeling Bernie is going to start to fade .
He had to win yesterday.â€ �
Referring to US secretary of state John Kerry , Trump added : â€œHe may be running .
Iâ€ ™
d love to run against him.â€
�
A protester has interrupted Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s rally in Georgia .
â€œYou can get him out of here .
Get him out , get him out!â€ �
Trump shouted to large cheers .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve been doing this now for awhile .
Thank you very much .
Enjoy your stay .
Look at those cameras , they turn like pretzels , they want to see it!â€ �
As the protester was escorted out , the crowd chanted â€œUSA !
USA !
USA!â€ �
Bernie Sanders has again far outpaced the other presidential candidates in small - donor fundraising for January , according to new numbers :
The Sanders campaign announced on Saturday , the day of the Nevada caucus , that it has to date received more than 4 m contributions .
Hillary Clinton now has more than 750,000 individual contributors , her campaign said this weekend .
Donors who gave $ 200 or less contributed $ 4.2 million in January .
After the lights briefly went off at Trumpâ€ ™ s rally , he started a bizarre chant saying he preferred the lights off : â€œTurn off the lights !
Turn off the lights !
Turn off the lights ! ...
Get those lights
off!â€
�
Trump also went on a negative rant about the media , earning loud boos from the crowd .
â€œI love tweeting .
Itâ€ ™ s like owning the New York Times without the losses , â€ � Trump said .
He also criticized the Wall Street Journal over a recent poll : â€œI guess
thatâ€ ™ s why papers donâ€ ™ t do too well nowadays , â€ � he continued in his speech .
Trump further complained about the fact that the media never shows footage of his large crowds : â€œI do hope we have a few protesters so the cameras will turn.â€ � Directing his attention at the media , he added : â€œThey are the worldâ€ ™ s most dishonest people .
They are terrible , terrible human beings .
They are .
They are terrible , terrible , terrible human beings .
Some are smiling .
Others are repulsed by that fact .
You are terrible.â€ �
We won with everything â€ “ tall people , short people , fat people , skinny people .
It was a great day .
-Donald
Trump is telling an energetic crowd in Georgia that he won every possible demographic in the South Carolina primary .
He continued : â€œWe won with women - I love the women .
We won with men , meh !
Iâ€ ™ d rather win with women , to be honest .
We won with evangelicals .
We won with the military ...
We love our vets .
We have illegal immigrants and theyâ€ ™ re treated much better than our vets in some cases.â€
�
A very confident Donald Trump , on the heels of a big win in the South Carolina primary , has taken the stage in Atlanta , Georgia .
He keeps repeating the word â€œwinningâ€ � : Theyâ€ ™ re saying theyâ€ ™ ve never seen anything like this before .
Weâ€
™ re going to win .
Weâ€ ™ re going to win .
Weâ€ ™ re going to win ...
Youâ€ ™ re going to get so tired of winning .
Youâ€ ™ re going to say , â€˜please please Mr. President , we canâ€
™ t stand it anymore!â€ ™ ...
I donâ€ ™ t care , Iâ€ ™ m going to keep winning ...
The victory last night was very , very decisive .
How did the Bush political dynasty come to an end ?
The Guardianâ€ ™ s
Sabrina Siddiqui and Adam Gabbatt , reporting from South Carolina , have published a deep dive into the â€œhorror show campaignâ€ � of Jeb Bush and how the candidacies of Donald Trump and Marco Rubio led to his downfall : Bush suspended his presidential campaign in the state he had hoped would resurrect his fortunes .
On Saturday , voters in South Carolina instead overwhelmingly chose Donald Trump , the businessman who a week before had blamed George W Bush for the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 , and accused the former president of lying about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
There , in microcosm , lay the problem that plagued Bush from the off : a surname that earned a record $ 100 m war chest before he had even declared his candidacy , and yet became one of his many disqualifications in the eyes of a primary electorate shaped less by conventional wisdom than anti - establishment fervor .
Read the whole analysis here : John Kasich , the only governor left in the presidential race , spent part of his Sunday signing legislation that diverts funding away from Planned Parenthood in Ohio .
The bill targets roughly $ 1.3 m in health department funds that Planned Parenthood uses for HIV testing initiatives , breast and cervical cancer screenings and violence against women prevention efforts , according to the AP .
The legislation blocks funds from going to entities that â€œperform or promoteâ€ � abortions .
Kasich has sometimes earned the â€œmoderateâ€ � label in the context of the presidential race , but Democrats in Ohio say he is much more of a staunch conservative .
He has repeatedly championed abortion restrictions in his state .
Marco Rubio just took the stage in Franklin , Tennessee .
His speech was focused on his faith and family , with the senator presenting himself as the best candidate to unite the Republican party and beat the Democrats .
â€œIf we stay on the road we are on right now ...
the American dream will die , â€ � he said .
â€œWe will still be a rich country ...
but we will lose the American dream ...
America is still a great people , we just have a bad president.â€ �
He continued : If you vote for me , I will unite this party .
If you vote for me , I will grow this party ...
the Democrats do not want to run against me , but I can not wait to run against them ...
If you elect me , I will be a president for all Americans â€ “ even the Americans that donâ€ ™ t agree with me ... even the Americans that say nasty things about me on Twitter .
I will cut their taxes , too .
Glenn Beck is fasting for Ted Cruz .
The conservative talk show host , who is rallying with Cruz in Henderson , Nevada Sunday night , has posted on his Facebook page :
I would like to ask you to join me and my family Monday in a fast for Ted Cruz , our country and the Nevada caucus .
Beck later expressed outrage that the internet was apparently mocking him for his Cruz fast .
He wrote : â€œSince when has a fast and prayer been crazy ? ...
Have we really become a nation that mocks those who pray and fast ?
The sad answer is yes.â€ �
In a second post , he added : â€œI am not running from this .
I own my comments and actions and encourage others to do the same .
Prayer , fasting and asking for a humbling of ourselves and nation .
I pray and fast not for Ted Cruz to win , but for His will to be done and that our will and wants will align with His.â€ � Beckâ€ ™ s fast comes days after he made comments suggesting that God took Justice Antonin Scaliaâ€ ™ s life in order to encourage voters to support Cruz .
Ending months of speculation with an announcement that is sure to be a significant game changer in the GOP race , actor and New Kids on the Block singer Donnie Wahlberg has endorsed Marco Rubio and will be joining the candidate at his rally in Las Vegas Sunday night .
The Blue Bloods star and brother of actor Mark Wahlberg had previously supported Carly Fiorina .
Donnie said in a statement Sunday morning : Even though we do not see eye to eye on every issue , I know that Marco is a man of principle who can be trusted to keep us safe and give each and every one of us a shot at the American Dream .
Here are some other celebrities who have expressed support for GOP candidates this season : Kid Rock recently said
heâ€ ™ s â€œvery interestedâ€ � in Ben Carson .
Dennis Rodman called Donald Trump a â€œgreat friendâ€ � and the businessman America needs in the White House .
Tim Allen likes John Kasich .
Reality star Phil Robertson of Duck Dynasty fame is supporting Ted Cruz .
Nevada Republican senator Dean Heller , a former supporter of Jeb Bush , has endorsed Marco Rubio days before the GOP caucus .
Heller , who had endorsed Bush last summer , said in a statement Sunday , less than a day after Bush announced his campaign suspension in South Carolina , that he has â€œbecome
convincedâ€
�
Rubio is the best choice for the White House : Marco Rubio is the next generation of conservative leadership in this country .
Iâ€ ™ ve become convinced that heâ€
™ s the candidate capable of uniting conservatives , growing our party , and beating the Democrats in November .
He understands what it takes to get our economy back on track and he understands how to keep us safe .
And Marco understands Nevada , he grew up here .
I am proud to offer my full support and look forward to campaigning with him in Nevada today .
It remains to be seen which GOP candidate stands to benefit the most from Bushâ€ ™ s departure , though Ohio governor John Kasich claimed today that he now has â€œsome Bush people that have come our wayâ€ � .
Ben Carson is out of the news , but still in the race .
As the leading GOP candidates made the rounds on the Sunday morning talk shows , the retired surgeon remained missing in action .
Although he finished behind Jeb Bush in South Carolina , Carsonâ€ ™ s campaign says heâ€ ™ s still running and â€œwould beat Hillary Clinton in a head - to - head raceâ€ � .
On Sunday , he will be hosting a â€œWe the People Town Hallâ€ � in Reno , Nevada ahead of the Tuesday GOP caucus .
Here are the other Nevada campaign stops planned for the day :
Ted Cruz has a rally with Nevada attorney general Adam Laxalt in Pahrump , near Las Vegas , at 2 pm .
Marco Rubio has an evening rally at a ballroom in north Las Vegas at 7.30pm .
Rubio first will stop in Little Rock , Arkansas .
The candidates have run their Sunday morning marathon through the talk shows .
Hereâ€ ™ s
whatâ€ ™ s new .
Donald Trump questions everything .
Fresh off his sweeping victory in South Carolina , the billionaire said he didnâ€ ™ t know whether he would keep winning against the â€œvery talented peopleâ€ �
heâ€ ™ s competing with .
He also asked why rush the release of his â€œmassiveâ€ � tax returns , and suggested Marco Rubio could be as ineligible as Ted Cruz for the presidency , because Twitter is interesting .
Asked about his support for the Iraq war , stated in 2002 , he said : â€œthat was a long time ago , and who knows what was in my head?â€ � Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz , who finished a close second and third in South Carolina , bickered about which one of them could scare Trump and Democrats the most .
Cruz said heâ€ ™ s the only conservative left who could beat Trump .
Rubio said heâ€ ™ s the only one who can unite the party .
Neither actually said which state they think they can win over Trump , and instead hemmed and hawed , at sometimes excruciating length .
But he hasnâ€ ™ t managed to win over 2012 nominee Mitt Romney , according to the Florida senator , who said he spoke with Romney and could confidently rebut a report of an imminent endorsement .
Pressed to criticize Trump , Rubio said that the billionaire changes his mind too much to be relied on .
Cruz responded to accusations that heâ€ ™ s a liar by saying he will not insult other candidates , after which he suggested Rubio is a coward for not facing up to Trump , and that the billionaireâ€ ™ s record on key issues resembles Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s .
Republicans are ready for a brokered convention if necessary , said National Committee chair Reince Priebus .
The party panjandrum said he didnâ€ ™ t think it would come down to that , though , and expected even unhappy Republicans will fall in line .
â€œWinning is the antidote to a lot of things.â€ � Hillary Clinton conceded that many Americans donâ€ ™ t whether they can trust her , but said she can convince them that her loyalties lie with them .
After praising her team for its clear , if close , victory in Nevada , she also tested a new campaign line against her rival , Bernie Sanders , implying that heâ€ ™ s running a â€œsingle - issueâ€ � campaign in contrast to her broader message .
Sanders insisted that the close loss still shows his campaignâ€ ™ s momentum , arguing that young people , workers and Hispanic Americans couldâ€ ™ ve lifted him to victory had turnout been higher .
As for Team Clinton line that he only cares about inequality and Wall Street , Sanders said : â€œWe are talking about dozens of issues , so Iâ€ ™ m not quite sure
what secretary Clinton is talking about.â€

Republican John Kasich appeared on television , saying he was excited about big crowds in Vermont , Massachusetts and Virginia , all three of which were won by Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 .
Ben Carson was nowhere to be found .
John Kasich is standing by for CBS .
So thereâ€ ™ s something new .
The only governor left in the race is on in the TV equivalent of â€œunder
the foldâ€ � â€ “ when some CBS stations have left Face the Nation .
Thatâ€ ™ s pretty telling , although as everyone has said , Kasich pretty much abandoned South Carolina to focus on states more friendly to him , such as Michigan .
Should â€œmoderatesâ€ � stick with him , not switch to Rubio ?
â€œIâ€ ™ m starting to get known in the country , â€ � Kasich says .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re getting big crowds everywhere we go â€ “ Vermont , Massachusetts ,
Virginia.â€ �
He also says he exceeded expectations in South Carolina , particularly with late deciders .
â€œEverybody just hang on , things are going to settle down , â€ �
he says .
Where does he have to win to have a shot ?
Vermont , Massachusetts , Virginia , Mississippiâ€ ¦
â€œthe midwest whether itâ€ ™ s Illinois or Michigan.â€ �
Kasich plans to hang on in there and get momentum , he says , because â€ “ and he cites Bernie Sanders â€ “ itâ€ ™ s a proportional race .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re the engine that can , â€ � he says , before adding :
â€œWe now have some Bush people that have come our way both from a political view and a fundraising view.â€ � Heâ€ ™ ll also beat Hillary Clinton , he says , and he still thinks a proposed ban on Muslim immigration is not a good thing , despite exit polls in early voting states which suggest many Republican voters think it is .
And thatâ€ ™ s that .
Speaking of Texas , hereâ€ ™ s one of the stateâ€ ™ s senators , Ted Cruz , who finished a close third in South Carolina yesterday .
How does it feel to be called a liar by everybody , Chuck Todd asks Cruz .
â€œI will not respond in kind , I do not intend to insult the other candidates , â€ � Cruz says .
Itâ€ ™ ll only be substance and the issues .
Then he criticizes Donald Trump and Marco Rubio as candidates who canâ€ ™ t handle criticism .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a reason that they scream liar , when you point out their own voting records , their own words , their voting records are inconsistent , â€ � he says .
He notes that Trump threatened a defamation suit over an ad that included clips of Trump himself talking .
Todd calls Cruz out on this , noting that the senator once held a 30-minute press conference to criticize Rubio and Trump .
Cruz says nope , heâ€ ™ s as much â€œa happy warriorâ€ � as ever .
The senator says heâ€ ™ s mostly just blissful about what an incredible evening he had in South Carolina , where he placed third .
The NBC host is clearly tired of candidates describing their defeats as victories , and asks how Cruz can possibly see this as good news .
â€œOur path to victory from the beginning was always do well in the first four states and then have a strong , strong night on Super Tuesday on March 1.â€
�
Todd is muttering through all of this .
â€œYup .
All right .
OK .
Yup .
Yeah.â€
�
Heâ€ ™ s just audible over Cruzâ€
™ s spiel .
The host finally cuts in : â€œAre you going to beat Donald Trump in Texas on March 1?â€
�
Cruz says he hops so .
Todd escapes to commercial .
Chuck Todd shows Sanders a clip of Clinton railing against the power of Wall Street and the yawning inequality of modern America .
Familiar , ainâ€ ™ t it , Todd says .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re looking into the copyright issues here , â€ � Sanders cracks .
â€œThose are our words!â€ �
He says that Clinton recognizes â€œThe American people are extremely angry about the power of Wall
Street.â€ �
The NBC host then asks about Sandersâ€ ™ strategy as the Super Tuesday primary elections ( 14 states on one day ) approaches .
â€œWell , weâ€ ™ re studying that issue very closely , obviously , as to where we allocate our resources and my time , â€ � Sanders says .
â€œI think we have a good shot in Colorado , a good shot in Minnesota , a good shot in Massachusetts , looking pretty good in Oklahoma .
I think we got a shot to win there .
I think we will surprise people in some other states as well.â€ �
What about the math ?
Donâ€ ™ t you need to win large states such as Texas ?
Sanders :
â€œAt the end of the day
what yourâ€ ™ e saying is true , you need delegates .
As you know these are state by state proportional [ delegates handed out ] .
â€œWe think we have a pretty good shot in parts of Texas , â€ � he finishes .
â€œWe are in this race to the convention , I think weâ€ ™ ve got some states coming down the pipe that weâ€ ™ re going to do very , very well
on.â€
�
Bernie Sanders hits the NBC carousel of talk show candidates .
How does he feel about the loss in Nevada ?
Sanders weaves a little stump speech into the answer .
â€œOur message of a rigged economyâ€ � and a corrupt campaign finance system , he says , â€œthose are the issues that are resonating.â€ �
â€œI wish we had had a larger voter turnout
, â€ � the senator concedes .
But he adds â€œwe did phenomenally well with younger votersâ€ � and well with working class voters .
â€œShe knew Nevada a lot better than we did .
Iâ€ ™ m proud of the campaign that we ran
, â€ � he says .
â€œAt the end of the day
I think she gets 19 delegates , we get 15 delegates , we move on to the next states.â€ �
Bernie Sanders follows the Republican cavalcade , on to CBS .
Not sure where he is , statewise , but he has a nice lamp behind him .
Rebuttal of the Clinton single - issue attack line first
: â€œThis is not a message campaign , â€ � he says , â€œweâ€ ™ re here to win.â€ � John Dickerson asks about his chances with African American voters in South Carolina , voters who favour Clinton heavily over him .
Sanders says he is making inroads
but there is a lot of work to do .
â€œI think as people become familiar with my ideas , weâ€ ™ re going to do better and better.â€ �
â€ ¦ and itâ€ ™ s Ted Cruz now on CBS , from South Carolina .
Rubio is in Tennessee , Trump in Florida .
All is well despite not winning in New Hampshire and South Carolina , after winning in Iowa .
This we knew Cruz would say .
â€œWe won young people in South Carolina , â€ �
Cruz says , trumpeting similar successes in Iowa and New Hampshire and among â€œReagan Democratsâ€ � â€ “ working class voters .
He trumpets past evidence that you have to win an early state to take the nomination , which he has done , and he says : â€œYou canâ€ ™ t beat Donald with a candidate that has supported amnesty.â€ � Thatâ€ ™ s Rubio , thatâ€ ™ s immigration .
Cruz is the man to beat Trump , he says .
The questioning - Cruzâ€ ™ s - Christianity issue comes up again .
â€œBoth Donald and Marco got very personal and very nasty â€ ¦ they scream â€˜liar , liar , liarâ€ ™ , they attack your character .
Iâ€ ™ m not going to do that .
I will happily praise Donald Trump and Marco Rubio.â€
�
Butter wouldnâ€ ™ t melt , and etc .
And Rubio and Trump are soft on immigration , he adds .
Marco Rubio is on the show now , with his name emblazoned at an empty hall somewhere in South Carolina .
Todd asks him about Trumpâ€ ™ s many statements that would have been thought apostasy among Republicans a few years agoâ€ “ eg â€œneutralityâ€ � in the Israeli - Palestinian negotiations , his criticism of the Iraq war .
Rubio says that Trump will say whatever springs to mind , and that thereâ€ ™ s no way of knowing what he actually believes or would do .
He says that with his campaign , in contrast , â€œyou know what youâ€ ™ re getting ,
so thereâ€ ™ s some level of accountability here.â€ � â€œThatâ€ ™ s
a big difference in this campaign between Mr Trumpâ€ ™ s and mine.â€ � Todd then asks him if he actually intends to win a state , rather than finish second and third and spin those defeats as wins .
â€œIâ€
™ m not going to reveal to you today our campaign playbook ,
â€ � Rubio says ,
â€œbut obviously Iâ€ ™ m going to be in a lot of different places
today.â€ �
He doesnâ€ ™ t
say which states he plans to invest in .
â€œWe have a national campaign , and I feel great about it especially after last night.â€ �
Asked about the Iraq war , Trump lambasts George W Bushâ€
™ s decision to invade , saying â€œwe get nothingâ€ � from the trillions spent , thousands of lives lost and â€œcarnageâ€ � wrought upon the country .
So what about his old comments back in 2002 , when he told a radio host that he supported the war : â€œYeah , I guess so .
You know , I wish it was â€ “
I wish the first time it was done correctly.â€ �
Trump in February 2016 :
â€œWell , what I mean by that is it almost shouldnâ€ ™ t have been done , and , you know , I really donâ€
™ t even know what I mean , because that was a long time ago , and who knows what was in my head?â€ � â€œI think that it wasnâ€ ™ t done correctly .
In retrospect it shouldnâ€ ™ t have been done at all , â€ � he added .
â€œIt was sort of , you know , it was just done , it was just â€ “
we dropped bombs.â€
�
Another foreign affairs question : explain what you mean by â€œneutralâ€ � in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , Trump is asked .
â€œI was head of the Israeli Day Parade a couple of years ago , â€ � Trump says .
To further show off his pro - Israel bona fides , he says he once did a commercial for Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu .
But the Palestinian conflict , â€œthat probably is the hardest deal yourâ€ ™ e going to make , â€ �
Trump says .
â€œPeople are born with hatred , theyâ€ ™ re taught hatred , and I got ta say itâ€ ™ s motsly on the one side than the other.â€ � â€œI will try the hardest I can , â€ � he says ,
â€œto try and solve that puzzle .
Youâ€ ™ re not going to solve it if yourâ€ ™ e on one side or the other .
If Iâ€ ™ m going to solve that problem , youâ€ ™ ve got to go in with a clean slate.â€ � â€ ¦ and Rubio , again .
Similar tactics from me here
â€ “
will he say anything new ?
He still says itâ€ ™ s a smaller race , down to three people â€œpractically speakingâ€ �
â€ “ change from Fox , where he said it was â€œliterallyâ€ � down to three .
He also praises Kasich and Carson .
Subtle recalibration there .
He also wants actual policy from Trump , from here on : â€œOn everything , on healthcare .
We all agree weâ€ ™ re going to repeal Obamacare but how would you replace it?â€ �
Rubio wants policy from Trump on â€œalmost every issue facing this country that is in the purview of the federal governmentâ€ � , because if he doesnâ€ ™ t have it â€œthe Democrats are going to eat our lunchâ€ � .
Finally , is he in danger of being everyoneâ€ ™ s second choice ?
Nope .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re in real good shape , weâ€ ™ ve got to keep working hard.â€ �
And now weâ€ ™ re back to Donald Trump on NBCâ€ ™ s Meet the Press .
Host Chuck Todd asks whether Trump believes what heâ€ ™ s telling voters , for instance regarding healthcare .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re gon na repeal and replace Obamacare , itâ€ ™ s a complete disaster , itâ€ ™ ll be gone ,
â€ �
Trump says .
â€œYou can call it whatever you want , people are not going to die in the middle of the street , people are not going to die on the sidewalks , if Iâ€ ™ m president.â€ �
He says heâ€ ™ s not going to call it â€œa mandateâ€ � , but that he prefers â€œcommon senseâ€
� .
Iâ€ ™ m really talking about people that canâ€ ™ t afford it .
Weâ€ ™ re not going to let people die in squalor because we are Republicans.â€ �
Trump says that Republicans got into this mess alongside Democrats .
â€œThatâ€
™ s part of the problem with Republicans is somehow they got fed into this horrible position .
Theyâ€ ™ re gon na have great plans , â€ � he says , vaguely as usual .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re gon na be private , they are going to be lots of different options.â€ �
He adds his own take on Planned Parenthood â€ “ which is , somehow , a hair more nuanced than his rivalsâ€ ™ .
Cruz and Rubio have said they will defund the program without conditions .
â€œPlanned Parenthood does a really good job in a lot of different areas , but not in abortion , â€ �
Trump says , â€œbut I would defund as long as theyâ€ ™ re doing abortions.â€
�
â€
¦ and
now The Donald is on The CBS .
Itâ€ ™ s all a bit like that bit in Sherlock when Moriarty turned up on every screen in Christendom and says : â€œDid you miss me?â€
�
Letâ€ ™ s see if Trump says anything new .
Itâ€ ™ s not terribly likely , I know .
He wonâ€ ™ t
say the nomination is his .
Check .
â€œI was always against the war in Iraq.â€ � Check .
â€œThey
didnâ€ ™ t knock down the World Trade Center .
It was other people.â€ � Uhâ€ ¦ check .
Familiar ground if a bit odd .
â€œSomeday they should open the report and take a look.â€ �
Umâ€
¦
The pope spat and whether Trump gets to question
peopleâ€ ™ s faith .
â€œI never questioned Tedâ€ ™ sâ€ ¦ anything having to do with his religion.â€ �
Also : â€œThe pope was very nice by the way , and I appreciated it.â€
�
And now itâ€ ™ s
Reince Priebus , the cthulhulically named chairman of the Republican National Committee .
He says that Trumpâ€ ™ s victories are a sign that voters are â€œsick and tired of politics in general , sick and tired of Washington DC .
I think itâ€ ™ s just a general feeling out there thatâ€ ™ s real , I wouldnâ€ ™ t deny it.â€
�
So is he worried about schisms in the party should Trump win the nomination ?
â€œWinning is the antidote to a lot of things , â€ � Priebus says .
â€œSo the name of the game is winning in November .
If we win in November a lot of those armchair quarterbacks will fall in line.â€ �
Are you ready for a brokered convention , if no candidate can win enough delegates to secure the nomination â€ “ or if the party truly revolts against the votersâ€ ™ choice ?
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to support whomever
that isâ€ � that wins the nomination , Priebus says , adding that heâ€ ™ s reading for â€œanythingâ€ � , brokered convention or not .
â€œWe will be prepared if that happens but
I donâ€ ™ t think thatâ€ ™ s going to be the case.â€ �
And now , Rubio .
Does he have to win a state to win the nomination ?
â€œWe do
and we have to win more than one
, â€ � he says .
â€œItâ€ ™ s been difficult because up to now weâ€ ™ ve had so many people in the race.â€ �
Rubio thinks the non - Trump 70 % , previously split between Bush - Kasich - Cruz - Rubio - Carson - Fiorina - and - presumably - the - one - guy - in - Nashua - who - liked - Jim - Gilmore will start to coalesce behind him .
The race is down to â€œliterally three peopleâ€ � , so I guess he doesnâ€ ™ t think John Kasich and Ben Carson count anymore .
Is he calling for them to drop out ?
â€œIâ€ ™ m no one to tell anyone to drop out
, â€ � says Rubio , refusing to say if their exits would be better for the party .
His first line against Cruz is that the Texas senator is weak on national security .
He also says â€œheâ€ ™ s literally every day making up thingsâ€ � .
Then back to national security weakness , which Rubio says cost Cruz in South Carolina .
About that Photoshopped pro - Cruz ad showing â€œRubioâ€ � shaking hands with â€œBarack Obamaâ€ � .
Does Cruz have the integrity to be president ?
Rubio says â€ ¦ no .
Basically .
Those robocalls come up again .
Some of them in Spanish to English - speaking households in South Carolina .
â€œHe did robocalls on the Confederate flag in South Carolina , â€ � says Rubio .
Thereâ€ ™ s a robocalls / robo - Rubio joke here but that New Hampshire debate was a long time ago so
letâ€
™ s all move on .
Rubio also has to defend his former mortgage arrangements and his Senate attendance record , both familiar issues raised against him in this campaign cycle .
So he does .
Last :
Governor Haley as a Rubio VP pick ?
Rubio says he has become friends with Nikki Haley â€œover the last three daysâ€ � , since her endorsement of him for president .
He also says that Haleyâ€ ™ s support and that of Tim Scott , South Carolinaâ€ ™ s African American senator shows the GOP is a diverse GOP .
But is she a running mate ?
â€œShe will certainly be at the top of any list.â€ �
So sheâ€ ™ s on his shortlist ?
â€œSheâ€ ™ s someone that people are going to be paying attention to.â€
�
So she is , then .
Ted Cruz is now on the show .
Heâ€ ™ s competing with Marco Rubio for being the person who Donald Trump attacked most .
This is a strategy that did not go well for Jeb Bush .
But Cruz says Rubioâ€ ™ s being a coward about Trump .
â€œFor whatever reason heâ€ ™ s afraid to take on Donald Trump , â€ � he says .
â€œIf you want to beat Donald Trump youâ€ ™ ve got to go with the only campaign that has shown it can [ beat ] him .
The Texas senator then repeats what he said on CNN earlier this morning : that Donald Trump has a record of supporting Democrats and non - Republican causes , such as abortion rights and the Wall Street bailouts ( he omits that those were initiated by a Republican president ) .
Stephanopoulos takes it to commercial .
So how come you canâ€ ™ t seem to get any unity , if youâ€ ™ re the candidate of unity , Rubio is asked .
â€œWe had seven to eight peopleâ€ � running , Rubio says , although there were six candidates in yesterdayâ€ ™ s primary .
â€œYou can only take on so many people at one time .
And this is not about taking on Donald Trump , I know people are obsessed about that.â€ �
Rubio says that Trump is â€œthe frontrunner when you have seven to eight people running and heâ€
™ s dividing the vote.â€
�
The senator does not mention that had he won all of the votes that went to former governor Jeb Bush , who finished fourth , he would not have beaten Trump for first .
Stephanopoulos asks would Rubio support a nominated Trump .
â€œIâ€
™ m going to support the Republican nominee , â€ � Rubio says ,
â€œbut
I donâ€
™ t believe heâ€ ™ s exhibited and understanding of foreign policy .
And just to say Iâ€ ™ m going to surround my self with really smart people , thatâ€ ™ s not enough â€
¦
You have to make judgments .
â€
¦
â€œVladimir Putinâ€ ™ s not going to have a six - month honeymoon period , the worldâ€ ™ s not going to wait until you can catch up.â€ �
He finishes with his usual stump speech argument that heâ€ ™ ll bring the party together , though he wonâ€ ™ t create â€œunanimityâ€ �
he could still be â€œsomeone who will seek to unite Americans and not pit us against each otherâ€ � .
Marco Rubio is up next on the ABC program , and he says Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s tactics of saying ridiculous things to get free airtime have played out .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not going to work anymore , â€ � the senator says .
â€œIâ€ ™ m going to spend zero time with his interpretation of the constitution with regard to eligibility.â€
�
â€œThe consequences are extraordinary if we get this election wrong , â€ � he adds , before again saying that youvâ€ ™ e got to get out there and see his website at his name dot com .
Stephanopoulos asks whether itâ€ ™ s true that 2012 nominee Mitt Romney intends to endorse Rubio .
The senator says heâ€ ™ s spoken to Romney and the report is nonsense , though heâ€ ™ d like the endorsement if it were to ever arrive .
â€œIf he were we wouldnâ€ ™ t be announcing on the Huffington Post.â€ �
And hereâ€ ™ s Donald , live â€ “ is he ?
Heâ€ ™ s on ABC too .
This is confusing â€ “ from Palm Beach .
Can he be stopped for the nomination ?
â€œI guess you can always be stopped , I have very good competitors ,
â€ � he says , mentioning among the governors and senators against him Dr Ben Carson .
Yes , him .
Ted Cruz is â€œvery sharpâ€ � , says Trump , before returning to his complaints about the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s campaign tactics and robocalls .
Marco Rubio ?
â€œWell heâ€
™ s a talented guy , a good guy , I like him ,
I start off liking everybody and all of a sudden
they become mortal enemies.â€
�
Well , quite .
And then Trump says he probably needs to tone down his tactics and be â€œmore presidentialâ€ � , which he will be â€œat
the appropriate timeâ€ � , although the one president he wonâ€ ™ t be a better president than is , apparently , Abraham Lincoln .
So now you know .
Now Chris Wallace asks him about his rowing back on whether George W Bush lied to get the US into Iraq , and whether he supports the individual mandate in Obamacare or not .
â€œFirst of all I donâ€
™ t want mandates for anything , â€ � he says , and says the confusion arose over the fact he and CNNâ€ ™ s Anderson Cooper were talking over each other at the time he made the remark in question .
He then skates over Wallaceâ€ ™ s insistence on the remark in question to talk about the â€œheartâ€ � he has , because he isnâ€ ™ t going to have people dying on the street when heâ€ ™ s president and when he says that at rallies people stand to applaud .
â€œThe war in Iraq was a disaster , â€ � he says â€ “ and adds that even though he may have praised the military operation at the time that doesnâ€ ™ t mean anything .
He avoids the follow up about whether George W Bush lied , too .
Of course he does .
â€œI have nothing against Bush , â€ � he says .
He means W. Not Jeb .
Now weâ€ ™ re on to tax returns
â€ “ an issue which haunted Mitt Romney , another billionaire , four years ago .
Will they be released ?
â€œWeâ€ ™ re having them made , itâ€ ™ s extremely complicated , it will take a while â€ ¦ weâ€ ™ re having them done and they will be released at the appropriate time.â€ �
Voters deserve a look at his finances , Trump says , before trumpeting his previous financial disclosures .
Which wasnâ€ ™ t what he was asked about .
He then denies he is engaged in a hostile takeover of the Republican party , but also gives the party establishment a good drubbing .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re from a different world , â€ � he says .
â€œEvery time I go to a debate I walk in and itâ€ ™ s like death , â€ � he says .
â€œEvery time the other candidates speak they get standing ovations.â€ �
The GOP is â€œstackingâ€ �
the audiences , he says , and itâ€ ™ s very unfair .
Digested read :
Trump is brilliant , everyone else is unfair to Trump , who is brilliant .
And the tax returns will be alongâ€ ¦ at some point .
Stephanopoulos :
Youâ€ ™ ve been promising to release your tax returns for months , will you put them out before 1 March ?
Trump : â€œNo , I wonâ€ ™ t , weâ€ ™ re working on them , theyâ€ ™ re massive.â€ �
As for the Wall Street Journal , which called for those tax returns , Trump says : â€œThey have taken me on so much , theyâ€ ™ re ridiculous ,
every day editorials.â€ � â€œThey should fire their pollster , and they should fire their editorial staffâ€
�
Stephanopoulos :
But what about the tax returns ?
Trump : â€œWhy is there such a rush ?
Am I supposed to rush like crazy ?
I released my financial statements and everybody was amazed by how â€ ¦ great the company is â€ ¦
Thatâ€ ™ s the kind of thinking the United States needs now because our country is in financial trouble and military trouble.â€
�
On to ABCâ€ ™ s
This Week with host George Stephanopoulos , who says that Republicans are now facing the previously â€œunimaginableâ€ � prospect of nominee Donald Trump .
That red - faced nominee then appears via live feed to answer questions .
Are you certain youâ€ ™ re going to win , Stephanopoulos asks .
Trump : â€œNo , not at all .
I mean look Iâ€ ™ m dealing with very talented people , very smart people .
â€
¦
I never take it for granted.â€ �
Stephanopoulos :
You retweeted somebody who questioned whether Marco Rubio is eligible for president â€ “
do you really believe he could be ineligible , as youâ€ ™ ve suggested Cruz might be because of his Canadian birth to and American mother ?
( Rubio was born in the US . )
Trump : â€œIâ€ ™ m not really that familiar with Marcoâ€ ™ s
circumstances.â€ � Stephanopoulos :
So why retweet ! ?
Trump : â€œBecause Iâ€ ™ m not sure .
Let people do their own determination.â€ �
He says that Cruz is â€œbeing sued by somebody , it has nothing to do with me.â€
�
With regard to Rubio , he insists , â€œIâ€ ™ ve never looked at it , George , honestly Iâ€ ™ ve never looked at it.â€
�
As for why he retweets , Trump is insouciant : â€œI have 14 million people following me between Twitter and Facebook .
We start dialogue and itâ€ ™ s very interesting.â€ �
Good morning , and welcome to another edition of the never - popular show , Iâ€
™ m Watching Fox News Sunday
So You Donâ€ ™ t
Have Toâ€ ¦ Will Fox News Sunday break with this morningâ€ ™ s rather depressing precedent and mention the Kalamazoo multiple shooting and any issues arising on gun control ?
Iâ€ ™ m guessingâ€ ¦ not .
They seem keener on discussing whether Trump is now â€œTeflon Donâ€ � , given that even a squabble with the pope canâ€ ™ t sink him â€ “ where does he go next ?
Jesus ?
God Himself ?
The Emperor Ming ?
â€ “ and whether Marco Rubio can win the nomination without winning any primaries or caucuses .
Of course they do .
Further Trumperama imminent , anywayâ€
¦ What about Clintonâ€ ™ s new stump speech suggestion that Sanders is a â€œsingle - issueâ€ � candidate ( ie all he talks about is inequality , sheâ€ ™ s implying ) ?
â€œI
havenâ€
™ t the vaguest idea what sheâ€ ™ s talking about , â€ � Sanders says .
Weâ€ ™ re the only major country on earth that doesnâ€ ™ t have a national healthcare program
â€
¦
We need to have free tuition in public colleges and universities
â€
¦
We need to have the wealthiest and biggest corporations to pay their fair share in taxes
â€ ¦ Weâ€ ™ re working very hard to transform our energy system so we can combat climate change .
â€œWe are talking about dozens of issues , â€ � he concludes , â€œso Iâ€ ™ m not quite sure
what secretary Clinton is talking about.â€ �
He throws in a glancing jab at Clinton , saying the US has to address
â€œthis crisis of a corrupt campaign finance system in which billionaires and Super Pacsâ€
� are influencing politicians with donations .
He then points out that Clinton has Super Pacs supporting her with millions of dollars .
Finally , Tapper asks about a photo and article unearthed from the Chicago Tribune archives showing Sanders being arrested by police in 1963 , over his participation in civil rights protests .
â€œI remember it pretty well ,
â€ � Sanders says .
â€œThis had to do with opposition to segregated schools.â€ � â€œI remember being arrested , being driven in a police wagon to the police station .
It was an interesting day.â€ �
Finally , Vermont senator Bernie Sanders appears â€ “ in real time â€ “ on the CNN show .
He starts off with the same argument Saturday - night Cruz used , saying that Nevada shows how far his campaign has come .
Clintonâ€ ™ s huge lead was diminished to six points , he says .
What about the wide margin in black voters in Nevada , who turned out for Clinton ?
Sanders insists heâ€
™ s going to keep winning over those voters as they learn about his campaign .
â€œI think the more the African American community hears our message on a broken criminal justice system , â€ � he says , â€œwhen they hear our message about the need for an economy that represents all of us , not just the 1 % , I think youâ€ ™ ll see us making progress there as well.â€ �
Tapper asks about Hispanic voters , and the Clinton campaignâ€ ™ s contention that early polls are wrong when the suggest Sanders won more of the demographic .
â€œNationally it is clear that we are doing better and better with Latino voters , â€ � he says , â€œfor a campaign that started off as a fringe campaign at 3 % in the polls , we have enormous momentum.â€ � â€œAs the field narrows
weâ€ ™ re seeing more and more people coming to us because weâ€ ™ re looking for a strong , proven , constitutional conservative , â€ � Cruz goes on .
He then seems to suggest that Donald Trump has the similar record on issues â€ “ abortion , healthcare , immigration , Wall Street bailouts â€ “ as Hillary Clinton .
I donâ€
™ t think thatâ€ ™ s a path to victory .
I think the way we win is to follow Reaganâ€ ™ s admonition
â€˜we paint in bold colors , not in pastels.â€ ™ Tapper asks Cruz how heâ€ ™ s going to win if he canâ€ ™ t muster up a victory in the + 70 % evangelical South Carolina .
Cruz uses the same argument that Sanders did about his loss in Nevada , saying of Trumpâ€ ™ s huge lead , â€œmuch of it disappeared in this last week.â€ �
In fact , Cruz says , Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s the guy who shouldâ€ ™ ve won .
â€œMarco had the popular governor support , he had the popular senator Tim Scott supporting ,
â€ � he says .
â€œAll the political establishment of South Carolina came out behind him.â€ �
So Rubioâ€ ™ s second - place loss â€ “ which Saturday - night Cruz refuses to concede is also his third - place loss
â€ “ is â€œparticularly strikingâ€ � .
He thinks it comes down to him and Trump in the next few weeks .
â€œItâ€ ™ s going be particularly clear that itâ€ ™ s a two - man race , and that I beat Donald head - to - head.â€ �
Jake Tapper does a smash - cut to a pre - recorded interview with Ted Cruz , from Saturday night .
â€œI think we had a terrific night tonight
, â€ � Ted Cruz says .
Heâ€ ™ s wearing huge , white earphones of some kind .
Cruz says heâ€ ™ s totally happy with not winning South Carolina , because it â€œputs us in a position of having won a strong victory in Iowa , a strong second - place victory in New Hampshire , and now a strong second- or third - place.â€ � â€œThe only campaign that can beat Donald Trump and has beat Donald Trump is our campaign.â€
�
He says that Trump is disliked by many Republicans , and that polls suggest â€œhead to head Donald loses to Hillary .
And head to head
I beat Hillary.â€
�
No Republican has won New Hampshire and South Carolina and then lost the nominee , Tapper tells Rubio .
Are you fighting a losing battle against Trump ?
â€œWe never had a race where 15 credible candidates began , â€ � Rubio says .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve never had a race like this.â€ �
He says history is no guide to 2016 .
â€œI think last night was truly the beginning of the real Republican race for president .
â€
¦ Hereâ€ ™ s where it really begins at this point now.â€
�
So would he prefer a brokered convention , if it came down to it ?
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t think itâ€ ™ s likely , â€ � he says .
â€œI most certainly donâ€
™ t want party insiders deciding this.â€ �
How do you feel about Jeb Bush dropping out , Tapper asks .
Rubio says his departure , and John Kasichâ€ ™ s very narrow strategy â€œgives us an opportunity now to coalesce , and bring together Republicansâ€ � .
He makes an electability argument , saying it comes down , â€œultimately , [ to ] who can win .
Who do the Democrats fear most ?
Democrats now acknowledge that thatâ€ ™ s me .
Thatâ€ ™ s why they spend so much time attacking
me.â€
�
Rubio says that he thinks the smaller field of rivals â€œaccrues to our benefitâ€ � .
He says twice that Americans should check out Marco Rubio dot com .
Next up is Florida senator Marco Rubio .
Tapper asks : What would an endorsement from 2012 nominee Mitt Romney mean ?
â€œThat report is false .
I have no reason to believe heâ€ ™ s about endorse , â€ � Rubio says .
Weâ€ ™ d love to have his endorsement
, weâ€ ™ d love to have the support of everyone â€ ¦
Weâ€ ™ re not going to defeat Hillary CLinton or Bernie Sanders in November if we donâ€
™ t unite the Republican party .
â€œWeâ€ ™ d love to have his endorsement ,
â€ � but thereâ€
™ s no reason to believe those reports are true , Rubio says .
Tapper asks about the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , which Donald Trump said he would be a â€œneutralâ€ � in .
Clinton says he missed the mark .
First of all Israel is our partner , our ally , we have longstanding and important ties with Israelis going back to the formation of the state of Israel .
I will defend and do everything I can to defend Israel .
I also believe the Palestinians deserve to have a state of their own .
Thatâ€ ™ s what I support and thatâ€ ™
s what I worked on .
â€
¦ Three very intense conversations between the prime minister of Israel and the president of the Palestinian authority .
I happen to think that moving toward a two - state solution , trying to provide more support for the ] Palestinian people ] is in the long - term interests of Israel .
Are you worried about Donald Trump in the general election , secretary Clinton ?
Clinton : â€œI donâ€
™ t know
Jake , Iâ€ ™ m not thinking that far ahead .
They have to finish their nomination process , we have to finish ours.â€

She flips into stump - speech mode : â€œWe can do better together .
We can build those ladders of opportunity again .
We can have rising prosperity , and break down those barriers that are holding people back .
â€œThat great recession was such a terrible blow to so many people , and the repercussions are still working its way through the economy and the political system
â€
¦ I want to find common ground wherever I can.â€ �
Tapper asks about whether Clinton believes that Hispanic voters were more won over by Sanders than her campaign , as polling data suggests .
â€œThatâ€
™ s just not what our analysis shows , â€ � she says .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t believe that the so - called entry polls are that accurate.â€ � â€œThereâ€ ™ s a lot of evidence that we did very , very well with every type of voter ,
â€ �
she goes on , adding that her campaign â€œheld our own up in Reno , so it was a broad base of voter turnout , and we dominated of course in Clark County , which is where Las Vegas is .
â€
¦
We always have to work hard for every single voter , and we do that in every place.â€ �
Clinton acknowledges to Tapper that thereâ€ ™ s a question of trust in a lot of independent votersâ€ ™ minds .
She says she knows voters wonder whether sheâ€ ™ s in the race for them or for herself , and she insists sheâ€ ™ s in it for them .
I know that I have to make my case
â€
¦
I have to really make clear that we want to make progress in our country , we want to make a real difference in their lives , and thatâ€ ™ s
what Iâ€ ™ ve always been about .
Hillary Clinton is now on the CNN program , where Tapper asks her what went right in Nevada .
I think it was a lot of things .
First of all weâ€ ™ ve been on the ground there for months , so weâ€ ™ re building an organziation , developing relationships â€
¦
so as we build that we were able to udnerstand more of what was on peopleâ€ ™ s minds , how best to connet with them , to make my case to them .
We have as I said thousands of people who were engaged from Las Vegas to the smallest rural town .
She thanks the people working on her campaign , who â€œdid not get in any way knocked off courseâ€ � .
Tapper asks whether Bernie Sanders was gracious in his call to concede the primary .
Clinton doesnâ€ ™ t
really say : â€œHe did call me before I made my speech
and I did appreciate that very much.â€
�
She then says that she isnâ€ ™ t a fighting to lead a â€œsingle - issue countryâ€ � , which may be her new line of attack on Sandersâ€ ™ unshakeable insistence that inequality and Wall Street are the central problems of the day .
I want to knock down all the barriers that are holding people back .
â€
¦
Of course a lot of it is economic , and a lot of that needs to be addressed â€ ¦
Mroe good paying jobs with rising incomes again
, you know , once and for all making sure women get equal pay â€ ¦ clean energy , especially in a state like Nevada that should be the solar capital of the west .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to talk about the issues that are on the minds of Americans and thatâ€ ™ s a broad number.â€
�
Tapper :
Whatâ€ ™ s up with all those retweets of white supremacistsâ€ ¦ ?
Trump : â€œI know nothing about these groups that are supporting
me.â€ � But donâ€ ™ t you worry about whether you can get elected against a Democrat ?
I donâ€
™ t worry , Trump says .
As a candidate I will bring over many , many Dems â€ ¦
Weâ€ ™ re going to bring over the Reagan Democrats
â€ ¦ the independents
â€ ¦ tremendous youth
â€
¦
They say that it will be the largest voter turnout in the history of the United States elections .
â€
¦
If itâ€ ™ s Hillary against me , itâ€ ™ s going to be a tremendous turnout .
Iâ€ ™ m going to win , Iâ€ ™ m going to win places like Michigan that Republicans wonâ€ ™ t even think about it .
Trump says heâ€ ™ s going to have a chance at winning New York , which hasnâ€ ™ t been one by a Republican since Calvin Coolidge in 1924 .
â€œIf I win New York
I win.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ ll win states that Republicans donâ€
™ t even think of â€ ¦ Upstate New York Iâ€ ™ m like the most popular person thatâ€ ™ s ever lived ,
essentially.â€ �
The billionaire doesnâ€ ™ t back down when asked about his commitment to healthcare reform â€ “
he just says itâ€ ™ ll be a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and then some other , different healthcare reform
: â€œPeople are not going to die in the middle of the street when Iâ€ ™ m president .
Theyâ€ ™ re just not.â€ �
Finally Tapper asks about Trumpâ€ ™ s wife , Melania , who made rare public comments at Trumpâ€ ™ s victory celebration on Saturday night .
â€œSheâ€ ™ s a very , very brilliant woman .
I know her academic background , â€ �
Trump says .
â€œSheâ€ ™ s also a very private woman â€
¦
She has some interesting causes that are going to be fantastic for the country .
I really just surprised her when I said that .
Did calling Jeb Bush â€œlow - energyâ€ � and mocking him writ large lead to the governorâ€ ™ s collapse ?
Trump : â€œI can tell you I like him , heâ€ ™ s a good person , heâ€ ™ s a good man , but he really hit me with a lot of commercials.â€ � Not as tough as Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s â€œtough , tough toughâ€ � robocalls , he adds .
â€œIâ€ ™
ll tell you , this is a tough business .
I think real estate in Manhattan is a lot easier.â€
�
Was the rejection of Bush a â€œreferendumâ€ � on the familyâ€ ™ s legacy in the White House ?
Trump : â€œI hope not , because it shouldnâ€ ™ t be , it wasnâ€ ™ t meant to be â€ ¦
Jeb fought hard , it just wasnâ€ ™ t his time.â€ �
It was really just not his time .
You know , four years ago , I think he wouldâ€ ™ ve won .
Although with Mitt , you know , it wouldâ€ ™ ve been a good contest .
Weâ€ ™ re on to CNNâ€ ™ s State of the Union with Jake Tapper .
He says the state of the union is â€œfrontrunningâ€ � , whatever that means .
Donald Trump is on first , which was probably a condition of his appearance .
Can he be stopped ?
â€œWell , certainly you can be stopped .
Iâ€ ™ m dealing with very talented people , theyâ€ ™ re senators , do we have any governors left ?
I donâ€
™ t know â€ ¦
Certainly nobodyâ€ ™ s
unstoppable.â€ �
Tapper asks why heâ€ ™ s doing so well .
â€œWell , Iâ€ ™ m an outsider.â€
�
I was a member of the establishment ,
totally â€ ¦
I was a very big donor to the Republicans
, I used to be a donor to everybody because as a businessman that was a good thing to do .
On the day I decided to run , June 16 , I became an outsider .
â€
¦
I donâ€
™ t need donor money , special interest money , and that bothers them .
Trump goes on : â€œIâ€ ™ m going to be fair to everybody but Iâ€ ™ m going to do whatâ€ ™ s right.â€ �
Politicians are bought and controlled , he says , even though the â€œVery talentedâ€ � Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio could still beat him .
That said , â€œI donâ€ ™
t think weâ€ ™ re going to have a convention , a brokered convention.â€ � Donald Trump is on MSNBCâ€ ™ s Morning Joe , a show he calls more than maybe any other .
The billionaire says heâ€ ™ s feeling pretty good .
Host Joe Scarborough asks about Trumpâ€ ™ s spat with Pope Francis earlier this week , in which the pontiff suggested Trump is â€œnot Christianâ€ � if heâ€ ™ s so committed to building a wall to keep immigrants out .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think it helped me or hurt me .
I think it was neutral , â€ �
Trump says .
Trump says at first he was surprised the pope said anything at all , and described his reaction to the popeâ€ ™ s remarks as : â€œI said this is bad , this is not good.â€ �
But he was glad the way it turned out , in the end , with both sides stepping back from their initial statements .
Trump says he was â€œvery honoredâ€ � to be talked about by the pope .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve never seen a pope talk about anybody before ,
â€ � he says .
â€œThey usually talk more important things than Donald Trump.â€ �
The hosts ask about Trumpâ€ ™ s victory in South Carolina last night , and the billionaire brags about winning all seven congressional districts .
â€œWhat I thought was going to hurt me were those robocalls , â€ �
he says , talking about automated phone calls to voters , â€œand they were put out by Ted.â€ �
Finally Trump waxes generous toward the primary voters so far , and mocks the way Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are describing their second- and third - place finishes as â€œhistoricâ€ � .
â€œThe person who came in third was like a superstar , â€ � he says , describing the Rubio campaign ( and the mediaâ€ ™ s ) excitement after Iowa .
The hosts also ask Trump about a tweet in which he appears to suggest Barack Obama is Muslim , which he is not .
Trump says it was a joke .
They donâ€
™ t ask Trump about how last week he said : â€œNo leader , especially a religious leader , has the right to question another manâ€ ™ s religion or faith.â€
� Hello and welcome to our coverage of the celebration , despair and soap opera spite of the 2016 election ,
the day after Donald Trump , the maroon menace of the Republican party , swept South Carolina , and Hillary Clinton , breaker of ceilings , fended off Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ success with Hispanic voters in Nevada .
Itâ€ ™ s still high drama the morning after .
Republicans Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz finished in a virtual tie , with 22.5 % and 22.3 % of the vote respectively in South Carolina , and both of them are spinning those results
â€ “ they both lost , after all â€ “ so hard that one might well fall over on a talk show this morning .
The tribulations of Jeb Bush finally came to an end last night , when the former governor of Florida conceded that Americans donâ€ ™ t like him lingering at their parties , Republican or otherwise .
John Kasich and Ben Carson remain in the race : the Ohio governor gave up in South Carolina long ago to focus on Michigan and other states ; the retired neurosurgeon hasnâ€ ™ t been seen for a while , and may have fallen asleep .
Trump lorded over his victory and his opponents .
â€œItâ€ ™ s
tough , itâ€ ™ s
nasty , itâ€ ™ s mean ,
itâ€ ™ s vicious , â€ � he said , before departing the state for Nevada , where Republicans will caucus on Tuesday .
â€œWhen
you win , itâ€ ™ s
beautiful.â€ �
In Nevada , Clinton finally put space between her and Sandersâ€ ™ rising campaign , which de facto tied her in Iowa and defeated her soundly in New Hampshire .
The former secretary of state won by 52.7 % to 47.2 % , with a huge margin of support from African American voters in urban areas .
â€œSome may have doubted us but we never doubted each other , â€ �
she told supporters in Las Vegas .
â€œThe fight is on â€ “ the future that we want is within our grasp.â€ �
But because Nevadaâ€ ™ s caucus system is not a winner - take - all system , and because Sandersâ€ ™ had more success winning over Hispanic voters than predicted , the senatorâ€ ™ s campaign will undoubtedly spin its loss as just another step toward â€œpolitical revolutionâ€ � .
With reporters on the trail and candidates going groggily back to work , weâ€ ™ ll distill the insults , bickering , half - truths and everything else for you this morning
so you donâ€
™ t have to ."
2016-02-22,"Ted Cruz fired a top aide on Monday after he promoted a false story questioning Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s commitment to the Bible , a move the Texas senator described as â€œa grave errorâ€ � .
Cruz sacked Rick Tyler , his national spokesman , after he circulated a video on Sunday that allegedly showed Rubio walking by a Cruz staffer in a hotel lobby who was holding a Bible .
Although the audio was fuzzy , some assumed Rubio to have remarked : â€œGot a good book there , not many answers in it.â€
�
In fact , Rubio had said â€œall the answers in itâ€ � .
â€œThis morning I asked for Rick Tylerâ€ ™ s resignation , â€ �
Cruz told reporters in Las Vegas over his promotion of a news story that falsely claimed his rival said â€œsomething negative about the Bibleâ€ � .
â€œThis was a grave error of judgment , â€ � he said .
â€œIt turned out the news story he sent around was false .
But Iâ€ ™ ll tell you , even if it was true , we are not a campaign that will question the faith of another candidate.â€
�
The conservative blog that posted the video of Rubio was later updated to correct the error , and Tyler posted an apology on his personal Facebook page late on Sunday that said he regretted the mistake .
â€œI assumed wrongly that the story was correct , â€ � Tyler said .
The controversy comes on the eve of crucial caucuses in Nevada , the fourth state to hold a Republican presidential nomination contest .
It also comes on the same day that GOP insiders , including former Senate majority leader and 1996 presidential nominee Bob Dole , are flocking to back Rubio .
Other endorsements Rubio received in the past 48 hours have been from several senators , including Orrin Hatch of Utah , Governor Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas , a half dozen House members , and other party figures like former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty .
Cruz and Rubio effectively tied in South Carolinaâ€ ™ s primary at the weekend and are both vying for the mantle of challenger - in - chief to Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump .
The billionaire , who many are tipping to win in Nevada , immediately seized on the controversy in a tweet .
â€œWow , Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director .
More dirty tricks!â€ � he said .
While claiming to have zero tolerance for dirty tricks , Cruz , who is predicating his campaign on support from Christian evangelical voters , also insisted the he had been the victim of below - the - belt assaults from rivals who he said â€œattack us personally , impugn my integrityâ€ � .
â€œNone of us have heard me throw the kind of insults at Marco Rubio that he throws at me every single day .
If other candidates choose to go into the gutter , we will not do the same , â€ �
he said .
He added of his rivalâ€ ™ s campaign : â€œThey have a long record theyâ€ ™ ve earned in South Carolina of engaging in this kind of trickery and impugning the integrity of whoever their opponent is to distract the attention .
We are going to stay focused on issues and substance and record.â€ �
In reality , Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign has been repeatedly hit by rivals for allegedly engaging in dirty tricks , and both Trump and Rubio have openly called the Texas senator â€œa liarâ€
� .
In particular , Cruz faced criticism in Iowa for sending out a controversial â€œvoter violationâ€ � mailer .
Later , supporters of the conservative from Texas also spread the word in the minutes before the Iowa caucuses that Ben Carson might be dropping out of the race after the retired neurosurgeon announced he was going home to Florida for several days and not on to New Hampshire .
Cruz later apologized for the mistake .
Tyler , a longtime aide to former House speaker Newt Gingrich , has been a fiery surrogate for Cruz and played a key role in pushing out the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s message throughout the course of the campaign .
Rubio told reporters Monday that while he accepted Tylerâ€ ™ s apology , it simply wasnâ€ ™ t enough .
â€œThis is a pattern now .
I think we are at a point where we start asking about accountability , â€ � Rubio said before boarding a flight to Elko , a small town in the north of the state .
â€œThis campaign now has repeatedly done things that they have to apologize for and no one is ever held accountable , â€ � he added .
In addition to the video , Rubio cited the rumors spread by Cruz staffers on the night of the Iowa caucuses that Ben Carson was dropping out of the race .
The Florida senator similarly criticized Cruzâ€ ™ s tactics leading up to the South Carolina primary , accusing his opponent of being behind misleading push polls and robo - calls .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s a very disturbing pattern of deceptive campaigns and flat - out just lying to voters , â€ � Rubio said .
Rubio spokesman Alex Conant reacted to the news by saying Tyler is â€œa really good spokesman who had the unenviable task of working for a candidate willing to do or say anything to get electedâ€ � .
â€œThere is a culture in the Cruz campaign , from top to bottom , that no lie is too big and no trick too dirty , â€ � Conant said .
â€œRick did the right thing by apologizing to Marco .
Itâ€ ™ s high time for Ted Cruz to do the right thing and stop the lies.â€
�
The Tyler firing suggests Cruz may believe his campaign is vulnerable to the emerging narrative that he is a candidate willing to play dirty â€ “ a troublesome accusation for a candidate seeking to appeal to the religious right ."
2016-02-22,"Ted Cruz has finished speaking in Reno , so hereâ€ ™ s where we stand on the eve of the Nevada caucuses : Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio spent the day trading jabs , following the firing by Cruz of a spokesman who tweeted a fake video purporting to show Rubio saying there â€œwerenâ€ ™ t answersâ€ � in the bible Donald Trump gave plenty of red meat to an audience of 8,000 in Las Vegas , including saying he wanted to punch a protester â€œin the faceâ€ � Ted Cruz tacked sharply to the right on immigration , telling Fox Newsâ€ ™ Bill Oâ€ ™ Reilly that he would deport all 12 million illegal immigrants Rubio picked up endorsements from a wide swath of the Republican establishment following Bushâ€ ™ s dropping out of the race , including former vice presidential candidate Bob Dole Glenn Beck described himself as a â€œnutjobâ€ � Cruz compares Obama to Jimmy Carter .
â€œSame failed economic policies .
Same feckless and naive foreign policies.â€ � â€œNow why does that analogy give me so much hope and optimism , â€ � he asks .
Heâ€ ™ s comparing himself to Reagan .
â€œItâ€
™ s easy , by the way , to say you want to make America great again
, â€ � Cruz says .
â€œYou can even print it on a baseball cap .
But the question to ask is : do you understand the principles that made America great in the first place?â€
�
Heâ€ ™ s telling his regulator / pesticide joke again .
The joke is that the farmer wants to use pesticide on federal employees .
To kill them .
â€œWe will not weaken ; we will not degrade ; we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS.â€ � Ted Cruz promising â€œcommon - sense healthcare reformâ€ � that â€œstops government getting between us.â€ �
He promises to stop Common Core .
â€œWe will finally , finally , finally secure the borders and end sanctuary cities.â€
�
â€œNow Iâ€ ™ ve been told you folks in Nevada like your guns , â€ � says Cruz .
â€œLet me say as a Texan :
I understand.â€
�
The crowd whoops and claps .
â€œWe are one liberal justice away from the Supreme Court wiping away the second amendment and removing our right to bear arms , â€ � Cruz says .
Cruz calls late supreme court justice Antonin Scalia a â€œlion of a manâ€ � . â€œLast week , Donald Trump says he intends to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians , â€ � says Cruz .
â€œI have no intention of staying neutral.â€ � â€œIf you look at the roots of the word politics , there are two parts : poli , meaning many , and tics , meaning parasites ,
â€ �
Cruz says .
â€œAnd that is a fairly accurate description of Washington DC .
He says there is â€œa spirit of awakening that is sweeping this country.â€ �
Asks everyone to look forward to January 2017 .
â€œIf I am elected president , let me tell you what I intend to do on my first day in office.â€ �
The audience shouts â€œwhen!â€ � â€œIf and when , â€ � Cruz corrects himself .
He promises to reverse every single of Obamaâ€ ™ s executive actions .
â€œThe second thing I intend to do is to instruct the department of justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood , and persecute those responsible .
Itâ€ ™ s possible he meant prosecute rather than persecute , but then itâ€ ™ s possible he meant what he said .
â€œHow do you define a progressive : thereâ€ ™ s an easy test , â€ � says Cruz .
â€œThey donâ€
™ t understand the scariest words in the English language : â€˜Iâ€ ™ m from the government and Iâ€ ™ m here to helpâ€ ™ .â€ � â€œHow about Glenn Beck , â€ �
Cruz says .
â€œIsnâ€ ™ t Glenn Beck extraordinary.â€ � â€œThereâ€ ™ s nothing elected officials like less than being held accountable for their words and actions , â€ � Cruz says .
â€œBut thatâ€ ™ s the best thing about the people : holding elected officials accountable.â€ � Boos for the first mention by Cruz of Marco Rubio .
â€œGod bless the great state of Nevada , â€ � he says .
â€œWhat an incredible pleasure this is .
Thank you for coming out tonight ;
what a privilege.â€ �
Trump , from earlier , on wanting to punch protesters in the face : Beck still talking .
Garner the trainee guide dog puppy has gone to sleep .
But he seems to be getting around to the subject of Ted Cruz , so there might be light at the end of the tunnel .
Glenn Beck still talking .
He just did a lengthy bit where he explained the internet to an invisible George Washington .
Trumpâ€ ™ s finished his speech in Las Vegas .
It sounds like it was pretty wild .
Now Beckâ€ ™ s doing an impression of George Washingtonâ€ ™ s mother .
This is , if nothing else , at least entertaining .
â€œPlease heed this warning : there are many people running - Donald Trump is dangerous , â€ � says Glenn Beck in Reno , illustrating the adage that even a stopped clock is right twice a day .
Trump , who earlier today told reporters that he and the Pope were OK now , reviving his spat with Rome .
Glenn Beck is currently on stage at the Ted Cruz rally , claiming to have predicted 9/11 but â€œnobody listened.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ m a nutjob , â€ � he shouts .
â€œI wear it as a badge of honor!â€ �

# 2016
Meanwhile , back in Vegas , Trump is really hitting his stride .
By most measures , Marco Rubio should be running away with the race for the Republican nomination in Nevada , writes the Guardianâ€ ™ s Richard Wolffe .
Of all the Republicans left in the contest , the senator from Florida has a unique connection to Nevadaâ€ ™ s culture and voters .
He lived in Las Vegas for three years as a child , until the age of 11 , during which time he also embraced the Mormon faith that is popular in a state that borders Utah .
Fully one quarter of GOP caucus - goers in the last presidential election were Mormon .
( It was only later that the young Rubio convinced his family to leave the Church of Latter - day Saints to convert to Catholicism . )
In a state where Latinos make up 27 % of the population , Rubio â€ “ as the only bilingual candidate in the field â€ “ should be making deep inroads into Nevada .
So how come Rubio is faring so poorly in a state he once called home , Wolffe asks .
Much of the answer lies in Rubioâ€ ™ s pitch to voters .
At the heart of his campaign is a perfectly delivered stump speech that sells one idea : the American dream .
Beyond his personal story of struggling with student debt , and his parentsâ€ ™ story as working - class immigrants , Rubioâ€ ™ s platform amounts to no more than motherhood and apple pie .
Yes , he delivers the now standard Republican promise to repeal Obamacare , increase military spending , lower taxes and beat Hillary Clinton .
But his ideas are so vacuous he makes Trumpâ€ ™ s stump speech sound like a seminar at the Brookings Institution .

Speaker of the house Paul Ryan is on Fox News right now , filled with optimism about the November elections :
Hereâ€ ™ s a livestream of Trump in Las Vegas - there are 16,000 people watching this stream alone .
Donald Trump , in Vegas , striking out at Ted Cruz , who is set to come on stage in Reno soon :
Trump still going strong : Crucial update from your faithful reporter at the back of the crowd at the Ted Cruz rally in Reno , where the support speakers have begun :
A mark of a Donald Trump rally is how often he has protesters ejected .
Itâ€ ™ s happening again in Vegas right now
: Another regular occurrence is attacks on the media - again , Trump in Vegas is staying true to usual form .
Another update from Ben Carsonland : On Bill Oâ€ ™ Reilly today , Ted Cruz noticeably hardened his stance on illegal immigration .
According to the Dallas Morning News : Ted Cruz said tonight that he would use federal immigration officers to round up and deport all 12 million people in the country illegally â€ ” a markedly tougher stance that he has struck in the past .
â€œYes , we should deport them , â€ �
Cruz told Fox host Bill Oâ€ ™ Reilly .
â€œThatâ€
™ s what ICE exists for .
We have law enforcement that looks for people who are violating the laws , that apprehends them and deports them.â€ � Cruz also appeared on Hugh Hewitt today , and addressed the Rick Tyler incident in more detail :
It was unfortunate that that had to occur .
Rick is a good man , and he has worked hard on this campaign , but Rick forwarded on social media a story that was written in the press that falsely attributed some negative sentiments by Marco Rubio about the Bible , and it turned out the story was false , and even more fundamentally , even if the story was true , we shouldnâ€ ™ t be forwarding it on , that from the very beginning of this campaign , I told every member of this campaign , we are going to run this campaign with the highest level of integrity and
doesnâ€ ™ t matter if others engage in attacks
, if others engage in insults , we are not going to go personal , we are going to stay focused on issues and substance , and we are not going to impugn the faith of any candidate and that unfortunately is what this tweet is impugning Marcoâ€ ™ s faith .
That was wrong , and itâ€ ™ s not something that the campaign is going to tolerate .
It wasnâ€ ™ t done maliciously , but it was a serious error of judgment and thatâ€ ™ s why I asked for his resignation today because that is not conduct that will be tolerated on our campaign .

Another view of the Trump crowd : Trump is speaking .
Jon Huntsman update : his daughter Abby , who is an anchor and reporter on Fox News , has taken to Twitter to say that people are taking her fatherâ€ ™ s comments to CNN somewhat too far :
Meanwhile , the crowd for Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s rally in Reno is increasing - though nowhere near Trumpâ€ ™ s size in Vegas .
In front of an enormous crowd .
Big though the crowd may be at the Cruz rally in Reno , itâ€ ™ s likely to be nothing compared to the arena crowd in Las Vegas for Donald Trump .
Warm - up speakers for Trump have begun .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s Dave Schilling is on the scene at the Trump rally .
On the Hugh Hewitt show earlier today , Donald Trump sounded a rare note of caution about tomorrowâ€ ™ s caucuses .
Iâ€ ™ m in Nevada now , and I think you know , based on the polls , but of course , you never know what happens here .
A lot of strange things happen here , and the caucus system is dangerous , to use a very nice word .
Itâ€ ™ s sort of a dangerous system .
But weâ€ ™ ll see what happens .
We should do pretty well tomorrow .
Trump also took the opportunity to pile in on Ted Cruz , saying his campaign â€œhad a lot of problems with himâ€ � and describing the Texas senator as â€œa person that doesnâ€ ™ t like telling the truth.â€ �
Then you see the other things .
Heâ€
™ s done things with me that are incredible .
You know , he did two robo - calls on election day in South Carolina , on election day , and they were terrible .
One was on the confederate flag , and the other one was on , I believe , gay marriage .
And they were very , very rough , and very , very unethical to do .
He plays hardball , but , and I like hardball , and Iâ€ ™ ve met a lot tougher people than him , believe me , many , many , many times tougher .
But he has a real hard time with the truth .

Doors have just opened for Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s rally in Reno .
The person on the door at first tried to turn away your faithful Guardian reporter - â€œyouâ€ ™ re on the do - not - let - in listâ€
� was what he said - but the banishment appeared to be overturned by a supervisor .
The queue outside is large - a big crowd is expected .
Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs has brought this lovely piece by Ashley Parker in the New York Times to our attention .
Headlined â€œVoters might not miss Jeb Bush , but campaign reporters will ,
â€ � the piece says : By the time I was assigned to cover Jeb Bush , he was already becoming the exclamation mark that couldnâ€ ™ t .
Even his gait â€ ” long - limbed and newly gangly courtesy of the Paleo diet â€ ” and the way he seemed to curl slightly into his 6-foot-4 frame told the story : A campaign that was supposed to be â€œjoyfulâ€ � had become a slog .
He had taken to handing out small toy turtles to children he met along the way , in what often felt like a parable intended just for him
â€
” maybe slow and steady
could , still , win the race .
Ultimately , the end came painfully , as he finished fourth in the South Carolina primary on Saturday , yet another disappointment in a year full of them .
The nation , simply , did not want what he was selling .
But his presence will be missed in the 2016 race among those of us who covered him .
Even as he stumbled as a candidate , he was , in many ways , a reporterâ€ ™ s dream .
He held news conferences so frequently â€ ” nearly daily â€ ” that their absence felt newsworthy .
And he seemed constitutionally incapable of not answering questions , even those he should not have .
As aides tried to hustle him away , he would often pause and turn back , or roll down his car window , to give a final response , throwing political caution to the wind .
He gave out his email address easily and freely and , early on , even responded to queries sent there .
He could be curt with voters , and rarely coddled them .
People who saw him speak in person almost always went away impressed , even if they were not convinced that they should vote for him .
He was your goofy dad , your awkward uncle .
He bungled a policy rollout in Nevada when he called â€œSupergirlâ€ � â€œhotâ€ �
( câ€ ™ mon , Dad ! ) , he was delightfully befuddled when his Apple Watch began ringing during a meeting with an Iowa newspaper , and he wiggled into a hoodie in a shaky YouTube video .

Former ambassador and presidential candidate Jon Huntsman has told CNNâ€ ™ s David Axelrod that he â€œcould get behindâ€ � Donald Trump as presidential candidate .
â€œIf heâ€

and I tend to gravitate towards whomever
the nominee is , â€ � the former ambassador to China told Axelrod .
Heâ€ ™ s strong on things like campaign finance reform
and I think
itâ€ ™ s going to take an extraordinarily unique leader to stand up and say that the way that weâ€ ™ re doing this on the campaign finance side is broken and we need to fix it .
Iâ€ ™
d love to see someone stand up whoâ€ ™ s a total outsider and see if that can be done because I think it would actually be a pretty healthy thing .

where he says that things â€œcould turn around pretty quickly.â€ � â€œBill Clinton didnâ€ ™ t win anything until his sixth contest , â€ �
he adds .
Interesting
: Roll Call is reporting that rep .
Joe Heck , the top Republican candidate for the senate from Nevada , will not be caucusing for any candidates tomorrow .
Ahead of Tuesdayâ€ ™ s Nevada Republican presidential caucuses ,
Rep. Joe Heck , the top Republican Senate candidate , was not in the state on Monday and did not plan to be there on Tuesday , either .
His office said he was on the East Coast as Congress begins to trickle back from the Presidents Day recess .
Ryan Erwin , the former executive director of the Nevada Republican Party and the top strategist on Heckâ€ ™ s campaign , said
Heckâ€ ™ s approach in the race was a focused one : â€œKeep your head down and get the job
done.â€ � â€œWe need to work with whoever the nominee is .
We have enough to do to win this race than to get neck - deep in other politics , â€ �
he said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a race that has shifted so many times .
For us to worry about how that shift might impact the electorate in our race doesnâ€ ™ t make sense.â€ �
Unlike Pennsylvania GOP Sen. Patrick J. Toomey , who endorsed Marco Rubio , or Ohioâ€ ™ s
Rob Portman , who endorsed his home state governor John Kasich , despite being locked in tough races
, Heck has adopted the approach of New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte , staying quiet as the presidential circus went through town .
Heck , who could still face a Republican challenger , is walking a fine line in trying to placate the conservative base while keeping an eye on a general election electorate whose support would be harder to earn on a GOP ticket headlined by a candidate such as Donald Trump .

Genn Beck is currently speaking at Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s rally in Elko , Nevada .
Cruz is expected to speak there soon .
Meanwhile , in Ben Carson - land ... The Cruz vs Rubio spat is getting nastier by the minute .
Possibly in response to those biting comments from Rubioâ€ ™ s spokesman that Rick Tyler was â€œa really good spokesman who had the unenviable task of working for a candidate willing to do or say anything to get elected , â€ � the Cruz camp is now striking back at Marco Rubio in a memo titled , in all - caps , â€œTED CRUZ IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO CAN BEAT DONALD
TRUMPâ€ � .
In the memo , Jason Johnson , Cruzâ€ ™ s chief strategist , writes : Three states into the Republican nominating process , the field has narrowed from seventeen to five candidates .
And of the five candidates remaining , only three are viable : Cruz , Trump and Rubio .
Marco Rubio can not beat Trump .
Trump canâ€ ™ t be beaten from the political Left , with a candidate who emphatically supports amnesty and who allows Trump to be considered the â€œconservativeâ€ � in that context .
Rubio has yet to win a primary state .
On This Week with George Stephanopoulos , Senator Rubio was asked simply ,
â€œwhat state can you win?â€ � Rubio replied , Florida on March 15 .
Rubioâ€ ™ s stated strategy is to lose the first four primary states , lose every state on Super Tuesday , then lose every state on March 5 , then lose every state on March 8 , and then finally win in Florida ( where heâ€ ™ s currently polling third , behind Donald Trump and Ted Cruz ) .
Johnson goes on to say that â€œBy March 15 , 26 states or territories will have voted , and Rubio does not plan to win any of them .
Almost 50 % of the delegates will have already been allocated ; Rubio will win almost none , and then heâ€ ™ ll hope for resurrection in Florida .
Thatâ€ ™ s an even less plausible path to victory than Mayor Rudy Giulianiâ€ ™ s â€œwait for Floridaâ€ � strategy in 2008.â€ �

Itâ€ ™ s raining endorsements today for Marco Rubio , reports Sabrina Siddiqui .
Senator Dan Coats of Indiana is the latest to jump on board .
Earlier , Rubio got the endorsement of senators Jeff Flake Orrin Hatch , and the second - hand , lightly used , still in good working condition endorsement of former vice - presidential candidate Bob Dole , who had previously backed Bush .
Maria La Ganga has investigated the possible reasons why , despite his lead in the polls , Donald Trump could lose here in Nevada tomorrow : his lack of a ground game .
Donald Trump has one of the smallest and least organized ground campaigns in Nevada , according to Republican officials and operatives in the state , raising questions about the billionaireâ€ ™ s readiness for another caucus - based contest after his disappointing second - place finish in Iowa .
Texas senator Ted Cruz beat the brash real estate mogul in Iowaâ€ ™ s Republican contest with help from evangelical Christians and a superior network of volunteers ; such workers are critical in states such as Nevada and Iowa , which choose their presidential nominees through a complicated caucus system .
Donald Trump leaves supporters cold as he accuses Rubio of â€˜excess sweatingâ€
™ Read more Eight days after his bruising loss , Trump won the New Hampshire primary , declaring : â€œWe learned a lot about ground game in a week.â€ � The big question is whether he has learned enough .
Although the answer wonâ€ ™ t become clearer until the Republican caucuses inNevada on 23 February , following the South Carolina primary on Saturday , the reality television star appears to be lagging behind his better organized competitors in reaching out to Nevadaâ€ ™ s hard - to - corral caucus - goers .
â€œElections are won on organization , â€ � said Adam Khan , chairman of the Washoe County Republican Central Committee .
â€œTrump has a lot of popularity , but if you look at the ground operation here , he just doesnâ€ ™ t have it.â€ �
Exhibit A :
Trumpâ€ ™ s rally on 10 January at the downtown Reno Ballroom .
It could have been a campaign managerâ€ ™
s dream â€ “ 3,000 or so cheering supporters , an energized army ready to be harnessed
, a data trove for the all - important get - out - the - vote effort .
But Trumpâ€ ™ s staff did not record e - mail addresses or phone numbers that day from the captive audience of potential donors , caucus - goers and volunteers .
The rally became a squandered opportunity six weeks out from the caucuses .
When asked about that campaign blunder , Trumpâ€ ™ s Nevada state director Charles Munoz replied : â€œIâ€ ™ ll have headquarters get back to you , or Iâ€ ™ ll get back to you.â€ �
So far , that has not happened .
The Best Ground Game award here , Republican political consultant Erik Jimanez told Maria , goes to Marco Rubio .
Heâ€
™ s got a large number of campaign staff in Las Vegas and Reno .
Theyâ€ ™ re doing a lot of outreach to the rural counties , which are tremendous in terms of who shows up on caucus day , much higher rates than in urban areas.â€ �

A quick break from Nevada and the Republicans for a second : Atlantaâ€ ™ s
Channel 2 Action News has just released a poll showing that Hillary Clinton has a commanding lead in Georgia over Bernie Sanders , with 72 percent to the Vermont senatorâ€ ™ s 19.8 .
Georgia is one of the 12 states - and one territory - which vote on March first : â€œSuper Tuesday.â€ �
More from Cruz Nevada campaign chair Adam Laxalt
: On the subject of the Rick Tyler controversy , he said : â€œThey made the decision to move on with the communication director .
Thatâ€ ™ s just is a strong statement of how important integrity is to Cruz and to the campaignâ€ ¦ .â€
�
Asked about Trump and his campaignâ€ ™ s behavior during the nominating process , Laxalt said , â€œI think thereâ€ ™ s absolutely a double standard .
Thereâ€ ™ s a lot of stuff that happens with these huge presidential candidates ...
Thereâ€ ™ s no accountability on all sides .
â€œCruz tends to take the lionâ€ ™ s share of attacks from the media whenever anything is happening , â€ � the stateâ€ ™ s attorney general said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s challenging .
But despite all that , thereâ€ ™ s a huge reservoir of consistent support in this state and across the country.â€ �
My colleagues Sabrina Siddiqui , Maria La Ganga and Ben Jacobs have gone into much more detail on the scandal that led to Rick Tylerâ€ ™ s firing .
Cruz sacked Rick Tyler , his national spokesman , after he circulated a video on Sunday that allegedly showed Rubio walking by a Cruz staffer in a hotel lobby who was holding a Bible .
Although the audio was fuzzy , some assumed Rubio to have remarked : â€œGot a good book there , not many answers in it.â€
�
In fact , Rubio had said â€œall the answers in itâ€ � .
â€œThis morning I asked for Rick Tylerâ€ ™ s resignation , â€ �
Cruz told reporters in Las Vegas over his promotion of a news story that falsely claimed his rival said â€œsomething negative about the Bibleâ€ � .
â€œThis was a grave error of judgment , â€ � he said .
â€œIt turned out the news story he sent around was false .
But Iâ€ ™ ll tell you , even if it was true , we are not a campaign that will question the faith of another candidate.â€
�
They also spoke to a spokesman for the Rubio campaign , Alex Conant , who reacted to the news by saying Tyler is â€œa really good spokesman who had the unenviable task of working for a candidate willing to do or say anything to get electedâ€ � .
Owch .
They conclude that the Tyler firing â€œsuggests Cruz may believe his campaign is vulnerable to the emerging narrative that he is a candidate willing to play dirty â€ “ a troublesome accusation for a candidate seeking to appeal to the religious right.â€ �
You can read the full story here .
The controversy which led to his firing of campaign spokesman Rick Tyler does not appear to have dampened the enthusiasm of Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s diehard supporters , as this video shot by Maria La Ganga outside his Las Vegas rally this afternoon shows : Maria also was there for a candid briefing from Adam Laxalt , the Cruz campaign chairman in Nevada and the stateâ€ ™ s attorney general , where he sought to manage expectations about the Texanâ€ ™ s performance in the Battle Born state .
Talking to reporters after Cruzâ€ ™ s Las Vegas rally midday Monday , he stressed Rubioâ€ ™ s ties to the state .
â€œRubio should win this state , â€ � Laxalt said , as supporters mobbed Cruz for selfies and handshakes in a YMCA gymnasium .
â€œRubioâ€ ™ s from here , he was raised here , heâ€ ™ s got family here and heâ€ ™ s campaigned here .
So there should be an expectation that he should beat Trump here .
â€œWith the caucus , it is so unknown who turns out , â€ � Laxalt continued .
In the 2012 Republican caucuses , â€œwe only had 33,000 show up in the state , 16,000 from here , Clark County .
Who turns out is up to anyoneâ€
™ s guess .
I think if conservatives turn out , the Cruz is in a very , very good position.â€ �
Laxalt said he has toured the state on Cruzâ€ ™ s behalf and â€œthere were a lot of folks that didnâ€ ™ t even know we had a caucus .
â€
¦ I think
thatâ€ ™ s one disadvantage we face .
A lot of voters just arenâ€ ™ t in tune with the caucus.â€ �
Laxalt said Cruz planned to travel 750 miles on Monday , the day before the Republican caucuses , from Las Vegas to Reno to Elko , along with other small , rural towns in Nevadaâ€ ™ s vast outback .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve had to change venues ,
â€ � he said .
â€œEverythingâ€ ™ s sold out , people are excited.â€ �
Nate Cohn , over at the New York Times , makes an interesting spot regarding the new voter registrations following the Iowa caucuses .
Outside the Rubio rally I catch up with a few supporters .
Brooke Sullivan is the manager of a cattle ranch in Reno ; she says that before seeing the senator speak she was on the fence
- â€œbut now
Iâ€
™ m convinced to vote ; he rocked my socks.â€
�
Sheâ€ ™ ll be caucusing for him tomorrow .
Several people here werenâ€ ™ t impressed by what they called â€œdirty tricksâ€ � by the Cruz team .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t like anything heâ€
™ s done , â€ � Sullivan says .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t want a president whoâ€ ™ s constantly apologising - these things are not done by mistake , so
either heâ€ ™ s giving a back door wink , or hiring bad people.â€ �
Janelle LaFleur , a housekeeping manager at a Reno hotel , had just caught up on the news about Rick Tylerâ€ ™ s firing when I speak to her .
â€œItâ€ ™ s horrible ,
â€ � she says .
â€œItâ€ ™ s nice to see that [ Cruz ] has taken care of it - but
itâ€ ™ s his campaign.â€ � â€œYou donâ€ ™ t see Marco Rubio doing things like that , â€ � she adds .
In Reno , Rubio , who has just finished speaking , was recounting his personal story - he was born in Las Vegas ; his mother was a maid , his father a bartender .
Itâ€ ™ s a story
thatâ€ ™ s resonating extremely well here .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to have a lot of work to do together .
But weâ€ ™ re going to do it , â€ � Rubio is saying in Reno .
It wonâ€ ™ t be easy , he says , but â€œthere has never been a time when America had it easy.â€ � Each generation before us had problems , and they solved their problems . ...
Today , America is governed by the most selfish leaders in the history of the republic .
The crowd again chants â€œMarco !
Marco!â€ � â€œThere are other people in this race - Iâ€ ™ ve gotten to know them really well over 44 debates
, â€ � he jokes .
â€œI like them ,
I do.â€
�
But , he says , there canâ€ ™ t be two Republican nominees .
â€œJust one.â€ �
â€œWhen youâ€ ™ re president you canâ€
™ t be a divisive figure ,
â€ � he says , obliquely striking at Trump and Cruz while couching it in critiques of Obama .
Rubio says he wants to campaign â€œin a way that does not necessitate pitting us against each other.â€ � Applause in the room .
Some sad news : Missouri senator Claire McCaskill has just announced , in a blog post , that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer - though
, happily , she says that she has been told by doctors that she is going to make a full recovery .
Her statement : I very recently learned that I have breast cancer .
It was detected through a regular mammogram .
Itâ€ ™ s a little scary , but my prognosis is good and I expect a full recovery .
I will be in St Louis for the next 3 weeks receiving treatment .
During this time my staff will continue to assist Missourians and I will be posting on my Senate website ( McCaskill.senate.gov ) how I would have voted on any matters that come before the Senate during my absenceâ€”which Iâ€ ™ ll also enter into the Congressional record .
Additionally , Iâ€ ™ ll be submitting questions in writing for any missed Senate hearings .
Thank you for the honor of serving you in the Senate .
In Vegas , Cruz is hitting out more at the President than his Republican rivals - not surprising , considering how much humble pie heâ€ ™ s been forced to eat today by Rubio and Trump over his now ex - spokesmanâ€ ™ s tweet .
â€œIf we nominate somebody that 40 to 50 percent of our party
canâ€
™ t stand , we are going to lose to Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders , â€ � Rubio says .
Then , he makes his pitch : We have to nominate someone who will bring us together , and I will bring us together faster than anyone else .
We have to nominate someone not just who can bring us together , but someone who can bring new people in .
He points out that his mother was a maid ; says when he stays at hotels on the campaign trail , the maids he meets know that .
â€œWe have to take that message to them.â€
�
This part is crucial : â€œWe have to tell them that what they hear about Republicans , about us only caring about the rich , is a lie : because , look at where I come from.â€ � â€œRubio victory!â€ � someone in the crowd calls out .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re messing with my train of thought here , â€ � Rubio says , grinning .
â€œYou know how much I love to repeat myself now
I have to repeat myself
again!â€ � Back in Reno , Rubio is hitting his stump speech talking - points beautifully .
Hitting out at Bernie Sanders .
â€œA few weeks ago I started saying Bernie Sanders should be president of Sweden ,
â€ � he says .
â€œAnd then Sweden got mad .
Then I started saying he should be president of Norway .
Then Norway got mad.â€
�
The audience laughs heartily .
The tone is ebullient .
And you can watch a livestream here :
â€œI know youâ€ ™ re here today because youâ€ ™ re worried about the future of your county , â€ � Rubio says .
â€œYou should be.â€ � â€œMarco !
Marco!â€ � the crowd chants .
â€œDonâ€
™ t say polo , â€ � the Florida senator jokes .
â€œThat game tortured me as a child.â€ � Donald Trump is piling in on Cruz too over Rick Tylerâ€ ™
s
tweet :
Rubio is due to speak in Reno soon .
Earlier , he spoke out obliquely against the actions of Rick Tyler .
Rick Tyler , the former national spokesman for the Ted Cruz campaign , was asked to resign by Cruz on Monday .
According to Politico : Cruz cited a social media posting from Tyler on Sunday about a comment Marco Rubio supposedly made about the Bible .
â€œOur campaign should not have sent it .
Thatâ€ ™ s why Iâ€ ™ ve asked for Rick Tylerâ€ ™ s resignation , â€ � Cruz said .
The Texas senator was speaking to reporters on Monday , and said heâ€ ™ s spent the morning investigating what happened .
Tyler was on TV this morning apologising for his post . ...
but it doesnâ€ ™ t appear to have been enough .
Hello and welcome to
this afternoonâ€ ™ s
live coverage of the eve of the Nevada Republican caucuses .
Iâ€ ™ m Nicky Woolf , and Iâ€ ™ m in Reno , Nevada , taking over the blog from my colleague Amber Jamieson .
We have an action - packed afternoon for you as we gear up for this crucial first - in - the - west caucus .
Marco Rubio , who is picking up endorsements from previous Bush supporters left , right , and center , is about to speak at a campaign stop in Reno .
Later today , Donald Trump will be speaking in Las Vegas , and Iâ€ ™ ll be at a Ted Cruz rally tonight here in Reno .
Theoretically , itâ€ ™ s possible
Ben Carson might make an appearance too .
But donâ€ ™ t hold your breath .
As the great Ira Glass says : stay with us .
BREAKING :
Ted Cruz just announced he asked one of his top staffers , spokesman Rick Tyler , to resign after pushing a story that said opponent Marco Rubio criticized the Bible .
As we explained earlier this morning , the story stems from a video with pretty crappy audio , where Rubio walks past a Cruz staffer and compliments him for reading a the bible but then says , according to the subtitles of the YouTube clip : â€œNot many answers in it .
Especially in that one.â€ � Rubioâ€ ™ s team declared the story totally bananas , saying their candidate said the holy book had â€œall the answers in itâ€ � .
Tyler apologized in a Facebook statement earlier this morning : Iâ€ ™ ve deleted the post because I would not knowingly post a false story .
But the fact remains that I did post it when I should have checked its accuracy first .
I regret the mistake .
And now he has been forced to resign .
A new poll from Vermont shows very , very strong support for hometown hero Bernie Sanders in the Democrat primary -- while Trump is poised to win the stateâ€ ™ s Republican vote .
The VPR poll shows Sanders winning 84 % of the Democrat vote , compared to just 9 % for Hillary Clinton .
Sandersâ€ ™ support jumps to a whopping 95 % when counting only voters between 18 - 39 .
While itâ€ ™ s no surprise that Sanders would win his home state , Clinton won 38 % of the Democrat primary vote in Vermont back in 2008 .
Of the 151 Republicans that responded , 32 % said they support Trump .
Rubio sits in second place , with 16 % .
The poll was conducted between Feb. 3 and Feb. 17 and had 895 responses from across Vermontâ€ ™ s 14 counties .
The margin of error rate is 3.3 % .
GOP establishment feels the Rubiomentum One of the most consequential political science works about modern American politics is
â€œThe Party Decidesâ€ � which advances the thesis that party insiders often decide who the nominee is before voters do so .
And , if the party still decides , itâ€ ™ s clear they are picking Marco Rubio .
In the aftermath of Jeb Bushâ€ ™ s decision to drop out of the Republican primary on Saturday night , GOP insiders are flocking to back Rubio .
Former Kansas senator and 1996 Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole announced his support for Rubio on Monday .
Dole , the epitome of a party elder , had previously backed Jeb Bush .
Doleâ€ ™ s endorsement is the latest that Rubio has recieved in the past 48 hours .
In addition to the nonagenarian former Senate majority leader , he has been endorsed by three senators , Dean Heller of Nevada , Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona , Governor Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas as well as a half dozen House members and other party luminaries like former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty .
Despite not winning a single primary so far , Rubio , whose best finish is razor thin second place over Ted Cruz in South Carolina , is clearly consolidating establishment support as alternative to Cruz and Donald Trump .
However , Rubio still doesnâ€ ™ t have the establishment lane to himself .
Ohio governor John Kasich is still in the race and hoping to pick off delegates on March 1 states in advance of the Michiganâ€ ™ s primary on March 8 .
Kasich has picked up a handful of additional endorsements in the past two days as well including former Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge .
â€œWhen
I look at you , I donâ€
™ t see happiness , â€ � a supporter said to John Kasich during this morningâ€ ™ s campaign event in Fairfax , Virginia .
Kasich quickly said this campaign made him â€œjoyous.â€ �
However , there was also an acceptance of the unlikeliness of him winning the nomination , saying he doesnâ€ ™ t pray to win , but instead prays â€œto be able to accept whatever is meant to be and carry out whatever the next responsibility I have
is.â€ �
The more I read the sentence
â€œWhen
I look at you , I donâ€
™ t see happiness , â€ � the more utterly bleak it becomes .
Commenters !
We asked for you to hazard a guess on which are the â€œfive critical issuesâ€ � that Bernie Sanders will differentiate himself from Hillary Clinton on at todayâ€ ™ s 3:30 press conference in Boston .
So far and FirasA and WarlockScottâ€ ™ s comments seem the most likely :
Although , shout out to kattw for at least making us laugh .
A special congratulations post will be awarded to whichever commenter manages to nail Sanderâ€ ™ s top issues before 3:30pm , so please keep offering up your suggestions .
A Carson supporter asks the candidate if heâ€ ™ d consider taking another position in government if he doesnâ€ ™ t win the Republican nomination â€ “ which , considering his poll numbers , is a reasonable question .
Carson didnâ€ ™ t rule out being someoneâ€ ™ s vice - president , but kept his answer vague : Iâ€ ™ m not looking for a job .
I had a very good , long and arduous career .
I would always consult with the Lord .
Remember ,
thereâ€
™ s a lot you can do outside the government , especially if youâ€ ™ ve got a platform .
I donâ€
™ t know , if there was someone who was really compatible with me .
And right now , Iâ€ ™ m not really sure who that would be .
I never close the door on anything , including being the next president .
Who won Nevadaâ€ ™ s Latino vote on Saturday night ?
Hillary Clinton won a modest but decisive victory in the Nevada caucuses on Saturday .
And she won the black vote by a wide margin .
Less clear is who won the stateâ€ ™ s Latino voters .
The Sanders campaign was quick to spin Saturday nightâ€ ™ s loss as a marginal success based on polling that showed he had not only made significant inroads with Latinos but also won the stateâ€ ™ s Hispanic vote .
Specifically , early entrance polls that gave Sanders an eight - point edge over Clinton among Hispanic voters .
On Sunday , a New York Times report raised questions around the arithmetic .
The report quoted a memo from Latino Decisions , a polling firm the Clinton campaign used to tally Hispanic votes , which suggested that the math â€œdidnâ€ ™ t add upâ€ � .
A precinct - by - precinct analysis by the Timesâ€ ™ data guru , Nate Cohn , suggested that Clinton may have won the Latino vote but not by the considerable margin she won in 2008 : â€œThe actual election returns in Las Vegasâ€ ™ s Clark County hint at a different story .
Analyzed neighborhood by neighborhood , they suggest that Mrs. Clinton might have won the Hispanic vote by a comfortable margin .
She won about 60 percent of delegates in heavily Hispanic areas , a result that calls the finding of the polling into question.â€ �
Why does it matter ?
Minority voters just may determine the Democratic party nominee , especially as the contests move to states with a more diverse electorate .
Will we ever get to the bottom of this ?
Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ Carsonâ€ ™ s
quiet and more laid - back demeanor and slow manner of speaking regularly gets slammed , with Donald Trump labelling him with his favorite insult :
â€œlow energyâ€ � .
But Carson shrugged off that criticism during a Virginia City town hall meeting : â€œThe ability to be calm , relaxed and controlled is a sign of strength , not a sign of weakness .
Carson then outlined what he would do if he was trying to â€œdestroy Americaâ€ � , such as raising taxes , failing to look after veterans , failing to fix electric infrastructure and putting more people on welfare â€ “ noting that any similarity to what the current president is doing is purely â€œcoincidentalâ€ � , to many laughs .
Carson is now speaking about growing up poor and how education and belief in God helped turn his life around and gave him hope : It matters what you do with the gifts that God has given you and how much energy you put into it .
The thing that bothered me most was poverty .
I hated being poor .
But once I understood that [ it was OK ] ... because I knew it was only temporary .
I could change it .
If you know you can change the situation , it doesnâ€
™ t bother you as much as if you think youâ€ ™ re stuck .
Ben Carson slamming the media at a town hall rally in Virginia City , Nevada moments ago : Weâ€ ™ re living in a country , unfortunately , today where the media has become very irresponsible .
They are the only business that is protected by our constitution .
Thereâ€ ™ s a reason for that : they were supposed to be on the side of the people .
They were supposed to be honest and not take sides â€
¦ I always appeal to young journalists to shake off the bosses that they have and start working without an agenda and for the people .
GOP presidential wannabe and Ohio governor John Kasich frustrated female supporters by declaring this morning that heâ€ ™ d gotten elected to the Ohio senate in 1978 because of â€œmany women who left their kitchensâ€ � to support him .
John Kasich : â€œHow did I get elected ?
Nobody was ...
I didnâ€ ™ t have anybody for me .
We just got an army of people ...
many women who left their kitchens to go out and go door to door and put yard signs out for me.â€ �
Female supporter : â€œYour comment
earlier about the women came out of the kitchen to support you ?
Iâ€ ™ ll come to support you but I wonâ€ ™ t be coming out of the kitchen.â€ � Kasich , who is trying to position himself as a Republican moderate , made the comment in Fairfax , Virginia .
Yesterday , he signed a bill to block any Ohio state funding of Planned Parenthood .
After Jeb !
Bush bowed out of the race on Saturday â€ “ not even ditching his glasses could save him â€
“
his staffers are also left jobless .
His chief analytics officer , Alex Lundy , tweeted out his feelings about Bushâ€ ™ s most bitter political enemy and started a handy job hunt : The entire internet is currently being charmed by this delightful video of a 106-year - old woman visiting the White House and dancing with President Obama and Michelle Obama to celebrate Black History Month .
Sprightly Virginia McLaurin says that she never thought sheâ€ ™ d live to see a black president and First Lady .
Itâ€ ™ s an interesting reminder that in the next election there are a few possible first presidents that could occur : first female president ( Clinton ) , first Jewish president ( Sanders ) or first Latino president ( Cruz and Rubio ) .
Marco Rubio is displaying an interest in local issues ahead of tomorrowâ€ ™ s Republican caucus in Nevada , revealing his views on prostitution .
â€œIâ€ ™ m anti - prostitution ... I wish Nevada would make it illegal .
But thatâ€ ™ s their decision to make .
I donâ€
™ t agree with it , â€ � he said ahead of an event in Elko .
Prostitution is legal in Nevada â€ “ and there are 19 licensed brothels â€ “ but millions of dollars of illegal prostitution , more than the legal sex work , occurs in the state every year .
But since Rubio believes in small government , he wouldnâ€ ™ t bring in laws to make it a federal offense .
â€œI think you can be against something and still say :
â€˜But I donâ€ ™ t want the federal government involved in federalizing something , â€ ™ â€ � said Rubio .
New Hampshireâ€ ™ s secretary of state confirmed the delegate count for the Republican convention from the statesâ€ ™ s primary on 9 February , with Donald Trump picking up 11 delegates and John Kasich getting four .
The full list of results : New Hampshire saw a record turnout at its Republican primary , with 542,459 votes cast .
As much as this election might seem uniquely American â€ “ from its Clinton - Bush tussle to the billionaire reality TV star Republican frontrunner â€ “ the AP notes that politics are similar to those seen in recent years in Europe : Donald Trump â€ “ his bombast distinctly American â€ “ sometimes takes a nationalist stance that sounds a lot like the â€˜blame the immigrantâ€ ™ approach used by a growing cadre of European politicians as the continent deals with unprecedented waves of immigration and Islamic extremism .
On the left , Bernie Sanders espouses Scandinavian - style â€˜democratic socialismâ€ ™ that sounds radical to some American ears .
But it has long been part of the political mainstream in Europe , where socialist governments come and go without particular fanfare .
This just landed in our inboxes from the Sanders camp : Bernie Sanders will hold a news conference at 3:15 today in Boston differentiating his views with Hillary Clinton on five critical issues .
Sanders also will accept an endorsement from a national grassroots organization .
The press conference will be held at the International Association of Ironworkers in Boston .
No word yet on the â€œnational grassroots organizationâ€ � or the five critical issues .
Give us your suggestions on the five issues in the comments !
This just in from reporter Lauren Gambino , clarifying that our earlier update that Clinton had the day off was a miscommunication ...
Hillary Clinton has no public events today , but alas , no rest for the weary .
Not when thereâ€ ™ s cash to be collected and important hands to shake .
The former secretary of state is in southern California today , where sheâ€ ™ s scheduled to hold fundraisers in Studio City and Hancock Park .
The fundraisers are part of a two - day swing in the state .
Her trip in the state began in northern California on Sunday where she was due to attend three fundraising events .
On the other side of the country , a group of mothers who have lost their children to gun violence and policing incidents as well as a team of civil rights lawyers are holding forums at churches and a library across South Carolina , ahead of the states Democratic primary on Saturday .
John Kasich speaking right now at an event in Fairfax , Virginia ( attended by 1,000 people , he claims ) : I labored in obscurity for literally 100 straight days .
I told everybody : look , you just watch whatâ€ ™ s going to happen in New Hampshire .
Iâ€ ™ m going to talk to people about my record and Iâ€ ™ m going to talk to people about my heart â€
¦
If youâ€ ™ ve got the head without the heart , you canâ€ ™ t win , and if youâ€ ™ ve got the heart without the head , youâ€ ™ re probably not qualified to run things .
To Fairfax , Virginia , where Congressman Tom Davis is hustling for his friend John Kasich .
Hustling , in this case , means speaking about when Kasich was head of the House budget committee .

â€œWe got the Republicans to agree to a balanced budget .
We got the Senate on board .

Both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have been busy trying to court civil rights leader Al Sharpton â€ “ with Sanders popping up to Harlem for lunch and Clinton joining him for a chat last week .
But Sharpton spoke to Politico about Donald Trump â€ “ who he knows from years of power broking in New York City â€ “ and compared him to the infamous boxing promoter Don King :
The best way I can describe Donald Trump to friends is to say if Don King had been born white heâ€ ™ d be Donald Trump â€ ¦

Hello , and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House , following a weekend that saw Jeb Bush hang up his glasses after losing to Trump in South Carolina , and Hillary Clinton locking down the black vote and claiming Nevada in a decisive 52 - 47 win over Bernie Sanders .
Now itâ€ ™ s time for the old state switcheroo , with tomorrowâ€ ™ s Nevada Republican caucus and a Democratic primary in South Carolina on Saturday .
In Nevada , polling data from Real Clear Politics shows Donald Trump with 42 % support , Ted Cruz at 20 % and Marco Rubio at 19 % .
It echoes the result in South Carolina , where Trump sewed up the lead and Cruz and Rubio basically tied for second .
The battle for second place behind Trump is getting dirty , with Cruzâ€ ™ s spokesman Rick Tyler forced to backtrack overnight after pushing a story that said Rubio criticized the Bible .
In a video with pretty crappy audio , Rubio walks past a Cruz staffer and compliments him for reading a book ( surprise , itâ€ ™ s the Bible ) but then says , according to the subtitles of the YouTube clip : â€œNot many answers in it .
Especially in that one.â€ � Rubioâ€ ™ s team declared the story totally bananas , saying their candidate said the holy book had â€œall the answers in itâ€ � .
Tyler apologized in a Facebook statement :
Iâ€ ™ ve deleted the post because I would not knowingly post a false story .
But the fact remains that I did post it when I should have checked its accuracy first .
I regret the mistake .
Can Sanders get the delegates required ?
Not only did Clinton win Nevada , but sheâ€ ™ s beating Sanders in the delegate race , with 502 to his 70 so far .
Plus , of those delegates , Clintonâ€ ™ s got 451 superdelegates ( party leaders who can vote regardless of their stateâ€ ™ s allegiance ) compared to Sandersâ€ ™ 19 .
There are 2,383 delegates needed to decide the Democratic nomination .
Nearly that many will be allocated in March alone , and many of the upcoming primaries favor Clinton .
â€œThe odds of his overtaking her growing increasingly remote , â€ � says a New York Times report today .
But Jeff Weavers , Sandersâ€ ™ campaign manager , reckons the Vermont Senator will be OK post 1 March , telling AP :
Itâ€ ™ s frontloaded for her , but we have the ability to stay in the long game .
Will Ben Carson drop out after Nevada ?
The retired neurosurgeon is busy claiming his campaign isnâ€ ™ t beyond resuscitation , after a Daily Beast reporter tweeted that he will bow out on Wednesday .
â€œRight now , it is way too early in the game to give up .
If you were supposed to select a nominee after just three contests , then why did w go through all of this?â€ � said Carson on Sunday .
Plus , with Bush out of race , where will his supporters â€ “ and money â€ “ go ?
Today weâ€ ™ ve got Lauren Gambino in Charleston , South Carolina , Sabrina Siddiqui hanging in Vegas with Rubio , Nicky Woolf in Reno and Paul Lewis and Sam Levin also hanging in Nevada .
Bill Clinton will be stumping for Hillary in Laredo and Dallas , Texas , ahead of the stateâ€ ™ s 1 March primary .
Are you ready for today ?
Son - of - Donald , Eric Trump , sure is ."
2016-02-22,"Ted Cruz fired top aide Rick Tyler after he promoted a false story questioning Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s commitment to the Bible , a move the Texas senator described as â€˜a grave errorâ€ ™ The departure from the race of Jeb Bush after the former governor imploded in South Carolina unstoppered a flow of endorsements for the Florida senator .
The endorsements included a couple senators , a handful of US representatives , a former Minnesota governor and Bob Dole , the 1996 Republican presidential nominee .
Reports that Mitt Romney , the 2012 nominee , was on the verge of backing Rubio were shot down , however , by Romney insiders , who said that cake wasnâ€ ™ t quite yet baked .
Donald Trump , whose most high - profile endorsement on Monday came from the star of a motorcycle reality show , stumped in Nevada after beating Rubio by 10 in South Carolina .
Do endorsements from elected officials matter ?
Or will Trump end that notion ?
Next up , Nevada Republicans caucus on Tuesday .
The smart money is on Trump to win â€ “ again .
On the Democratic side , meanwhile , Hillary Clinton has opened up a large delegate lead on rival Bernie Sanders , despite winning only two of three state contests so far .
What kind of math is that ?
In a word , superdelegates !
â€ “ party insiders who get to help pick the nominee without any duty to listen to voters .
Neat .
Even if Sanders wins popular vote , Clinton could still get nomination Kasich was talking about 1978 , and his campaign said â€˜kitchenâ€ ™ was shorthand for â€˜grassrootsâ€ ™ .
But at least one candidate for president didnâ€ ™ t give him a pass ..."
2016-02-22,"Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio arrived in Nevada late on Sunday with distinctly different pitches for why each should be considered the most viable challenger to the Republican presidential frontrunner , Donald Trump .
The two first - term senators effectively tied in South Carolinaâ€ ™ s primary at the weekend and are running short of time to stop Trump , who beat them both by a 10-point margin , from clinching the Republican nomination for the White House .
Both senators vowed that they were uniquely positioned to defeat the real estate mogul , but whereas Cruz focused his efforts on firing up Nevadaâ€ ™ s rural , religious right , Rubio underscored the need for a more diverse coalition of conservatives reflective of a new generation .
Rubio , who spent part of his childhood in Nevada , a state in which close to half the population are minorities , talked about the support he received from South Carolinaâ€ ™ s governor , Nikki Haley , and Senator Tim Scott .
â€œI was on stage receiving the endorsement of an Indian American governor from South Carolina , who was endorsing a Cuban American senator from Florida , and I was standing next to the African American Republican senator from South Carolina.â€ �
â€œThis is the face of the new conservative movement , â€ �
he told a couple of hundred supporters inside Texas Casino , a resort off the Las Vegas strip .
â€œWe are the party of everyone.â€ � Cruz , a senator for Texas , headed straight to hammer - shaped Nye County , which is over 90 % white .
In Pahrump â€ “ with 37,000 or so residents , the regionâ€ ™ s population center â€ “ he made a play for the stateâ€ ™ s rural conservatives by promising that if was sworn in as president â€œthe persecution of religious liberty ends todayâ€ � .
On a weekend that saw yet another mass shooting , Cruz also pledged to defend the second amendment while boasting of his support from the Gun Owners of America .
He further warned , in a state with a sizable Latino population , of the need â€œto finally , finally , finally control the borders and end sanctuary citiesâ€ � .
In South Carolina on Saturday , Rubio inched just ahead of Cruz to clinch second place by less than a percentage point .
Both candidates nonetheless paled in comparison with Trump , who scored a second consecutive overwhelming victory after the New Hampshire primary on 9 February .
Trump holds a similarly commanding lead in Nevada , with the caucuses less than two days away , although surveying in the state is notoriously unreliable .
Trumpâ€
™ s success has left neither Rubio nor Cruz where they had hoped to be at this stage of the race .
Rubio , despite bouncing back somewhat from a poor showing in New Hampshire , has yet to win a primary .
And Cruz , despite coming out on top of the Iowa caucuses , now faces questions over whether his evangelicals are as loyal to his campaign as had been expected .
However , the maverick senator questions the Republican frontrunnerâ€ ™ s support base .
â€œDonald
Trump has demonstrated that he has a relatively high floor of support , â€ �
Cruz said during a brief news conference in the back room of a smoky sports bar on State Route 160 .
â€œBut heâ€ ™ s also got , I think , a ceiling.â€ �
â€œFor folks who are concerned that Donald Trump is not the best candidate to go head - to - head with Hillary Clinton , it is becoming clearer and clearer that we are the one campaign that can beat Donald Trump .
Indeed , weâ€ ™ re the only campaign that has beaten Donald Trump , in Iowa .
And we will continue to go forward and beat him.â€ �
While he was consistently respectful of his billionaire rival , Cruz dismissed Rubio as an underachiever who had low - balled his prospects throughout the race .
Cruz cited in particular an interview of Rubioâ€ ™ s with ABCâ€ ™ s This Week on Sunday , in which host George Stephanopoulos asked the Florida senator which state he thought he could win after losing all three early contests .
â€œHe said , â€˜I think we could win Florida , March 15,â€ ™ â€ �
Cruz recounted .
â€œNow thatâ€ ™ s a fairly amazing admission that they donâ€
™ t believe theyâ€ ™ re gon na win here in Nevada .
Apparently they donâ€ ™ t believe theyâ€ ™ re going to win any states on Super Tuesday.â€ � â€œTheyâ€ ™ re writing off March 5 .
Theyâ€ ™ re writing off March 8 .
And theyâ€ ™ re trying to wait , apparently , until March 15 to finally win a state , â€ � Cruz added .
â€œAnd I would point out even in Florida , his home state ,
heâ€ ™ s right now polling in third place , behind both Donald and me.â€ �
Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign sought to drive home the opposite message : that it was Cruz who had been left bruised after falling short in a state tailor - made for his evangelical appeal .
â€œIf Ted Cruz can do no better than third place in a state like South Carolina where 73 % of the electorate described themselves as â€˜born - again or evangelical Christianâ€ ™ , where else can he win?â€ � Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign manager , Terry Sullivan , wrote in a memo on Sunday .
Rubio , for his part , charted a path to victory contingent upon winnowing the field and consolidating support behind his candidacy .
With former Florida governor Jeb Bush suspending his campaign after South Carolina , Rubio said during an interview with CNN on Sunday , the dynamic was â€œbeginning to shiftâ€ � .
â€œThat is what gives us an opportunity to coalesce and bring together Republicans who understand that we have to nominate someone who will unify our party , who will reach out to people that havenâ€ ™ t voted for us and grow our party and ultimately who can win.â€ �
The Florida senator struck upon similar themes while rallying with supporters across three states on Sunday â€ “ with stops in Nashville , Tennessee , Little Rock , Arkansas , and finally Las Vegas .
Framing himself as the most viable general election candidate , Rubio spoke defiantly of his ability to challenge Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders .
â€œIf you nominate me , we will win this election , â€ �
he said .
This article was amended on 22 February 2016 to correct a statement that Marco Rubio was born in Nevada .
He was born in Florida , but spent some of his childhood in Nevada ."
2016-02-23,"By most measures , Marco Rubio should be running away with the race for the Republican nomination in Nevada .
Of all the Republicans left in the contest , the senator from Florida has a unique connection to Nevadaâ€ ™ s culture and voters .
He lived in Las Vegas for three years as a child , until the age of 11 , during which time he also embraced the Mormon faith that is popular in a state that borders Utah .
Fully one quarter of GOP caucus - goers in the last presidential election were Mormon .
( It was only later that the young Rubio convinced his family to leave the Church of Latter - day Saints to convert to Catholicism . )
In a state where Latinos make up 27 % of the population , Rubio â€ “ as the only bilingual candidate in the field â€ “ should be making deep inroads into Nevada .
When he showed up to campaign at the downbeat Texas Station casino in north Las Vegas on Monday , there were more than two dozen of his family members in the audience .
Mark Hutchison , Nevadaâ€ ™ s lieutenant governor who is also serving as Rubioâ€ ™ s state campaign chairman , introduced the candidate by stressing the title of one of the chapters in his autobiography .
â€œYou know what itâ€ ™ s titled ?
Chapter Seven :
Growing up Vegas , â€ � Hutchison said .
â€œGrowing up Vegas !
Marco Rubio grew up here !
Marco Rubio is about Nevada .
He has his family members here .
Senator Rubio once told me has more family members in Nevada than he has in Florida .
He is here all the time for reunions .
He knows Nevada.â€ �
Whatever Rubio knows about Nevada , it isnâ€ ™ t impressing the stateâ€ ™ s voters .
According to the most recent polls ( in a state that is notoriously difficult to poll ) , Rubio is at least 20 points behind Donald Trump and can barely tie Ted Cruz for second place .
In fact , Rubio is faring no worse in this state than he is elsewhere .
He is running third in two of the bigger states on Super Tuesday â€ “ Texas and Georgia â€ “ in line with his third - place finish in Iowa and his effective tie for second place in South Carolina .
For a candidate who exudes confidence in his likelihood of winning the nomination , Rubio has a solid lock on losing for the foreseeable future .
His own state of Florida does not vote for another three weeks , and even there he is trailing in third place in recent polls .
He is the winningest candidate who just canâ€ ™ t win .
There is a consistency to Rubioâ€ ™ s underperformance that matches his robotic delivery on stage .
If he is now the Republican establishmentâ€ ™ s best candidate , the partyâ€ ™ s leaders and donors are destined to lose their shirts in Vegas .
So how come Rubio is faring so poorly in a state he once called home ?
Much of the answer lies in Rubioâ€ ™ s pitch to voters .
At the heart of his campaign is a perfectly delivered stump speech that sells one idea : the American dream .
Beyond his personal story of struggling with student debt , and his parentsâ€ ™ story as working - class immigrants , Rubioâ€ ™ s platform amounts to no more than motherhood and apple pie .
Yes , he delivers the now standard Republican promise to repeal Obamacare , increase military spending , lower taxes and beat Hillary Clinton .
But his ideas are so vacuous he makes Trumpâ€ ™ s stump speech sound like a seminar at the Brookings Institution .
( One of Rubioâ€ ™ s biggest applause lines is a promise to send Islamic State terrorists to GuantÃ¡namo Bay .
â€œAnd in GuantÃ¡namo , we are going to find out everything they know ,
â€ � he says darkly . )
Conventional wisdom â€ “ as well as the Cruz campaign â€ “ tells us that Rubio is an Obama - like figure â€ “ all hope and change and fine speeches .
In reality , Rubio most closely resembles another Democratic candidate from the 2008 cycle : John Edwards .
Before Edwards became tainted by sex scandal , he was a masterful campaigner with a pitch - perfect delivery of a stump speech about two Americas : one prosperous , the other trapped in poverty .
Edwards delivered each rendition of his stump speech with identical timing and hand gestures .
Every watery eye and dramatic pause was calibrated to sweep his audience off their feet .
It worked â€ “ as long as you only saw him once .
After that , you felt hopelessly manipulated .
Rubioâ€ ™ s delivery has an Edwards - like quality .
He places his hand on his heart when he talks about himself , as if to demonstrate the sincerity of his convictions .
He emotes so deliberately when talking about how your family is just like his , there really can be no distance between you .
It is easy to see how his supporters could leave a rally convinced by this wholesome and earnest performance .
Rubio places himself at the heart of a story of the revival of the American dream , with all the grandiose ambition and sheer hollowness that entails .
â€œHereâ€ ™ s what history will say of this generation if we get this election right
, â€ � he told his supporters in Las Vegas on Monday .
â€œIt will say the truth : we almost got it wrong .
But then we remembered who we were .
Then we remembered what America was .
And we rose up and confronted our challenges .
And we rose up and solved our problems .
And we rose up and embraced our opportunities .
And when our work is done , history will say of this generation , because we did what needed to be done , our children became the freest and most prosperous Americans
that ever lived.â€ � Sadly for Rubio , not enough of them are voting for his American dream .
That may be because he is a moderated version of the two candidates ahead of him .
He is not as apocalyptic as Cruz and he doesnâ€ ™ t promise as golden a future as Trump .
Rubio is an old manâ€ ™ s idea of young man : a fresh copy of an old Norman Rockwell .
He is neither youthful and forward - looking , nor old and backward - looking .
In other words , a perfectly good second - best .
Based on his current performance , history will say one thing about his campaign : he almost did what needed to be done .
In the meantime , he helped nominate Trump ."

2016-02-26,"Love him or hate him , you got ta hand it to Donald Trump : no one is better at manipulating the news cycle than he is .
And there is an almost Shakespearean quality to todayâ€ ™ s latest installment of the Trump Show .
Barely over 12 hours into his worst news cycle , after a debate where Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz delivered a bruising tag - team assault on the Donald and his record , Trump managed to instantly change the conversation .
Governor Chris Christieâ€ ™ s endorsement of Trump Friday afternoon not only ends a bad news cycle for Trump , but it also sucks all the oxygen out of Rubioâ€ ™ s moment in the spotlight .
The icing on the cake for Trump is that he manages to accomplish both of these things by announcing the endorsement of his main rivalâ€ ™ s nemesis â€ “ the man responsible for single - handedly stopping Rubioâ€ ™ s post - Iowa momentum at a prior debate .
Christie is a little manâ€ ™ s
Trump : equal parts authoritarian executive and blustering machismo .
He ran his now - defunct campaign promising to â€œtell it like it isâ€ � and vowing to increase the power of the NSA and to crack down on states that legalize marijuana .
The only reason Christie never really gained traction in the primaries is because Trump offered a bigger , badder version of what Christie was peddling .
The real question , then , isnâ€ ™ t why Christie endorsed Trump .
Itâ€ ™ s , whatâ€ ™ s in it for Chris Christie ?
While I donâ€ ™ t think Christie likes Rubio , I also havenâ€ ™ t heard anything that would lead me to believe that this endorsement is driven by personal animosity towards him .
So what is in it for Christie ?
Hard to imagine him being anyoneâ€ ™ s vice president .
Is he angling to be attorney general in a Trump administration ?
Possibly .
For Trump , the significance of this endorsement canâ€ ™ t be understated , not because Christie is going to sway many voters
â€ “ he wonâ€ ™ t .
Sure , he will be a helpful surrogate and attack dog on the trail and on television .
But the endorsementâ€ ™ s true importance is that it blunts Rubioâ€ ™ s momentum and puts the spotlight back on Trump , who is winning in almost every Super Tuesday state and just needs to run out the clock .
Not only does the Christie endorsement take the spotlight off of Rubio , but it also signals that the establishment isnâ€ ™ t monolithic in its support for Rubio .
Christie was once a rising star in the Republican party , a governor elected in deep blue New Jersey , whose endorsement was much coveted during the 2012 primary .
His endorsement â€ “ coupled with Trumpâ€ ™ s first congressional endorsements this week â€ “ shows that at least certain pockets of the Republican establishment are beginning to warm up to the idea of President Donald Trump .
Rubio got 12 hours to enjoy the spotlight after Thursday nightâ€
™ s debate .
Now itâ€ ™ s back to regularly scheduled programming : the Trump Show ."
2016-02-26,"The tenth Republican debate of the 2016 race for the White House is in the can .
Hereâ€ ™ s what happened :
Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz threw as many punches as they could at frontrunner Donald Trump , who was standing between them .
He dismissed them , argued with them , insulted them and generally gave as good as he got .
Rubio got under Trumpâ€ ™ s skin , by demanding that he describe his plan for health insurance reform beyond creating a national market .
Trump said â€œYouâ€ ™ ll have competition .
Itâ€ ™ ll be beautifulâ€ � but could not say more .
Pressed by a moderator to describe his health plan in any depth , Trump fumed , â€œNo !
Thereâ€ ™ s nothing to add .
What is to add ?
What is to add?â€ � â€œNow heâ€ ™ s repeating himself!â€ � said Rubio , lampooning Trumpâ€ ™ s rhetorical default mode : â€œEveryoneâ€ ™ s dumb .
Heâ€ ™ s gon na make America great again , weâ€ ™ re gon na win win win , and the lines around the statesâ€ � will go away .
Cruz joined in the attack on Trump , saying that while he , Cruz , was fighting immigration reform in Congress , â€œWhere was Donald ?
He was firing Dennis Rodman on Celebrity
Apprentice.â€ �
Trump called Cruz a â€œbasketcaseâ€ � and a â€œliarâ€
�
and he called Rubio a â€œchoke artist.â€

Rubio dumped his opposition research file on Trump , saying he hired foreign workers ahead of Americans , defrauded students at a university bearing his name , made his ties and suits in Mexico and China and drove companies to bankruptcy .
Trump said he couldnâ€ ™ t release his tax returns because he was being audited and his lawyers wouldnâ€ ™ t let him release them .
Trump dismissed polls that showed him performing miserably among Hispanic voters .
â€œI currently employ thousands of Hispanics , and over the years I have employed tens of thousands of Hispanics .
Theyâ€ ™ re incredible people.â€ � Ohio governor John Kasich made repeated calls for greater seriousness of purpose as Dr Ben Carson called for greater time for himself to speak .

In the Apple encryption question , all the Republicans are ignoring what a tremendous bit of government over - reach this is .

Now question on Appleâ€ ™ s decision to defy an FBI request to disable a self - destruct mode on an iPhone to comply with an investigation of the San Bernardino terror attack .
â€œApple doesnâ€ ™ t want to do it because they think it hurts their brand .
Well let me tell you their brand isnâ€ ™ t superior to the national security of America , â€ � Rubio says .
Cruz agrees , saying Apple should be required to comply with the search order , because it applies to only one phone , not to all phones .
â€œOn the question of unlocking this cell phone ...
we should enforce the court order ..
Apple doesnâ€ ™ t have a right.â€ �
Carson agrees .
â€œIf they donâ€
™ t comply with that , youâ€ ™ re encouraging chaos in our system.â€
�
Kasich says , â€œyou know what the problem is , whereâ€ ™ s the president been?â€ �
He says the president should have â€œlocked the doorâ€ � on a meeting between intelligence community folks and Apple until they compromise .
And kept the whole thing out of the newspapers .
Cruz to Trump : â€œFor 40 years youâ€ ™ ve been funding liberal politicians.â€
�
Trump : â€œI funded you.â€ �
Cruz admits
Trump gave him five grand .
Then there is a big messy Cruz - Rubio - Trump mess .
Blitzer gets control back with effort .
Interesting Beck boost for Rubio : Cruz now says
heâ€ ™ s going to upload an interview to his web site in which Trump advocates for toppling Gaddafi , despite Trumpâ€ ™ s just having said he never wanted to remove Gaddafi .
â€œIf you care about Israel , you donâ€ ™ t write checks to politicians that are undermining Israel , â€ � Cruz says .
Kasich tries to talk
but Blitzer says Trump gets to because he was attacked .
â€œThere is nobody on this stage that has done more for Israel than I have ...
you are all talk and no action ,
â€ �
Trump says .
Then Trump gestures respectively to Rubio and Cruz : â€œFirst of all , this guyâ€ ™ s a choke artist and this guyâ€ ™ s a liar.â€ �
Carson gets a big cheer with the line : â€œCan someone attack me please?â€ �
Trump is asked about a prospective ceasefire in Syria .
He says â€œitâ€ ™ s a meaningless cease
fireâ€ �
so he doesnâ€
™ t support this particular deal .
Cruz says heâ€ ™ s hopeful but skeptical .
Then he says Russia has strengthened its position because the Obama administration had given Russia the region .
Then Cruz says Trump and Rubio supported the Obama Libya policy and Rubio supported John Kerry for secretary of state .
Trump says he never supported deposing Gaddafi .
Rubio says he supported Kerry to get Clinton out of the state department .
Dr Carson , how would you deal with North Korea ?
â€œPeople say I whine a lot because I donâ€ ™ t get enough time .
Iâ€ ™ m going to whine
, â€ � says Carson .
â€œBecause
I didnâ€
™ t get asked about taxes .
I didnâ€ ™ t get asked about Israel.â€ �
Wolf tells Carson to go for it .
â€œThis is your time.â€ �
Carson says the IRS â€œis not honest and we need to get rid of them.â€ �
Carson says he went to Israel a couple months ago and talked to a lot of people and none of them did not think that the United States had not turned its back on Israel .
Carson says Kim Jong - Un is unstable but understands strength and that the United States should strengthen regional alliances and develop a strategic defense initiative .
Kasich is back to North Korea .
Heâ€
™ s asked whether he would assassinate Kim Jong - Un .
He says Chinese intervention is needed in North Korea .
â€œYou look for any measure you can to be able to solve the problem , â€ � Kasich says .
But would he risk war for regime change ?
â€œIf there was an opportunity to remove the leader of North Korea , and create stability ... but Iâ€ ™ m also aware of the fact that there are 10 m people in Seoul ... perhaps the Chinese can accomplish that working with this man who is now the leader , â€ � Kasich says .
Trump gets the North Korea question and he starts talking about defending Japan â€œfor peanuts.â€ � Kasich is up .
He seems to get dinged almost immediately , after a jag he takes into North Korea policy .
Rubio is up .
He accuses Trump of taking an â€œanti - Israel position.â€
�
He says you canâ€ ™ t be an honest broker when â€œone side acts in bad faith.â€ �
Then Rubio and Trump get in another slapfight , with a pretty good line from Rubio about the Palestinians not being a real estate deal .
â€œA deal between Israel and the Palestinians , given the current makeup of the Palestinians , is not possible , â€ � Rubio says .
â€œI will be on Israelâ€ ™ s side every day.â€ �
Trump : Iâ€ ™ m a negotiator .
I have done very well over the years .
Rubio :
The Palestinians are not a real estate deal .
Trump :
A deal is a deal .
Rubio : Not dealing with terrorists .
Have you ever dealt with terrorists ?
Trump : You will never bring peace .
Theyâ€ ™ re back !
Question for Trump .
You said you wanted to be â€œneutralâ€
� in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
How can that be when Israel is Americaâ€ ™ s closest ally in the Middle East ?
â€œAs president there is nothing that I would rather do than to bring peace to Israel and itâ€ ™ s neighbors generally , â€ �
Trump says .
â€œIt doesnâ€
™ t help if I start saying â€
“
I am very pro - Israel ..
but it doesnâ€ ™ t do anything to start demeaning the neighbors.â€ � â€œWith that being said , I am totally pro - Israel.â€ � Cruz : â€œThis is another area in which Donald agrees with Hillary Clinton ...
If Iâ€ ™ m president , America will stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel ...
it is not equivalent.â€ �
Trump continues to imagine brokering a Middle East peace as president : â€œIf I could bring peace , that would be a fantastic thing , it would be one of my greatest achievements as president.â€
�
OK folks , commercial break after only one hour .
Whoâ€ ™ s winning ?
Tell us in the comments ?
Trump is comparing his poll numbers with Cruz : â€œA poll just came out in Bloomberg where Iâ€ ™ m beating him so badly ,
Iâ€ ™ m embarrassed.â€ � â€œHillary Clinton , take a look at USA Today ...
I beat her and I beat her badly ... and I havenâ€ ™ t even started with her ...
â€ �
Trump said he mixed it up with her a few weeks ago when her camp accused him of being sexist , â€œand believe me , they had a rough weekend that weekend ,
between Bill and Hillary , they had a rough weekend.â€ � Cruz then jumps in and accuses Trump of being a past Clinton admirer .
â€œOn substance , how do we nominate a candidate who said Hillary Clinton was the best secretary of state of modern times?â€ � Cruz asks .
Cruz says Trump â€œcanâ€ ™ t take it to [ Clinton ] and beat her on the debate stage and the polls.â€ � Trumpâ€ ™ s reply is sharp and is cheered loudly : â€œIf
I canâ€
™ t beat her youâ€ ™ re really going to get killed wonâ€ ™ t you
, â€ � he says .
Then Trump pats Rubio and Cruz on the head
: I know youâ€ ™ re embarrassed , I know youâ€ ™ re embarrassed .
Keep fighting keep swinging .
Swing for the fences .
Swing for the fences .
Trump is asked about Mitt Romneyâ€ ™ s assertion that there is a â€œbombshellâ€ � in Trumpâ€ ™ s taxes , pertaining perhaps to his wealth or charitable giving being smaller than he makes out .
â€œI was the first one to file a financial disclosure form ...
You donâ€ ™ t learn anything about someoneâ€ ™ s wealth from a tax return ....
people were shocked , â€ �
Trump says .
â€œI will say this .
Mitt Romney looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed , and Harry Reid baited him so beautifullyâ€ � on releasing his tax returns .
â€œAs far as my return , I want to file them .
Except for ... I will absolutely give my returns but Iâ€ ™ m being audited now for two or three years .
So I canâ€ ™ tâ€ � turn over the returns until the audit is through .
Trump is pressed by a moderator .
â€œI want to release my tax returns , but I canâ€ ™ t release them if Iâ€ ™ m under an audit , â€ �
Trump says .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re under a routine audit .
As soon as the audit is doneâ€ � Iâ€ ™ ll release them .
Question goes to Rubio .
When will you release your returns ?
He answers simply : â€œTomorrow or Saturday ... and luckily Iâ€ ™ m not being audited this year , or last year.â€ � Cruz then hits Trump over his admission that heâ€ ™ s being audited .
â€œDonald says heâ€ ™ s being audited .
Well I would think that would underscore the need to see those returns.â€
�
Twitter metrics , via Twitter .
Looks like the polls in Florida .
Wow that image renders tinily .
Hereâ€ ™ s what it says .
The share of the Twitter conversation thus far is split like so :
Trump 51 % Rubio 23 % Cruz 14 % Carson 7 % Kasich 5 % Cruz insists on answering the Obamacare question and uses it to bludgeon Trump .
He says that Trump likes Planned Parenthood , while he would investigate it and prosecute any infractions .
Cruz then accuses Trump of â€œadvocating socialized medicine : â€ � Donald wants to end it because he says that it doesnâ€ ™ t nearly go far enough . ...
For decades Donald has been advocating socialized medicine ...
If youâ€ ™ re a small business owners , Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s socialized health care will kill more jobs than Obamacare .
Cruz to Trump : â€œTrue or false
: you said the government should pay for everyoneâ€ ™ s health care.â€ �
Trump says â€œfalseâ€ � .
Then Cruz brings up a line from a couple debates ago , in which Trump said he would not let people â€œdie on the sidewalk.â€ �
Trump stands by his position : â€œI will not let people die on the streets if Iâ€ ™ m president.â€ �
Then Trump manages a moment of humanity , which strangely under the force of Cruzâ€
™ s cross - examination feels like some kind of moment of grace :
Let me talk .
Weâ€
™ re going to have private health care .
I am not going to let people die on the streets or the sidewalks of this country , if I am president .
You might be fine with it .
Iâ€ ™ m not fine with it .
Who is doing best so far ?
Jeb Lund thinks Marco Rubio is putting on a good performance â€ “ but should stop laughing at his own jokes Marco Rubio is doing very well .
He hit Trump smartly on apt points , and he even had a good punchline .
Cruz isnâ€ ™ t doing as well as Rubio , which should probably be alarming for Cruz supporters , because heâ€ ™ s the one who should be tap - dancing around everyone on stage .
Kasich seems pleased to talk when people remember him and just as pleased to watch when no one does .
Ben Carson was let out by the roadside to run free through a meadow as mom and dad peeled off in the car .
That said , itâ€ ™ s a foolâ€ ™ s game to think that the normal rules of debates apply here .
Rubioâ€ ™ s shots on Trump and his one - liner would have been body blows to any candidate who was running as a candidate .
But Trump is still Trump , a personality rather than a candidacy , fame rather than a campaign .
And ultimately everything Rubio just said probably isnâ€ ™ t going to matter to anyone leaning toward Trump .
Yeah , sure , Trump employed immigrants .
But Iâ€ ™ m a Trump supporter , and I like Trump , thatâ€ ™ s just a canny move .
He saved money !
He knew the game was rigged , and he played it .
He got sued â€
”
so what ?
Heâ€
™ s a famous rich guy , they get sued all the time .
Trumpâ€ ™
s playing a different game , which is scored differently among the fanbase .
When he owns someone , it rules .
When people bite back , itâ€ ™ s annoying .
If they bite back too much , theyâ€ ™ re desperate .
( Also , for as many good lines as Rubioâ€ ™ s getting in on him tonight , Rubio is clearly enjoying them the most of all , which is just bad form .
Donâ€ ™ t enjoy your joke more than I can , man .
Thatâ€ ™ s amateur hour .
Act like youâ€ ™ re not stunned that this is the first time your brain thought of something clever . )
On top of that , these guys are trying to work Trump , and
heâ€ ™ s working the room .
Thereâ€ ™ s something kind of final about the way that he can turn to them and engage , then turn to the moderators and the room and act as if theyâ€ ™ ve vanished .
At some point , he remembers that the other two donâ€ ™ t actually matter , and it shows .
Next up : the Affordable Care Act .
Rubio accuses Trump of liking the individual mandate in the law , which requires people to carry health insurance .
Rubio reels into his own castle - in - the - clouds plan for repealing and replacing Obamacare .
He says the law is not only bad for health care , itâ€ ™ s a â€œjob - killing law.â€ �
Trump says he would throw out Obamacare ... but keep requirements that insurers cover pre - existing conditions .
â€œI agree with that 100 % except pre - existing conditions , â€ �
Trump says .
â€œI want to keep pre - existing condition .
I think we need it
I think itâ€ ™ s the modern age
and I think we have to have it.â€
�
Then he says â€œthe insurance companies are making a fortune with every thing they do.â€
�
He doesnâ€ ™ t mention medical products manufacturers and drug companies , who are making the bigger fortunes .
â€œI know the insurance companies , theyâ€ ™ re friends of mine .
One of them is in the audience , he was just waving to me , he was just laughing â€
“ heâ€
™ s not laughing so much anymore .
Hi.â€
�
Trump says he would erase the lines between states , meaning set up national interstate competition in the insurance market .
Then Rubio mounts the most effective attack of the night so far at Trump .
â€œYou may not be aware of this Donald , because you donâ€ ™ t follow this stuff very closely , but hereâ€ ™ s what happened , â€ � Rubio says .
He says Obamacare included a bailout for insurance companies who couldnâ€ ™ t sustain the initial costs of the new law .
â€œWhat is your plan?â€ � Rubio challenges Trump .
Erase the lines ?
Trump accuses Rubio of not knowing about state markets : â€œThe biggest problem heâ€ ™ s got is he really doesnâ€
™ t know about the lines .
I watched him melt down two weeks ago with Chris Christie.â€
�
Rubio persists : â€œYour only thing is to get rid of the lines around the states .
What else is your plan?â€ �
Trump : â€œyouâ€ ™ ll get rid of the lines ...
â€ �
Rubio :
So thatâ€ ™ s the only part of the plan ?
Just the lines ?
Trump :
Youâ€ ™ ll have many different plans .
Youâ€ ™ ll have competition .
Itâ€ ™ ll be beautiful .
Rubio :
Now heâ€ ™ s repeating himself !
Trump : I watched him repeat himself five time two weeks ago !
Rubio : I watched him repeat himself five times five second ago !
Rubio :
He says five things .
Everyonâ€ ™ es dumb .
Heâ€ ™ s gon na make America great again , werâ€
™
e gon na win win win , and the lines around the states .
Moderator Dana Bash :
Mr Trump , anything to add ?
Trump :
No !
Thereâ€ ™ s nothing to add .
What is to add ?
What is to add ?
Trump just appeared not to have a health care reform plan any deeper than â€œweâ€ ™ ll create competition and itâ€ ™ ll be beautiful.â€ � Ding .
Ding .
Ding .
Republicans , at least Marco Rubio , finally figured out how to go after Donald Trump .
Rather than tagging him as a New York City liberal , you go after his supposed strengths .
You say he is phoney on issues , not much of a businessman and hardly a friend of the common man .
And you press the issue machine - gun style , over and over and get under his skin .
Rubio did that when he accused him of hiring undocumented immigrants for his Trump University .
Even Cruz jumped , forming a brief alliance with Rubio .
Perhaps for the first time during these debates , Trump looked rattled , even petulant .
Weâ€ ™ ll see if Rubio and Cruz can keep it up during the rest of this debate and coming weeks .
Rubioâ€ ™ s claim that the GOP is â€œthe party of diversityâ€ � only proves the hollowness of â€œdiversityâ€ � .
Yes , there are two candidates of Latino descent in the race , and Ben Carson .
But painting the face of a racist system a different color does not stop its racist operations .
This is , after all , the party whose front - runner paints an entire country as rapists and who whipped - up racialized fears during the Central Park 5 case .
For voters who care about diversity , more representation will do nothing to undo the damage wreaked by Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s harmful comments .
Kasich answers a question and Carson answers a question .
They feel like a sideshow to this : Anybody remember the movie ?
Who wins this fight ?
Rubio says he doubts that Trump would appoint a real conservative to the Supreme Court .
Trump invokes Reagan to say that itâ€ ™ s OK to evolve .
Trump doesnâ€ ™ t admit that he personally has evolved on issues such as abortion .
But then he rather daringly slides into a measured defense of Planned Parenthood : Millions of millions of women , cervical cancer , breast cancer , are helped by Planned Parenthood ...
I would defund it because Iâ€ ™ m pro - life .
But millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood .
Trump is asked whether â€œreligious libertyâ€ � would be a litmus test for â€œall court employees.â€ �
He opts to hit Cruz over a vote in favor of the nomination of John Roberts .
â€œJustice Roberts was strongly recommended and pushed by Ted .
Justice Roberts gave us Obamacare .
It might as well be called Robertscare , â€ � says Cruz .
â€œThat is a rough thing , and I know Ted probably feels badly about it ... but that judge has been a disaster in terms of everything we stand for ...
Ted very very strongly pushed Justice Roberts.â€ �
Cruz replies : â€œYes itâ€ ™ s true , I supported the Republican nominee once it was made.â€ �
Then he opts to list all the Democrats that Trump has given money to over the year .
He accuses Trump of being willing to â€œcut a dealâ€ � on the Supreme Court instead of taking a stand .
â€œLet me tell you Donald , I will not apologize for a minute over ... defending the Bill of Rights , â€ � Cruz says .
Rubio is taking a break for a moment while Cruz beats up on Trump .
They are tag - teaming .
Supreme Court question for Cruz .
Pitching to his sweet spot .
Cruz basically says that if a Democrat is elected president Americans will lose all their guns and their god and cats and dogs etc .
â€œFor voters who care about life , or marriage , or religious liberty or the second amendment
... I give you my word ,
every justice I nominate will vigorously defend the Bill of Rights for my children and for yours.â€ � Applause .
Carson â€ “ who is indeed sporting a nontraditional elegant striped tie â€
“ takes a question about whether he thinks GOP rhetoric alienates Latino voters .
Carson calls for â€œliberty and justiceâ€ � for all .
He said that before too .
He says that ending dependence and creating opportunity will help everybody .
ArrarÃ¡s goes back to Trump .
â€œA brand new Telemundo poll says that 3 of 4 Hispanics nationwide have a negative opinion of you.â€ �
Trump : â€œFirst of all
, I donâ€ ™ t believe a thing Telemundo says.â€
� Funny and gets laughs .
Then Trump : I currently employ thousands of Hispanics , and over the years I have employed tens of thousands of Hispanics .
Theyâ€ ™ re incredible people .
Then he starts talking about his crushing Nevada win , including among Hispanics .
ArrarÃ¡s persists .
A Washington Post poll showed 80 % of voters have a negative opinion of you .
Trump tries to interrupt her .
â€œLet me finish , â€ � she says .
She insists that Hispanic voters are leery of Trump .
He denies it .
â€œIâ€
™ m just telling you , Iâ€ ™ m doing very well with Hispanics .
And as you know , I settled my suit with Univision ...
weâ€
™ re good friends now ...
I will do really well
Hispanics.â€ �
He fought with Univision over airing a beauty pageant .
ArrarÃ¡s asks Kasich about whether the Republican party does not need to widen its aperture on immigration .
â€œWell , Iâ€ ™ m not gon na talk about that , â€ � he says , uncharmingly .
Then he makes the same argument Cruz did .
If you create economic growth , everything follows .
Kasich has an addendum : â€œWe have to create the sense that everyone can rise.â€ �
Cruz did not mention that part .
Kasich concludes : â€œWith me and the Hispanic community , I think they like me , and I appreciate that.â€ �
ArrarÃ¡s says
thereâ€
™ s a perception
that Cruz and Rubio are â€œmissing a huge opportunity to expand the Republican baseâ€ � by taking a hard line on immigration instead of talking to Latino constituencies .
Cruz says it is amazing that two of the five onstage are the children of Cuban immigrants .
Then he trashes the media which he says has constructed a myth that if youâ€ ™ re Hispanic you have to be liberal .
Cruz argues that â€œthe Obama economyâ€ � has hurt â€œthe Hispanic communityâ€ � the most and that he would help , in short , by creating economic growth .
Rubio points out that in addition to the immigrant sons onstage there is an African American .
â€œWe are the party of diversity , not the Democratic party , â€ �
Rubio says .
Applause .
Trump is silent .
Rubio is winning applause .
Telemundoâ€ ™ MarÃ­a Celeste ArrarÃ¡s goes into the weeds with Rubio on his policy for DREAmers , undocumented migrants who arrived as children to the United States .
Rubio unspools a fluent answer claiming absolute consistency .
Trump jumps in rather lamely : He lied .
He lied .
100 % Rubio smiles and returns fire : You lied to the Polish workers .
You lied to the students of Trump University .
Trump mumbles something about that being the past .
â€œYou lied to them eight years ago , â€ � says Rubio .
â€œI guess
thereâ€
™ s a statute of limitations on lies?â€
�
The crowd likes that line .
To Trump : You want to build a wall .
But Mexican leaders say that will never happen .
In fact Vicente Fox said , Quote : â€œIâ€ ™ m not going to pay for that quote , effing wall.â€
�
How will Trump get Mexico to pay ?
Trump : â€œI will .
And that wall just got 10 feet taller.â€ �
Then Trump objects to Foxâ€ ™ s profanity :
â€œI tell you , if I would have used even half of that word , â€ � it wouldâ€ ™ ve been a scandal .
â€œThis guy used a filthy disgusting word on TV , and he should be ashamed of himself and he should apologize.â€ �
Trump says the wall would be 1,000 miles long and cost $ 10bn-$12bn and â€œitâ€ ™ s a real wall.â€ � â€œMexico will pay for it because they are not doing us any favors.â€
�
Then Rubio cuts loose with a highly prepped slam : If he builds the wall the way he builds Mar - a - Lago heâ€ ™ ll be using illegal workers to do it .
Your ties and clothes he made are made in Mexico and China .
Make them in America !
Trump :
â€œYou donâ€ ™ t know a think about business .
You donâ€ ™ t know anything about it.â€ � Rubio back with a hit : â€œI donâ€ ™ t know anything about bankrupting companies either.â€ �
Then he hits Trump over lawsuits against a university that used to bear his name .
Rubio is unloading the oppo arsenal onstage .
Trump is wound up .
â€œHereâ€ ™ s a guy that buys a house for $ 179,000
, he sells it for $ 380,000 to a lobbyist , probably whoâ€ ™ s here!â€ �
Rubio is not letting up :
â€œHereâ€ ™ s a guy that inherited $ 200m!â€ � Update : inre Donald and the F word : Now to Kasich .
He starts by pointing out the elder Bushâ€ ™ s presence in the audience .
He holds up the Bush era as a time when the parties could work together , in tacit contrast with what weâ€ ™ re witnessing onstage .
Then Kasich says he would take care of immigration reform first thing as president .
Carson is asked about his beliefs on immigration .
He says â€œI believe in liberty and justice for all.â€ �
Then he warns terrorists are trying to cross the border .
Then he calls for boosting the Mexican economy .
He mentions China too .
Cruz says he finds it funny that Trump pretends he invented the immigration issue .
He says when he was fighting the Gang of 8 immigration reform proposal , â€œWhere was Donald ?
He was firing Dennis Rodman on Celebrity
Apprentice.â€ �
Laugh line .
Then Trump hits Cruz for being unpopular .
â€œNobody likes you.â€ �
Trump : â€œI get along with everybody .
You get along with none of them ...
you donâ€
™ t have one Republican senator backing you , and you work with these people ...
you should be ashamed of yourself.â€ �
Cruz flips the attack .
â€œDonald , if you want to be liked in Washington , thatâ€ ™ s not a good attribute for president ,
â€ � he says .
He also hits Trump for hiring foreigners .
â€œAnyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldnâ€ ™ t be hiring illegal immigrants , â€ � Cruz says .
Trump hits back at Cruz , calling him duplicitous for leaving a 2012 loan from Goldman Sachs after financial disclosure forms .
Rubio says that he would secure the border â€œbefore we doing anything on immigration.â€ �
Then he turns to Trump : â€œa lot of these positions that heâ€ ™ s now taking are new to him.â€ �
He mentions a 2011 Trump position in favor of a path to citizenship and the fact that Trump criticized 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney for talking about â€œself - deportation.â€ � Rubio goes straight to the attack .
He then picks up on a New York Times report that Trump hired foreign workers on immigration visas instead of Americans at a Florida resort .
Trump defends himself : â€œAs far as the people that Iâ€ ™ ve hired ... during the absolute prime season ...
you could not get help , itâ€ ™ s the up season ...
everybody agrees with me on that .
They were part - time jobs .. because you couldnâ€ ™ t get help in that hot , hot section of Florida.â€ �
Then Trump defends his criticism of Mitt Romney : â€œHe shouldâ€ ™ ve won that election ...
he ran a terrible campaign , he was a terrible candidate , thatâ€ ™ s an election that shouldâ€ ™ ve been won.â€ � Applause .
But Rubio will not let him go : â€œYou did criticize him for using the term â€œself - deportation.â€ �
Then Rubio says , â€œyouâ€ ™ re the only one on this stage for hiring people to work illegally.â€ �
Trump has a great comeback : â€œIâ€ ™ m the only one on this stage
whoâ€ ™ s hired people.â€ �
Rubio keeps after Trump , accusing him of hiring workers from Poland .
He tells the audience to Google it .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve hired tens of thousands of people ,
â€ �
Trump says .
â€œMany from other countries , â€ � Rubio says .
Sizzling !
Cruz gets the Q.
He says â€œthe people who get forgotten in this debateâ€ � are the millions of â€œlegalâ€ � immigrants who are losing their jobs â€ “ because , he implies , of undocumented workers .
Cruz says letâ€ ™ s fight for legal immigrants instead of ones â€œwho break the law.â€ �
He says heâ€ ™ s led the fight against granting citizenship to undocumented migrants .
Then Trump brags about Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona endorsing him .
Thereâ€ ™ s some applause .
Some Trump fans in this crowd .
First Q is about immigration .
For Trump .
You want to remove 11 m undocumented migrants from the USA .
But in your words â€œthe good onesâ€ � can come back in .
Cruz wouldnâ€ ™ t allow that and calls your plan â€œamnesty.â€ �
Is it ?
â€œHe was in charge of amnesty , he was the leader , and you can ask Marco , â€ � too , Trump says .
Trump says the only reason itâ€ ™ s even an issue is because he brought it up .
â€œWe either have a country or we donâ€ ™ t have a country.â€ � Ben Carson : America is â€œheading off the abyss of destruction.â€ � A call for civility :
â€œMarco , Donald , Ted , John :
We will not solve any of these problems by trying to destroy each other ...
Itâ€ ™ s not about us.â€ �
John Kasich :
My grandfather was a coal miner and my grandmother was an immigrant .
For viewers : You can do whatever you want to do in your life .
America is an amazing country .
Shoot for the stars .
Americaâ€ ™ s great and you can do it .
Marco Rubio : We have to decide the identity of America in the 21st century .
Ronald Reagan .
Conservatism .
Hopes and dreams .
Are we still that kind of party or one who â€œpreys on peopleâ€ ™ s anger and fears?â€
� Applause .
Ted Cruz : Welcome to Texas .
[ Applause . ]
I grew up here .
I graduated from high school here .
I am a senator from here .
Democrats tell me I didnâ€
™ t vote for you , but youâ€ ™ re doing what you said you would do .

Donald Trump :

One last bit of news - of - day before the debate begins
: On Thursday , a group of New York political and civil rights operatives announced the launch of a new political action committee focused on African American voters , writes the Guardianâ€ ™ s Mahita Gajanan :
Worried that the 2016 election will see a low turnout of black voters , the activists formed the Black Votes Matter PAC to maximize black voter turnout in battleground states like Florida , Ohio , Pennsylvania , North Carolina and Virginia , the committee announced on Thursday .
The Black Votes Matter PAC will be run by Charlie King , who ran the New York state democratic party for Governor Andrew Cuomo and headed the reelection effort of Congressman Charlie Rangel .
â€œMany of the issues that Governor Cuomo and Assembly Speaker Heastie are fighting for here in New York are the issues that matter in Black communities across the country : a special prosecutor when police kill an unarmed individual ; criminal justice reform ; $ 15 minimum wage ; real growth opportunities for Black owned businesses ; meaningful education initiatives and paid family leave , â€ �
King said in a statement .
â€œWe will keep these issues on the front burner and make sure the candidates do too.â€ �
Hereâ€ ™ s a sampler of our politics coverage so far today :

Super Tuesday primary contests , Donald Trump is being confronted with resurfaced allegations that he sexually assaulted and tried to rape a woman in the early 1990s , reports the Guardianâ€ ™ s Jon Swaine :
The woman alleged in a federal lawsuit in 1997 that Trump violated her â€œphysical and mental integrityâ€
� when he touched her intimately without consent after her boyfriend went into business with him , leaving her â€œemotionally devastated [ and ] distraughtâ€ � .
The woman , whom the Guardian is not naming , dropped the $ 125 m lawsuit in Manhattan the following month .
It coincided with a separate legal dispute between Trump and the womanâ€ ™ s then - boyfriend over an alleged breach of contract relating to their beauty pageant business venture .
Trump claimed at the time that the lawsuit alleging assault was aimed at pressuring him to settle the other dispute , which reportedly he did for a six - figure sum later that year .
On Wednesday , Trumpâ€ ™ s counsel Michael Cohen told a reporter for Mail Online that there was â€œno truthâ€ � to the lawsuitâ€ ™ s allegations .
â€œThe plaintiff in the matter ... would acknowledge the same , â€ � Cohen was quoted as saying .
Yet when asked by the Guardian whether she stood by the allegations detailed in the lawsuit , the woman said in a text message :
â€œYes.â€ � The woman , now a successful makeup artist in New York , declined to discuss the allegations in detail .

: The Guardianâ€ ™ s Tom Dart reports from a protest outside the debate venue at the University of Houston :
As smartly - dressed guests headed for the debate venue , several hundred protestors massed then marched along the edge of the security perimeter at the University of Houston campus , agitating for a variety of causes , among them Black Lives Matter , pro - immigration , anti - Trump and anti - Cruz .
Dozens were with Fight for $ 15 , calling for a $ 15 minimum wage .
GOP contenders including Donald Trump , Ben Carson and Marco Rubio rejected the idea of raising the minimum when the issue came up at last Novemberâ€ ™ s debate in Milwaukee , while Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have proposed an increase .
â€œItâ€ ™ s something that we need
, we have families that are struggling , â€ � said a demonstrator , Carlton , who works at a burger restaurant and goes to college while trying to take care of his three - year - old son by himself .
Another fast - food worker , Janice , 47 , said that she earns $ 8 an hour .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s no way a human can live off that , â€ � she said .
She lives with five children , and a granddaughter she looks after , in a studio apartment .
â€œItâ€ ™ s real hard , â€ � she said .
â€œPrices go up and still my wage doesnâ€ ™ t go upâ€
¦ Everyone lives in one room .
Thatâ€ ™ s what $ 8 is doing for me right now.â€
�
She had no strong opinions about the politicians who were soon to take the stage a couple of hundred metres away - while they indulge in rhetoric , her focus is on practical and immediate matters .
â€œIâ€ ™ m trying to get a roof over my head
, â€ � she said .
Googleâ€ ™ s at the Houston debate and theyâ€ ™ ve produced a 360-degree view of what the room looks like from Trumpâ€ ™ s podium : It seems like it would be hard to think in there ?
So loudly colorful and lights and purple seats and too many shapes
â€ “ and this is without Wolf Blitzer .
The debate isnâ€ ™ t scheduled to start for more than an hour , and if it starts on time thatâ€ ™ ll be a first .
So letâ€ ™ s detour for a moment to Vermont senator Bernie Sanderâ€

The Guardianâ€ ™ s
Ryan Felton reports : Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders called the lead contamination crisis in Flint , Michigan , â€œone of the more serious public health crises in the modern history of this countryâ€
� as he addressed community members in his first visit to the city .
With the Michigan presidential primary looming on 8 March , Sanders addressed a crowd of some 300 residents in a church , saying he hoped that â€œout of the tragedyâ€ � would come â€œfundamental changes in public policy.â€ � â€œIn Flint , the situation may be more extreme , but all over this country , our infrastructure is crumbling ,
â€ �
Sanders told a majority - white crowd .
The Vermont senator said he has proposed a $ 1 trillion infrastructure program that aims to â€œprovide safe drinking waterâ€ � and create â€œmillions of decent paying jobs.â€ � â€œIt is my hope that the American people will look at Flint and say never again , â€ � he said .
In answer to one question , he renewed his call for Michigan governor Rick Snyder to resign .
â€œThe dereliction of this community has been so extraordinary , that I think in good conscious he should resign , â€ � he said .
Snyder , a Republican , has rebuffed calls to step down .
At the close of the event , Sanders said the US has to help â€œrebuild Flintâ€ � and â€œget our priorities right.â€ � Hello and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the 10th Republican presidential debate in the 2016 race for the White House .

Trump has won the last three state contests running away , and itâ€ ™ s hard to find an upcoming state where he looks vulnerable .

Why : pick a GOP nominee"
2016-02-26,"Marco Rubio took the fight to Donald Trump on Thursday night .
With assistance from Ted Cruz , the Florida senator unleashed an attack on Trumpâ€ ™ s business record and policy acumen that has the potential to shake up the Republican presidential race .
Trump , who has emerged as the Republican frontrunner with remarkably little vetting , was consistently attacked for employing foreign and illegal workers , for his business record and for his lack of policy specifics .
The debate , five days before the critical Super Tuesday primaries when voters in 12 states will cast their verdict on the Republican field , descended into a series of personal attacks and bad - tempered exchanges .
At times , the candidates shouted over each other .
Rubio gleefully mocked Trump , saying â€œYou say the same thing every night , â€ � and even gave his own parody of Trumpâ€ ™ s stump speech : â€œEveryoneâ€ ™ s dumb , Iâ€ ™ m going to make America great again , Iâ€ ™ m winning in the polls , lines around the states ,
every night.â€ �
It was the first time rival candidates have used a debate stage to go after the foundation of Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign â€ “ his experience as a businessman , his assertion that he is the only candidate who can be relied upon to be a stalwart opponent of illegal immigration , and his fundamental belief in â€œwinningâ€ � .
It left Trump stuttering and defensive .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t repeat myself , â€ �
he said , as he struggled through another tough exchange with Rubio .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t repeat myself .
I donâ€
™ t repeat myself.â€
�
The concerted attacks and Trumpâ€ ™ s counterpunching left John Kasich and Ben Carson as relative bystanders .
At one point , Carson pleaded : â€œCan somebody attack me?â€ �
Trump has built a populist movement of discontented blue collar voters very different from the fiscally and socially conservative coalition George W Bush once relied on .
As he said onstage : â€œWe are building a new Republican party .
A lot of new people are coming in.â€
�
But on Thursday his rivals tried to discredit him with those voters and consolidate their own appeal among Republicans who disdain Trump .
Rubio used immigration as a cudgel .
The first question , from CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer , was on Trumpâ€ ™ s plan to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants but to let â€œthe good onesâ€ � back in .
Rubio seized the opportunity .
â€œThe truth is , though , that a lot of these positions that heâ€ ™ s now taking are new to him , â€ �
he said .
He referred to a New York Times story on Thursday that claimed that Trumpâ€ ™ s exclusive club in Palm Beach , Florida , has pursued more than 500 temporary foreign worker visas since 2010 and hired only a handful of US residents .
â€œWe saw a report in one of the newspapers that Donald , youâ€ ™ ve hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that Americans could have filled , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œMy mom and dad â€
“
my mom was a maid at a hotel , and instead of hiring an American like her , you have brought in over a thousand people from all over the world to fill those jobs instead.â€ �
Trump said this was because of a lack of available American workers .
â€œThey were part - time jobs , â€ � he said .
â€œYou needed them , or we just might as well close the doors , because you couldnâ€ ™ t get help in those hot , hot sections of Florida.â€ � Rubio then mentioned reports claiming that undocumented immigrants have worked at Trump properties .
In the 1980s Trump faced a lawsuit alleging that undocumented Polish demolition workers worked on Trump Tower in Manhattan .
The suit was not settled until 1999 , and the settlement never made public .
A 2015 Washington Post story suggested undocumented workers could have been involved in building a new luxury hotel in the city .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re the only person on this stage that has ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally .
You hired some workers from Poland , â€ � Rubio said , adding that Trump was forced to pay â€œa million dollars or soâ€
� in a judgment .
Trump said this was â€œtotally wrongâ€ � and hit back : â€œIâ€ ™ m the only one on the stage thatâ€ ™ s hired people .
You havenâ€ ™ t hired anybody.â€ � â€œIf he builds the [ border ] wall the way he built Trump Towers heâ€ ™ ll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve hired tens of thousands of people ,
â€ �
Trump said .
â€œHe brings up something from 30 years ago .
It worked out very well .
Everybody was happy.â€ �
Cruz attacked Trump as a Johnny Come Lately .
â€œI really find it amazing that Donald believes that he is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration ,
â€ � the senator said .
â€œI can tell you , when I ran for Senate here in the state of Texas , I ran promising to lead the fight against amnesty , promising to fight to build a wall .
â€œAnd in 2013 , when I was fighting against the â€˜gang of eightâ€ ™ amnesty bill , where was Donald ?
He was firing Dennis Rodman on Celebrity
Apprentice.â€ �
Rubio also repeatedly hit Trump on Trump University , a for - profit enterprise that promised to teach attendees about the real - estate world .
Trump is facing several lawsuits in federal court from unhappy customers of what Rubio said was â€œa fake universityâ€ � .
The attack was echoed by Cruz , who referenced one coming case , warning that Trumpâ€ ™ s â€œlawyers have scheduled the trial for Julyâ€ � and saying the mainstream media would make hay if â€œthe Republican nominee [ was ] in court on the stand being cross - examined about whether he has committed fraudâ€ � .
Trump claimed the allegations in the case were â€œnonsenseâ€ � and insisted that he had only refused to settle it out of principle .
Rubio jibed : â€œYou know where Donald Trump would be if he hadnâ€
™ t inherited $ 200 m ?
Selling watches in Manhattan.â€ �
Trump was also left staggering after an assault from Rubio on his healthcare plan .
In response , Trump insisted he would â€œget rid of the lines around statesâ€ � , without providing further detail , and resorted to bringing up Rubioâ€ ™ s implosion in the New Hampshire debate against Chris Christie as a defense .
â€œI watched him repeat himself five times four weeks ago , â€ �
Trump insisted .
Rubio fired back : â€œI just watched you repeat yourself five times five seconds ago.â€ �
Trump kept on trying to change the subject to New Hampshire .
Trump was then repeatedly hit on a supposed reluctance to release his tax returns , a subject that 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney â€ “ no stranger to the issue
â€ “ has brought up in recent days .
Cruz and Rubio said they would release their tax returns in the coming days , Rubio saying his were coming Friday or Saturday .
Trump said he could not release his because of an ongoing audit .
â€œEvery year they audit me ,
â€ �
Trump said .
â€œI will absolutely file my returns , but Iâ€ ™ m being audited now for two or three years and I canâ€ ™ t do it until the audit is finished.â€ �
Afterwards , the Rubio and Cruz campaigns both declared victory .
Jason Miller , a top aide to Cruz , told the Guardian the senator â€œjammed up Donald Trumpâ€ � .
He also sarcastically praised Rubio â€œfor eating his Wheaties and getting into the mix for the first timeâ€ � .
Miller felt confident that night was a win for his man .
â€œDonald Trump didnâ€
™ t look presidential tonight and he lost a lot of votes , â€ �
he said before adding , in a reference to the immigration reform effort spearheaded by Rubio in 2013 :
â€œThose votes arenâ€ ™ t going to a member of the gang of eight.â€ � Todd Harris , a top adviser to Rubio , said the Florida senator had met all his goals : â€œThere is a growing anti - Trump movement within the party and our goal tonight was to have Marco emerge as leader of that movement
and I think we succeeded.â€
�
Miller said many of Rubioâ€ ™ s attacks were not based on substantive issues because â€œtrying to wage a battle of substance against Trump is pretty futile effortâ€ � .
â€œAnyone who goes into an attack on Donald Trump by saying heâ€ ™ s not a conservative , â€ � he said , â€œis not going to win that fight because Trump doesnâ€ ™ t pretend to be a conservative.â€
�
The debate was the last one before Super Tuesday , which will produce the largest delegate haul of the GOP candidate selection process .
Texas , with 155 delegates , is the largest of the 12 states that vote on 1 March , which range from conservative southern states such as Alabama and Georgia to liberal outposts in New England such as Vermont and Massachusetts .
Trump has led in recent polls in almost every Super Tuesday state .
The exception is Texas , Cruzâ€ ™ s home state , where the senator has a narrow lead .
Trump leads Rubio in Florida .
Todd Harris , the Rubio aide , said his candidate finally went after Trump only because Jeb Bush had dropped out .
As long as the former Florida governor was running , he said , attacks from his Super Pac â€œmade it hard for us to make case that this was two - person race between us and Donald Trumpâ€ � .
The question now is this : given that the Rubio campaign is already writing off any chance of winning a Super Tuesday state , when will that two - man race come to exist and who will run it ?
As Jason Miller , the Cruz operative , jibed about Rubioâ€ ™ s newfound aggression : â€œMarco has yet to win a state .
Thereâ€ ™ s probably more a sense of desperation and it has to be weighing on him pretty heavily.â€
�
Elsewhere in the spin room , Trump also dismissed Rubio .
â€œI thought he was ineffective , â€ � he said .
â€œI think he was a weak guy .
I thought Ted Cruz did better but
what do I know.â€
�
Rubio , he charged , was a â€œchoke
artistâ€ � .
The tone was familiar ; at times , the debate had descended into little more than a slanging match , candidates speaking angrily over each other .
â€œDonald , you can get back on your meds now , â€ �
Cruz said during one exchange .
â€œIâ€ ™ m relaxed .
Youâ€ ™ re the basket case , â€ �
Trump said .
Carson , speaking to reporters , sought to sum it all up .
â€œItâ€
™ s clear this was all about ratings and fights , â€ � he said .
â€œUnfortunately , the audience didnâ€ ™ t help because when people would fight they would yell
â€˜Yeah !
Yeah!â€ ™
like it was gladiators.â€ �"
2016-02-26,"In the Republican debate in Houston on Thursday night , the candidates trailing in the polls lined up to criticize Donald Trump , the frontrunner on his stance â€ “ and consistency â€ “ on the matter of immigration .
And as in previous debates , the tone of the argument quickly turned nasty .
First , Florida senator Marco Rubio said he would secure the border â€œbefore
we doing anything on immigrationâ€ � .
He then turned to Trump , who has advocated the building of a wall on the southern border and deporting all 11 million undocumented migrants in the US .
â€œA lot of these positions that heâ€ ™ s now taking are new to him , â€ � said Rubio , mentioning a 2011 Trump position in favor of a path to citizenship and the fact that Trump criticized the 2012 Republican nominee , Mitt Romney , for talking about â€œself - deportationâ€ � .
Rubio then picked up on a New York Times report that Trump hired foreign workers on immigration visas instead of Americans at a Florida resort .
â€œAs far as the people that Iâ€ ™ ve hired , â€ � said Trump , â€œduring the absolute prime season â€ ¦
you could not get help , itâ€ ™ s the up season
â€ ¦ everybody agrees with me on that .
They were part - time jobs
â€ ¦ because you couldnâ€ ™ t get help in that hot , hot section of Florida.â€
�
Then Trump defended his criticism of Mitt Romney : â€œHe shouldâ€ ™ ve won that election , â€ �
he said , referring to 2012 .
â€œHe ran a terrible campaign , he was a terrible candidate , thatâ€ ™ s an election that shouldâ€ ™ ve been won.â€
�
But Rubio would not let him go : â€œYou did criticize him for using the term â€˜self - deportationâ€ ™ ,â€ � he said , adding : â€œYouâ€ ™ re the only one on this stage fined for hiring people to work illegally.â€ �
Trump had a comeback : â€œIâ€ ™ m the only one on this stage
whoâ€ ™ s hired people.â€ �
But Rubio kept after him , accusing him of hiring workers from Poland .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve hired tens of thousands of people ,
â€ �
Trump said .
â€œMany from other countries , â€ � Rubio said .
Ted Cruz also joined the attack , saying he found it funny that Trump pretended he invented the immigration issue .
When he , Cruz , was fighting the Gang of Eight immigration reform proposal , the Texas senator said : â€œWhere was Donald ?
He was firing Dennis Rodman on Celebrity
Apprentice.â€ �
In return , Trump hit Cruz for being unpopular .
â€œNobody likes you , â€ � he said .
The issue did not go away for Trump , who found himself under repeated attack ."
2016-02-26,"As his opponents in the Republican debate on Thursday sought to reel in his big polling lead , Donald Trump came under heavy fire .
On domestic policy , after fierce opening exchanges on immigration , one of the key issues on which senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio focused was healthcare .
Rubio went after Trump on policy specifics ; Cruz accused him of supporting socialized medicine for all .
First came a long exchange over the intricacies of plans to repeal Obamacare that descended into characteristic bickering about who repeated himself more .
Amid the bickering , however , Trump said he would throw out Obamacare but keep requirements that insurers cover pre - existing conditions .
This prompted Rubio to unfurl an effective attack line : â€œYou may not be aware of this Donald , because you donâ€ ™ t follow this stuff very closely , but hereâ€ ™ s what happened , â€ � he said â€ “ highlighting Trumpâ€
™ s
general lack of policy detail .
Rubio then said Obamacare included a bailout for insurance companies who couldnâ€ ™ t sustain the initial costs of the new law .
Cruz followed and went for the jugular , accusing Trump of advocating for socialized medicine .
Saying Trump liked the federal womenâ€ ™ s health agency Planned Parenthood , while he would investigate it and prosecute any infractions , Cruz added : â€œDonald wants to end [ Obamacare ] because he says that it doesnâ€ ™ t nearly go far enough .
â€œFor decades Donald has been advocating socialized medicine
â€
¦
If youâ€ ™ re a small business owner , Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s socialized healthcare will kill more jobs than Obamacare.â€ �
Cruz then asked : â€œTrue or false : you said the government should pay for everyoneâ€ ™ s healthcare.â€ �
Trump said : â€œFalseâ€ � .
Then Cruz brought up as an attack a line from a couple of debates ago , in which Trump said he would not let people â€œdie on the sidewalkâ€ � .
Trump stood by his position , saying : â€œI will not let people die on the streets if Iâ€ ™ m president.â€
�
And then , the billionaire managed a moment of humanity , which strangely â€ “ under the force of Cruzâ€
™ s cross - examination â€ “ felt like some kind of moment of grace : â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to have private healthcare .
I am not going to let people die on the streets or the sidewalks of this country , if I am president .
â€œYou might be fine with it , â€ � he said to Cruz .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not fine with it.â€ �"
2016-02-26,"Australian basketball phenom and NBA player Andrew Bogut is keeping his green card close ...
Talk about a Friday news dump , amiright ?
From New Jersey governor Chris Christieâ€ ™ s surprise endorsement of Republican billionaire frontrunner Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential campaign to former candidate Lindsey Graham joking about murdering Texas senator Ted Cruz in a bid to stop the â€œbatshitâ€ � primary from tearing apart the GOP , itâ€ ™ s been a humdinger of a Friday .
Before you drown out the sound of four adult men bickering over one another for 45 seconds straight with your drink of choice - we suggest The Trump - letâ€ ™ s go over the highlights from the campaign trail : Marco Rubio turned up on the Today show to press his argument that Donald Trump is not a logical choice to carry the mantle of American conservatism , calling the billionaire a â€œcon artist.â€ �
â€œWeâ€ ™ re on the verge of someone taking over the conservative movement in the Republican party
whoâ€ ™ s a con artist , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œHe has spent his career sticking it to working Americans.â€
�
The junior senator from Florida later backed up his â€œcon artistâ€ � insult by stating that Trump feared that he would wet his pants on the debate stage .
Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton declared that she â€œlove[s ] having men at my feet , â€ � which would have lead todayâ€ ™ s recap if the day hadnâ€ ™ t been so insane .
New Jersey governor Chris Christie gave Rubio what we call a â€œJersey handshakeâ€ � by endorsing Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential bid , jumping to the front of the queue for potential vice presidential picks should Trump win the partyâ€ ™ s nomination .
Shortly thereafter , living gaffe - machine Paul LePage , the governor of Maine , followed suit .
Not one to hog endorsements , Trump disavowed the support of noted white supremacist and one - time future governor of Louisiana David Duke .
Thatâ€ ™ s it in news from the campaign trail

Until then ...
Unless youâ€ ™ re a citizen of an early - voting state , youâ€ ™ re unlikely to have seen these advertisements in between airings of American Idol , but through the miracle of streaming video , the most important political ads are only a mouse - click away .
Democrats :
Hillary Clintonâ€ ™
s
â€œStandâ€ �
Featuring a voiceover from God Himself
- thatâ€ ™ s Morgan Freeman , to use His mortal name - the ad , called Stand , began running in South Carolina this past weekend .
The 30-second spot focuses on Clintonâ€ ™ s criticism of police brutality , her stance on the Flint , Michigan , water crisis and her work as secretary of state under Barack Obama .
This is the second time the Oscar - winner has provided his voice for a Clinton campaign advertisement , having emphasized her willingness to â€œdo all the good you can , for all the people you can , for as long as you canâ€ � in a spot called All the Good .
Republicans :
John Kasichâ€ ™ s
â€œThe Adult
In the Roomâ€ �
Although lacking in a voiceover from a Hollywood celebrity , Kasichâ€ ™ s ad does make quick and effective use of the most embarrasing - by - proxy moment of last nightâ€ ™ s Republican presidential debate .
When the three top - tier candidates ( plus moderator Wolf Blitzer ) were caught in a high - speed verbal pileup , it highlighted some of the main concerns of moderates within the Republican party : That the aggressive primary was driving the main candidates in a race to the bottom .
This long - ish spot clocks in at a minute and twenty seconds , but effectively highlights Kasichâ€ ™ s term as governor and his ability to get things done - without calling his opponents names .
Hillary Clinton rally :
Pom Poms and Protesters edition
After a performance by the South Carolina State University cheerleaders , an appearance by the schoolsâ€ ™ s mascot and a string of introductions from civil rights luminary congressman James Clyburn and singer - reality star K. Michelle , Hillary Clinton took the stage in Orangeburg , South Carolina .
But what was meant to be a rousing pep rally before South Carolina Democrats head to the polls on Saturday was distracted by two protesters .
One man held a sign that read â€œWe came here to heal , not to be brought to heel , â€ � a reference to comments that she made in the 90s referring to young gang members as â€œsuper predatorsâ€ � .
A supporter jumped in front of the man as he held his sign .
The man was eventually escorted out of the gymnasium .
Clinton was previously interrupted at a fundraiser in Charleston by a Black Lives Matter protester who raised those questions .
Serial protester Rod Webber , known as the Flower Man because he likes to hand candidates â€œflowers for peace , â€ � also interrupted Clinton while he recorded her with his videocamera .
He told reporters , who immediately surrounded him , that Clinton is â€œnot the candidate for black peopleâ€ � .
Despite the interruptions , most people in the room continued to pay attention to Clintonâ€ ™ s speech .
Tyler Prieston , a recent graduate of the university and aspiring trainer , said he came to the rally undecided between Clinton and her rival , Vermont senator Bernie Sanders , but was convinced after listening to her speak .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re fighting for the same things , â€ �
he said .
â€œBut I think sheâ€ ™ ll win in the end.â€ � Priestonâ€ ™ s major concerns this election are college affordability and education .
After four years of college , he said is more than $ 50,000 in debt and will have to begin paying it back in four months .
And it doesnâ€ ™ t help that his parents were major supporters of Bill Clinton .
â€œI guess that kind of influences me , â€ � he said .
â€œBut I think sheâ€ ™ ll be her own president.â€ �
The Townsend , a high - end cocktail bar in Austin , Texas , has a primary - themed drink menu this weekend in celebration of the Lone Star Stateâ€ ™ s Republican primary on Super Tuesday : Weâ€ ™ re partial to the Trump .
Donald Trump isnâ€ ™ t the only candidate earning endorsements today - Vermont senator Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ campaign office was visited by Russian feminist punk rock protest group Pussy Riot this afternoon , where the group applauded the candidate and â€œwhat u stands for!â€ � Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s rhetoric about migrants and his promise to wall off the USâ€ ™ s southern border have prompted Joe Biden to apologize on behalf of a nation and driven former Mexican president Vicente Fox to swearing .
But even if the border wall is never built , many in Mexico fear that Trumpâ€ ™ s comments about the country will result in a more draconian US border policy , threatening to derail two decades of closer ties and economic integration brought about by the North American Free Trade Agreement .
â€œThere is no winning for Mexico in this situation , â€ � says Federico EstÃ © vez , political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico .
â€œThe only win is if Trump loses down the line .
But you can be sure that his policy on immigration will be followed at the border.â€
� Hours after New Jersey governor and former Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie endorsed frontrunner Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign for the White House , Maineâ€ ™ s governor , Paul LePage , has thrown his support behind the real estate tycoon .
In an interview on the Howie Carr show , a Boston - area radio show , LePage endorsed Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential campaign , telling Carr , â€œYou know , we could do a lot worse .
We could have another Obama in there , or Hillary Clinton .
And we canâ€ ™ t afford that.â€
�
â€œI think the governors have got to come out and pick your poison , because Iâ€ ™ m telling you , weâ€ ™ ve got to stop the charade that went on last night , â€ � LePage said , referring to the dogpile debate in Texas that featured nearly a minute of four - way crosstalk .
He has a message to senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz , who he accused of â€œkillingâ€ �
Trump : â€œYouâ€ ™ re also killing the brand.â€
�
â€œThe one thing I like about Donald Trump , Iâ€ ™ m not gon na say I agree with everything heâ€
™ s saying ...
heâ€ ™ s showing a vision for the future , â€ � LePage said .
â€œHe wants to make America great again , and heâ€ ™ s the only person doing that right now.â€ � LePage , who described himself in the interview as â€œjust a schmuck from the streets , â€ � told Carr that he had not spoken with Trump about his endorsement beforehand , although he had been considering doing so after Chris Christie dropped out of the presidential race .
LePage , like Trump , is no stranger to controversy and is well known for his incendiary rhetoric .
In January , the governor was forced to apologize for making racially charged comments about drug dealers at an event on Wednesday night .
â€œThese are guys with the name D - Money , Smoothie , Shifty â€ “ these types of guys â€ “
they come from Connecticut and New York , they come up here , they sell their heroin , they go back home , â€ � LePage said .
â€œIncidentally , half the time they impregnate a young white girl before they leave , which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we have to deal with down the road.â€ �
These cheerleaders help put the pep in pep rally one day before South Carolina Democrats head to the polls .
And we go another day without Clinton taking questions from the press .
A CNN reporter tried to ask her about the news of the day â€ “ Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s big endorsement â€ “ during a quick stop at a coffee shop in Atlanta , where she held a rally earlier today , but she didnâ€ ™ t bite .
â€œI really do like you ...
thatâ€ ™ s a good one , â€ � Clinton said , apparently in reference to his question .
The reporter , Dan Merica , has been tallying the number of days Clinton has gone without holding a press conference .
By his count , she hasnâ€ ™ t held a press conference since December .
Or put another way , since the new year began , since the Paris Climate Conference , since Trumpâ€ ™ s Muslim ban , since voters started voting , since Kanye released the Life of Pablo .
You get the picture .
Donald Trump has pledged to change the libel laws in a way that could undermine the first amendment and the freedom of the press , reports the Guardianâ€ ™ s Ben Jacobs : Speaking at a rally in Fort Worth , Texas , on Friday , shortly after accepting an endorsement from New Jersey governor Chris Christie , Trump pledged if elected president to â€œopen up our libel laws so when [ newspapers ] write purposely negative stories
â€
¦ we can sue them and make lots of moneyâ€ � .
This move , he said , would mean that â€œwhen the New York Times or the Washington Post writes a hit piece , we can sue themâ€ � .
Since the American revolution , freedom of the press has been a key principle in American public life , with truth long established as an absolute defense to any accusation of libel .
The first amendment states that â€œCongress shall make no law â€ ¦ abridging the freedom of speech , or of the pressâ€ � .
It is a foundation stone of democracy in the United States .
Former secretary of state and Democratic presidential frontrunner
Hillary Clintonâ€ ™
s camp is running a new advertisement ahead of the Massachusetts primary on Tuesday , with former congresswoman and gun violence survivor Gabriel Giffords telling Bay State Democrats that sheâ€ ™
s voting for Clinton in a straight - to - camera address .
â€œWe have a gun violence problem , â€ � Giffords says to the camera .
â€œSo
Iâ€ ™ m voting for Hillary Clinton.â€
�
Interspliced with images of makeshift memorials following gun massacres across the United States , Giffords calls Clinton â€œtough.â€ � â€œShe will stand up to the gun lobby , â€ � Giffords says .
â€œShe will fight to make our families safer .
It matters.â€ �
The advertisement is a continuation of Giffordsâ€ ™ long - standing support of the former secretary of stateâ€ ™ s candidacy .
At a speech in Ames , Iowa , in January , the former congresswoman used the same words : â€œHillary is tough.â€ � â€œIn the White House , she will stand up to the gun lobby .
Thatâ€ ™ s why Iâ€ ™ m voting for Hillary.â€ � Clinton has increasingly sought to make gun control a wedge issue between her and Bernie Sanders .
The Clinton campaign has aggressively pushed the narrative that Sandersâ€ ™ record on gun safety has , on occasion , been more aligned with the agenda of the National Rifle Association .
In return , Sanders has consistently pointed to his D- rating from the NRA .
After a brief moment with Marco Rubio in the spotlight , Donald Trump stole it back with the New Jersey governorâ€ ™ s support , writes the Guardianâ€ ™ s Christopher Barron : Love him or hate him , you got ta hand it to Donald Trump : no one is better at manipulating the news cycle than he is .
And there is an almost Shakespearean quality to todayâ€ ™ s latest installment of the Trump Show .
Barely over 12 hours into his worst news cycle , after a debate where Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz delivered a bruising tag - team assault on the Donald and his record , Trump managed to instantly change the conversation .
Governor Chris Christieâ€ ™ s endorsement of Trump Friday afternoon not only ends a bad news cycle for Trump , but it also sucks all the oxygen out of Rubioâ€ ™ s moment in the spotlight .
The icing on the cake for Trump is that he manages to accomplish both of these things by announcing the endorsement of his main rivalâ€ ™ s nemesis â€ “ the man responsible for single - handedly stopping Rubioâ€ ™ s post - Iowa momentum at a prior debate .
President Barack Obama departed from scripted remarks at a manufacturer in Florida on Friday to address a shooting spree Thursday in Kansas and last weekend in Michigan , according to a pool report .
â€œThese acts may not dominate the news today but these are two more communities in America torn apart by grief , â€ �
Obama said .
â€œI thought it was important for me to say something today because otherwise these sorts of shootings become
routine.â€ �
â€œWe can not become numb to this.â€ �
â€œThis happens far too many times and affected far too many innocent Americans.â€
�
â€œAs long as Iâ€ ™ m president Iâ€ ™ m going to keep on bringing this up ...
Lord knows I wish I didnâ€ ™ t have to make these phone calls and comfort families ....
The real tragedy is the degree to which this has become routine.â€ �
For further reading : Part of Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential platform ( often lost amid his controversial promises to force Mexico to build a wall along the US border and temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States , let alone his suggestion that we impose a unilateral 45 % tariff on Chinese goods entering the United States to reduce the trade deficit ) is to increase the United Statesâ€ ™ trade enforcement efforts against other nations , particularly China .
Despite the economic downturn and the Democratsâ€ ™ general pro - enforcement preferences , trade enforcement did not markedly increase under the Obama Administration â€ “ a subject of some frustration among manufacturers and workers in industries forced to compete with Chinese goods .
Trade policy ( and especially free trade agreements and trade enforcement ) has always been a sore point between labor and any given administration , and the fact that Bill Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement ( Nafta ) into law in the 90s continues to rankle liberals today .
Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ opposition to the Trans - Pacific Partnership ( wildly unpopular among liberals even before the text was released ) on the campaign trail was an early point of difference between him and Hillary Clinton before she came out against it ; sheâ€ ™ s since pointed out that , while in the Senate , she voted against the Central American Free Trade Agreement ( Cafta ) .
Still , Trumpâ€ ™ s vociferous opposition to free trade at the expense of American workers and businesses was considered likely to peel off ( or convince to return to the polls ) the so - called â€œReagan Democratsâ€ � â€ “ blue collar , union voters disillusioned by their candidate and manufacturing declines â€ “ from the eventual Democratic nominee .
So , perhaps itâ€ ™ s a coincidence that the administration is trumpeting its trade enforcement measures or that Clinton is pushing a strong trade enforcement agenda as president ... but perhaps not .
On Monday , the president promised at the meeting of the National Governorâ€ ™ s Association to get tougher on unfair Chinese trade practices â€ “ though not to eliminate Chinaâ€ ™ s access to the US market for steel .
On Wednesday , the president signed into law the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act , which was intended to allow the administration to more fully investigate currency manipulation in countries like China ( something Trump has repeatedly mentioned ) and to impose retaliatory tariffs on countries like China that are found to be selling goods at below - market value in the United States in a manner compliant with Americaâ€ ™ s obligations to the WTO .
( Trumpâ€ ™ s promises to impose tariffs , by comparison , would likely not be WTO compliant and could lead to US products facing Chinese tariffs . )
Simultaneously , the president announced several executive actions to improve trade enforcement , including the hiring of more Customs and Border Protection officers to perform port inspections of steel imports and Commerce Department staff to ensure tariff enforcement .
But it might be too little , too late â€ “ and way , way too esoteric an action â€ “ for workers in the many industries that have been hurt by US trade policy over the last 25 years and like the sound of a retaliatory tariff , even if they wouldnâ€ ™ t like the inevitable result ( higher prices at American stores ) .
Trump is wrapping up .
â€œOur whole thing is make America great again , â€ � he says .
Trump has a history of hating US libel laws , which in his opinion â€œsuck.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ ve never said this before , â€ � says Trump .
( What else isnâ€ ™ t he telling us ? )
What follows sound as much like an assault on the first amendment as you could pretty much make up :
â€œOne of the things Iâ€
™ m gon na do if I win ... is Iâ€
™ m gon na open up our libel laws
so when [ newspapers ] write purposely negative stories ...
we can sue them and make lots of money ...
So when the New York Times or the Washington Post writes a hit piece , we can sue them .
â€œWith me theyâ€ ™ re not protected because Iâ€ ™ m not like other people ...
So weâ€ ™ re going to open up those libel laws , folks , and weâ€ ™ re gon na have people sue you like youâ€ ™
ve never been sued before.â€

There are protesters at the Trump rally .
We canâ€ ™ t make out what theyâ€ ™ re saying .
Thereâ€ ™ s a yelling match between a protester and two guys in stars and stripes hates hats and football jerseys that say â€œTrumpâ€ � on the back .
Trump is resuming his fight with Mitt Romney over releasing tax records .
Trump says Romney walks like a penguin .
â€œWhen you walk on a stage , you canâ€

He walked like a penguin , It was a disaster , â€ �
Trump says .
â€œIf he wanted to support me , I would not accept his support , â€ �
Trump says of Romney .
â€œI supported John McCain , and we lost .
I supported Mitt Romney , and we lost .
This time I said Iâ€ ™ m gon na do it myself.â€

Trump :
A guy like Rubioâ€ ™ s a baby .
Ted is actually tougher .
And heâ€ ™ s actually smarter .
I have to give that to him , Tedâ€ ™ s actually smarter .
The crowd shouts Trump !
Trump !
Trump !
Trump chugs some water from a bottle , hams it up and tosses the empty bottle .
â€œItâ€

Rubio!â€ � he jokes .
Trump returns to a favorite topic of late , former Mexican president Vicente Fox saying yesterday â€œIâ€ ™ m not going to pay for that fucking wallâ€ � !
Trump :
He dropped the F - bomb , and I said to myself , can you imagine if I said that ?
I would not use it .
I would not go there by the way .
Hereâ€ ™ s an issue where thereâ€ ™ s some daylight between Chris Christie and Donald Trump : anti - Muslim bigotry .
Trump takes the stage at the Fort Worth Convention Center .
You can watch all this in the live stream in the previous block .
Trump is talking about devising the rollout of his Christie endorsement .
â€œI said letâ€ ™ s keep it as a secret for the people in Texas.â€ � â€œWe have a lot of endorsements happening ... but the one I really was happy with was this one right here.â€
�
Now Christie is warming up Trumpâ€ ™ s rally audience .
â€œThe simple fact is this .
America needs strong leadership ...
we need a first class president and weâ€ ™ re gon na have it in Donald Trump ,

Christie says .
Ohio governor John Kasich sees Trumpâ€ ™ s Christie endorsement and raises him an endorsement by former New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman : Hereâ€ ™ s more sour grapes from the former Jeb Bush communications shop â€ “

# TrumpChristie2016 Low whistle .
How much is Chris Christieâ€ ™ s endorsement of Donald Trump really worth ?
Trump might want to ask Mitt Romney , who thought heâ€ ™ d benefit from Christieâ€ ™ s endorsement and the governorâ€ ™ s convention speech in support of Romney in 2012 .
But a flashback to 2012 reveals that the speech wasnâ€ ™ t positive for Christie or Romney .
From Politico : Political commentary about the 24-minute speech â€ “ while some of it has been favorable â€ “ has been dominated by discussion of whether Christie offered too many words about himself and too few about Romney or about the kind of original and provocative ideas that many were expecting on such a major occasion .
The fallout on Wednesday was the talk of Tampa and left Christie on the defensive to avoid lasting damage to his political fortunes .
It also revealed tensions between the Christie and Mitt Romney camps .
Does that still hold true ?
Letâ€ ™ s look at the transcript , and note that Christie didnâ€ ™ t mention Romney by name until halfway through .
Some more numbers : Number of times Christie mentioned Romney by name : 7 Number of times Christie mentioned New Jersey by name
: 5 Number of times Christie said â€œmeâ€ � : 9 Number of times Christie said â€œIâ€ � : 37
But perhaps Christie can recycle some of his speech for 2016 :
Itâ€ ™ s a moment like this where some skeptics wonder if American greatness is over .
How those who have come before us had the spirit and tenacity to lead America to a new era of greatness in the face of challenge .
Not to look around and say â€œnot me , â€ �
but to say , â€œYes , Me.â€ �
Trump is definitely a â€œYes ,
Meâ€ � kind of guy .
Jeb Bushâ€ ™ s communications director apparently watched the Christie - Trump news conference , just wrapped : Christie is asked whether he is interested in a cabinet position or the vice presidency .
â€œI
havenâ€
™ t been offered any position and I donâ€
™ t speculate on those kinds of things , â€ � he says .
Christie says heâ€ ™ s governor through January 2018 then heâ€ ™ s going to enter the private sector and make money â€œlike
Trumpâ€ �
â€ “ more than his wife for once , is his goal .
Sheâ€
™ s an investment banker .
Trump is defending his various brands that Rubio has named in the past two days in an attempt to depict Trump as the king of a crumbling business empire .
Rubio named Trump University , Trump vodka and Trump ties made in China .
â€œI make vodka for all of my clubs , â€ �
Trump explains .
Theyâ€ ™ re some of the best clubs in the world , he says .
Heâ€ ™ s a teetotaller .
â€œMarco Rubio is a lightweight , â€ �
Trump says .
â€œHe doesnâ€ ™ t have the talent , he doesnâ€ ™ t have the temperament , he will never make us great.â€ �
Trump says Rubio lied onstage on Thursday night when he , Rubio , said Trump got a $ 200 m gift from his father .
â€œIf you knew Brooklyn in the early 1980s , and the 1970s , there wasnâ€ ™ t $ 200 m , let me tell you .
And I do have brothers and sisters ,
â€ �
Trump says .
â€œI got a very very small loan from my father many years ago .
I built that into a massive empire and I paid my father back that money .
â€œFor this guy , this lightweight ... to get up and say $ 200 m ....
wow , how does he say that ,
thatâ€ ™ s not true ...
Itâ€ ™ s really a shame.â€ �
Trump says his sister and brother called him after the debate and said â€œwow , how can he do that?â€ �
Trump is asked whether he might have considered Rubio as a vice presidential pick .
No way , Trump says .
â€œNow
itâ€ ™ s obvious that heâ€
™ s not going to be.â€
�
But he never thought Rubio was of sufficient caliber .
â€œItâ€ ™ s interesting about people who choke ...
Iâ€ ™ ve watched people who choke over the years .
Once a choker , always a choker .
The guy that misses a kick , misses a kick ,
â€ �
Trump says .
Then he again brings up Rubioâ€ ™ s New Hampshire debate performance under assault from Christie :
He didnâ€
™ t know where he was .
I thought he was going to die.â€ �
Trump says he thinks he can beat Senator Ted Cruz in Texas on 1 March .
â€œI think we have a great shot , â€ �
Trump says .
â€œPeople are liking me a lot .
I have a lot of great friends in Texas , many many friends.â€
�
Then Trump bashes Rubio as a â€œNervous Nellyâ€ � : â€œHe is not presidential material , that I can tell you .
Heâ€ ™ s
a Nervous Nelly .
I watch him backstage ...
Iâ€ ™ ve never seen a human being sweat like this man sweats .
I donâ€
™ t think
heâ€
™ s of presidential caliber .
I donâ€
™ t think he has the demeanor.â€
�
The Trump camp is circulating statements touting the Christie endorsement .
â€œIt is my great honor to receive the endorsement of the Governor , â€ �
Trump is quoted as saying .
â€œWe have had a wonderful relationship for many years .
He is a solid person that I have tremendous respect for .
I am really proud to receive the support of the Governor and his family.â€ � â€œDonald is a leader , â€ �
Christie is quoted as saying .
â€œHe is a successful person that , like me , isnâ€ ™ t afraid to tell it like it is .
Our system is broken and it wonâ€ ™ t be fixed from the inside .
I am proud to offer my endorsement of his candidacy for President.â€ �
Will this be counted as a second major act of treason of the Republican party by Chris Christie , after his embrace of Barack Obama in the Superstorm Sandy aftermath ?
â€œThis is the person who will go to DC , and will actually be able to turn the place around , â€ � Christie says .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t need any more Washington politicians.â€
�
There was a period of time when I was running against him ... that time has passed .
As a good , loyal American , who is the best person for stopping Hillary Clinton ?
Trump is asked about David Duke , the former KKK grand wizard and Louisiana legislator who yesterday encouraged supporters to back Trump .
â€œDid he endorse me?â€ �
Trump said .
â€œI disavow it ,
OK.â€ � Christie said he met Trump yesterday morning , they sat and talked and Christie made a final decision .
Was there an offer in it for Christie ?
Christie , of course , was the candidate who delivered the one crushing blow against Rubio , on the debate stage before the New Hampshire primary , highlighting how Rubio used a template to answer questions and flustering Rubio to the extent that the Florida senator wound up repeating himself .
Rubio is perceived to be the Republicansâ€ ™ best chance at stopping the Trump nomination .
Now Trump has recruited the number - one anti - Rubio attack dog .
Christie and Trump are taking questions .
Christie dismisses the notion that senator Marco Rubio flustered Trump at the Houston debate .
â€œThe fact of the matter is , no oneâ€ ™ s gon na get inside this guyâ€ ™ s head ... there is no better fighter than Donald Trump ,
â€ � says Christie .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s going to fight for the American people .
And you didnâ€ ™ t hear Senator Rubio talking about that this morning .
Trump thanks Christie :
Generally speaking Iâ€ ™ m not big on endorsements ...
This was an endorsement that really meant a lot . ...
This is the one endorsement that I felt very strongly about , that I wanted to get .
Trump is asked about Rubio saying he was shaken up backstage at the Houston debate and saying that Trump had a sweat moustache .
Rubio really did say that .
â€œIâ€ ™
ll tell you about backstage , â€ �
Trump says , enthusiastically .
Heâ€ ™ s with a pile of makeup putting it on his face , and I say Marco , easy with the makeup , you donâ€ ™ t need that much ....
I saw him backstage , he was putting it on with a trowel .
Hereâ€ ™ s video of Rubioâ€ ™ s attack on Trump this morning
: Christie says the most important thing is to nominate someone who can beat Hillary Clinton , and
thatâ€ ™ s
Donald Trump :
I can guarantee you that the one person Hillary and Bill Clinton do not want to see on that stage in September is Donald Trump .
They know how to run the usual political playbook around junior senators , and run them around the block .
But Trump is â€œrewriting the playbook , â€ � Christie says .
The best person to beat Hillary Clinton in November , on that stage last night , is undoubtedly Donald Trump .
Iâ€ ™ m happy to be on the Trump team
and I look forward to working with him .
â€œI am proud to be here to endorse Donald Trump for president , â€ � Christie says .
He says Donald and his family are old friends .
â€œThere is no one who is better prepared to provide America with the strong leadership that it needsâ€ � than Donald Trump .
Christie says he was on the debate stage and Trump is the only one up to the job .
â€œDonald
Trump is someone who when he makes a promise , he keeps it .
Iâ€ ™ ve experienced that over my long friendship with him.â€ �
Trump appears at his news conference .
He introduces ..
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s a real talent.â€ �
Here comes Christie .
The Times agrees itâ€ ™ s big : What is it ?
Did Ivanka deliver ?
Update : no thatâ€ ™ s not
it , weâ€ ™ re advised .
Now some Dennis Rodman - slams - Ted Cruz action in the full - cafeteria food fight that is the 2016 Republican race : In one of his attacks on Trump last night , Cruz said that while he , Cruz , was fighting immigration reform in Congress , â€œWhere was Donald ?
He was firing Dennis Rodman on Celebrity
Apprentice.â€ � John Kasich half - threatened to assassinate Rodmanâ€ ™ s friend Kim Jong - un last night â€ “ and
the former NBA star decides to go after Cruz ?
OMG .
It is on .
Cruz and Rubio shook hands behind Trumpâ€ ™ s back during a break from the debate at which they mercilessly hammered him from right and left .
Maybe this is why Cruz optimistically said in a post - debate interview , â€œMarco
and I are friends.â€
�
Looks like theyâ€ ™ re enjoying themselves : ( h / t : @nickywoolf ) ... and makes fun of Trumpâ€ ™ s misspelling of â€œchoker.â€ �
This clip also has Rubio making fun of Trumpâ€ ™ s applying makeup backstage and Rubio saying Trump wanted to make sure his pants werenâ€ ™ t wet .
Is the backstage conduct of candidates at debates fair game ?
Isnâ€
™ t there like a safe area back there ?
Politics ainâ€ ™ t beanbag , if I see you applying makeup on your sweat mustache
â€
“ donâ€
™ t blame me if I tell the world about it in the morning .
2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney is really not letting this Donald Trump taxes thing go .
Weâ€ ™ d accuse him â€ “ based on his own refusal to release his taxes for months and months in 2012 , and the incompleteness of the release when it finally happened â€“of being a hypocrite .
But letâ€ ™ s give him a second chance and cheer him on :
For background on the Trump - Romney fight over Trumpâ€ ™ s taxes , see here .
This Trump tweet kind of captures the tone : The Guardianâ€ ™ s Lauren Gambino witnessed a winning scene covering Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s visit to the Saffron cafÃ © and bakery in Charleston , South Carolina , this morning .
A groom , Joe Schreck , of Atlanta , and his 10 groomsmen had just orders a round of bloody Marys when she arrived , Lauren writes : They asked her for a photo .
When Clinton realized the man was getting married today , she turned to her staff : â€œheâ€ ™ s getting married today !
Thatâ€ ™ s pretty exciting.â€ �
Campaign photographer Barb Kinney tells them to kneel down , just like at the wedding .
A few of them kneel around her .
â€œI love having men at my feet , â€ � Clinton says .
They took several photos [ photos TK ] .
â€œThat looks like a really good Bloody Mary , â€ �
she said pointing to one of the menâ€ ™ s drinks .
Laurenâ€ ™ s coverage continues : Schreck invited Clinton to his wedding later that evening .
She said she wished she could attend and declined politely .
â€œMadame
President , â€ � pastry chef Mary Knochel , interrupted .
She was welding a sample basked of coconut pound cake .
â€œI got ta try this , â€ � Clinton said , plucking a piece of cake out of the sample basket and popping it into her mouth .
The two women spoke quietly to each other for a moment .
Knochel said she is a big supporter of Clinton , as he two women are from the same region , sheâ€ ™ s from Louisiana , and from the same generation .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve got to get all of these crumbs out of my mouth , â€ �
Clinton says chewing and smiling for more pictures .
While admiring , another rack of pastries , Clinton complimented the owner on his selection .
â€œYou got ta indulge here , â€ � Clinton said , facing the pool .
Schreck , the groom , is from Atlanta , but
heâ€ ™ s getting married in Charleston today at 5 .
Heâ€ ™ s still undecided about who he is going to vote for but said heâ€ ™ s a big fan of Clinton , especially now .
Asked what his fiancÃ
© e will say , he said : â€œsheâ€ ™ ll love it!â€ � Good question , dave_damage ( and thanks for reading ) !
Letâ€ ™ s see what advice you have for Mr Damage â€
“
hereâ€ ™ s a selection : Trump has corrected his earlier tweets misspelling â€œhonorâ€ � as â€œhonerâ€ � and â€œchokerâ€ � as â€œchocker.â€ � Second timeâ€ ™ s a charm :
Weâ€ ™ d say Trump deserves every credit for communicating with voters through a direct medium without a thousand layers of screening between .
If the price is an occasional misspelling , so what ?
Or is that going too easy on him ?
Can you imagine Hillary Clinton misspelling ... anything ?
From the comments : This will elevate the debate .
Rubio is not letting up on Trump , opening his first speech of the day with a minutes - long prologue attacking Trump .
Rubio even has made a pants - wetting joke : Hereâ€ ™ s the second poll in two days showing Donald Trump with a double - digit lead over Marco Rubio in Rubioâ€ ™ s home state of Florida .
Yesterday Quinnipiac published a poll with Trump up 44 - 28 .
Now Public Policy Polling measures
Trump up 20 : Rubio in his Today show appearance
this morning said his campaignâ€ ™ s own numbers show these polls to be way way off , and he said he knows Florida and heâ€ ™ s going to win there .
Is Trumpâ€ ™ s supposed strength in Florida really plausible ?
Weâ€
™ re trying so hard not to make a dumb Florida man joke , and
For the millions spent on polling the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire , writes Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi , the state - by - state surveys get a lot sketchier as the primary season proceeds : This past week has been all about state , rather than national , polling .
But as Super Tuesday fast approaches , there are lots of states where very little is known about voting intentions .
Even in states like Tennessee , which awards 58 Republican and 75 Democratic delegates , there isnâ€ ™ t all that much polling data .
Reliable polls are expensive to conduct at the best of times â€ “ all the more so when youâ€ ™ re trying to identify likely caucus - goers in places like Colorado or Kentucky .
As a result , the sample sizes of these polls shrink down to just a few hundred , in some cases meaning that the margin of error is much higher .
Basically , be cautious of primary polls - you can expect lots of the unexpected on March 1 .
The New York Timesâ€ ™ Upshot shop has produced a great interactive graphic depicting various paths for Trump or Rubio ( or one of the others ) to get to the Republican presidential nomination depending on how they perform on Super Tuesday on 1 March and then in the spate elections on 15 March ( they include the big winner - take - all prizes of Florida , Ohio , North Carolina , Illinois and Missouri ) .
You set dials according to what proportion of support
you think the various candidates will be winning before and after 15 March and the widget represents probabilities for outcomes .
Itâ€ ™ s cool check it out .
Hillary Clinton avoided on Friday morning admittedly wildly premature questions about whether she would consider senator Elizabeth Warren to be her vice presidential pick , the Guardianâ€ ™ s Lauren Gambino writes :
â€œI canâ€ ™ t get presumptuous , â€ � Clinton said on MSNBC .
â€œRight now Iâ€ ™ ve got to win the nomination and then Iâ€ ™ m going to take a deep breath and maybe get a good nightâ€ ™
s sleep , and then start thinking about that important decision.â€
� Clinton also acknowledged some voters viewed her as untrustworthy .
â€œItâ€ ™ s hurtful to have people say , oh , I donâ€ ™ t trust her or
donâ€ ™ t know why sheâ€ ™ s doing it , â€ � Clinton said .
â€œAnd it suddenly struck me , well , maybe there is this underlying question like is she doing it for herself , or is she really in it for us ?
And Iâ€ ™ ve always thought of myself as being service - oriented.â€ �
Florida senator Marco Rubio turned up on the Today show to press his argument that Donald Trump is not a logical choice to carry the mantle of American conservatism .
â€œIâ€ ™ d prefer not to have a fight and an argument with other Republicans , but ... weâ€ ™ re on the verge of someone taking over the conservative movement in the Republican party whoâ€ ™ s a con artist ...
He has spent his career sticking it to working Americans , â€ � Rubio says .
Rubio also hits Trump for hiding his tax returns ( Rubio has promised to release his at the weekend ) :
The reason why Donald wonâ€ ™ t release his taxes is he because he hasnâ€ ™ t made nearly as much money as he claims he does ...
He is not as rich as he claims to be , everybody in finance knows that , and his taxes would expose that .
Rubio calls Trumpâ€ ™ s story that he canâ€ ™ t release his taxes because heâ€ ™ s being audited for being too strong of a Christian â€œabsurdâ€ � and â€œunreal.â€ � â€œIf you kill Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate , and the trial was in the Senate , nobody could convict you , â€ �
Republican senator Lindsey Graham said in remarks skewering his partyâ€ ™ s presidential field at the Washington press club foundation dinner on Thursday night .
The Texas senator , a contender for the Republican presidential nomination , is extremely unpopular among his congressional colleagues .
The dinner is convened by news organizations with a footprint in Washington and features stabs at comedy by elected officials .
It is not to be confused with the White House correspondentsâ€ ™ association dinner , which in recent years has become celebrity - filled and at which the president typically speaks .
The Republican party has gone â€œbatshit crazyâ€ � , Graham told the crowd , referring to the presidential race .
And he noted that he himself had dropped out of this yearâ€ ™ s presidential race and promptly endorsed former Florida governor Jeb Bush , who subsequently dropped out .
Graham put on a white â€œMake America Great Againâ€ � hat and said : â€œI endorse Donald Trump and hope the Graham magic still exists!â€

In reference to Cruzâ€ ™ s birth in Canada and the false belief held by about 10 % of self - identified conservatives that Barack Obama was born in Africa , he added : â€œI will say that our Canadian is better than your Kenyan.â€ �
He continued : â€œI know exactly when Ted is going to drop out of the race .

Graham had some zingers for Florida senator Marco Rubio , too , whom Graham called â€œthe boy wonderâ€
� .
Rubio is 44 , about five months younger than Cruz .
â€œIâ€
™ m not saying he would change his positions , but he would change his positions , â€ � Graham said , in reference perhaps to Rubioâ€ ™ s calibration on immigration reform .
â€œThe Secret Serviceâ€ ™ s
main job
if heâ€

Trumpâ€ ™
s spellcheck appears to be broken this ayem .
Will this be the outrage that sinks his candidacy ?
Hello , and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House .
Did you watch last nightâ€ ™ s Republican debate ?
Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz ganged up on Donald Trump in an effort to take the frontrunner down a notch .
Trump often gave as good as he got , although Rubio tagged him pretty good by pointing out that Trump could not describe his healthcare policy in any depth beyond â€œitâ€ ™ ll be beautifulâ€ � .
Trump apparently sat bolt upright in bed this morning and began throwing punches again , jumping on Twitter to call Rubio a â€œchockerâ€ � : â€œTheyâ€ ™ re desperate â€ “
I mean what are they going to do ,
theyâ€ ™ re losing by massive amounts , â€ �
Trump said of his senatorial rivals last night .
And this : â€œI think
itâ€ ™ s going to be over fairly quickly , and I donâ€
™ t think
thereâ€ ™ s going to be a [ contested ] convention.â€ �
In Democrat - land , former secretary of state Hillary Clinton popped up this morning on MSNBC and said she had already undergone the process of careful scrutiny that could snag less experienced pols .
â€œI have withstood all this .
I have been vetted , â€ �
she said .
She also took a swipe at Trump , saying he â€œtraffics in a lot of â€˜prejudice and paranoiaâ€ ™ â€ � .
Clinton : I am not a natural politician like Bill Clinton or Barack Obama , and so for me it really came through the route of service .
Last night Clinton was in Charleston , South Carolina , which votes on Saturday , and she took the stage with Charlie Wilson , the former Gap Band frontman , in a moment captured by the Guardianâ€ ™ s Lauren Gambino .
With moves like that , how can she not be 20 points up in SC ?
Today our correspondents are in Nashville , Tennessee ( a Super Tuesday state ) ; Columbia , South Carolina ; and across the west to take the measure of whether and how the race is twisting in advance of the cascade of voting on 1 March .
Thanks for joining us , and letâ€ ™ s hear your take in the comments !"
2016-02-26,"The 10th Republican debate of the 2016 race for the White House is in the can .
Hereâ€ ™ s what happened :
Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz threw as many punches as they could at frontrunner Donald Trump , who was standing between them .
He dismissed them , argued with them , insulted them and generally gave as good as he got .
Rubio got under Trumpâ€ ™ s skin , by demanding that he describe his plan for health insurance reform beyond creating a national market .
Trump said : â€œYouâ€ ™ ll have competition .
Itâ€ ™ ll be beautiful.â€ �
But he could not say more .
Pressed by a moderator to describe his health plan in any depth , Trump fumed : â€œNo !
Thereâ€ ™ s nothing to add .
What is to add ?
What is to add?â€ � â€œNow heâ€ ™ s repeating himself!â€ � said Rubio , lampooning Trumpâ€ ™ s rhetorical default mode : â€œEveryoneâ€ ™ s dumb .
Heâ€ ™ s gon na make America great again , weâ€ ™ re gon na win win win , and the lines around the statesâ€ � will go away .
Cruz joined in the attack on Trump , saying that while he , Cruz , was fighting immigration reform in Congress , â€œWhere was Donald ?
He was firing Dennis Rodman on Celebrity
Apprentice.â€ �
Trump called Cruz a â€œbasketcaseâ€ � and a â€œliarâ€
�
and he called Rubio a â€œchoke artist.â€
�
Rubio dumped his opposition research file on Trump , saying he hired foreign workers ahead of Americans , defrauded students at a university bearing his name , made his ties and suits in Mexico and China and drove companies to bankruptcy .
Trump said he couldnâ€ ™ t release his tax returns because he was being audited and his lawyers wouldnâ€ ™ t let him release them .
Trump dismissed polls that showed him performing miserably among Hispanic voters .
â€œI currently employ thousands of Hispanics , and over the years I have employed tens of thousands of Hispanics .
Theyâ€ ™ re incredible people.â€ � Ohio governor John Kasich made repeated calls for greater seriousness of purpose as Dr Ben Carson called for greater time for himself to speak .
Trump entered the debate with very strong polling numbers in upcoming Super Tuesday states , and if anything happened onstage tonight capable of eroding the kinds of purported leads you see below â€ ¦ we didnâ€ ™ t recognize it ."
2016-02-26,"Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz just woke up to the fact that theyâ€ ™ re losing the Republican nomination to a reality - show star and real estate mogul .
Thatâ€ ™ s the only way to explain their spirited bid to draw Trumpâ€ ™ s blood in the latest Republican debate on Thursday .
Too bad they didnâ€
™ t put on such a performance earlier .
If Rubio is robotic , then he has suddenly turned into the Terminator .
From the start of the debate and then over and over , Rubio went after Trump .
And he did so in a rather clever way .
Often using mockery â€ “ and almost always smiling â€ “ he attacked Trumpâ€ ™ s supposed strengths .
He said Trump was soft on immigration , wondering if Trump would use undocumented workers to build his promised border wall with Mexico , just as he said he allegedly did to build the Trump Tower in New York .
Rubio attacked Trumpâ€ ™ s business acumen .
He said if Trump hadnâ€ ™ t inherited so much wealth from his father , heâ€ ™ d be selling watches on the street in Manhattan .
Rubio attacked , attacked , attacked on everything from the Trump University to Trumpâ€ ™ s healthcare plan to Trump foreign policy knowledge .
And when Trump responded by recalling Rubioâ€ ™ s mental hiccup a few weeks ago before the New Hampshire primary , Rubio laughed it off , saying Trump himself had just repeated himself fives times in the past five seconds .
Cruz pursued a different , more typical attack vector , hitting Trump as a faux Republican with long - time ties to some of the partyâ€ ™ s most despised opponents such as Hillary Clinton and Nevada Senator Harry Reid .
Sure , Cruz nicked Rubio from time to time , but it seemed perfunctory .
We donâ€
™ t know if Rubio and Cruz were consciously working in tandem , but they might as well have been .
It was almost as if Rubioâ€ ™ s job was too peel off Trumpâ€ ™ s teflon by exposing him a phony and pretender so Cruzâ€
™ s more traditional attacks could better find their mark .
And between Cruz and Rubio , the debate often looked like Rubio was the main challenger to Trump .
Trump has been ridiculed as an internet comments section come to life .
In Houston , Cruz and Rubio â€ “ while Ben Carson and John Kasich stayed on debate cruise control
â€ “ were like an opposition research book come to life .
And one look at a rattled and flustered Trump shows what an effective strategy it might have been had it been tried , say , back in summer of last year or in the autumn .
Imagine if in debate after debate , Trumpâ€ ™ s
rivals had attacked him repeatedly as a charlatan and policy dunce â€ “ with considerable disrespect for the Great Man .
If billionaire businessman Donald Trump ends up being the Republican presidential nominee , many party regulars and conservatives may again see the debates as a key inflection point .
That was the lesson learned from Mitt Romneyâ€ ™ s fate , who most Republicans thought would defeat Barack Obama in 2012 .
If you ask conservative die - hards what Romney could have done differently ( this is still wistfully discussed ) , they often will point to the presidential debates that year .
Many feel an aggressive Romney dominated Obama in the first debate , and then eased off the next two .
If only , if only , if only â€ ¦ Many regular Republicans and conservative activists may spend a great deal of time imagining just such a â€œwhat ifâ€ � scenario in the weeks and months ahead .
Not only do polls suggest Trump will be the winner of
next weekâ€ ™ s southern Super Tuesday
, Trump may even keep it a close race in Cruzâ€ ™ s Texas .
Trump is also currently ahead in Rubioâ€ ™ s Florida , which holds its primary in the middle of the month .
The hour is very , very late .
Trump has a core group of believers who are not the kind who typically vote in Republican primaries .
They are unlikely to be shaken loose by any debate performance or clever television ad .
But are there enough of the more traditional conservatives â€ “ ones who believe in the Reaganite value of limited government , low taxes and peace through strength â€ “ who can yet be awakened from their Trumpian fever dream ?
And did donors see enough from Cruz and Rubio to finance a major anti - Trump effort ?
We wonâ€
™ t have to wait too long for the answers , even though Republicans may wondering â€œif only , if only , if onlyâ€ � for a long , long time ."
2016-02-27,"Mounting a stage at a public park in downtown Dallas , Marco Rubio pulled out his phone before a crowd of more than 3,000 and began reading from Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s Twitter account .
In an extended opening to his stump speech on Friday , Rubio relentlessly mocked the Republican frontrunner for misspelling a series of tweets .
â€œJust like Trump Tower , he must have found a foreign worker to do his own tweets , â€ � Rubio quipped .
It was the sort of theatricality usually associated with Trump , the bombastic showman .
But bravado is clearly catching in the Republican primary race , where with only four states decided , there is mounting hysteria that Donald J Trumpâ€ ™ s hostile takeover of the Republican party is a done deal .
Jeb Bush is long gone , and for the party grandees , fresh - faced Rubio , the 44-year - old Florida senator , is all that stands in the way of Trump or the unpalatable Texas senator Ted Cruz .
Can Rubio be the Trump slayer ?
Until now , Rubio had shied away from confrontation with the boorish frontrunner .
But with the clock ticking and no victories so far , Rubio took Trump on in the final televised debate before this
weekâ€ ™ s Super Tuesday contest in 12 states which could put the billionaire way out in front .
Rubio shed his nice - guy image in the debate in Houston , needling Trump on virtually every aspect of his candidacy : his record of hiring foreign workers for his grand real estate projects ; on disguising himself as a conservative , citing Trumpâ€ ™ s prior support for the family planning group Planned Parenthood ; and more fundamentally , as a man lacking in substance .
â€œYou say the same thing every night , â€ � Rubio said , standing alongside Trump on the stage .
â€œEveryoneâ€ ™ s dumb , Iâ€ ™ m going to make America great again , Iâ€ ™ m winning in the polls , lines around the states ,
every night.â€ �
It was a performance that grabbed most of the nightâ€ ™ s headlines , and left as reporters and pundits wondered why Rubio had not unveiled this version of himself sooner .
The senatorâ€ ™ s team insisted the timing came not from desperation but was a concerted calculation .
â€œIf we have to be a part of the circus in order to get people to pay attention to Marcoâ€ ™ s substantive policy proposals , then let us in the ring , â€ �
Harris told reporters on Friday .
â€œWe felt like this was the exact right time to show the Republican base that Marco Rubio is the one candidate best able to take on and take out Donald Trump.â€
�
The strange truth , in a truly unusual race , is that at a surface level everything has gone precisely to plan for Rubio .
First , he disposed of Bush , whose exit from the race after the South Carolina primary prompted a rush of endorsements for Rubio and commitments from high - dollar donors .
He has also begun to inch ahead of Cruz , the other Cuban - American first - term senator , campaigning from the evangelical , social conservative right .
The trouble is Rubioâ€ ™ s map to the nomination made no mention of Trump , who steamrolls on and is poised for a near - sweep on Super Tuesday , a day that could prove decisive for both parties .
On the Republican side , 595 delegates â€ “ roughly a quarter of the total required to clinch the nomination
â€ “ are at stake across a dozen states .
For Democrats , a once - competitive race looks more predictable : Hillary Clinton is expected to score big victories over Bernie Sanders and cement her status as the presumptive nominee .
Whether buzzing across the early voting states or the southern states set to vote next , Rubio has argued what many Democrats privately acknowledge : he is the Republican who can defeat Clinton .
Invoking his humble beginnings as the son of working - class immigrants , Rubio vows to reach voters long forgotten by the Republican party .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to take our message to the people who are struggling paycheck to paycheck , â€ � he said .
â€œTo the students living under the burden of student loans , to the families struggling to raise their children with the right values , we will take our message to them and bring them to our side.â€ �
Rubio tried to win voters of this demographic last week , at a hotel and casino on the southern end of the Las Vegas valley last week .
On the morning of the Nevada caucuses , in the state where Rubio spent some of his childhood , he recounted that his parents had worked as a bartender and a maid in a place much like the Silverton casino .
â€œThey park cars here at the valet and they sweep up the floors in the casino and they clean your room after you use it
and they serve you your drinks and your food , and they work behind the tables , â€ �
Rubio said of hotel workers .
â€œThese people that are working here , they havenâ€ ™ t heard from conservatives in a long time.â€ �
He won a standing ovation and was mobbed by the crowd .
Yet their exuberance made little difference in the fourth Republican contest : another resounding win for Trump , with Rubio finishing a distant second .
It embodied in many ways Rubioâ€ ™ s greatest challenge : voters have shown little regard for electability , ideas or policy , and preferred the sheer personality of a candidate like Trump .
Rob Damwijk , a tourist from San Diego who attended Rubioâ€ ™ s Las Vegas rally , reflected the contradiction near perfectly .
The California native , who plans to vote in his stateâ€ ™ s primary in June , said he was torn between Rubio and Trump .
â€œThere were moments where I was moved to tears , â€ � he said of Rubio .
â€œHe seems very committed and dedicated to average Americans.â€ �
So why , then , would Damwijk consider Trump ?
â€œHeâ€ ™ s like the bad boy in class .
And if you were going to be protected by somebody , thatâ€ ™ s who you would stand behind.â€ � Rubio is making a mark , but he has yet to win a state .
The senator believes he will win his home state of Florida .
But even there , Trump holds a double - digit lead , and a loss for Rubio on 15 March would probably be a fatal blow .
Reports have suggested Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign is preparing for a so - called brokered convention , which would , in essence , require Trumpâ€ ™ s opponents collude to rob him of the winning margin of 1,237 delegates required to secure the nomination .
Though not out of the realm of plausibility , it would be a historic feat .
There are other remaining hurdles , too , should Rubio succeed .
Democrats have eagerly tied the entire Republican field to Trump and his outlandish statements , particularly those directed towards immigrants .
Aboard his campaign bus , Rubio recently reflected on his desire to expand the appeal of Republicans , telling reporters : â€œI think the party will largely be defined by who the nominee is .
â€œThatâ€
™ s why Iâ€ ™ ve spent a lot of time talking about the plight of single women living on the edge of poverty , about empowering majority minority communities through education , and about student loan debt.â€ �
Asked by the Guardian whether he was at least surprised by Trumpâ€ ™ s success
â€ “ Rubio had for weeks dismissed the reality TV star as a sideshow â€ “ the senator suggested that everyone was surprised .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think anyone took him seriously at first , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œBut I still donâ€
™ t think he will be the nominee.â€
�
Rubioâ€ ™ s new strategy , of attacking Trump for lacking specific proposals and foreign policy expertise , tracks more remarks the senator made early in the campaign .
In one interview last fall , for instance , Rubio referred to Trump as â€œa freak showâ€ � who was both â€œtouchyâ€ � and â€œinsecureâ€ � .
But until Trump proved he could dominate an election , and not simply polls , Rubio only criticized Trumpâ€ ™ s controversial statements , and not the man himself .
The senator now finds himself losing state after state to the billionaire , and forced to tap into the anger and frustration that Trump has unearthed ahead of the biggest voting day of the primary campaign .
Super Tuesday : day of decision Super Tuesday is the biggest single night of the protracted process by which Republican and Democratic parties choose their nominees to run for president .
This week , 12 states plus American Samoa and Democrats abroad will hold primaries or caucuses to dole out delegates among the remaining candidates .
Despite the excitement of early contests very few delegates have been pledged so far .
Super Tuesday changes all that .
The band of voting states , running from New England through the south and into the west , carry far more delegates than the early states of Iowa , New Hampshire , Nevada and South Carolina .
This year Super Tuesday is weighted towards southern states as Georgia , Virginia , Oklahoma , Alabama , Arkansas , Tennessee and Texas all vote .
For the Democrats , Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders by 502 to 70 , according to an Associated Press estimate that also tallies â€ � super delegatesâ€ � , who are free to decide whom to back at the July convention , regardless of the state - by - state primary results .
Clintonâ€ ™ s success with black voters in Nevada suggests she will do well in the south , while Sanders has captured young voters and will expect to push hardest in Massachusetts , Vermont , Colorado and Minnesota .
For Republicans , the quest to stop Trump may come down to a few key states .
Texas native Cruz needs a big majority of his stateâ€ ™ s 155 delegates , and Rubio will hope to cut through in cities and suburbs , for instance in Georgia and Virginia .
Super Tuesdayâ€ ™ s delegates are given out proportionally to results .
On 15 March , the delegate - rich states of Ohio , Florida and Illinois will hold winner - take - all contests .
But momentum from success on Super Tuesday could be decisive in both election days ."
2016-02-27,"John Howard says he â€œtremblesâ€ � at the thought of Donald Trump becoming the president of the United States â€
“
but he understands why the voluble billionaire is cutting through with the voters of America , because Trump â€œseems to call it as it isâ€
� .
The conservative former Australian prime minister told Sky News on Sunday he believed if Trump secured the nomination of the Republican party for the presidency he would ultimately lose to the likely Democrat candidate , Hillary Clinton .
Howard said an establishment candidate , like Marco Rubio , might have a better chance of prevailing at a general election against Clinton .
â€œI assume , absent [ Clinton ] being indicted by the justice department â€ “
I assume
sheâ€ ™ ll be the Democratic party candidate , â€ �
Howard noted on Sunday .
But while discounting the billionaireâ€ ™ s chances of getting to the White House , Howard confessed he was fascinated by the Trump phenomenon .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s doing well because heâ€ ™ s saying things that a lot of people think should be said but the current political class arenâ€ ™ t willing to say , â€ �
Howard told Sky News on Sunday .
â€œIn part , his success is emblematic of peopleâ€ ™ s frustration with political correctness .
What people like is he seems to call it as it is.â€
� Howard throughout his parliamentary career prided himself on speaking up against what he termed political correctness and having a special connection with â€œthe battlers.â€ �
Howard also made much of the strength of his border protection policy as one of the political bedrocks of his prime ministership .
On Sunday , Howard told Sky News his declaration in the 2001 election campaign , â€œWe decide who comes to this country and the circumstances
in which they comeâ€ � , was now seen by Australians and possibly people elsewhere as â€œan essential declaration of national sovereigntyâ€ � .
But the former prime minister said on Sunday he was concerned about Trumpâ€ ™ s instability .
â€œI tremble at the thought of Trump being president .
Thereâ€ ™ s an instability about him that bothers
me.â€ �
Howard acknowledged some of Trumpâ€ ™ s remarks were â€œoutrageousâ€ � and he noted his treatment of interviewers was â€œpretty brusque to sat the leastâ€ � .
The former prime minister said : â€œThe big worry [ Trump ]
has and the big worry the Republicans should have is that he might attract passionate support from a certain percentage [ of voters ] but that percentage is less than 50 per cent and , unless you get 50 plus one , you are not going to winâ€
� .
â€œItâ€ ™ s all about arithmetic in the end ,
â€ �
Howard said ."
2016-02-28,"The specter of Donald Trump as an elected nominee for president pushed his Republican opponents to desperate measures on Sunday , two days before a dozen states could vote to give the billionaire a huge lead in the 2016 contest .
Marco Rubio predicted he could win the nomination without winning a state , while Ted Cruz raised allegations that Trump once contracted a mafia - owned company .
Though no Republican votes were cast this weekend , Trump presided proudly over the campaign â€ “ to the extent that Hillary Clinton , the Democratic victor in South Carolina , aimed her victory speech his way and not towards Bernie Sanders .
On Friday two sitting governors endorsed Trump ; on Saturday two former presidents of Mexico compared him to Hitler ; and on Sunday he initially declined to condemn a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan â€ “ even though he had disavowed the manâ€ ™ s endorsement two days earlier .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t know anything about what youâ€ ™ re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists , â€ �
Trump told CNN , insisting he had never heard of David Duke , a former grand wizard of the group .
â€œCertainly I would disavow it if I thought there was something wrong , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œIf
you send me a list of groups , Iâ€ ™ ll let you know.â€ �
The refusal to pass judgment on the former Klansman directly contradicted what Trump told reporters on Friday â€ “ as he eventually pointed out on Sunday .
His claim to know nothing about Duke also contradicted a statement he made in 2000 , when he called Duke â€œa Klansmanâ€ � and said : â€œThis is not company I wish to keep.â€ � Cruz , the Texas senator and hardline conservative who defeated Trump in Iowa thanks to evangelical voters , appeared on all five main political talk shows on Sunday morning to argue that his hopes of sweeping the south had not been shattered .
Cruz described Trump as a fairweather conservative who lacked judgment , telling CNN that if the businessman were president , â€œwho the heck knows what he would do ?
Even Donald doesnâ€ ™ t know what he would do.â€
�
He later speculated that Trump has refused to release his tax returns because he wants to hide â€œbusiness dealings with the mob , with the mafiaâ€ � .
The senator then alluded to allegations raised in a biography of Trump regarding business contracts with the S&amp;A Concrete company , which was run in the 1980s by Anthony Salerno , whom Cruz said was â€œa mobster who is in jailâ€ � .
Salerno died in prison in 1992 .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t know what it is
that heâ€
™ s hiding in his tax returns , â€ � Cruz said .
Trump repeatedly dismissed calls to release his returns on Sunday , claiming that a tax audit prohibited the release .
There is no legal restriction against doing so .
Marco Rubio , the Florida senator who has racked up endorsements from Republican congressmen and governors without having won a state , insisted that he could still win the nomination .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t care how long I have to work , â€ � Rubio told Fox News Sunday of his commitment to defeating Trump .
â€œI will go to every state and every territory.â€ �
Pressed on whether he could win the nomination if he were to lose every state in this weekâ€ ™ s elections , the 12-state â€œSuper Tuesdayâ€ � contest
, Rubio said : â€œSure .
Thatâ€ ™ s not the plan , by the way , but sure.â€
�
He then voiced anxieties that have coursed through the Republican party for months :
â€œI believe that a first - rate con artist is on the verge of taking over the party of Reagan and Lincoln.â€ � Calling the billionaire
â€œa clown actâ€ � who is â€œpreying onâ€
�
struggling Americans , Rubio warned that Trumpâ€ ™ s business record does not bear out his campaign promise to â€œmake America great againâ€ � .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s going to make America broke , like he did those four companies ,
â€ � Rubio joked bitterly .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s going to make it a casino.â€ �
The darkening mood even pervaded interviews with John Kasich , the Ohio governor whose strategy to win moderate Republican supports counts on his relentless and quixotic good cheer .
â€œI think Trumpâ€ ™ s probably going to win probably all of them , â€ � he told CNN of Tuesdayâ€ ™ s primaries , which will dole out delegates to the candidates proportionally according to election results .
Trump leads polls in most Super Tuesday states , except Texas and Arkansas , where Cruz leads in some counts .
â€œOur campaign plan was ultimately to hold our own in some of these places , and we will , â€ � Kasich said .
He admitted , however , that should he lose in his home state , Ohio , on 15 March , a winner - take - all contest in a critical state ,
â€œitâ€ ™ s time to call it overâ€
� .
â€œYou
canâ€
™ t win your home state , you need to get out , â€ � he said .
Both Kasich and Rubio â€ “ who trails Trump in his Florida home â€ “ suggested their campaigns were ready for a brokered Republican convention in July , in order to keep the delegates
Trump needs out of his hands .
But that scenario would require a wholesale revolt against Trump by the Republican party , and the billionaire repeated hints that he is prepared to break his pledge not to run a third - party campaign .
â€œIf they have a problem , Iâ€ ™ m going to have a big problem with that , â€ � Trump said .
â€œIf they want to play that game , I can play it a lot better than they can.â€ �"
2016-03-02,"A candidate who has described Mexicans as rapists and criminals and whose core immigration plan is to make Mexico pay for a giant wall ought not to prosper on the southern border .
Yet Donald Trump was embraced on Tuesday by voters in America ’s most Hispanic city .
Trump won almost 35 % of the Republican primary vote in Webb County , where Laredo is the county seat , comfortably ahead of Marco Rubio ( 28.4 % ) and Ted Cruz ( 28.2 % ) , the Hispanic senator from Texas who finished first in the state overall .
Not that it takes a lot of GOP votes to win here – only 4,089 were cast in the race , compared with nearly 26,000 among Democrats .
Laredo is 96 % Hispanic or Latino , according to the 2010 census , and it is hugely Democratic : Barack Obama won 77 % of the vote in the county in 2012 .
In an unusual spurt of eloquence , twice - failed GOP presidential hopeful and former Texas governor Rick Perry once called the border the blueberry in the tomato soup : a speck of nutrition for Democrats in a Republican - dominated state .
Despite the limited GOP voter pool , it is notable – and jarring – that Trump should not only triumph here but generally perform better in border counties than in the Texas interior , where Cruz was in command .
After some small - scale polling at the Nevada caucuses , Tuesday ’s outcome provided harder evidence that Trump has not been shunned by conservative Latinos .
He may even have inspired them into action : he won more votes in Webb County than were cast in its primary in total in 2012 .
One Trump voter in Laredo , who gave her name as Cindy , said he is popular with local elderly people who are “ tired of the system ” .
Jon Melendez , president of the Webb County Young Republicans , speculated that Trump ’s success owed something to Democrats voting for him because he would be easier for Hillary Clinton to beat in November .
“
In the fall , the Democrats will be absolutely energised to vote against him , ” Melendez said .
Trump bested two Hispanic senators who have also talked tough on immigration , in Rubio and Cruz – though both have Cuban heritage , rather than Mexican or Central American , and there is resentment at a US policy that fast - tracks admission and residency for growing numbers of Cubans while migrants from other countries have far bigger hurdles to overcome .
That situation is one example of the complexities and contradictions here that elude the bombastic rhetoric and uncompromising immigration positions of the main Republican presidential candidates .
Laredo is a characterful place of bridges and barriers ; of ramshackle little homes , pastel - coloured hole - in - the - wall taquerias and family - run auto repair centres , with a decayed downtown of thrift stores , sagging shoe shops , bright currency exchanges and buildings whose grandeur faded long ago .
Laredo ’s small - town familiarity and stability is interspersed with with busy crossings , a railway bridge and an interstate highway that barges through the centre of the city to speed trucks northwards where the sprawl subsides into ranchland and flat emptiness and the roving white and green SUVs of the border patrol .
It is the largest inland port on the US - Mexico border , mentioned soon after Los Angeles and New York in scale of international trade .
Its population is about 250,000 , though the county is vast : two - thirds the size of the LA metropolitan area .
It snuggles up to Nuevo Laredo , the more populous and notoriously violent Mexican city on the other side of the serpentine Rio Grande .
Laredo ’s biggest festival is a near month - long celebration of George Washington ’s birthday with a jalapeño - eating contest as its highlight .
Laredo carries on its broad shoulders an irony shared with frontier towns across the world : that the governmental apparatus of scrutiny , suspicion and separation is at its most prominent , its most stubbornly wedged , between communities that have the most in common .
“
We talk about security but we like to have a balance between security , legitimate trade and tourism so when somebody comes in and says ‘ I want to build a wall and secure the border’ that goes contrary to our daily life that we have in Laredo , ” said Henry Cuellar , a Democrat who is the district ’s US congressman .
Erick Barroso is a 42-year - old corrections officer who votes for some Democratic candidates in local elections , depending on who ’s running .
Often , Democrats are the only names on the ballot .
But he is leaning towards Trump in November ’s general election .
“
I do n’t agree with the wall , ” he said .
“
There ’s a saying , if you build 20 ft walls you ’re going to sell 21 ft ladders …
They ’re always going to find ways [ to cross ] , a wall is n’t the perfect solution .
”
But he ’s not seeing anyone else suggest a better idea right now .
While immigration measures naturally have the most profound and immediate impact on border - dwellers , Barroso ’s reasoning for backing Trump could have come from one of his supporters in Pittsburgh , or Louisville , or Minneapolis .
The rationale stems from personality , not policy .
“
He ’s strong and he ’s very confident , ” Barroso said .
“
I do n’t support everything he says but a lot of the things , he ’s not afraid to say it .
I see that as a strong characteristic .
”
Laredo experienced Trump ’s self - belief and self - promotion up close last July when he paid a brief visit , a month after kicking off his campaign by claiming that Mexico is “ sending people that have lots of problems , and they ’re bringing those problems with us .
They ’re bringing drugs .
They ’re bringing crime .
They ’re rapists .
And some , I assume , are good people .
”
After an outcry , the local border patrol union rescinded its invitation to the candidate , though Trump came anyway – and was shown around by the city ’s mayor , a Democrat .
He portrayed himself as bravely trekking into dangerous territory , but crime figures suggest Texas ’s border cities are some of the safest in the state .
Reports indicate there were more media and police than protesters .
One of the demonstrators was Henry Rodriguez , of the League of United Latin American Citizens , who came down from San Antonio to heckle the tycoon .
“
We went and made a big old ruckus over there , ” he recalled .
“
The more he talks against immigrants , it seems like the more brownie points he gets .
It ’s sad because it ’s kind of a mentality that still exists in this country , of haters .
”
The 71-year - old is frustrated by the lack of empathy and nuance in the political discourse on immigration .
“
There are a good number of Republican Latinos , their parents came from Mexico or Central America or other places like South America , they really do n’t care much about people that are coming over now .
They ’re saying they ’re taking away resources from them , ” he said .
“
But the ones that come here want to better themselves and they ’ll do anything , they ’ll start off take lower wages than anyone , taking jobs nobody else will do .
”
Melendez , a 30-year - old student and former marine , said that “ a lot of us here see it day to day , there is an illegal influx of people coming from Mexico and that needs to be addressed .
However , the tone and the rhetoric and everything else coming out of Donald Trump ’s mouth has been counterproductive .
”
“
I can get behind somebody who wants to secure the border , ” he added .
“
But I think that Trump has just been awful .
”
Before Tuesday night , that view would have seemed like conventional wisdom .
But even in Laredo , demagoguery confounded demographics ."
2016-03-03,"Barring some historic and unprecedented collapse , the US presidential election will be a heavyweight slugfest between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump : a contest between one candidate who says she wants to see more love and kindness , and another who says he wants to punch protesters in the face .
Thatâ€ ™ s not to say the primary rhetoric wonâ€
™ t persist for a while .
Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio will still hurl mud at Trump as they indulge in the fantasy of a brokered convention that could deny a man who has built his career on hurling mud and indulging fantasies .
Bernie Sanders will continue to talk about a revolution against the selfish and corrupt super - wealthy class while Democrats increasingly revel in Clintonâ€ ™ s attacks on a man who embodies the selfish and corrupt super - wealthy class .
And we in the beloved media will do our very best to pretend this primary is real .
Because : clicks and ratings .
But in reality Super Tuesday performed its traditional role : it confirmed the results of the early voting states , and set the frontrunners on a glide path to the nomination .
Those results are clear .
Republican voters are in a revolutionary mood .
They want more change , not less .
They want an anti - establishment candidate
who ( frankly , my dear ) doesnâ€ ™ t give a damn about credibility , consistency or conventional politics .
Democratic voters want less change , not more .
The minorities who are the bedrock of the party love President Obama and his record , but want a stronger and fairer economy .
Above all , they want to stop the Republican extremism that has deadlocked the country for the last six years .
At this stage , all that matters is the delegate count â€ “ not momentum , nor the number of states won .
To overcome the delegate leads of Trump and Clinton , their rivals need landslides , and lots of them .
Winning a landslide victory in the mighty state of Vermont is not a foundation for success .
Especially if â€ “ like Sanders â€ “ it has been your home since the Jurassic age of politics .
And winning marginal victories elsewhere doesnâ€ ™ t count for much .
If you add up all the delegate leads for Sanders in the four states he won yesterday , you find that Clinton pocketed more of a lead in the single state of Georgia â€ “ before we start counting super - delegates , who lean heavily towards her .
In todayâ€ ™ s Republican party , the split wins are the best possible outcome for Trump , which perhaps explains his unctuous attempt to congratulate Ted Cruz for winning his home state of Texas .
It is entirely in Trumpâ€ ™ s interest to perpetuate the fraud that Cruz and Rubio should stay in the race and continue to divide opposition to Trump inside the GOP .
Not that their presence will make any difference to the final outcome .
The Republican national committee stacked the deck by changing the delegate rules of later - voting states ( after 15 March ) from proportional allocation to a winner - takes - all system â€ “
Tthe idea being to prevent a Romney - like nominee from getting dragged into an extended fight with a Trump - like outsider .
Itâ€ ™ s at about this time that supporters of the also - rans point to the states their candidates have won : surely Sanders winning in Colorado is a sign of his electability .
Surely it doesnâ€
™ t matter about Clintonâ€ ™ s victories in the south , where the Democrats never win in the general election .
With the Trump factor making this such an unpredictable year , it is hard to forecast what will happen in the general election .
After several more months of freakout by the Republican establishment , it is possible that the Never - Trumpniks will stay at home rather than vote for someone they openly deride as a hate - mongering conman .
Take the reliably Republican state of Georgia , where demographic projections suggest that minorities will represent a majority of the stateâ€ ™ s population in under a decade .
Democrats havenâ€ ™ t won Georgia since Bill Clinton in 1992 , but now a Trump candidacy is leading to a reconsideration of the Republican lock .
â€œIt would be competitive because certainly thereâ€ ™ s a considerable amount of Republicans in Georgia , especially members of the business establishment , who would never support Trump , â€ � says Merle Black , a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta .
â€œWhether or not they would actively work for Clinton , I donâ€ ™ t know .
But there would be large defections from the usual Republican groups here in Georgia .
The big unknown is whether Trump would attract people who havenâ€ ™ t voted in the recent past : Democrats and independents.â€ �
Those disaffected voters are the blue - collar workers who have been screwed by economic upheaval caused by global trade and new technology .
They were Reagan Democrats and are now attracted to the anti - trade message of both Trump and Sanders .
Which helps explain why Clinton delivered a victory speech that was light on Trump - bashing .
Pivoting to the general election , she namechecked every voting group that she needs to improve her tally in a contest against Trump .
Trump could savour a consistent string of wins on Super Tuesday in a way that only he could pull off : sheer head - spinning inconsistency .
â€œLook , Iâ€
™ m a unifier , â€ �
Trump asserted before tearing into everyone else .
â€œOnce we get all of this finished , Iâ€ ™ m going to go after one person : Hillary Clinton , â€ � he promised .
â€œThey are declaring Marco Rubio the big loser of the night , â€ � he continued .
Trump is a special kind of unifier â€ “ the kind who feels most whole when he wins and other people lose .
â€œI feel awfully good , â€ �
he told the media .
Meanwhile , the rest of the Republican party felt just awful ."
2016-03-04,"The 11th Republican presidential debate has concluded .
Hereâ€ ™ s a breakdown of what happened : Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz took up where they left off in the last debate , throwing roundhouse punches at Donald Trump , the frontrunner .
Notable attacks were leveled at Trump University , which stands accused of fraud , and at Trumpâ€ ™ s seriousness as an immigration hawk .
Did it work ?
The billionaire businessman seemed frustrated at moments , growing red and seeming annoyed , repeating himself and not always succeeding at finding on - point defenses .
But he didnâ€ ™ t explode onstage or anything .
One of the most potentially damaging moments for Trump , however , came at the hands of Fox News host Megyn Kelly , who brandished court documents to bring alive the class - action suit against Trump University , which former students accuse of delivering next to nothing in return for thousands of tuition dollars .
Trump was driven to repeatedly saying â€œletâ€ ™ s see what happens at the end of three yearsâ€ � , in reference to the anticipated resolution of the lawsuit , which he downplayed as a â€œminor civil caseâ€ � .
Florida senator Rubio said that Trump was trying to put the same fraud over on American voters as he put over on Trump University students , in both cases selling a bill of goods .
Texas senator Cruz repeatedly called on Trump to â€œrelease the tapesâ€ � of an off - the - record conversation Trump had with New York Times editors , in which Trump supposedly expressed secret flexibility in his immigration stance .
Trump said he would not call for the release of the audio recordings , because his respect for the journalism ground rules for off - the - record conversations was simply too great .
Trump also admitted he was moderating his earlier opposition to more visas for highly skilled immigrant workers .
Might his seeming moderation on immigration hurt him with his base ?
Ohio governor John Kasich won repeated applause for bringing the conversation back to the details of policy and describing how to revive public schools , how to balance the budget and how to downsize government .
Kasich said that people tell him he is the only adult onstage in these debates .
Trump was questioned about how the military could follow his potentially extra - legal orders to , for example , kill the family of a suspected terrorist .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ ll do as I tell them , â€ �
Trump said .
Rubio accused Trump of being unable to speak in depth about policy in any area , and of instead resorting to personal attacks .
Trump at one point replied by calling Rubio â€œlittle Marcoâ€ � .
Rubio smirked and said : â€œletâ€ ™ s hear it big Donaldâ€ � .
Speaking of light moments , Cruz fell to mocking Trump at one point by telling him to â€œbreathe , breathe , breatheâ€ � .
Rubio made a crack about yoga .
Cruz quipped he hoped there would be no yoga onstage .
Rubio delivered the punch line , gesturing to Trump :
â€œHeâ€ ™ s flexible enough.â€ �
Trump early on appeared to boast about the size of his penis .
He noted that Rubio had accused him of having small hands and seemed to imply that his , Trumpâ€ ™ s , penis was similarly small .
â€œI guarantee you thereâ€
™ s
no problem , â€ �
Trump reassured the audience ."
2016-03-04,"This is the game we play after every Republican debate : the mainstream press corps finds some tortured explanation for why Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz won , and then days later Donald Trump rises in the polls .
In a night where CNN ran a headline reading â€œDonald
Trump defends size of his penisâ€ � , the man has probably won yet again .
Any doubt of Trumpâ€ ™ s tenacity was dispelled by the live crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference , a ballroom full of establishment Republicans watching the combat on giant projection screens , and laughing with He Of The Dyson Airbladed Hair in spite of themselves .
The media has only lately come round to the notion that perhaps its political Geiger counter is no longer detecting radiation but screaming a New York tune like Lou Reedâ€ ™ s Metal Machine Music .
But the revolutionary act of admitting that you can be wrong does not get you all the way to being right .
And it will be incredibly tempting for the same wisdom to hand this night to Cruz or Rubio .
Both candidates battered Trump repeatedly and well , according to the conventional political rules of debates .
They even tag - teamed Trump on a couple lines .
But the old logic has failed us .
We are not the same political people anymore , no longer bounded to conventional metaphysics .
Maybe it is no longer possible to die .
For every argument that should make sense , it is easy to proffer an immediate Trumpian counterpoint .
Cruz and Rubio alley - ooped mockery of him ?
Under normal circumstances , thatâ€ ™ s just the two responsible candidates beating down a punk .
Now , every Trump voter sees two congenital wusses who can only win by teaming up , two loser would - be antagonists so weak that even their insults need a partnership .
Even Fox News itself appeared to drop a lead weight on the scale to give this one to Cruz , the only viable remaining Not Trump candidate .
When the audience applauded Cruz , Fox cut to cheers .
When Trump got booed , they cut to those as well .
See , it seemed to say , you know which way this is going .
Fox even demanded that Trump explain how his own absurd tax - cut giveaway to the wealthy is going to correct the federal debt , as well as account for how his prescription drug plan will save taxpayers money while covering all Americans who qualify .
Thatâ€ ™ s just how far these people have gone on beyond zebra .
After a quarter century of allowing any Republican candidate to generate any trillion - dollar figure by throwing 13 dice in the air and counting whatever numbers appeared â€ “ after allowing eight years of â€œrepeal and replace Obamacareâ€ � without giving a tinkerâ€ ™ s damn about what the â€œreplaceâ€ � part looked like ( if it even existed at all ) â€ “ a conservative outlet demanded that a conservative explain how supply - side economics works , do something that looked like math and provide a plan that makes sense .
You know the instruments of the right are losing when they have to move left to correct themselves .
Again , it probably wonâ€ ™ t work .
For that , you just had to look at the audience at ground zero of the conservative movement .
People donâ€
™ t attend CPAC on a lark .
It costs $ 300 to register , and the expensive hotels near where the event is held usually run over $ 200 per night .
Thatâ€ ™ s $ 700 just to walk around conference rooms with a lanyard , pressed khakis and a titanic sense of entitlement to American hegemony .
These people were not Trump fans .
As the Fox moderators introduced each candidate , the cheers followed their status within acceptable conservatism .
John Kasich , the candidate running on the Sensible Stepdad platform , complete with flagrant lack of intolerance for gays and their ilk , received scattered cheers .
Trump garnered healthy applause and some boos .
Cruz received an even larger cheer and some boos as well .
The room erupted for Marco Rubio , the Ken doll avatar of CPAC crushes .
And yet Trump won them over , time and again .
Rubio had made jokes about his penis over the last week , and Trump just said : â€œItâ€ ™ s never been a problemâ€ � â€ “ and the entire room nearly whooped like a daytime talkshow audience .
Cruz burned him , and he burned back , and they cheered .
Rubio came after him , and they cheered .
Not everyone applauded Trump , but the volume of the laughs and clapping and did he just do that ?
moments was enough to overcome even the most ingrained institutional dislike .
Even in an audience pre - selected by cost and orthodoxy to oppose him .
If Trump could win points there , just imagine what happened among the people who have no fealty to movement conservatism , who have nurtured a sustained rage at being betrayed or ignored by its bromides , who have been told that conservatism is good for them even as they have seen the middle class begin to crater around them like a suburban Florida neighborhood pockmarking with sinkholes during a long drought .
If Donald Trump can win in enemy territory , consider just how much he succeeded among the villagers living in the crumbling outposts that conservatism has long abandoned ."
2016-03-04,"Donald Trump faced a barrage of attacks from rivals Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz on Thursday night during a Republican presidential debate that was at times nasty and crude but offered few moments that looked likely to reset a race that remains Trumpâ€ ™ s to lose .
The two senators ganged up for a second time in a row on the brash billionaire over his immigration stance , business record and overall temperament , but Trump swatted them away by condescendingly branding them â€œLittle Marcoâ€ � and â€œLying Tedâ€ � .
In return , his rivals treated Trump like a belligerent child .
At one point Cruz chastised his rival : â€œCount to 10 , Donald .
Count to
10.â€ �
The debate in Detroit was , in many ways , emblematic of the Republican partyâ€ ™ s core struggle , with time running short for the party establishment to blunt Trumpâ€ ™ s path to the nomination .
The tone of schoolyard taunts rather than substantive discussion was set no more than 10 minutes after the candidates took the stage at the Fox Theatre , with Trump referencing the size of his genitalia during an exchange with Rubio over his hands .
Responding to personal attacks Rubio recently made on the campaign trail , in which the Florida senator mocked his opponent as having small hands , Trump held out his arms and exclaimed : â€œLook at those hands .
Are those small?â€ �
He went on to note that Rubio had used his hands as part of a metaphor for other parts of his body , an argument Trump dismissed : â€œI guarantee you there is no problem .
I guarantee.â€
�
It marked the bleak beginning to an evening that vacillated between a shouting match with occasional discussion of more meaningful affairs , such as the hiring of foreign workers and the war against the Islamic State .
Much of the debate focused on Trump , as the presumptive nominee , and the lawsuits against his now - defunct eponymous university as well as his sincerity on immigration .
Yet for all the viciousness and personal attacks , all the Republicans agreed to support whoever eventually becomes the nominee and fights the general election in November .
Florida senator Marco Rubio , whose campaign had pushed the â€œ#nevertrumpâ€ � hashtag and attacked Trump as â€œa con artistâ€ � , firmly committed for the first time to support the real estate mogul if â€ “ as seems likely â€ “ he becomes the Republican partyâ€ ™ s nominee .
The Florida senator said of the two Democratic alternatives Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton , â€œone is a socialist and the other is under investigationâ€ � , a reference to the ongoing controversy over the former secretary of stateâ€ ™ s private email server .
Both Ohio governor John Kasich and Texas senator Ted Cruz agreed with Rubio that they would back Trump if he was the nominee .
Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign later sought to downplay the significance of the senatorâ€ ™ s pledge to support Trump if he were the nominee , insisting such a scenario simply wouldnâ€ ™ t become a reality .
â€œWe continue to believe Donald Trump will not be the nominee , â€ �
Todd Harris , a senior advisor to Rubio , told the Guardian in the â€œspin roomâ€ � .
â€œIf Santa Claus were to appear in my house tonight , I would welcome him in and give him some milk and cookies .
But itâ€ ™ s probably not going to happen.â€
�
The only interruption to the bickering were sporadic interventions by Ohio governor John Kasich , who in the absence of Jeb Bush assumed the role of party elder .
But his repeated attempts to stay above the fray rung largely incongruous throughout the event , despite his being joined by Cruz who appealed to the audience at home : â€œIs
this the debate you want playing out in the general election?â€
� While not as aggressive as Rubio in his attacks on Trump , Cruz did , however , team up with his Senate colleague to portray the reality TV star as essentially putting on a show on his signature issue : immigration and border security .
The two senators repeatedly criticized Trump over reports that he had said he was â€œflexibleâ€ � on the issue of illegal immigration during an off - the - record discussion with the New York Times .
The frontrunner , who has made building a wall along the Mexican border and making Mexico pay for it a cornerstone of his campaign , insisted it was unfair to reveal what was discussed in an off - the - record setting .
â€œI think being off the record is a very important thing .
I think itâ€ ™ s a very , very powerful thing , â€ � said Trump , who has forcefully called for new libel laws to sue media companies .
But the businessman made clear there was room for compromise in a future Trump administration .
â€œI will say , though , in terms of immigration â€ “ and almost anything else â€ “ there always has to be some , you know , tug and pull and deal , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve never seen a very successful person who wasnâ€ ™ t flexible ...
You have to be flexible , because you learn.â€ � Fox Newsâ€ ™ s moderators gave Trumpâ€ ™ s policy positions even more scrutiny than in the past .
Chris Wallace displayed a graphic which showed the frontrunnerâ€ ™ s fuzzy math on his proposals to reduce the federal budget and Megyn Kelly quizzed him on his flip flops on increasing H-1B visas for highly educated workers .
â€œIâ€ ™ m changing .
Iâ€
™ m changing , â€ � the frontrunner told Kelly in response .
â€œWe need highly skilled people in this country , and if we canâ€ ™ t do it , weâ€ ™ ll get them in.â€
�
The statement not only contradicted a policy paper on his website , which states an increase in the visas â€œwould decimate women and minoritiesâ€ � , but also the long held policy positions of Senator Jeff Sessions , who was named on Thursday as the chairman of Trumpâ€ ™ s National Security Campaign Advisory Commission .
Despite their best efforts , it remained unclear whether either Rubio or Cruz had managed to create a dent in Trumpâ€ ™ s candidacy .
They at times faded into the background , and in other moments struck a patronising tone .
â€œBreathe , breathe , breathe ,
â€ �
Cruz told Trump at one point .
â€œI know
itâ€ ™ s
hard.â€ �
Rubio appeared to get beneath Trumpâ€ ™ s skin with his relentless takedown of Trump University , highlighting the stories of students who he said had been victims of a scam , and a preference for foreign workers over Americans .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re making your clothes overseas , and youâ€ ™ re hiring your workers overseas , â€ � Rubio said .
A visibly angry Trump charged back by belittling his opponent , referring to Rubio as â€œthis little guyâ€ � and dubbing him an absentee senator â€ “ but seldom responding to the essence of the charge .
A brief respite to the back - and - forth arrived roughly 90 minutes into the debate , with local questions pertaining to the water crisis in Flint and Detroitâ€ ™ s bankruptcy .
But this resembled more lip service than a nuanced discussion of the problems plaguing the minority communities living outside the halls of the debate .
Rubio , when asked why Republican candidates had devoted no time to Flintâ€ ™ s lead - contaminated water crisis , expressed dismay that Democrats had â€œpoliticizedâ€ � the issue and commended Michigan Republican governor Rick Snyderâ€ ™ s response .
â€œHe took responsibility for what happened , â€ � Rubio said .
Dozens of protesters outside the arena disagreed , marching with signs that read : â€œFlint lives matter.â€ �
And Clinton responded swiftly on Twitter :
Trump also faced scrutiny over his foreign policy record .
He cited conspiracy theories about 9/11 while insisting that the military would obey any orders he gave to torture terrorists in US custody .
â€œThey wonâ€ ™ t refuse .
Theyâ€ ™ re not going to refuse me .
Believe me , â€ � the Republican frontrunner said .
And , with Trump winning 11 of the first 15 states and leading in polls in most of the upcoming contests , it looks increasingly likely he may be in the position to give those orders ."
2016-03-04,"Republican frontrunner Donald Trump scrapped a planned appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference â€ “ a kind of Star Trek convention for rah - rah right - wingers .
A party torn by Trumpâ€ ™ s unstoppable rise
Trump said he had to spend more time in Kansas , one of five states to vote on Saturday , and Florida , where heâ€ ™ s hoping to wipe the floor with Marco Rubio .
â€œWe are in territory that our party hasnâ€ ™ t seen , â€ � said Republican national committee chair Reince Priebus .
But he was â€œ85%-90 % sureâ€ � the party would elect a nominee cleanly .
Reassuring !
Republicans are supposed to elevate a nominee at a convention in July in Cleveland .
On Friday , the cityâ€ ™ s police force announced plans to buy 2,000 riot - control suits with collapsible batons and shin guards .
Republican hopeful John Kasich predicted a chaotic convention with no foretold nominee .
â€œCan you think of anything cooler than a convention?â€ � he said .
With only 25 delegates so far , he would say that .
The Republican sturm und drang grew after a poisonously contentious debate showdown in Detroit a night earlier .
Trump called his rivals â€œlittle Marcoâ€ � and â€œlyinâ€ ™ Tedâ€ � and guaranteed his penis was ample .
Talk of
Trump junk a disservice to voters Impresario and activist Russell Simmons endorsed Hillary Clinton for president , saying Bernie Sanders was â€œoverstating what he can deliver to underserved communitiesâ€ � .
It seems like only yesterday that Ben Carson was actively running for president .
In fact it was three days ago .
But Carson landed well :
heâ€

â€œThis time itâ€ ™ s life and death , â€ � he said .
After insisting at the debate that the military would not hesitate to carry out orders he might give as president â€ “ even orders to break torture laws

“ Trump backpedaled .
I do , however , understand that the United States is bound by laws and treaties and I will not order our military or other officials to violate those laws and will seek their advice on such matters .

Sometimes he makes it a little bit hard
but you know Iâ€ ™ m going to support whoever is the nominee .
Trump is asked would he support the nominee even if itâ€ ™ s not him .
Trump :
Even if itâ€ ™ s not me ?
Millions of millions of people have come to the Republican party ... and Democrats are losing people .
Iâ€ ™ m very proud .
The answer is yes I will .
Maybe there has been a gentlemenâ€ ™ s agreement in place during this GOP debate .
Tonight , Cruz and Rubio have attacked Trump , sometime very successfully .
Trump has been on the defensive most of the night .
Meanwhile , Kasich has presented himself very well .
His foreign policy answer was superlative .
Could it be that Cruz and Rubio are trying to put Kasich out front ?
I canâ€
™ t imagine a selfless Cruz , but maybe .
Last commercial break !
Letâ€ ™ s hear it
â€ “ whoâ€ ™ s
winning and whoâ€ ™ s losing ?
Kasich takes a question about a commercial his campaign ran tying Trump to Putin .
Do you think Trump is naive about Putin ?
â€œIâ€
™ m not biting , â€ � Kasich says .
â€œLet me just take you around the world , â€ � he says .
Heâ€ ™ s cheered and applauded .
He goes around the world : Russia : attack on Eastern European Nato member states is attack on us .
China : stop hacking us and pipe down in south China sea .
Egypt : they are on last legs .
Jordan , Saudi , Gulf states : our allies who need support .
Annnd ... â€œWe need good human intelligence.â€
�
Ding ding ding .
â€œLetâ€ ™ s call it a semi - trip around the world , â€ � Kasich says .
He has run out of time .
Someone like Ted Cruz , who is constitutionally incapable of exhibiting any emotions other than affected unctuousness or smug paternalism , should probably avoid coming across like a father on stage .
I mean , leave aside all the creeping discomfort of Ted Cruz reminding you of someoneâ€ ™ s daddy ; itâ€ ™ s just unbearably smug .
Telling Donald Trump to breathe and count to 10 and behave like an adult is just such a weasel reaction .
For one , Cruz has been just as much of a petulant child as anyone else not named Bush , Carson or Kasich over the course of the debates .
For another , itâ€ ™ s like trying to sneak a burn in through the backdoor of the discourse .
Ted Cruz loses when he tries to attack Trump head on , so heâ€ ™ s going to passively attack him by portraying him as a child and showing how much wiser he is for refusing to engage .
But Cruz is engaging , while trying to seem above the same inane slapfight he regularly engages .
Once you get past the superficial shaming , heâ€ ™ s either a hypocrite or a wuss or , more realistically , both .
Rubioâ€ ™ s invited to say why he thinks Trumpâ€ ™ s not qualified to be president .
Rubio says Trump hasnâ€ ™ t shown seriousness about foreign policy .
Rubio cites Trumpâ€ ™ s earlier answer about the military doing whatever he says
even if itâ€ ™ s extra - legal .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s just not true , â€ � Rubio says .
Trump has not shown â€œthe intellectual curiosity or the interest in learning about these complicated issues , â€ � Rubio says .
Trumpâ€ ™ s reply : â€œIâ€ ™ ve gotten to know Marco .
Believe me , he is not a leader.â€ � â€œFrankly , when I say theyâ€ ™ ll do as I tell them , theyâ€ ™ ll do as I tell them.â€
�
Rubio says Trump once again was pressed on a policy issue and could only attack someone by name .
Then he lists pressure from North Korea , China , Russia , Iran and radical jihadists .
â€œYou have yet to answer a serious question about any of this , â€ � Rubio says .
â€œPutin said very nice things about me , â€ �
Trump says .
Then he says he had said , â€œWouldnâ€ ™ t
it be nice if we got along with the world and maybe Russia could help us?â€
�
Here is Trump on targetting terroristsâ€ ™ families : And hereâ€ ™ s the second 15 minutes of the debate : As the candidates discussed gun control , they began to get more detail focused .
Donald Trump has said that he does not support the ban on assault weapons .
In December , we investigated the 20 shootings with the most fatalities in 2015 and found that most gunmen obtain their weapons legally .
More specifically , we found that in three of those shootings , assault weapons had been used .
Oh come now .
This is a bit histrionic .
Right ?
Cruz hits Trump on guns , guns , guns for everyone , and Trump gets peppy and tries to interrupt .
â€œBreathe , breathe , breathe , you can do it .
I know itâ€ ™
s hard , â€ � Cruz says .
Rubio : â€œWhen theyâ€ ™ re done with yoga , can I [ say something]?â€
�
Cruz : â€œI really hope we donâ€ ™ t see yoga on this stage.â€ � â€œWell heâ€ ™ s very flexible , â€ � Rubio says , pointing to Trump .
Good one !
Joke of the night !
Q for Rubio
: late justice Scalia said the second amendment was not limitless â€ “
so , what limits would draw around the second amendment ?
As few as possible , Rubio says .
He slips in that he personally owns a gun .
â€œGun laws are not effective , â€ � he says .
â€œWe will protect the second amendment.â€ �
Trump agrees : â€œIâ€ ™ m a big defender of the second amendment.â€ �
Then he says â€œmany people will be dying in additionâ€ � from the 13 November Paris attacks .
Four months later ?
Trump is pushed on past support for an assault weapons ban : â€œI donâ€ ™ t support it any more .
I do not support the ban on assault.â€
�
This was Cruzâ€ ™ s attack on Donald Trump over his hiring practices earlier : Social issues .
Kasich is asked about saying that a cupcake maker should probably have to sell cupcakes for a same - sex marriage ceremony even if the maker objects .
Now Kasich :
â€œIf they ask you to participate in something you really donâ€ ™ t like , thatâ€ ™ s
another issue.â€ �
Kasich says he does not agree with Supreme Court protections for same - sex marriage .
â€œI believe in traditional marriage , between man and a woman.â€ �
Then he says something about everybody respecting one anotherâ€ ™ s differences and loving one another .
As long as theyâ€ ™ re not same - sex married ?
Q for Cruz :
Can a gay couple adopt ?
Cruz says leave it to the states .
Adoption and marriage should be up to the states .
He attacks the Supreme court protection of same - sex marriage .
â€œI generally speaking agree with what he said , â€ �
Trump says .
He seems subdued , not having spoken much in the last ten minutes .
A substantial portion of the CPAC audience missed the last segment of the GOP debate due to the emcees announcing last call over the PA .
I met a cheerful Trump voter in line , a young man perhaps a biscuit over 21 , wearing a â€œMake America
Great Againâ€ � hat backward .
He said that people have been giving him a â€œright onâ€
� quite sincerely all day .
The room let out a huge â€œwhoooooaaaaaaaâ€ � when Cruz shut down Trump with his â€œcount to 10â€ � line .
Things are getting louder .
Booze is flowing ,
thereâ€ ™ s quite a bit of yelling .
This is basically a Springer audience at this point .
It might be for the best that the alcohol has been cut off : many of these people certainly look , smell and totter like they pre - gamed at one of the many nearby surrounding restaurants .
There could have been a spontaneous white gang rumble otherwise .
Lots of snapping and moving in lines down the aisles , menacingly .
All it needs is a spark .
Iâ€ ™ m considering throwing a can into the crowd and shouting a candidateâ€ ™ s name to see if it sets something off .
If something happens , know we all had it coming .
Question about the collapse of manufacturing in Detroit , for Cruz .
What would you do to bring manufacturing jobs back to America and train people to do the jobs ?
Cruz says â€œDetroit is a great city with a magnificent legacy that has been utterly decimated by 60 years of left - wing policy.â€ �
He goes back to Henry Ford and WWII .
â€œAnd then for 50 years , left - wing Democrats have pursued destructive tax policies , weak crime policies , and have driven the residents out.â€ � Itâ€ ™ s all the leftâ€ ™ s fault .
No such thing as an international market for cars .
Cruz says he would lift regulations : Obamacare , the EPA and other regulators .
And his VAT tax plan is a manufacturing magnet , he says .
Kasich is asked about Detroit schools , which are in debt and could go bankrupt .
Should the government bail out the schools .
Kasich compares the situation to Cleveland , where â€œschools are coming back because of a major overhaul.â€ � â€œFixing schools rests at the state and local level and particularly at the school board level.â€
�
He could talk forever about this .
Heâ€ ™ s on to vocational education and vouchers .
â€œWe as adults have to fight in our neighborhoods and our communities for our children and their educations.â€
�
â€œThe people of this town are gon na rise and they need to be
involved.â€ �
Cheers in the hall .
Theyâ€ ™ re back .
Itâ€ ™ s a question about government neglect and poisonous water in Flint , Michigan , not far from the debate tonight .
Rubio is asked about infrastructure improvement .
What can be done ?
â€œWhat happened in Flint was a terrible thing .
It was a systemic breakdown at every level of government.â€ � Rubio is applauded for saying â€œthe politicizing of it is unfair.â€ �
â€œThis should not be a partisan issue ... all of us are outraged .
.. It is a proper role for the federal government to play at the local level.â€ �
Here is Trump talking about the â€œoff the recordâ€ � immigration comments :
And this oneâ€ ™ s the first 15 minutes : How bad were those Trump lines : â€œLetâ€ ™
s see what happens at the end of three years ,
â€ �
and : â€œItâ€ ™ s
a minor civil case!â€
�
Itâ€ ™ s true that the CNN poll they have been discussing put a range of hypothetical questions to respondents ( very hypothetical ; the February poll was about the November general election ) but the difference between Cruz and Trump in a race with Clinton isnâ€ ™ t really anything to brag about ..
The poll showed that in a race between Cruz and Clinton , Cruz would win 49%-48 % ( remember , these polls have a margin of error - the numbers could be 3 percentage points higher or lower ) .
When respondents were given the choice between Trump and Clinton , they chose Clinton 52%-44 % .
Hereâ€ ™ s another commercial break .
How bruised do you see Trump as being after that grilling over his university ?
Which attack was more effective â€ “ Rubio saying Trump was trying to do to the American people what he did to the students â€ “ or Cruz asking voters if this is the conversation they want to see in the general election ?
Trump seemed a little cornered in that exchange over Trump University .
It ended with him citing the polls .
My polls are bigger than yours .
Kasich gets the mic and he says â€œthere are a lot of people yearning for someone who is going to bring America backâ€ � .
â€œLetâ€ ™ s stop fighting!â€
� Kasich says .
A robust cheer .
Rubio : â€œI spoke to one of the victims yesterday ...
They signed up for this course ...
they paid $ 15,000 ...
Then they had to pay even more money ...
When they realized what a scam it was , â€ � they asked for a refund and could not get one , he says .
â€œWe will see whoâ€ ™ s right at the end of a few years ,
â€ �
Trump says .
He says almost all of the people who signed up said it was terrific .
â€œLetâ€ ™ s see what happens at the end of three years.â€ �
Then Trump says the school gave refunds to people .
Rubio : â€œWhat heâ€ ™ s trying to do to the American people , what he did to the people who signed up for this course ...
heâ€
™ s trying to con people into giving him their vote , just like he conned people into giving him their money.â€ �
Trump hits back that Rubio is absent from the Senate and the people of Florida â€œwouldnâ€ ™ t elect him dog catcherâ€ � .
Cruz jumps in for the kill :
â€œLet me just ask the voters at home .
Is this the debate you want?â€
� â€œIf we nominate Donald , weâ€ ™ re going to spend the summer and fall with the Republican nominee facing a fraud trial , â€ � Cruz says .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a minor civil case ,
â€ �
Trump fumes .
Cruz : â€œYouâ€ ™ ve got to learn not to interrupt .
Count to ten , Donald .
Count to ten.â€ � Politifact has examined Trumpâ€ ™ s claim ( also made before tonight ) that Trump University was given an A by the Better Business Bureau , which reviews businesses .
Trump said about his entrepreneur institute that â€œwe have an â€˜Aâ€ ™ from the Better Business Bureau.â€ �
Literally speaking , that is inaccurate .
The Better Business Bureau gives the program no rating today because itâ€ ™ s no longer a going concern .
Trump University had an A at some point .
The Better Business Bureau doesnâ€ ™ t release details of its past ratings , but it did say Trumpâ€ ™ s program had ratings that ranged from A+ to D- .
What we do know , from several published reports and archived Web pages , is that the university had a D in 2010 .
Trumpâ€ ™ s claim is literally wrong and also ignores the universityâ€ ™ s lower Better Business Bureau scores .
We rate it False .
Rubio jumps in and attacks Trump on Trump University , which faces fraud accusations and a class action lawsuit .
He says the school hired a manager at Buffalo Wild Wings despite Trumpâ€ ™ s promise to hire the best .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re willing to say whatever you have to say to get them to give them your money , â€ � Rubio says .
â€œWe have a 98 % approval rating , we have an A from the Better Business Bureau and people like it ,
â€ �
Trump says .
Kelly clarifies : â€œThe rating from the BBB was a D- and it was a result of a number of complaints they received.â€ � â€œIt was elevated to an A , â€ �
Trump says .
Not on the public record , she sys .
Kelly says â€œthereâ€ ™ s a class action of 5,000 peopleâ€ � who say they were fleeced .
Kelly points out that these are â€œworking classâ€ � people .
â€œThe lead plaintiff is now getting out of the case because it was so bad for her ,
â€ �
Trump says .
â€œYou counter - sued her ,
â€ �
Kelly said , and you had to pay her legal fees .
Kelly is hammering him on it .
She puts up a court document that says , â€œThe victims of con artists often sing the praises of their victimizers until they realize that they have been fleeced.â€ � â€œLetâ€ ™
s see what happens in court , â€ � Trump says .
Kasich jumps in and says people are frustrated because politicians just tell them what they want to hear .
â€œWhatâ€ ™ s getting in the hearts and souls of people is they want change , â€ � Kasich says .
â€œPeople are getting more and more frustrated with the system which is why we must pick someone with a record of achievement , not just talk.â€ �
Hillary Clinton doesnâ€ ™ t seem totally convinced by Trumpâ€ ™ s performance this evening :
Kelly to Trump
: People believe you tell it like it is .
But you reverse yourself and here are three video examples !
She runs the video reel .
First on war in Afghanistan : Trump said â€œwe made a mistakeâ€ � getting involved ; but then he denies ever having said it .
On Syrian refugees : Trump says you have to accept refugees â€œon a humanitarian basisâ€ � .
Then later he says â€œwe have our own problemsâ€ �
so no .
On Bush lying to get the US into the Iraq war .
â€œThey lied , â€ �
Trump says .
Later : â€œI donâ€ ™ t know if they lied , youâ€ ™ d have to ask them.â€ � Trump says on Afghanistan that when he said Afghanistan he meant Iraq .
He says he was just correcting himself .
Confusing answer .
On Syrian refugees , he says the first time he took the question was early on and he heard the number was small .
But then when he understood the flow was larger , â€œI changed my tuneâ€ � .
Kelly challenges him : You seem to change your tune so much , whereâ€ ™ s your core ?
Iâ€ ™ ve never seen a successful person who wasnâ€ ™ t flexible , who didnâ€ ™ t have a certain degree of flexibility ...
You have to be flexible , because you learn .
Hereâ€ ™ s a look at where things stand halfway through the debate : Trump is still winning .
Kasich is the strongest , most impressive .
Rubio is the gadfly .
Cruz is the nit not worth picking .
Two more clips from the debate so far : Theyâ€ ™ re back .
Thereâ€ ™ s another commercial break .
Give us your report card .
Letter grades or number grades , your preference .
Cruz gets a question about his saying once that he was open to the possibility that Edward Snowden had done a public service by exposing government surveillance .
Cruz runs away from that position with his hair on fire .
Cruz says the news of massive surveillance was a very troubling development .
But the evidence at the time was unclear .
Now , â€œthe evidence is clearâ€ � that not only did Snowden violate the law
but he likely committed treason , Cruz said .
Cruz outdoes himself demonstrating how much he dislikes Snowden .
Trump on Snowden : â€œI said from the beginning , he was a spy and we need to get him back.â€ �
Kasich says a Foreign Policy magazine survey on who would be best at foreign policy as president gave him 55 % of the vote .
Trump takes a question about an open letter from military leaders and intelligence figures including Michael Hayden warning that the military would refuse to carry out a President Trumpâ€ ™ s order to torture terror suspects .
â€œThey wonâ€
™ t refuse .
Theyâ€ ™ re not going to refuse me .
Believe me , â€ �
Trump says .
Then he says â€œwe should go waterboarding and we go tougher.â€ �
He refers to â€œthese animals over in the Middle East chopping off headsâ€ � .
Trump is pressed on whether the military could follow his potentially extra - legal orders to kill a terroristâ€ ™ s family .
[ the description of this question has been corrected . ]
â€œIâ€ ™ m a leader ,
â€ �
Trump says .
â€œIf I say do it , theyâ€ ™ re going to do it , thatâ€ ™ s what leadership is
about.â€ �
Rick Santorum is LIVE in The Octagon here at CPAC during the break !
He claims that he took a test that was supposed to show who he should , as a voter , side with .
It turned out that he sided with Rubio more than he did with himself !
Endorsing Rubio was only the next logical step .
He then moves on to explaining how Rubio has been endorsed by the American Conservatives Union .
This speech is , bluntly speaking , not moving the needle very far .
People are booing .
Santorum is trying to amp up the crowd , and the divisions within it are just too big .
Then , perhaps sensing that there is no problem with the mood he can not make worse , he does this :
Santorum : I was at a funeral two weeks ago .
CPAC aide :
Sir , we do have to get back to the debate .
The hyped rematch between Megyn Kelly and Donald Trump fizzles out .
So far .
Why is Trump being so polite ?
Maybe because heâ€ ™ s trying to be polite to women .
After all , Hillary Clinton is ahead .
In an 18 February poll , she beats him in a match - up .
â€œDonald , you could resolve this issue very easily by simply releasing the New York Times tapes.â€ � Theyâ€ ™ re now all operating on the assumption that the tapes exist .
â€œIf in fact you went to Manhattan and said ,
â€˜Iâ€ ™ m lying to the American people , â€ ™ the people have a right to know , â€ � Cruz says .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re the liar , â€ � Trump says .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve given my answer , lyinâ€
™
Ted.â€ �
Here are Trump and Rubio arguing over immigration earlier :
Rubio and Cruz attack Trump over a New York Times report that more than 300 Americans applied to Trumpâ€ ™ s Palm Beach Florida club , Mar - a - Lago , but only 17 were hired and other positions were filled by immigrants Trump says heâ€ ™ s had tens of thousands of people working for him .
He says the Mar - a Lago club has a November through March season .
â€œPeople donâ€ ™ t want a short - term job ,
â€ �
Trump says .
â€œSo we will bring people in , we bring them out.â€ �
Cruz hits him with a question for the audience : â€œHow many people here have worked as a waiter or a waitress?â€ � he asks .
Lots of applause .
â€œMarcoâ€ ™ s
dad started as a bartender , mine started washing dishes.â€ �
Cruz is starting a refrain : â€œRelease the tapes.â€
�
â€œThis is all just rhetoric for the voters ... simply release the tape .
His record right now ... is one of repeatedly hiring illegal aliens.â€ � Theyâ€ ™ re back .
Trump is challenged again , on his changing views about admitting highly skilled workers .
His web site says the practice is wrong , but in a recent debate he said it was OK .
â€œIâ€
™ m changing , â€ � Trump says .
â€œWe need highly skilled people in this country .
And if we canâ€ ™ t do it
, weâ€ ™ ll bring them in .
â€œIâ€
™ m changing it , and Iâ€ ™ m softening the position because we have to have talented people in this country.â€ �
Kelly points out that the Art of the Deal â€ “ Trumpâ€ ™ s book â€ “ talks about the power of â€œPlaying to peopleâ€ ™ s fantasies.â€ �
Is that what Trump is doing here ?
â€œIâ€ ™ m not playing to anybodyâ€ ™ s fantasies , â€ �
he says .
They are talking immigration now and itâ€ ™ s an issue that is intimately tied to the economy in the minds of many voters ( and , perhaps not coincidentally , in Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s rhetoric too ) .
A report from Pew in September last year found that 50 % of US adults believe immigrants to the US are making things worse for economy while 28 % say they think immigrants improve the economy .
Thereâ€ ™ s a commercial break .
Whereâ€ ™ s everybody at with this debate so far ?
Rubioâ€ ™ s attacking hard , especially on Trumpâ€ ™ s lack of policy specificity â€ “ is it working ?
What about the Cruz attack on Trump writing checks to Hillary Clinton ?
Will Kasich pick up fans tonight ?
Kelly asks Trump about a BuzzFeed report that the NY Times has an audio recording of Trump admitting his seemingly rigid and hawkish stance on immigration is actually flexible .
Trump seems to admit the conversation and praises media interviewing rules
â€ “ rich for someone who has so forcefully called for new libel laws to sue media companies .
â€œI may have discussed something like that with the NYT .
But I would never have released off - the - record conversations .
I donâ€
™ t think thatâ€ ™ s fair , â€ � Trump says .
â€œMany of those things were off the record , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œI take being off the record as a very important thing ...
and I would always honor that.â€ �
Heâ€ ™ s pressed on whether he would call for the release of tapes with the Times editors .
The answer : No
. â€œI would not do that .
I have too much respect for that process ...
I would not do that.â€
� â€œIn terms of immigration
, there always has to be some target ..
deal ...
you have to be able to have some flexibility .
Some negotiation , â€ � he says .
You can watch the debate live here : â€œIt was for business ,
â€ �
Trump says .
He says he does a lot of deals abroad , implying that he needs to grease the skids to do so .
He says he supported George W Bush and Reagan .
Then we get a Megyn Kelly vs. Trump moment :
Kelly :
Mr Trump .
Hi how are you ?
Trump :
Nice to be with you Megyn .
Youâ€ ™ re looking well .
Chris Wallaceâ€ ™ s use of graphics to fact - check Donald Trump is surprising â€ “ and hasnâ€ ™ t been the norm in past debates â€ “
but perhaps it should not be such a shock .
Trump is a slippery fish , and the graphics are a method of pinning him down .
Fact is , however , that Trump still wriggles , even when itâ€ ™ s abundantly clear his budget numbers are completely bonkers .
Immigration question .
Cruz is asked why Senator Sessions endorsed Trump .
â€œIf
you look to the actual record , â€ � Cruz says , heâ€
™ s the candidate to support for a tough immigration policy .
He accuses Trump of supporting Carter over Reagan , and Kerry over Bush .
â€œHe funded Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi taking over Congress to pass Obamacare.â€
�
Cruz also says Trump supported five of the eight members of the Gang of 8 immigration reform crew .
Cruz says Trump wrote four checks to elect Hillary Clinton in 2008 .
â€œIt wasnâ€ ™ t for business.â€ �
The crowd watching the debate at CPAC is getting rowdier .
Someone yelled , â€œFuck
you , Trump!â€ � ( and , later , â€œ[semi - intelligible F - word usage ] , BITCHâ€ � in one of those stagily breathy yells that sound deliberately half - hearted , as if to gauge the audience .
It didnâ€ ™ t work ; the hostility didnâ€ ™ t move the needle .
Trump is moving the needle .
For a pro - Rubio crowd , Trump got howls and whoops for calling Rubio â€œlittle Marcoâ€ � .
He has a canny understanding for when abuse is funny , when puncturing seriousness seems cool and when to no - sell the assaults of his opponents .
Trump is winning a room that is institutionally designed to oppose him .
Also , Fox News is hilariously trying to make Trump explain how tax cuts can reduce the deficit , when conservative media has never demanded any viable mathematical explanation of the utter horse - pucky of supply - side economics at any point in the last generation .
Kasich takes a question about supporting raising the minimum wage .
Kasich said he never supported a federal minimum wage increase .
â€œIf states want to do it they ought to sit down .. and figure it out.â€ �
Then he says balancing the budget is â€œnot a theory for me.â€ �
As chairman of the budget committee Kasich secured the 1997 balanced budget act .
â€œI fought the entire Washington establishment and won , because when you balance a budget you must [ address ] every single thing.â€ �
He says you canâ€
™ t be a generalist and â€œyouâ€ ™ ve got ta take the heat.â€
�
Kasich is cheered .
Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s claims that the US tax code has become more complex are hard to dispute .
In 1940 , the instruction manual for individual income tax returns was just two pages long .
In 2013 , it was 207 pages .
Trump says â€œas a businessmanâ€ �
he has to support both parties .
â€œWe need people to get along .
We need to be able to get things done.â€ �
Cruz is asked about abolishing the IRS .
He says people will file on postcards .
Then he attacks Trump for a lack of specificity in his policy prescriptions ... and calls him a Washington insider .
In between all of the insults , let me point out the specificity that was lacking ...
Itâ€ ™ s easy to say it , but one of the great disconnects ..
I understand the support for Donald ...
youâ€ ™ re angry . ..
But for 40 years , Donald has been part of the corruption in Washington that youâ€ ™ re angry about.â€ �
By contributing to â€œliberal Democrats , â€ � Cruz means .
Trump is asked about his proposals to cut the deficit by cutting the education department and the EPA , with a combined $ 86bn budget .
But the deficit is $ 544bn per annum .
â€œYour numbers donâ€ ™ t add up , â€ �
Trump is told .
Trump argues that the government can renegotiate contracts with vendors .
Wallace , the moderator , doesnâ€ ™ t buy it , and continues to press , saying Trumpsâ€ ™ claim to save $ 300bn on Medicare is belied by the annual Medicare budget being only $ 80bn .
Trump insists â€œif
we properly
negotiateâ€ �
the money will be saved .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t do that , we donâ€ ™ t negotiate.â€
�
[ this post has been updated to correct budget figures ]
Trump responds .
â€œThis little guy has lied so much about my record ,
â€ �
Trump says .
â€œHere we go , â€ � Rubio says .
Boos , boos boos for Trump .
He says he did not inherit so much money as Rubio says .
He says he has built a magnificent company .
But how soon will he move his clothing manufacturing back to the USA ?
â€œI will do that and by the way I have been doing it more and more , â€ �
Trump says .
Lies , says Rubio .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s not going to do it , â€ � Rubio says , because he can make more money manufacturing abroad .
Then Rubio sets off a nasty argument with Trump : â€œYou see what happens again when you ask him about a policy issue ?
The first thing he does is launch an attack.â€ �
Trump and Rubio talk over one another .
Rubio brings up Trump steaks .
Yell yell yell .
Big fight over whether Trump is a good businessman .
Wallace wants to ask a question about policy .
â€œHe wonâ€
™ t answer it , â€ � Rubio says .
â€œDonâ€ ™ t worry about little Marco , I will ,
â€ �
Trump says .
â€œLetâ€ ™ s hear it , Big Donald ,
â€ � Rubio says .
Boos boos boos .
Now the debate has turned to the economy - itâ€ ™ s a strong policy area for Trump and not just among Republicans .
A poll by CNN / ORC last month asked 1,001 respondents â€œregardless of whom you support , which one [ of the candidates ]
do you think would do the best job handling the economy?â€
�
Some 38 % of respondents chose Trump , 25 % said Clinton , 17 % Sanders and in fourth place with 5 % of respondents was Cruz .
Donald Trump says his hands are not small .
This is probably true .
The Washington Post has published a thorough investigation into this question .
It estimates that Trumpâ€ ™ s finger are 3.7 inches long , which appears in line with averages from other datasets .
Back to Rubio .
You call Trump a con artist .
But he employs thousands .
Question : How many jobs have you created ?
The question is jeered .
What a crowd .
Rubio says Trump inherited â€œover a hundred million dollarsâ€ � and lost it .
â€œHe can start tonight by declaring that all the Donald J Trump clothing will no longer be made in China and Mexico , â€ � Rubio says .
Heâ€
™ s definitely got a tired voice , but
heâ€ ™ s pounding through it .
Then he says that government does not create jobs .
He refers people to his web site .
Here is a clip of the â€œsmall
handsâ€ � moment :
Look : this is how supreme , unassailable confidence works .
People enjoy it .
This guy just brazenly lied about a joke thatâ€ ™ s been coming at his expense for 30 years and then owned and totally absorbed all the energy of a dick joke , then pushed it outward with a thunderous chi blast of â€œwhateverâ€
� .
Attacks over .
Done .
Forget it .
Thereâ€ ™ s no damn point .
Kasich is pressed about what path he has to a nomination .
He finished in single digits in most Super Tuesday states ( except Vermont , and Massachusetts ) .
Kasich said â€œyou all wrote me offâ€ � before .
â€œItâ€
™ s now March madness and weâ€ ™ re heading up north , to my turf .
And let me tell you this , I will win Ohio , â€ � Kasich says .
He says when people get to know him , theyâ€ ™ ll back him .
The spotlight goes to Kasich .
Itâ€ ™ s a question about whether he would work a cooperative strategy with other candidates to block Trump .
â€œThis is so much about process , it frankly is boring to me , â€ � Kasich says .
Then he says he beats Clinton by more than anybody , by 11 points .
â€œIn one poll , â€ � Trump interjects .
Kasich ignores him .
He says â€œI can get crossover votes.â€ � Kasich says people tell him â€œyou seem to be the adult on the stage , â€ � and that line is cheered .
Now a fight over polling .
â€œOf all the people on this stage he performs the worst against Hillary Clinton , â€ � Rubio says .
â€œI
beat Hillary Clinton in many polls
, â€ � Trump says .
He mentions USA Today and Quinnipiac .
â€œI have not started on Hillary yet ,
â€ �
Trump says .
â€œBelieve me , I will start soon.â€ � Cheers .
Cruz gets a question and calls for a focus on issues that concern the average viewer .
Then he says heâ€ ™ s the only candidate to defeat Trump .
Trump replies that he is winning authoritatively .
Rubio says â€œtwo - thirds of the people who have cast a vote ... do not want you to be our nominee.â€ �
Then Rubio says that â€œweâ€ ™ re not going to turn over the conservative movementâ€ �
â€œto someone who thinks the nuclear triad is a rock band from the 1980s.â€ � Good one .
Trump groans .
Jeb Lund reports on the scene from CPAC as the debate picks up steam â€ “ less than 10 minutes in , and Trump has already made a â€œsmall hands ; small something - elseâ€ � joke : We are LIVE from the ballroom of the Conservative Political Action Conference .
These people were given chits for free drinks and warmed up by Sean Hannity .
They are ready to get ROWDY .
And from Trump to Cruz to Rubio , the crowd cheers only got LOUDER .
This is a hugely establishment crowd .
Rubio is asked about his attacks on Trump over his tan , his hands , and his maybe wanting to wet himself at the last debate .
Rubio : Donald Trump has basically mocked everybody with personal attacks ...
If thereâ€ ™ s anybody that ever deserved to be attacked that way ,
itâ€ ™ s Donald Trump .
Rubio is cheered - booed .
He sounds a bit hoarse .
He calls for a debate on the issues ( and blames the media ) .
Trump replies : â€œI also have called him a lightweight ... and I have to take that back.â€ �
Then Trump says Rubio â€œhit me on my hands ,
â€ � referring to Rubio picking up an old Graydon Carter criticism of Trump being a â€œshort - fingered vulgarian.â€ �
Trump holds up his hands .
â€œLook at those hands , â€ � he says .
Then he says Rubio implied that â€œif theyâ€ ™ re small , something else must be smallâ€ � .
Then Trump appears to boast about the size of his penis : I guarantee you
thereâ€
™ s no problem .
There is a huge protest going on , even as the debate kicks off , in the streets near the Detroit venue hosting it .
Protesters appear to be calling attention to the lead - laced water supply in Flint and the Michigan governorâ€ ™ s role in the public health debacle .
Other protesters are calling for a decent minimum wage of $ 15 an hour .
Television media might have told us more about the protests if not for Mitt Romney , though maybe not even then .
The former GOP presidential nominee gave a blistering speech Thursday morning attacking Republican frontrunner Donald Trump , calling him a con artist and fraud , and calling his supporters â€œsuckersâ€ � .
Thanks to his marquee speech , the media narrative of the day is Trump versus Mitt Romney and the Republican establishment .
In that match - up , thereâ€ ™ s little room for a redress of grievances .
Second question , about former KKK leader David Dukeâ€ ™ s support for Trump .
Trump : I totally disavow the KKK .
I totally disavow David Duke .
Iâ€ ™ ve been doing it now for two weeks . ...
Ultimately he got to the Ku Klux Klan , which obviously Iâ€ ™ m going to disavow ...
Take a look at my Twitter account .
First question for Trump , about Romneyâ€ ™ s attacks on him from this morning .
The mention of â€œRomneyâ€ � draws boos .
Trump :
He was a failed candidate , he should have beaten president Obama very easily , he failed miserably ...
Obviously he wants to be relevant , he wants to be back in the game .
Then Trump says he agrees with Romney on free trade , but â€œweâ€ ™ re getting crushedâ€ � â€ “ so Trump supports a tariff on Chinese goods , which is not free trade .
â€œWe will make great trade deals ,
â€ �
Trump says .
Heâ€ ™ s cheered .
Here come the moderators .
Megyn Kelly , Bret Baier and Chris Wallace .
The candidates are already on stage .
Left to right : Rubio , Trump , Cruz and Kasich .
Theyâ€ ™ re being introduced and all get cheers .
This crowd sounds ex - cited .
Check out that hall : More on that pilot who didnâ€
™ t work for Trump , ( Trump says ) , whether or not he , the pilot , was indeed a drug dealer ...
Hereâ€ ™ s the Rubio ad in question : Court documents via the Smoking Gun : If youâ€ ™ re just joining our debate live coverage â€ “ welcome !
Theyâ€ ™ re due to begin at 9 pm ET .
Currently thereâ€ ™ s a big protest staged by fast - food workers and â€œFight for $ 15â€ � supporters outside the debate hall in Detroit , Michigan .
Of the four candidates to take the stage tonight only John Kasich , the Ohio governor , has stated a willingness to entertain a minimum wage hike , if itâ€ ™ s â€œreasonable.â€ � Facing Kasich tonight will be Donald Trump , the talented politician ; Ted Cruz , the US senator from Texas ; and Marco Rubio , the US senator from Florida .
Yesterday Ben Carson said he wasnâ€ ™ t coming .
What to expect from this evening ?
Another round of pin - the - scandal - on - the - Trump .
Last time Rubio and Cruz hit the frontrunner with everything they had in an attempt to bring him down a notch .
Second timeâ€ ™ s a charm ?
Nora Ephron on
Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s
psychology .
We havenâ€ ™ t seen this Rubio ad , but weâ€ ™ re going to find it .
Sounds spicy .
Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama , who endorsed Donald Trump in advance of his stateâ€ ™ s Super Tuesday primary , will serve as Trumpâ€ ™ s top adviser on national security , the Trump camp has just announced .
Sessions is a longtime member of the armed services committee .
Itâ€ ™ s some pretty serious muscle for Trump , who has attracted little support from elected officials and won the support of zero other senators .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s
Sabrina Siddiqui is at the scene of the protest outside the debate at the Fox Theatre in Detroit :
As protesters outside the debate call for boosting the federal minimum wage to $ 15 an hour â€ “ up from its current $ 7.25 an hour
â€ “
hereâ€ ™ s where the candidates who will take the stage stand .
Theyâ€ ™ re all totally closed to the idea except Ohio governor John Kasich : Rubio : If I thought that raising the minimum wage was the best way to help people increase their pay , I would be all for it , but it isnâ€ ™ t .
In the 20th century , itâ€ ™ s a disaster .
Trump :
Weâ€ ™ re not going to be able to compete against the world .
I hate to say it , but we have to leave it the way it is .
People have to go out , they have to work really hard , and they have to get into that upper stratum .
But we can not do this if we are going to compete with the rest of the world
, we just canâ€ ™ t do it .
Cruz :
Every time you raise the minimum wage , the people who are hurt the most is the most vulnerable .
Kasich :
Have it be reasonable ...
I wouldnâ€ ™ t get into numbers right now .
In protest of the Republican opposition to a minimum wage increase ( elaboration : John Kasich has supported a â€œreasonableâ€ � minimum wage increase , which the other candidates oppose ) , low - wage workers are staging a giant march outside the Fox Theatre in Detroit .
( Michiganâ€ ™ s primary is on 8 March . )
Hereâ€ ™ s a periscope view of the crowd .
Itâ€ ™ s big .
People are chanting , â€œWhose streets ?
Our streets !
Whose streets ?
Our streets!â€ � and â€œWhat do we want ?
$ 15 !
When do we want it ?
Now!â€ �
The protests is organized by the Fight for $ 15 group , which has sent this press material : As presidential candidates from both parties converge in Michigan less than one week before the stateâ€ ™ s primary , fast - food workers from Detroit and Flint who are demanding $ 15/hour and union rights announced they will walk off the job Thursday , and will join more than 1,000 underpaid workers to wage back - to - back protests outside the GOP and Democratic presidential debates in Michigan this week .
With a devastating water crisis continuing to unfold in Flint , fast - food workers from that city â€ “ who were among the first to join the Fight for $ 15 â€ “ will demand that presidential candidates from both parties support higher pay , union rights , and racial justice .
More than 46 % of workers in Michigan , or some 1.9 million , are paid less than $ 15/hour .
â€œThe politicians who are failing the people of Flint are no different than companies like McDonaldâ€ ™ s that are locking us in poverty â€ “ both are abusing their power , and both must be held accountable , â€ � said Tyrone Stitts , 43 , who lives in Flint , Mich. , and is paid $ 8.50/hour at Taco Bell . â€œFast - food and other workers in Flint will be not silent until we win $ 15/hour and union rights , and until elected leaders from both parties fight to make sure that all people have a fair shot regardless of what they look like or where they were
born.â€ �
A reader just emailed us saying â€œ11th debate ? !
How many more?!!!â€ �
- we know how you feel Peter .
According to the GOP debate schedule , we should be nearing the end with just two more officially RNC sanctioned debates to go .
Historically speaking , thatâ€ ™ s not so bad .
The chart below published by the University of Virginiaâ€ ™ s Center For Politics
shows that Republicans had 20 debates in 2012 .
And in 2008 , the two parties together notched up almost 40 .
Oof .
We asked you what youâ€ ™ d like in your pre - debate coverage , and we gather that none of you are warming up by watching Foxâ€ ™ s run - up coverage , Real Talk with Greta .
Anyway here are some of your preferences and ideas
: Discuss : Donald Trump and the Politics of Resentment
Would Republicans really nuke Trump ?
Could they ?
As part of any answer to these questions Iâ€ ™ d point out that pollsters who track generic Democrats versus generic Republicans find a mood close to right down the middle this cycle .
Even if the Republicans arrive at their nominee in an extremely messy way , it will still only be July ( probably ) and if the nominee is a big enough name , thereâ€ ™ s no reason to think he ( she ? ! ? ) would be beaten before beginning .
One caveat here is that contested conventions are rare â€ “ the recent precedent most people point to is the Democrats nominating Hubert Humphrey ( over George McGovern in a mess ) in 1968 â€ “ and anyone who assumes there will be one should read a piece such as this from Josh Marshall yesterday : â€œNo , there wonâ€ ™ t be a contested convention.â€ � Addendum : trust us ,
dear international viewer â€ “ this nomination process is plenty confusing right here in the good old USA .
Clinton investigations and Trump as commander - in - chief Weâ€ ™ re enjoying the conversation below the line on this one .
See here for the latest on the Pagliano immunity deal .
Why does everyone hate Cruz ?
Weâ€ ™ d start the list with the fact that he is disloyal , as when he attacked senate buddy Mike Leeâ€ ™ s criminal justice reform bill ; self - serving , as when he brought the senate to a halt to grandstand about â€œdefundingâ€ � Obamacare which was not going to happen ; underhanded , as when his campaign spread a rumor on Iowa caucus night that rival Ben Carson had dropped out of the race ; and a sophist , as when he wondered aloud whether Chuck Hagel was taking money from North Korea during the formerâ€ ™ s defense secretary confirmation process .
But read the Atlanticâ€ ™ s Molly Ball on this , â€œWhy DC hates Ted Cruzâ€ � .
Commenters :
What do you want to do with the next 95 minutes ?
Talk Super Tuesday , and whether Donald Trump didnâ€ ™ t actually do so well ?
Mitt Romney , and whether he has a secret plan to snatch the Republican nomination in a contested convention ?
Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s chances in Florida ?
Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ path to the nomination ?
A Trump - versus - Clinton general ?
Weâ€ ™ re assuming that most of you are reasonably caught up with the news - of - day in US presidential politics .
If not , you can get a quickie light roundup in todayâ€ ™ s Campaign Minute , an incremental real - time narration in my colleague Scott Bixbyâ€ ™ s live blog , or a full briefing delivered in news - story form and collected on our US politics page .
Former top Mitt Romney strategist Stuart Stevens has been going after Trump for saying that Romney begged him , Trump , for his endorsement in 2012 :
Update : from Romneyâ€ ™ s former body man :
Hereâ€ ™ s our news coverage of Romneyâ€ ™ s big attack this morning on Trump , in which he called Trump dangerous to the economy and national security , impugned Trumpâ€ ™ s intelligence and business acumen and direly warned that â€œthis is the very brand of anger that has led other nations into the abyssâ€ � :
In other news , Bernie Sanders tamed his famous mane in Kansas , which caucuses Saturday :
Hello and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the umpteenth ( read : 11th ) Republican presidential debate .
There are only four candidates onstage tonight so it should be a quick one .
Kidding :
itâ€ ™ s scheduled to start at 9 pm and run for two hours .
Notably absent from tonightâ€ ™ s debate will be retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson , who announced on Wednesday that he was rethinking his campaign after an underwhelming Super Tuesday performance ( four last places ; seven second - to - last places ) .
What we can count on is another two - pronged attack on frontrunner Donald Trump by the determined senatorial duo of Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio .
Remember what happened last time ( summary here ) , just one week ago in Houston ?
Rubio accused Trump of repeating himself , Cruz tied Trump to Dennis Rodman and Trump called Cruz a â€œbasket caseâ€ � and a â€œliarâ€ � and said Rubio was a â€œchoke
artistâ€ � .
Who wouldnâ€ ™ t come back for more ?
Ben Carson , thatâ€ ™ s who .
Had he participated tonight , the surgeon would have enjoyed a home - court advantage : the debate will be held at the Fox Theatre ( thatâ€ ™ s how they spell it , the British way ) in Detroit , where Carson grew up and where he launched his campaign .
In the hall tonight for the Guardian will be Sabrina Siddiqui , backed by Ben Jacobs in Washington and a team of reporters and commentators here in New York and elsewhere .
Onstage tonight will be : Ted Cruz , US senator from Texas John Kasich , governor of Ohio Marco Rubio , US senator from Florida Donald Trump , leading vote - getter Fox News is hosting .
Of mild interest tonight is the fact that the moderators include Megyn Kelly , the Fox host who so rankles Trump that he boycotted a January debate sponsored by Fox when the network wouldnâ€ ™ t nix her .
Asked about the Kelly rematch Thursday , Trump said : â€œIâ€ ™ m ready.â€
�
Are you ready ?
What do you think is at stake tonight ?
Who do you expect to excel , and who to botch it ?
As usual , share your thoughts in the comments , please , and weâ€ ™ ll get some in the blog .
Thanks for reading and participating !"
2016-03-05,"The kids â€ “ at least at CPAC â€
“ are not all right with Donald Trump .
In the straw poll that traditionally finishes the three - day conservative event â€ “ which is famed as much as a hook - up spot for college kids as it as a measuring stick of the grassroots â€ “ Ted Cruz won with 40 % .
The Texas senator was followed by Marco Rubio at 30 % and Trump with 15 % .
It did not help that Trump canceled on the event in order to hold a rally in a place that his campaign spelled â€œWitchita , Kanasasâ€ � .
The Republican frontrunner objected to taking any questions during his scheduled appearance there .
Cruz and Rubio received rapturous receptions from the crowd at CPAC , as the room filled to capacity for their speeches .
Cruz in particular was received well , the conservative firebrand being repeatedly interrupted by applause .
But he and Rubio were clearly favorites at an event where Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s name was booed almost as frequently as Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s .
Kyle Foley , a first - time attendee from Orlando , Florida , was wearing a Rubio sticker .
He told the Guardian he â€œreally liked [ the Florida senator ] as a person .
Nothing I blatantly disagree with.â€ �
In contrast , he said : â€œI have every issue with Trump .
Heâ€
™ s a liar on basically everything.â€
�
As one staffer for a presidential campaign told the Guardian , there were â€œa lot of Cruz supporters and a lot of Rubio
supportersâ€ � present while Trump pointedly â€œdidnâ€ ™ t show upâ€ � .
But disapproval of Trump wasnâ€ ™ t just based on that .
Trumpâ€ ™
s appeal on the stump is a rejection of the conservative establishment â€ “ CPAC is the personification of it , or at least those who seek to join it .
The event is filled with GOP operatives and college students who aspire to become GOP operatives .
Every year , many of the attendees are young Republicans who hope to find their first job out of college or a potential first lady .
The conference has a furious and not very furtive singles scene .
For these young Republicans , both Cruz and Rubio have appeal .
Trump , who exit polls show is disproportionately supported by the older and less educated , is still the candidate of the masses .
He may be winning states but among establishment Republicans and those who wish to be establishment Republicans , he has a lot of work to do ."
2016-03-05,"The last morning of every Conservative Political Action Conference is generally a subdued one , as speakers , students and adult attendees alike nurse their hangovers , hang out with their friends , listen to the final speakers and await the results of the annual straw poll .
But in the wake Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s last - minute cancellation â€ “ to stump , he said , in Wichita , Kansas in advance of a Republican caucus he wasnâ€ ™ t favored to win â€ “ exhibitors started rolling up their banners before Senator Marco Rubio gave his Saturday keynote speech .
They left behind pamphlets and candy they didnâ€ ™ t want to pay the unionized convention services to ship back to their offices .
I grabbed a beer koozie for my father .
And though the ballroom was full for Rubioâ€ ™ s moment in the spotlight
â€ “ albeit maybe not quite as crowded as for Ted Cruzâ€
™ s
barnstormer on Friday â€
“ there was more buzz about whether someone , anyone , could keep Trump from sweeping the dayâ€ ™ s four Republican polls and cementing the nomination than there was about anything specific Rubio said .
It is , perhaps , not surprising that CPAC wasnâ€ ™ t fertile ground for Trumpâ€ ™ s policy agenda and persona , given that attendees are normally longtime activists , monied donors and fresh - faced , deeply committed college conservatives .
Making America great â€ “ or at least less liberal â€ “ again might be high on a lot of attendeesâ€ ™ agendas , but the general , deeply ideological interest in smaller , less powerful government shared by many attendees isnâ€ ™ t entirely compatible with Trumpâ€ ™ s message about what can and should be achieved through the personal power of the head of the executive branch .
Even if this wasnâ€ ™ t the sort of crowd regularly treated to panel discussions of eminent domain â€ “ or one of the few places outside a law school classroom in which rosy - cheeked twentysomethings could dissect the finer points of the Kelo v City of New London decision by the US supreme court ; even if this wasnâ€ ™ t the sort of crowd before which one would use the phrase
â€œgoodness graciousâ€
� instead of a saltier epithet ; and even if this wasnâ€ ™ t the sort of crowd that knows the difference between a â€œflat taxâ€ � and a â€œfair taxâ€ � and has opinions about both , CPACers enjoy conservative entertainers but take conservative policy discussions very , very seriously .
Trump , many of them told the Guardian , does not .
Attendees at CPAC are the most committed of the conservative faithful â€ “ and attendance is a costly tithe to the church of conservatism .
Tickets donâ€
™ t come cheap : students , veterans and senior citizens are accorded steep discounts but general admission costs $ 300 .
Would - be platinum - level VIPs are asked to call for prices .
Taking into account travel expenses and the steep hotel room rates at the Potemkin village of â€œNational Harborâ€ � in Fort Washington , Maryland â€ “ from which you can see ( but not walk to ) Alexandria , Virginia and which , in the winter months , is accessible only by car â€ “ you have to figure that the average attendee easily shells out $ 1,500 to $ 2,000 .
This gives them access to panel discussions by activists opposed to gun control and abortion , speeches from conservative standard - bearers and candidates , and book signings by Clueless actress Stacey Dash , former Republican presidential candidate and businessman Steve Forbes and George W Bushâ€ ™ s former press secretary , Dana Perino .
And though they are all conservatives of some stripe with more than a few dollars to spare , CPAC attendees are not â€ “ and never have been â€ “ of a singular mind about almost anything , particularly about which candidate to back .
So though there were more than a few â€œMake America
Great Againâ€ � hats in the crowd ,
Trumpâ€ ™ s advisers were probably right in their alleged calculation that his post - speech questions from a journalist wouldnâ€ ™ t be softballs and could inspire a less - than - friendly reaction from a boisterous crowd .
The big question for Trump and those who desperately donâ€ ™ t want him to be the Republican nominee is how much the rest of the primary will resemble , ideologically speaking , the ballroom at CPAC , or how much it will resemble the big tent Republicans were once desperately hoping to erect .
Saturdayâ€ ™ s contests , unlike many of the previous primaries , were more or less closed to those not previously registered as Republicans .
In effect , they may well look more like CPAC than the primary in South Carolina did .
Many conservatives were openly hoping well before Saturday that a more traditional conservative would win those contests , earn some delegates and forestall the growing feeling of inevitability around his eventual nomination .
There is , of course , one major stumbling block to conservativesâ€ ™ reasoning that the closed and forthcoming winner - takes - all contests will assure them a nominee with roots in the conservative movement .
If , in fact , non - traditional Republican ( or non - Republican ) voters are turning out in droves for Trump on the basis of his personality and persona rather than the ideological consistency of his policies â€ “ as is widely suspected â€ “ thereâ€ ™ s no reason to believe that those voters will turn out in November to vote for a different , more ideologically conservative nominee .
It might not be the first time conservatives have had to do this much navel - gazing at CPAC .
And for many on the stage and off , the question of whether they will vote for Trump if they have to is actually a question of whether itâ€ ™ s more important to get a Republican in the White House or to hew to their deeply held conservative principles , even if doing so means at least four more years of seething hatred for the White Houseâ€ ™ s occupant .
For many , itâ€ ™ s a difficult question to answer .
For now , theyâ€ ™ re hoping voters in Kansas , Kentucky , Louisiana , Maine and beyond will prevent them from having to do so ."
2016-03-06,"Bernie Sanders won the Maine Democratic caucuses on Sunday , his fifth victory in a caucus state , following wins in Nebraska and Kansas on Saturday .
With 91 % of results counted , the leftwing Vermont senator had 64.3 % of the vote to Clintonâ€ ™ s 35.5 % .
â€œWith another double - digit victory , we have now won by wide margins in states from New England to the Rocky Mountains and from the midwest to the Great Plains , â€ � said Sanders in a statement put out by his campaign while he faced Clinton in a debate in Flint , Michigan .
â€œThis weekend alone we won in Maine , Kansas and Nebraska .
The pundits might not like it but the people are making history .
We now have the momentum to go all the way to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.â€ �
Democratic officials reported unexpectedly high turnout at caucus sites across Maine , especially in Portland , where the party was forced to adjust the process in order to expedite the line , according to the Portland Press Herald .
According to the paper , voters in line were allowed to fill out a paper ballot , in effect an absentee ballot used in primary voting , as opposed to participating in a traditional town meeting style caucus .
Meanwhile , facing an uphill battle in the Republican race for president , Marco Rubio scored a much - needed victory on Sunday in Puerto Ricoâ€ ™ s primary , one day after his opponents called on the Florida senator to drop out of the race .
Rubio , the only Republican candidate to have campaigned in the US territory , secured more than 50 % of the vote â€ “ meaning as winner he took all 23 delegates at stake .
Donald Trump trailed at a distant second , while Texas senator Ted Cruz followed in third .
The result in Maine â€ “ Sandersâ€ ™ s eighth win of the 19 Democratic contests so far â€ “ hardly puts a dent in the dynamics of the Democratic race .
Maine offers the party 30 delegates , just a fraction of those needed to amass the 2,383 delegates needed to win the presidential nomination .
Including superdelegates â€ “ members of Congress , governors and party officials who can support the candidate of their choice â€ “ Clinton has at least 1,129 while Sanders has at least 498 .
Clinton and Sanders faced off on Sunday night in a debate in Flint , a city of 100,000 that is grappling with the long - term consequences of the poisoned water crisis .
The candidates have circled each other this week in Michigan , where they have each campaigned hard ahead of Tuesdayâ€ ™ s primary .
Sanders drew a large crowd in Warren , Michigan , on Saturday while Clinton addressed state Democrats at a dinner .
Earlier in the week , she outlined her plan to raise wages and create more jobs during a visit to a manufacturing plant in Detroit while Sanders increased his attacks against her on trade , trying to tie the resulting manufacturing job losses to her support for certain international trade deals .
Sunday was the first time the candidates had debated since Super Tuesday , when Clinton extended her lead and solidified her position as the partyâ€ ™ s frontrunner with a lead of more than 200 pledged delegates over the leftwing Vermont senator .
On what has been dubbed Super Saturday one day ago , Clinton claimed a crucial victory in Louisiana , while Sanders earned wins in Nebraska and Kansas .
In Michigan , Sanders is looking to blunt her momentum and prove that he still has a clear path to the Democratic nomination .
His campaign has insisted that it will fare better in the coming weeks as the primary race pivots from the south , where Clinton has won by sweeping margins with help from the largely African American electorate there , and into the delegate - rich midwestern states .
Sanders has insisted he will remain in the race until the Democratic convention in July .
â€œI still think we have that path toward victory , â€ �
Sanders said on CNN on Sunday .
Rubioâ€ ™ s victory in Puerto Rico is only his second in the Republican contest thus far , after Minnesota on Super Tuesday .
He has otherwise faced dismal results in 15 statesâ€ ™ primaries and caucuses over the past week .
He reacted to the news at a rally in Idaho Falls on Sunday evening , telling voters he had won 70 % of the vote in an open primary where members of any party could vote for the candidate of their choosing .
â€œIn an open primary , where anyone can vote , not just Republicans - Democrats and independents
â€ “
I got over 70 % of the vote , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œNot because I became less conservative , but because I took our conservative principles to people who are living the way I grew up.â€ � Rubio campaigned in Puerto Rico on Saturday evening , making a stop in San Juan for a stump speech entirely in Spanish before a crowd of roughly 500 people .
His event was nonetheless overshadowed by news that he had been trounced in four states by Trump and Cruz .
Although the senator dismissed the poor results as a consequence of southern and north - eastern voters who favored his opponents , his failure to pick up delegates in two states put Rubio far behind his rivals in the overall Republican delegate count .
It also underscored Rubioâ€ ™ s need to win on 15 March in his home state of Florida , where he is trailing Trump and faces a do - or - die moment for his presidential ambitions .
Rubioâ€ ™ s victory in Puerto Rico , however , could help bolster his chances .
Florida is home to the second - largest Puerto Rican population in the US , at roughly a million people , and Rubio is counting on the stateâ€ ™ s Hispanic voters to help see him through .
Tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans have left the territory for central Florida in recent years , in search of jobs , housing and the right to vote in the general election .
Rubio has insisted he will win Florida , which doles out delegates only to the winner , rather than through the proportional format of other states .
â€œWe knew this would be the roughest period in the campaign give the makeup of the electoral map
, â€ � he told reporters of his losses on Saturday .
â€œThis map only gets better for us as we move forward in some of the other states.â€ �
While in Puerto Rico on Saturday , Rubio reiterated his support for the island holding a referendum on statehood .
He also maintained that Puerto Rico should resolve its crippling debt crisis on its own rather than being bailed out by the US Congress , a position he took in September while campaigning in San Juan on the same day as Hillary Clinton .
With all of Puerto Ricoâ€ ™ s 23 delegates , Rubioâ€ ™ s total now rises to 151 .
Trump leads he pack with 382 delegates , followed by Cruz with 300 , while Ohio governor John Kasich has picked up just 35 .
Faced with improbable mathematical odds to obtain the 1,237 delegates required to clinch the nomination , Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign has raised the possibility of a brokered convention in July , in which delegates would be freed from voting in line with state primary election results .
Trump and Cruz have instead framed the Republican contest as a two - man race , suggesting Rubio should bow out .
Rubio , who was set to campaign in Idaho on Sunday , has vowed to do no such thing ."
2016-03-06,"Mitt Romney was clear about who
shouldnâ€ ™ t be the Republican Partyâ€ ™ s presidential nominee when he spoke Thursday in Utah .
He was not clear about whom he did want to see .
He said Ted Cruz , Marco Rubio and John Kasich need to â€œfind common groundâ€ � in the push back against the rising tide of Donald Trump .
In the world of Republican partisanship , that probably meant getting behind runner - up Cruz .
Deepening this impression was Cruzâ€ ™ s victory in Saturdayâ€ ™ s caucuses in Kansas and Maine .
Kansas wasnâ€ ™ t terribly surprising given Cruzâ€ ™ s nearly identical trajectory to Rick Santorumâ€ ™ s 2012 run , in which the arch - conservative Catholic appealed to the Republican evangelical base .
But Maine was surprising â€ “
almost stunning â€ “ and that small , rural , rugged north - eastern state , mostly forgotten by official Washington , might prove to be the turning point in the GOP nomination .
Maine governor Paul LePage endorsed Trump , but Romneyâ€ ™ s
anti - Trump speech Thursday may have been enough for moderate Republican clam diggers who still hold Romney in high regard .
Cruz knows Saturdayâ€ ™ s results made his case .
He intimated that now would be a good time for rivals Rubio and Kasich to drop out .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ll continue to amass delegates but what needs to happen is the field needs to continue to narrow , â€ � he said , according to Politico .
â€œIf weâ€ ™ re divided , Donald wins.â€ �
He added : â€œThe other candidates are increasing the likelihood that Donald Trump is the nominee.â€ � The clock is ticking .
There are two races on 15 March that are must - wins for whoever is going be to a viable Trump alternative .
Both states are winner - takes - all delegates .
Kasich is the governor of Ohio and favored there .
Rubio is a senator from Florida and favored there .
If they drop out before then , they can release their current cache of delegates and make the way clear for Cruz .
The irony here is the Republican establishment despises Cruz .
Bob Dole , George HW Bush , and George W Bush have made public their dim views of him .
Cruz called majority leader Mitch McConnell a liar on the Senate floor .
His public record of personal peevishness is growing .
But that was before Super Tuesday and the mathematical threat posed by Donald Trump .
Even if Kasich and Rubio drop out , the odds are still against Cruz .
Trump knows Cruz is being seen as the alternative .
Cruz did well in Maine , Trump said Saturday , because â€œitâ€ ™ s very close to Canada.â€

2016-03-10,"Marco Rubio has expressed regret over his decision to make personal attacks against rival Donald Trump , saying if given a chance he wouldnâ€ ™ t do it again .
The Florida senator drew criticism in recent weeks for a series of lowbrow taunts , including over the size of Trumpâ€ ™ s hands , his tan and even the Republican frontrunnerâ€ ™ s face .
During a town hall hosted by MSNBC , Rubio acknowledged he had gone too far .
â€œThatâ€
™ s not something
Iâ€ ™ m entirely proud of .
My kids were embarrassed by it ,
â€ � he said .
â€œIf I had to do it again
, I wouldnâ€ ™ t.â€ � Rubio offered a similar response when asked about the episode in a separate forum with Megyn Kelly of Fox News .
â€œIâ€
™ m not telling you he
didnâ€
™ t deserve it , but thatâ€ ™ s now who I am , â€ � Rubio said .
The mockery was indeed uncharacteristic of the senator , who for much of his presidential campaign sought to stay above the fray .
But following his shift in tone toward Trump , Rubio told reporters he felt it was necessary to punch back at someone who spent most of his time bullying others .
Rubio reiterated that point on Wednesday , telling MSNBC that Trump â€œbasically offended everyone for a year ...
a disabled journalist , a female journalist , every minority group imaginable , on a daily basisâ€ � .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t want to be that , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œIf thatâ€ ™ s what it takes to become president of the United States , then I donâ€ ™ t want to be president.â€ �
He drew a distinction , however , in his criticism of Trumpâ€ ™ s business record â€“including the mogulâ€ ™ s now - defunct eponymous university .
â€œI think that is legitimate , and the people need to know that what they are electing is not who he says he is , â€ � Rubio said .
He shot down an emerging dream among conservatives looking to deprive Trump of the nomination : a union between him and rival Ted Cruz .
In the wake of a series of dismal performances by Rubio in recent primary contests , a growing number of influential conservative commentators have called on the senator to drop out of the race and endorse Cruz .
In exchange , the thinking goes , Rubio could be the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s vice - presidential pick and this unity ticket would be the only way to stop Trump .
But during the town hall , Rubio dismissed the proposal as â€œHouse of Cards stuffâ€ � â€ “ a reference to the popular political show on the inner workings of Washington .
â€œIt looks good on TV .
It doesnâ€ ™ t ever work that way , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œ[The ] bottom line is , this process is going to play itself out.â€
� Rubio also said at another point in the forum that he would â€œabsolutelyâ€ � turn down an offer to be Trumpâ€ ™ s vice - president .
The town hall , held in Miami , comes less than a week before Floridaâ€ ™ s 15 March primary â€ “ a critical contest for Rubio that will likely determine the fate of his presidential ambitions .
Rubioâ€ ™ s personal attacks against Trump have been regarded as a key turning point that may have contributed to , if not led to , his collapse .
Rubio said his struggles in Florida have to do with the stateâ€ ™ s reliance on national media , which has been dominated by Trump .
â€œThe national media has given Donald Trump 10 times as much coverage as every other Republican candidate combined , â€ � he said ."
2016-03-10,"When Marco Rubio mounted a stage in the majority Cuban city of Hialeah on Wednesday , his first order of business was not to outline , as he typically does , the high stakes of the US presidential election
but to instead dispel a set of rumors .
Over the past 48 hours , the Florida senator was dogged by murmurings in the press that he was considering whether or not to suspend his campaign before his home state hosts its critical primary on Tuesday .
But addressing his supporters from inside a football stadium , a defiant Rubio dismissed the chatter as an effort to discourage Floridians from voting for him .
â€œLet me tell you something : I will be on that ballot on Tuesday , â€ � he said .
â€œI will campaign as long and hard as it takes .
We are going to the White House .
We are going to win this nomination.â€ �
Beneath his veneer of confidence was the reality that Rubio faces mounting pressure after a series of losses in the Republican primaries that have only appeared to grow more bruising with each passing contest .
And while some polls show Rubio slowly inching closer to Donald Trump in Florida , several others find the Republican frontrunner leading by double digits .
Even a number of influential conservatives who had previously waxed poetic about his prospects threw in the towel on Wednesday , suggesting that Rubio should suspend his campaign .
Absent a win in Florida , it is all but certain Rubio will have no other option but to quit the race .
And so while crisscrossing his home state with the fate of his presidential aspirations in their hands , Rubio is imploring voters to understand the urgency of the moment .
â€œIt always comes down to Florida .
I need you to get out and vote , â€ �
he told the crowd in Hialeah .
The previous evening , speaking in an airport hangar in Sarasota , Rubio struck a similarly pressing tone : â€œIt has to happen here , and it has to happen now.â€ �
â€œIâ€ ™
ve always been an underdog , â€ �
he added .
â€œMy whole life Iâ€ ™ ve had to scratch and claw and earn each and every step of the way.â€
�
It is indeed a familiar role for Rubio , who at just 44 years of age has defied the odds at virtually every stage of his political career .
It began with a successful bid at the age of 26 for city commissioner for West Miami in a building Rubio returned to last week to cast an early vote for himself for president , blocks away from where he grew up .
Then came a run for the Florida house of representatives , where he quickly rose to become its first Cuban American speaker , and an ambitious campaign for the US Senate in 2010 .
The latter experience is one Rubio has pointed to while seeking the presidency as evidence that he has been in this kind of longshot position before .
At the time , as Rubio recounts frequently on the stump , his primary opponent was Charlie Crist â€ “ the incumbent governor of Florida who had the backing of the Republican establishment and a campaign war chest of millions .
Rubioâ€ ™ s standing in the polls was so low that his backers embraced the name â€œthe 3 % clubâ€ � .
Rubio has relied on the story throughout his bid for president to recall his origins as an insurgent candidate who took on the political class and won .
But this time it is Rubio â€ “ having now spent six years in Washington â€ “ who risks defeat at the hands of a political outsider : Donald Trump .
And so in his Sarasota rally , Rubio repurposed his Crist analogy to reflect his uphill climb against the reality TV star .
After mocking Crist , as he usually does , for switching from Republican to independent and later Democrat â€ “
â€œNow I hear heâ€
™ s a vegetarian , â€ � Rubio joked â€ “
the senator warned that Trump was a liberal in conservative clothing .
The New York billionaire , he pointed out , had donated money to Democrats , defended Planned Parenthood and refused to take sides between Israel and Palestine .
The few hundred people who turned up to see Rubio speak cheered in agreement .
The challenge remains that the droves of voters casting their ballots for Trump do not seem to care much that he is challenging the Republican orthodoxy .
And Floridians , like most other Americans , are simply frustrated with the status quo .
Alex Burgos , a spokesman for Rubio , said Trumpâ€ ™ s support in Florida is reflective of the trend taking hold across the country .
â€œThe national exposure Donald Trump has had for his campaign , itâ€ ™ s not even close , â€ � Burgos said , adding that Florida is home to some of the most expensive media markets in the country .
â€œWhen you have that national profile , when youâ€ ™ re able to inundate the national TV airwaves , it is a factor.â€ � Several Super Pacs are hoping to blunt Trumpâ€ ™ s momentum by flooding the airwaves with ads attacking the business mogul .
Some were recently formed by Republican operatives with the express purpose of preventing a Trump nomination ; another , the pro - Rubio Conservative Solutions Pac , has dedicated nearly $ 8 m largely toward anti - Trump advertising .
Rubioâ€ ™ s team is also hoping for a strong debate showing on Thursday in Miami , paired with an aggressive campaign schedule through the primary .
Another unknown is whether the stateâ€ ™ s former governor Jeb Bush , who exited the GOP race last month , would make an endorsement .
Although Bush was scheduled to meet with Rubio , as well as Ted Cruz and John Kasich , on Thursday in Miami , some close to Bush said a Rubio endorsement ahead of Tuesday would be unlikely .
Indeed , were Bush to back Rubio , his former ally from Florida , he probably would have done so by now and would not first require a meeting with his opponents .
But many of Floridaâ€ ™ s senior Republicans remain confident in Rubio , albeit with some caveats .
Tomas Regalado , the mayor of the city of Miami , said he was â€œan optimistâ€ � and was relying on the voters of Miami - Dade County , the stateâ€ ™ s most populous , to listen to â€œpolicies instead of insultsâ€ � and pull Rubio through .
â€œThe county votes more , â€ � he said .
â€œIf we can move the middle he can win Florida .
But whatever is the case we are going to send a clear message that we donâ€ ™ t support people such as Donald Trump , that we support a mainstream America , that we support a conservative and that we support a person that is a part of the American dream.â€ � Regalado acknowledged Rubioâ€ ™ s position in the polls but added : â€œI am always hopeful .
I am an optimist .
Iâ€ ™ ve never lost an election and Iâ€ ™ ve done eight .
This one I still have a good feeling
about.â€ �
Carlos Lopez - Cantera , the lieutenant governor of Florida , takes issue with those who suggest Rubio has conceded ground in the panhandle and northern areas of the state to his rivals .
â€œI
spend my days traveling this state
, Iâ€ ™ ve put on five or 10 thousand miles a month driving Florida , and from what Iâ€ ™ ve seen on the ground he has the support , â€ � he said .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s the only one that has a very clear set of policies and plans for his first term .
Thatâ€ ™ s important ; people need to know whatâ€ ™ s your plan .
It canâ€
™ t just be rhetoric and platitudes .
Marco has a very specific set of policies .
Itâ€ ™ s a powerful message .
Florida is Marco Rubio country.â€ �
Some have nonetheless criticized Rubio for building a late presence in his home state .
His team opened its campaign headquarters in Rubioâ€ ™ s hometown of Miami only on 28 February , two days before Super Tuesday , followed by a slow roll - out of district offices elsewhere .
His campaignâ€ ™ s Fort Myers office opened on Wednesday , less than a week before the primary , and could yet prove to be short - lived if things go badly .
But Miami - Dade commissioner Esteban Bovo , who like Rubio was born to Cuban exile parents , dismissed the issue .
â€œFrom a grassroots perspective , a lot of folks have been working the ground here in south Florida for a long , long time , â€ �
he said .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s been volunteers for six months working the phones and doing the groundwork to get people out and get people excited .
Now we just need to get this on steroids and push it to the end.â€ �
Gina Sosa , treasurer of the Log Cabin Republicans of Miami , also defended Rubioâ€ ™ s operation , noting she had lost count of the hours on the phone to friends , relatives , and colleagues urging them to vote for Rubio , or at her precinct in early voting holding up Rubio placards .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re in the 21st century .
We have Uber , we have Lyft .
Do they have offices ?
No they donâ€
™ t , â€ � she said .
â€œYes , maybe he was a little behind the game
â€
¦ but the grassroots , the people that count ,
have been knocking on doors long before any office opened.â€
�
But if certain Republican politicians in Florida remain blithely confident in Rubio carrying the state , the same could not be said of all party supporters .
Alejandro Rojas , who voted for Mitt Romney in the 2012 election and was planning on supporting Rubio in the primary , said he has jumped ship â€ “ quite possibly from the entire party .
â€œI lost it with Marco when he started on Trumpâ€ ™ s hands and his tan , â€ � said Rojas , a Miami - born carpenter whose parents are from Cuba .
â€œI wanted it to be about the policy .
Trump has nothing and Marco had him on every single issue , then you watch these debates and itâ€ ™ s a circus .
Itâ€ ™ s a clown show and the Republican party is tearing itself apart.â€ �
The concern extended even to Rubio supporters who are remaining loyal .
Mauricio Pons is chairman of FIUâ€ ™ s Young Republicans and was among the first in line when Rubio launched his campaign at Miamiâ€ ™ s Freedom Tower last April .
â€œYou can only fight fire with fire , â€ �
he said .
â€œRubioâ€ ™ s just trying to give Trump a taste of his own medicine , but I do think it has deterred and detracted people because they see the whole entire debacle being very childish and immature.â€ � Rubio on Wednesday said for the first time that he regretted his personal attacks on Trump .
â€œThatâ€
™ s not something
Iâ€ ™ m entirely proud of .
My kids were embarrassed by it , â€ �
he said in a town hall hosted by MSNBC .
â€œIf I had to do it again
, I wouldnâ€ ™ t.â€ �
Time will soon tell whether his repentance will be too little , too late ."
2016-03-10,"Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have joined 13 other GOP senators to introduce a Senate resolution calling on Barack Obama to change nearly eight years of policy and open GuantÃ¡namo Bay to new detainees captured from the Islamic State .
The move follows the capture of Sleiman Daoud al - Afari , a man described as Isisâ€ ™ s chemical weapons chief , whose apprehension has reignited the political controversy over the future of the detention facility .
Hours after the introduction of the resolution , the Pentagon announced it had already transferred the alleged senior Isis figure to Iraqi government custody .
The Senate resolution , spearheaded by Steve Daines of Montana , comes as the administration faces a dilemma that has vexed senior Pentagon officials and military officers : what to do with the battlefield captures that will inevitably occur as Obama escalates the war against Isis while he also makes his final push to close GuantÃ¡namo .
While the resolution will have no binding legal force on Obama , it displays the latest argument from the GOP - led Senate to block the White Houseâ€ ™ s
GuantÃ¡namo closure plan â€ “ a central aspect of which involves winning the support of Congress for a proposal it has vigorously and consistently resisted .
â€œAll individuals captured by the United States during combat operations against Isil that meet the criteria by their affiliation with Isil must be detained outside the United States and its territories and should be transferred to United States Naval Station , GuantÃ¡namo Bay , â€ � the proposed Senate resolution reads in part .
Isil is another name for Isis .
Cruz , who claims he is the last candidate who can stop Donald Trump becoming the Republican nominee , urged Congress to exercise its â€œconstitutional authorityâ€ � , a reference to Article 1 , Section 8â€ ™ s empowerment of Congress to â€œmake rules concerning captures on land and waterâ€ � .
A statement from Cruz accompanying the resolution announcement began : â€œJihadists who seek to kill Americans should not be brought to American soil.â€ � Obamaâ€ ™ s longstanding plans for emptying GuantÃ¡namo of its 91 remaining occupants include convincing Congress to remove a legal ban on transferring GuantÃ¡namo detainees to the mainland United States for either continued detention or trial before civilian courts and military tribunals .
Rubio , whose campaign for the Republican nomination is in dire straits , stated : â€œThere should be no confusion in the minds of our enemies that , if captured , they will be sent to the detention facility in GuantÃ¡namo Bay to be interrogated.â€ �
Various military commanders have for years expressed discomfort that Obamaâ€ ™ s commitment to emptying GuantÃ¡namo has inhibited them from capturing terrorist suspects beyond the declared battlefield of Afghanistan .
Those captures have been the exception , and drone strikes and other lethal attacks have been the rule .
Now that Iraq , with Syria , is once again a theater of war â€ “ though undeclared as such by Congress â€ “
US military officers are sounding alarms over the absence of clear rules surrounding detentions policy , particularly for long - term detentions and interrogations .
Unlike the GOP senators , they have not yet called for Obama to make GuantÃ¡namo Bay an option for those detentions .
Gen Joseph Votel , Obamaâ€ ™ s choice to oversee the anti - Isis war at US Central Command and a veteran leader of the elite special operations forces that conduct capture raids , raised the issue with the Senate this week as it considers his nomination .
â€œThe ability to detain individuals is essential â€ “ a fundamental [ tenet ] of fighting and winning the current fight ,
â€ �
Votel wrote in a statement for the Senate armed services committee for the record , citing the importance of interrogations to gather â€œotherwise unobtainable actionable intelligenceâ€ � .
â€œRelated and pertinent is the development of an effective long - term policy for the detainment of enemy combatants which would allow holding certain enemy combatants indefinitely to fuel increased exploitation , â€ �
Votel continued .
Yet there is little indication that Pentagon officials are moving from their current position on detentions .
Last month , US special operations forces captured Sleiman Daoud al - Afari , who has been described as Isisâ€ ™ s chemical weapons chief , and had been holding him in what defense officials describe as a temporary detention center .
On Thursday , the Pentagon announced it had transferred him to Iraqi government custody that morning , following what it described as a successful interrogation .
â€œThrough Dawud , the coalition learned details about Isilâ€ ™ s chemical weapon facilities and production , as well as the people involved .
The information has resulted in multiple coalition airstrikes that have disrupted and degraded Isilâ€ ™ s ability to produce chemical weapons and will continue to inform our operations in the future , â€ � Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said .
In his statement to the Senate , Votel also appeared to endorse that approach : â€œDetaining and exploiting enemy personnel and materiel prior to turning them over to partner nations is critical â€ “ we must retain this policy going forward , â€ �
he said .
Despite the resolutionâ€ ™ s introduction , the White House is holding to its current policy of attempting to achieve the closure of GuantÃ¡namo via Congress .
â€œThe administration looks forward to working with Congress to identify an appropriate facility for future detention , to lifting the statutory prohibitions , and to identifying the precise costs associated with doing so , â€ � said Myles Caggins , detentions spokesman at the National Security Council .
It is unclear when the Senate might vote on the resolution .
An aide to Daines suggested that it might take months , until the Senate appropriations committee considers a military construction bill that might be the next opportunity for GuantÃ¡namo - related legislation .
Admiral Kurt Tidd , the new chief of US Southern Command , the military command overseeing GuantÃ¡namo , pledged to continue what he described as professional and humane detentions at the facility â€œuntil the very last detainee steps on an airplane and departs the islandâ€ � .
Kidd praised his forces for their â€œutmost discipline , professionalism and integrityâ€ � during a hearing of the Senate armed services committee on Thursday ."
2016-03-10,"The stakes for two Republican candidates for president â€ “ Ohio governor John Kasich and Florida senator Marco Rubio â€ “ could not be higher at this point in the primary .
Both men need wins in their respective home states next week to continue their campaigns .
So when Fox News gave each of the four remaining Republican presidential candidates a full hour in primetime to make their pitch to voters before Florida , Ohio , Illinois , North Carolina and Missouri vote on Tuesday , they didnâ€ ™ t hold back .
Kasich led off with a town hall moderated by Greta Van Susteren with mostly undecided voters in Illinois .
Unsurprisingly , he played it true to form â€ “ heavy on sober policy prescriptions , delivered in his somewhat rambling , stream - of - consciousness style .
You have to give Kasich credit : he entered the race running as the accomplished governor of a critical swing state who pledged to stay above the fray , and he hasnâ€ ™ t veered from that path .
As so many of his rivals fell into the trap of political mud wrestling with Trump , Kasich stuck to his game plan .
Even if Kasich comes up short in this race , which is almost a certainty regardless of whether he wins Ohio or not , he has run a campaign that leaves him as an attractive VP option for whoever ends up with the nomination .
The same canâ€ ™ t be said for Marco Rubio , who had to spend part of his hour admitting that it was a mistake for him to get into the personal attack tit - for - tat with Trump .
Then , without Trump there in person to spar with , he turned his focus back on Trumpâ€ ™ s failure to offer meaningful policy prescriptions for the problems that plague the country .
When it came to policy , Rubio â€ “ as usual â€ “ excelled , even ably handling questions about his previous support for the politically poisonous Gang of 8 immigration bill .
He still needs a dramatic moment that will lead to voters giving him a second look as his campaign death spirals .
He didnâ€ ™ t get it tonight .
Meanwhile , Texas senator Ted Cruz , who is quickly consolidating the anti - Trump voting block , spent his hour trying to solidify his position as the partyâ€ ™ s best and likely only chance at stopping Trump .
While Cruz said all the right things , and sounded all the conservative dog whistles , the optics of the event were odd .
The built - in amen choir at the Cruz event , held at a mega - church in North Carolina , seemed to cheer his every word .
It was distracting , as was Cruzâ€ ™ s delivery , which bordered on big - tent evangelist .
Cruz didnâ€ ™ t stumble , didnâ€ ™ t do anything to stall his growing momentum , but he probably didnâ€ ™ t do anything to seal the deal with voters who are leaning towards either Kasich or Rubio .
Donald Trump , as usual , was the eveningâ€ ™ s main attraction .
Ahead in the delegate count and ahead in the polls , it is all about running out the clock .
Trump is not a typical candidate , and he hardly delivers a typical political stump speech , but there is no question that the political neophyte has been a quick study .
Trump is a vastly better candidate than he was just a few months ago .
He seemed restrained by Trump standards last night .
He looked , dare I say , almost ... presidential .
He was short on policy specifics , but his voters arenâ€ ™ t coming for wonky policy details .
What he lacks in policy chops he more than compensates for in his ability to connect to voters .
He knows his voters , he knows what they want to hear , and he gives it to them , delivering a powerful emotional moment in his rally when a marine vet , left disfigured by an IED explosion , came on stage to ask him what he would do about healthcare for veterans .
Another sign of Trumpâ€ ™ s growing confidence about his prospects for securing the nomination : he barely mentioned his primary opponents .
Instead of attacking his Republican rivals , Trump made the case that he would be the best candidate to defeat Hillary Clinton .
And he didnâ€ ™ t make a terrible case ."
2016-03-11,"Marco Rubio scored a huge hit on the Republican debate stage in Miami on Thursday night , with strident rhetoric on the subject of Barack Obamaâ€ ™
s reopening of relations with Cuba .
The Florida senator , the son of Cuban migrants , is seeking to win the Florida primary on Tuesday and thus rescue his flagging campaign for the White House .
He was asked about Obamaâ€ ™ s trip later this month to Cuba , which is still governed by the communist Castro regime .
Rubio was asked why the United States should not engage further with Cuba .
Rubio said the US changes had allowed money to flow to the Castro regime , and added : â€œNothing will change for the Cuban people â€ ¦
In fact things are worse , than they were before this opening.â€
�
The only result of â€œthe openingâ€ � , he said , was that the Cuban government had more sources of money .
It was a huge applause line .
Donald Trump , who leads Rubio comfortably in polls in Florida , had previously said on the campaign trail that opening Cuba was fine .
Under attack in the Miami debate from all the candidates who trail him in the polls and the mounting delegate count , he said â€œI want a much better deal with Cubaâ€ � and repeated a familiar line : â€œWe donâ€ ™ t make any good deals.â€ � â€œI do agree that something should take place , â€ � he added .
â€œAfter 50 years itâ€
™ s enough time , folks .
But we have to make a good deal here.â€ �
In response , Rubio rattled down a list of anti - Castro grievances and was applauded wildly again , drowning out attempts to ask Senator Ted Cruz â€ “ the son of a Cuban father and an American mother
â€ “ the next question .
Would you break diplomatic relations with Cuba , Cruz was asked .
â€œYes
I would , â€ � Cruz says .
Cruz said the question illustrated â€œa real difference between usâ€ � on foreign policy .
Trump , Cruz said , supports the â€œsame basic trajectoryâ€ � of policy as Obama and Hillary Clinton , when Obamaâ€ ™ s first secretary of state , have established .
John Kasich , the fourth man onstage , was asked if he would encourage US companies to do business with Cuba .
Kasich said he would not .
Trump , meanwhile , repeated : â€œWe would not do the deal unless it would be a very good deal for us.â€
�
Then he skipped to the Iran nuclear â€ ¦ deal ."
2016-03-11,"A top spokesman for Marco Rubio urged the Florida senatorâ€ ™ s supporters in Ohio to vote for John Kasich in their stateâ€ ™ s upcoming primary .
In an appearance on CNN , Alex Conant , the communications director for Rubio , said â€œIf you are a Republican primary voter in Ohio and you want to defeat Donald Trump , your best chance in Ohio is John Kasich.â€ � Ohio has a winner - take - all primary and polls in the state show Kasich and Trump neck and neck while Rubio is mired in the single digits .
The Kasich campaign , though , was not willing to return the favor .
A campaign spokesman told the Associated Press , â€œWe were going to win in Ohio without his help , just as heâ€ ™ s going to lose in Florida without ours.â€ �
The outright plea for tactical voting is deeply unusual in American politics and speaks to the desperation of those opposed to Donald Trump to deny him the 1,237 delegates needed to obtain the Republican nomination .
Many in the GOP are now actively hoping for a contested convention as their last best chance to prevent Trump being the Republican standard bearer in November .
However , addressing reporters at a press conference in a Florida synagogue , Rubio declined to explicitly say that Ohio voters should cast their ballots for Kasich .
When asked about his spokesmanâ€ ™ s comments , Rubio said : â€œIf an Ohio voter is motivated by stopping Donald Trump and comes to the conclusion John Kasich is the only one who can beat him there , then I expect thatâ€ ™ s the decision theyâ€ ™ ll make.â€ � â€œClearly John Kasich has a better chance of winning Ohio than I do , and if a voter concludes that voting for John Kasich gives them the best chance of stopping Donald Trump there , I anticipate thatâ€ ™ s what theyâ€ ™
ll do.â€
�
The senator , who said he had not spoken with Kasich on the subject , added that he was the only contender who could defeat Trump in Florida and reiterated the message he has taken to voters in recent days who may be weighing an alternative .
â€œIâ€ ™ m telling people in Florida the truth : a vote for Ted Cruz or a vote for John Kasich in Florida is a vote for Donald Trump , â€ � he said .
â€œIf you want to stop Donald Trump in Florida , any vote but a vote for me is a vote for Donald Trump.â€ �
Rubio has staked his entire presidential campaign on his ability to win his home stateâ€ ™ s winner - take - all primary .
Currently , he trails Trump in polls of the Sunshine State by double - digit margins .
Pressed again later on whether he was urging Ohioans to vote for Kasich or simply anticipating that they would , Rubio again demurred .
â€œIâ€ ™ ll leave it to John to make that argument , â€ � he said .
â€œI suspect that a voter in Ohio that doesnâ€ ™ t want Donald Trump to win Ohio may very well conclude that the best way to stop him in Ohio is to vote for John Kasich and I respect that.â€ � Chris Schrimpf , a spokesman for the Kasich campaign , said his camp agreed with the Rubioâ€ ™ s , â€œthat the best chance to beat Donald Trump in Ohio is by voting for John Kasich , and in that spirit , Senator Rubio should immediately tell his Super Pac to stop attacking the governor.â€ �"
2016-03-11,"Though Ben Carson was repeatedly mocked by the media â€ “ incidents like his confused debate entrance made it all too easy â€ “ the retired neurosurgeon did have the support of many Republicans .
Just before he dropped out of the race , polling averages put Carson at 9 %
â€ “ slightly ahead of John Kasich and less than 10 percentage points behind Marco Rubio .
So does Carsonâ€ ™ s endorsement of Donald Trump count for more than those of the seven other politicians who have already done the same ?
You might not recognize everyone on Trumpâ€ ™ s list of political endorsements .
Here are the names so far : Representative Scott DesJarlais Representative Tom Marino Senator Jeff Sessions Governor Paul R LePage Governor Chris Christie Representative Duncan D Hunter Representative Chris Collins Those titles could matter .
FiveThirtyEight assigns points to endorsements based on an individualâ€ ™ s role in office , using a scoring system that may have been a good historical predictor of success , but may make less sense in this election where political experience seems to count for so little and anti - establishment spirit is running so high .
According to their model , an endorsement from a representative means 1 point , from a senator 5 points and from a governor 10 points .
The numbers arenâ€ ™ t looking great for Trump â€ “ the seven politicians who have backed him so far mean a total score of 29 , the lowest on the table .
Marco Rubio currently has 67 endorsements , which together create a total score of 168 , while Cruz has 49 points .
You may have noticed that the list of seven white men who have endorsed Donald Trump so far doesnâ€ ™ t include Sarah Palin , who announced her support for the billionaireâ€ ™ s bid for presidency in January .
Thatâ€ ™ s because , as a former governor of Alaska , Palin scores no points in the FiveThirtyEight league tables .
But perhaps she holds sway among Republican voters .
Since Palinâ€ ™ s retirement from mainstream politics , polls have continued to ask US respondents about their attitudes towards her .
Since 2008 , positive sentiment towards Palin has plummeted but overall , more Republicans report a favorable opinion of her than an unfavorable one .
In August 2013 , Monmouth University found that Palinâ€ ™ s net favorability among Republicans was still at a relatively healthy + 27 percentage points ( among all voters though , her net favorability was -35
percentage points
â€ “ numbers that are strikingly similar to those for Trump ) .
Are the numbers reliable ?
Palin probably thinks so .
In February , when polls revealed that Trump was leading the Republican race , Palin commented : Usually , I say polls are only good for strippers and cross - country skiers , but in this case , I do think that the polls are accurate and are reflecting that the American people , the electorate ... weâ€ ™ re looking for something different .
More recent numbers are available for other individuals who have endorsed Trump .
So far this year , 10 polls have asked whether respondents have a favorable opinion of Chris Christie â€
“
all of them have found a negative overall response .
On average , Christieâ€ ™ s net favorability is -18 percentage points .
Ben Carson fares slightly better .
On average , polls show Carsonâ€ ™ s net favorability at -9 percentage points (
donâ€ ™ t forget that still means that on average , 36 % of Republicans have a positive attitude towards Carson ) .
If history is any guide , those numbers could change .
From March to December last year , Carson was consistently showing positive net favorability in polls â€ “ hardly surprising given that he was in second place in the Republican race , behind Trump .
His support may have fallen and he might not hold political office , but Carson is still an asset to Trump .
Last month , Public Policy Polling described Carson as â€œthe most broadly popular Republicanâ€ � based on net favorability of the candidates that were then left in the race .
Perhaps divisive Trump ( who was considered favorable by 64 % of Republicans and unfavorable by 27 % ) could even learn a thing or two from Ben Carson ."
2016-03-11,"The subject of climate change was raised on Thursday at the Republican debate in Miami â€ “ a city with pressing concerns about its effects .
Marco Rubio , the Florida senator fighting strongly on home ground as he sought to revive his presidential campaign , was asked : â€œWill
you acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus of climate change?â€ �
Rubio said : â€œSure , the climate is changing â€ ¦
There was never a time when the climate was not changing.â€ �
But Rubio then said flooding in south Florida was caused by the fact that it was built on a swamp .
He favored mitigation measures , he said .
â€œAs far as a law that we can pass in Washington that can change the weather?â€ � he asked .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s no such thing.â€
�
Rubio then moved on to a familiar theme , decrying the Obama - era Environmental Protection Agency , emissions regulations and â€œthe war on coalâ€
� .
â€œThese laws that people are asking us to pass will do nothing for the environment and hurt the economy , â€ � Rubio said .
The debate continued , Ohio governor John Kasich saying that â€œI do believe we contribute to climate changeâ€ � but adding : â€œYou can have strong environmental policy at the same time as you have strong economic growth.â€ �
The question and the candidatesâ€ ™ responses may not have much impact on the race going forward , including the Florida primary on Tuesday .
A poll from Quinnipiac University last month found that 7 % of Democrats rate climate change as the most important issue in determining which candidate they support for the partyâ€ ™ s presidential nominee .
But when Republicans were asked the same question , the results were so low ( less than 1 % ) that Quinnipiac simply reported climate change issues with â€œâ€“â€ � in the results summary .
In response to the exchanges on the Republican stage , the leader in the Democratic nomination race , former secretary of state Hillary Clinton , tweeted a reference to a familiar GOP campaign line : â€œRepublican candidates deny climate change because theyâ€ ™ re â€˜not
scientistsâ€
™
.â€
�
The line was not actually used in the debate ."
2016-03-11,"The mayor of Miami Beach , one of the US cities most vulnerable to sea level rise , has criticized Marco Rubio after the presidential hopeful said that itâ€ ™ s not possible to â€œchange the weatherâ€ � or the rising oceans through government regulation .
Asked if he accepted the reality of human - induced climate change , Rubio , a US senator for Florida and running for his partyâ€ ™ s presidential nomination , said : â€œIf the climate is changing , one of the reasons is because the climate has always been changing.â€
�
Speaking at the Republication presidential debate in Miami on Thursday , Rubio said the flooding experienced by Miami is due to the the city â€œlargely built on land that was once a swampâ€ � .
â€œAnd number two , because if there is higher sea levels or whatever it may be happening , we do need to deal with that through mitigation , â€ �
he told the CNN event .
â€œAnd I have long supported mitigation efforts .
But as far as a law that we can pass in Washington to change the weather , thereâ€ ™ s no such thing.â€
� Rubio , who is badly trailing Donald Trump in the race to be the Republication nominee , said Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s clean power plan , aimed at slashing greenhouse gas emissions , would â€œdevastateâ€ � the American economy , all while other countries continued to pump out planet - warming gases .
â€œIf you took the gift list of all of these groups that are asking us to pass these laws and did every single one of them , there would be no change in our environment , â€ � he said .
â€œSea level would still rise .
All these other things that are happening would continue to go on for a lot of different reasons .
â€œOne , because America is not a planet .
Itâ€ ™ s a country .
And number two , because these other countries like India and China are more than making up in carbon emissions for whatever we could possibly cut.â€ � Tomas Regalado , the Republican mayor of Miami , has endorsed Rubio but via the debateâ€ ™ s host Jake Tapper he questioned whether the senator accepted the mainstream scientific position on climate change and his commitment to combat the problem .
Rubio said Regalado is a â€œgreat mayor and a good friendâ€ � but said that any laws to reduce emissions would drive up power bills in Miami and cause the mayor a political headache .
Philip Levine , mayor of neighboring Miami Beach , said Rubio was â€œ100 % using the language of a climate change denierâ€ � and has overlooked the escalating problem of sea level increases for south Florida .
Miami Beach has already spent $ 100 m on new sea defenses to curb the regular flooding of its western half .
Sea levels are expected to rise in south - east Florida by six to 10 inches by 2030 , with ever increasing levels throughout the century unless greenhouse gases are severely cut .
These increases risk inundating large areas of the region , with 2.4 million people living within 4 ft of the local high tide line .
â€œUnfortunately , Senator Rubio went to his usual talking points , fed to him by his donors in the sugar and energy industry , â€ � said Levine .
â€œAccording to him , America
shouldnâ€
™ t be a leader in the greatest challenge of our generation .
If he were around during World War II , heâ€ ™ d want us to sit on the sidelines and leave Britain to its fate .
â€œHe made the amazing statement that America is not a planet .
Iâ€ ™ m sure he had to go onto Wikipedia to get that information .
He said heâ€ ™ s all for making cities resilient but heâ€ ™
s done absolutely nothing as a US senator for us , heâ€ ™ s never come to Miami Beach to meet with us .
The only time he comes down here is for a fundraiser.â€ � Levine said he was more impressed by Ohio governor John Kasich , who said he accepts the science of climate change , but that he was disappointed that the other candidates , Trump and Ted Cruz , werenâ€ ™ t also asked about climate change .
A coalition of 21 Florida mayors wrote to the networks broadcasting the two Miami debates this week â€ “ the Democratic debate was on Wednesday â€ “ to demand that questions were put over sea level rise and climate change .
The US experienced its warmest year on record in 2015 , with the lower 48 states emerging from the warmest winter on record this year .
The leading Republican presidential candidates have pledged to scrap Obamaâ€ ™ s plan to limit emissions from power plants and have criticized the landmark Paris climate deal , which committed 196 nations , including the US , to cut emissions ."
2016-03-11,"Donald Trump hopes to make a decisive move towards the 1,237 delegates he needs to lock up the Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday , when Florida , Illinois , Missouri , North Carolina , Ohio and the Northern Mariana Islands all vote , with a total of 367 delegates up for grabs as the contest moves to a winner - takes - all phase in many states .
Texas senator Ted Cruz is attempting to encourage Republicans to rally round him as the â€œstop Trumpâ€ � candidate .
But increasingly the GOP establishment have been floating the idea of preventing the New York businessman from winning the nomination not at the ballot box but in a â€œcontested conventionâ€ � , which would bring another candidate â€ “ Florida senator Marco Rubio , Ohio governor John Kasich and 2012 GOP duo Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan
have all been floated â€ “ in over the heads of the voters at the partyâ€ ™ s July convention .
â€œReagan and Ford battled it out in a contested convention , â€ �
Cruz told Fox News this week .
â€œThatâ€
™ s what conventions are
for.â€ �
For the first time since the invention of social media and 24-hour cable news , a major party may decide its presidential nominee on the convention floor .
But what exactly is a contested convention ?
Smoke - filled rooms
In the dark ages of American politics , the elaborate politicking of a presidential primary was once condensed into a political convention .
For decades , instead of a long public process during which candidates traipsed from Iowa to New Hampshire and onwards across the country for series of primaries and caucuses , presidential nominees were chosen in overheated convention halls and the smoke - filled rooms in adjacent hotels .
However , as more states instituted primaries to select their delegates , a process that accelerated greatly in the 1970s , the conventions receded in importance .
The last political convention to go to more than one ballot was the Democratsâ€ ™ in 1952 , when they nominated Adlai Stevenson .
And the last one where there was even a shred of suspense â€ “ as Cruz recalled â€ “ was held by the Republicans in 1976 when Ronald Reagan forced Gerald Ford into a primary contest in an unsuccessful attempt to snatch the nomination from the incumbent presidentâ€
™ s grip .
Reagan would have to wait until 1980 before becoming his partyâ€ ™ s candidate and winning two terms as president .
The Republican partyâ€ ™ s rules require that the winning candidate for the presidential nomination receives the support of a majority of delegates at the party convention , which this year will be held in Cleveland in July .
With 2,473 delegates attending the convention , this means the nominee needs the support of 1,237 of those attending .
However , with four candidates still in the race , even Trump , the frontrunner , may not reach this threshold , and the partyâ€ ™ s byzantine rules then create the potential for anarchy to ensue .
The problems come in several forms .
The first is that since conventions have been long thought to be vestigial parts of American politics , candidatesâ€ ™ campaigns are not fully prepared for the delegate chase â€ “ a full scale 50-state scramble .
Campaigns have to take care to not just make the ballot in every state but to fill their slates of delegates with names and ensure that those delegates pledged to them are actual supporters and not what veteran Republican strategist John Yob calls â€œsupporters in name onlyâ€
� , or Sinos .
Yob , who guided delegate strategy for Rand Paulâ€ ™ s failed presidential campaign this year and is also the author of Campaign Chaos , a book on a potential contested convention , told the Guardian that one of the key tells for a successful delegate effort was â€œhow effective campaigns are at keeping Sinos from being electedâ€ � .
Some delegates could ignore primary results In addition , in many states delegates are in fact selected in an entirely separate process from the primaries currently being carried out under such vast media scrutiny .
In the event of a contested convention , the primary votersâ€ ™ decisions in such states like Michigan and Virginia potentially could be completely ignored by the delegates .
According to the prevailing interpretation of current Republican National Committee rules , though , delegates are bound on the first ballot by the results of their stateâ€ ™ s nominating contest .
However , after that , many ( the rules vary state by state ) can do what they want .
Furthermore , the convention itself decides what rules govern it , and delegates are not bound when it comes to votes on changing the rules .
The common belief is that the candidate most under threat from a contested convention would be Donald Trump .
The Republican frontrunner is a political outsider who is viewed as anathema by many in the GOP establishment .
The hope among some in the Republican party is that even if Trump achieves a clear majority , delegates formally bound to the real estate mogul on the first ballot would in fact vote to change the rules and then defect .
However , Barry Bennett , a top Trump operative dealing with much of the delegate process for his campaign , told the Guardian : â€œOur theory all along is that we have to get delegates that are not part of politics of usual and [ are ] 100 % loyal to us.â€ �
In addition , up to 112 delegates
â€ “ many of whom come from territories and not states â€ “ will arrive at the convention without any obligation to support a particular candidate .
As Yob noted , delegations such as those from Guam , American Samoa and the Virgin Islands ( where he is standing to be a delegate ) will play a crucial role as a result .
These unbound delegates , though , should not be interpreted as agents of the party establishment who will act in tandem to block Trump .
As Bennett noted : â€œI know what these delegates want .
They want a deal .
They are going to act in their own self - interest , and not in the interest of Rubio , Cruz or Romney .
Itâ€ ™ s like herding cats .
This notion that they will all line up together , itâ€ ™ s just ludicrous.â€
�
Bennett , the Trump operative , who previously served as Ben Carsonâ€ ™ s campaign manager on an effort where delegates from the territories were assiduously courted , was also scornful of the idea that the unpledged delegates would â€œlay down , put their self - interest aside to vote for an establishment candidateâ€ � .
In addition , all of the delegates from three states â€ “ Colorado , North Dakota and Wyoming â€ “ will be unbound , as will portions of the delegations from Louisiana and Oklahoma .
The result is that internal machinations in obscure contests such as the Colorado state convention in April could be as important as far better - covered events such as Super Tuesday .
Major obstacle â€ ¦ for anyone but Trump Campaigns also face another obstacle in Rule 40b of the Republican party , which states that candidates need to win the support of a majority of the delegations in eight different states or territories to have their name placed into nomination at a convention .
So far , Trump has won seven states under this rule , Cruz has won four and Rubio has only one .
Party insiders have long assumed that the rule , implemented solely to block libertarian
Ron Paulâ€ ™ s name from being placed into nomination in 2012 , would be modified before the 2016 convention .
If and until it is , however , it serves as a major obstacle for candidates seeking to have their names considered on the first ballot .
( The Cruz campaign dispatched an operative to Guam in August under the assumption that Rule 40b might still apply and to gain a leg up . )
How a contested convention would play out is still unclear .
One Republican operative familiar with the delegate process claimed to the Guardian that â€œCruz has the highest - quality delegatesâ€ � .
The operative ranked Trump second , Rubio third and Kasich last in this regard .
The Republican noted that while Trump â€œfiles more delegates than any other campaignâ€ � , the impression left is that â€œhe sends out a mass email [ to supporters ] and encourages everyone to applyâ€ � â€ “ in other words , that he carries out little checking into whether his delegates are truly loyal .
Would it damage the GOP ?
Almost every recent example of a contested convention has ended badly for the party concerned .
â€œWhen you look back in history , highly contested conventions tended to be a disadvantage to the party that had them , â€ �
Yob said â€ “ although he noted there were exceptions , the most recent being Franklin Delano Rooseveltâ€ ™ s
White House victory after a multi - ballot convention in 1932 .
Yet because of the unique nature of Trump supporters , many of whom are new to the Republican party , a contested convention in 2016 may be less damaging than might be assumed .
Rick Tyler , a former top aide to Cruz , told the Guardian a contested convention â€œwould cause minimal damage , and the reason I say that is because a significant portion of Trumpâ€ ™ s voters are not party peopleâ€ � .
They were not â€œthe people who show up to county committee meetings , state committee meetingsâ€ � , he said .
â€œThese arenâ€ ™ t our folks.â€
� â€˜You would have a revoltâ€ ™
To Tyler , if no one gets 1,237 delegates , â€œTrump will be on equal footing with everybody elseâ€
� .
In his view , â€œeveryone who wants to put their name forth for nomination would be on equal footing and
then â€ ¦
letâ€
™ s assume they go through the process of casting the first ballot and then all the deal - making begins.â€
�
However , he did see potential for a contested convention to greatly weaken the party .
â€œIf the establishment tries to put in a Mitt Romney or Paul Ryan or someone like that because you would have a revolt , â€ � said Tyler .
â€œNow conservatives would be aligned with the Trump people.â€ �
But top Republican operatives are still skeptical that a contested convention will come to pass .
Stuart Stevens , a top consultant for Romney in 2012 and author of The Innocent Have Nothing To Fear , a novel about a contested convention , noted that Trump is likely to win every delegate in New York and New Jersey and is skeptical about any scenario where the frontrunner does not get to the magic 1,237 threshold â€ “ provided he wins Floridaâ€ ™ s winner - take - all primary on Tuesday .
Stevens thought if Trump was under 1,000 delegates at the time of the convention , â€œhe could be beatâ€ � .
Cruz has called the possibility of a contested convention â€œthe fevered talk of the Washington
establishmentâ€ � .
But Stevens dismissed this : â€œThe guy who is running second saying I think
itâ€ ™ s dishonorable to win in overtime â€ ¦ Real men donâ€ ™ t kick field goals.â€
�
In 1924 , HL Mencken wrote of that yearâ€ ™ s Democratic national convention : â€œThere is something about a national convention that makes it as fascinating as a revival or a hanging .
It is vulgar , it is ugly , it is stupid , it is tedious , it is hard upon both the higher cerebral centers and the gluteus maximus , and yet it is somehow charming.â€ �
Yet that description sums up an era in which the entire modern year - long primary process was consolidated into a few days .
As Clarke Reed , the former chair of the Mississippi Republican party who played a key role in the last contested convention in 1976 , told the Guardian far more laconically , a contested convention this year is â€œlikely to lead to all kinds of games being playedâ€ � ."
2016-03-12,"Marco Rubio on Saturday hedged on whether he would support Donald Trump as the Republican nominee for president .
Addressing reporters ahead of a rally in Largo , Florida , one day after a Trump rally in Chicago was canceled amid clashes between his supporters and protesters , and as Trump cancelled an event scheduled for Ohio on Sunday , the senator offered a blistering critique of frontrunnerâ€ ™ s incitement of violence at his events .
â€œItâ€ ™ s called chaos , anarchy and thatâ€ ™ s
what weâ€ ™ re careening toward , â€ � Rubio said of the atmosphere surrounding Trump .
â€œWe are being ripped apart at the seams now , and itâ€ ™ s disturbing .
I am sad for this country .
This country is supposed to be an example to the world.â€ �
Asked if he would still support Trump if he were the partyâ€ ™ s nominee , the senator responded : â€œI donâ€ ™ t know .
I intend to support the Republican nominee , but
[ itâ€ ™ s ] getting harder every day.â€ �
Rubioâ€ ™ s comments reflected the first cracks in a pledge taken by all Republican candidates to support the eventual nominee .
At a debate one week ago in Detroit , Rubio said he would support Trump because he would still be better than Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders .
The other Republican candidates , Texas senator Ted Cruz and Ohio governor John Kasich , have also committed to backing Trump if he is the nominee .
According to reporters with Kasich in Sharonville , Ohio , on Saturday , the governor also appeared to waver on the question of backing Trump .
â€œIt makes it extremely difficult , â€ � Kasich said .
On Saturday , a visibly frustrated Rubio said he continued to believe Clinton would be a bad president but said a Trump nomination would â€œshatter and fracture the Republican party and conservative movementâ€ � .
Rubio spent much of the press conference offering his sharpest rebuke yet of Trump , who he said bore some of the responsibility for violence and protests due to his actions and words .
â€œThis is what happens when a leading presidential candidate goes around feeding into a narrative of bitterness and anger and frustration , â€ � Rubio said .
Rubio was also critical of some of the Chicago protesters , who he said had arrived simply to create a scene .
He also blamed the media for its treating Trumpâ€ ™ s candidacy as more of a reality show throughout the election cycle .
â€œWe settle our differences in this country at the ballot box , not with guns or bayonets or violence , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œOur politics has become more like the comments section in blogs.â€
� Taking the stage at a rally moments later , Rubio reiterated the comments .
â€œLast night , we saw images that make America look like a third - world country , â€ � Rubio said , before laying into Trump once more .
â€œThe job of a leader is not to stoke peopleâ€ ™ s anger
â€
¦
There are consequences to that , and theyâ€ ™ re playing out before our eyes.â€ �
Rubio was especially critical about how protesters and the media have been treated at Trump rallies , particularly the business mogulâ€ ™ s record of encouraging his security and his supporters to use force against unwanted interruptions .
â€œIn many ways he doesnâ€ ™ t want to say anything to his supporters , because he doesnâ€ ™ t want to turn them off , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œBecause
he understands that the reason theyâ€ ™ re voting for him is because heâ€ ™ s tapped into this anger.â€ �
â€œThe problem is leadership has never been about taking peopleâ€ ™ s anger and using it to get them to vote for you .
If it is , itâ€ ™ s
a dangerous style leadership.â€ �"
2016-03-13,"Donald Trump has suffered a comprehensive defeat by Marco Rubio in Washington DC , where the divisive billionaire hopes to occupy the White House from January next year .
Rubio won Saturdayâ€ ™ s Republican presidential primary in the District of Columbia , edging out John Kasich and comfortably beating national frontrunners Trump and Ted Cruz .
The Florida senator took 37.3 % of the vote , giving him 10 delegates , while former Ohio governor Kasichâ€ ™ s 35.5 % earned him nine delegates .
Trump and Cruz left empty handed , as had been widely expected in the US capital , which is home to some former administration officials and has traditionally favoured establishment candidates .
But conservatives in the city that hosts the White House , Congress and the Lincoln Memorial are used to not having much of a say in who becomes president .
There are a mere 27,000 registered Republicans here , just 6 % of all voters .
No candidates campaigned in DC before Saturdayâ€ ™ s vote ; indeed , Trump and Cruzâ€ ™ s anti - establishment speeches often make Washington sound like a dirty word .
Although its influence was higher than normal this time
â€ “ there were 19 delegates at stake , as many as Hawaii and more than Vermont or Delaware â€ “ turnout was still a relatively low 2,839 , less than half the number who voted four years ago .
This may in part have been because voting was restricted to a single location , the downtown Loews Madison Hotel , on what proved a grey and drizzly day .
A glimpse of the queue snaking around several blocks , including determined parents holding babies and pushing strollers , may also have put some people off .
Colleen McKiernan , 29 , a healthcare consultant , arrived just before the cut off time of 4 pm .
â€œThis is ridiculous , â€ �
she said .
â€œWe were told it would take a couple of minutes to vote but
itâ€ ™ s six blocks long .
Iâ€ ™ m going to leave and itâ€ ™ s frustrating because I really wanted to vote.â€
�
But others stuck it out .
Ben Voelkel , 29 , a senatorial press secretary , waited more than three and a half hours to cast his ballot .
â€œIt was the longest line Iâ€ ™ ve ever had to wait in for anything , â€ � he said .
â€œAt first
I thought it might be a protest , then I said to someone there ,
Iâ€ ™ m impressed how many of us there are .
I didnâ€ ™ t think there are that many Republicans in DC .
It was exciting to see them all engaged in the process.â€ �
Voting was slow not only due to the presidential race but because 160 candidates , said to be a record in modern times , were running for election as delegates at the Republican convention in Cleveland , Ohio , in July .
Among those who were unsuccessful was Alyssa Abbinanti , 42 , a lawyer and Cruz supporter .
A Korean - American , she called for more diversity in the party , noting a sea of white male faces on the list of candidates .
â€œIâ€ ™ m in a minority on multiple levels , â€ � she said .
â€œI wish people would look at what we really stand for.â€
�
Washington is a Democratic stronghold that voted for Barack Obama in overwhelming numbers four years ago .
Dan Hemmati , 36 , a Rubio supporter , was accompanied on Saturday by his wife of three months , Amy , 35 , who is a Democrat .
â€œWe do have debates but theyâ€ ™ re always friendly , â€ � he said .
â€œRepublicans are a minority here but we find ways of making it work and keeping our mouths shut when we have to.â€ �
Hemmati was among many determined to vote against the maverick Trump , who has called for a ban on Muslims entering the US and a wall to be built on the Mexican border .
â€œThis is one of the most important elections in a long time .
Itâ€ ™ s a chance to show what the Republican party is all about .
Itâ€ ™ s not an exclusionist party of hate ; itâ€ ™ s the party of Lincoln and Reagan .
Donald Trump is not a Republican and not a Democrat .
Heâ€ ™ s just a hateful son of a bitch .
Heâ€ ™ s not a politician ; heâ€ ™ s a reality show actor trying to get publicity for his next show.â€
�
The buzz and bustle in the hotel corridors and stairways made a change for Patrick Mara , executive director of the DC Republican party , who is used to being the only Republican in the room .
â€œItâ€ ™ s pretty lonely , â€ � he smiled .
â€œEven
my wife is a Democrat.â€ � The DC presidential primary convention had been brought forward to avoid being too close to the national convention , giving it more influence in the race than usual .
Kasich , Rubio and â€œNeverTrumpâ€ � were most in evidence on badges , flyers , placards and stickers .
â€œItâ€ ™ s fantastic to see all these people come out to vote .
Your average DC Republican is well read in current events and world affairs .
We see so many people turn out because they know this is meaningful .
What they do today is not only local news but national and world news , â€ � Mara said ."
2016-03-15,"The Republican party will be consigned to the wilderness at Novemberâ€ ™ s US presidential election â€œand beyondâ€
� if it chooses Donald Trump as its candidate , rival Marco Rubio has said .
In an interview with the Guardian on Monday evening , the Florida senator â€ “ whose fate is likely to be sealed if he fails to win his home state on Tuesday night
â€ “ said the New York billionaire was an embarrassment who would not be respected around the world .
â€œIf weâ€ ™ re going to be the party of fear , weâ€ ™ re going to spend some time in the wilderness , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œIf weâ€ ™ re the party of fear , with a candidate who basically is trying to prey upon peopleâ€ ™ s fears to get them to vote for them , I think weâ€ ™ re going to pay a big price in November and beyond.â€ �
If elected , Trump would not have the respect of allies around the globe , Rubio warned .
â€œI think heâ€ ™ s already an embarrassment , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œPeople around the world are watching this debate and this campaign and wondering whatâ€ ™ s happening here , because the things he says are nonsensical .
â€œWhen youâ€ ™ re the most powerful and important nation on earth , youâ€ ™ re not always going to be popular , â€ � he added .
â€œBut the question is , are you respected ?
And I donâ€ ™ t think Donald Trump is going to be respected.â€ � Rubio , faced with a do - or - die moment for his presidential ambitions , has grown sharper in his criticism of Trump in recent weeks both on the stump and in the Republican debates .
But in the days before his home state will determine whether his campaign can continue , he also adopted a more reflective , and at times emotional , tone .
Speaking with the Guardian aboard his campaign bus in West Palm Beach , Rubio was visibly exasperated by what he felt would be a reckoning for the Republican party and conservative movement .
â€œYou have all kinds of people that are lifelong conservatives , or at least claim to be , who donâ€ ™ t seem to care that Donald Trump has never been and is not now a conservative on principles , â€ � he said .
â€œAnd theyâ€ ™ ve staked their reputation on their support of him.â€ � If any other Republican candidate were to assume Trumpâ€ ™ s positions on the issues , he or she â€œwould be characterized as a Rino [ Republican in Name Only ] by every major conservative outlet in Americaâ€ � , Rubio added .
â€œThese are people that â€ “ whether itâ€ ™ s now or five years from now or two years from now or six months from now â€ “ are going to be explaining for a long time how they fell into this.â€ �
The conversation occurred against the backdrop of what will be the greatest test of Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign : a winner - take - all contest in Florida that will award 99 delegates to the candidate who emerges on top .
Trump , according to many recent polls , leads Rubio by double digits .
While Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign has cited private polling showing a tighter race , aides privately concede a victory from behind on Tuesday would be a miracle .
So far , Rubio has won 153 delegates to Texas senator Ted Cruzâ€ ™ s 369 and Trumpâ€ ™ s 469 , achieving victory only in Minnesota , Puerto Rico and DC .
A total of 1,237 delegates are needed to win .
Of the other states to vote on Tuesday , he is trailing in fourth in polls in Ohio , Illinois and North Carolina , and is third in Missouri .
If Rubio fails , it wonâ€ ™ t be for a lack of trying .
The senator barnstormed the vast corners of his home state over the past 10 days , speaking with an urgency that acknowledged both his longshot odds and the high stakes for the direction of the country .
â€œIt always comes down to the state of Florida , â€ � he told the crowds who gathered to see their native son speak in diners , school gymnasiums and at the park where he once played as a boy .
â€œEmbrace leaders who do not ask you to give them your vote on fear and hopelessness , â€ �
Rubio implored .
â€œLeadership is not inciting people to get angrier .
Thatâ€ ™ s not leadership .
You know what it is ?
Thatâ€ ™ s called demagoguery.â€
�
He referred at times to the violent clashes that erupted at recent Trump rallies over the weekend , likening them to â€œthird world imagesâ€ � that posed a threat to the republic .
The impact of the scenes was such that Rubio , for the first time , said in a press conference on Saturday he no longer knew if he could commit to backing Trump as the Republican nominee .
Rubio told the Guardian he believed Trump was pursuing a strategy employed by strongman leaders that defied Americaâ€ ™ s founding values .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s arguing that he himself is the singular figure
thatâ€ ™ s going to do these amazing things for the country .
Heâ€
™ s asking us to basically make it a nation of a man instead of a nation of laws , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œOur founders chose a very different form of government â€ ¦
We donâ€ ™ t have political messiahs in America and every nation thatâ€ ™
s tried to find one has ended up finding that those people are fallible and make terrible mistakes .
When you deposit that much faith and confidence in one individual youâ€ ™ re bound to be let down.â€ �
The challenge for Rubio , or any candidate not named Trump , has nonetheless remained the faction of Republican primary voters who are inspired more by their frustration than by specific policies .
Should the business mogul win in Florida and Ohio on Tuesday , he is all but certain to steamroll his way to the nomination .
The Democratic party faces a similar clarifying moment in its race on Tuesday , as Bernie Sanders continues to engage Hillary Clinton in a duel that could grow more protracted should he pull off wins in the midwest and the south .
The Vermont senator has gained on Clinton in states such as Ohio , Illinois and Missouri , while the former secretary of state maintains wide leads in Florida and North Carolina .
A central premise of Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign has been that he would be the most formidable opponent for Clinton or any Democratic nominee .
In a sign of his own fixation with the race , Rubio mentioned aboard his bus a new poll out that morning of the Democratic - leaning Pennsylvania .
He was beating Clinton by eight points , he said , while Trump was trailing her by the same margin .
Rubio openly struggled to comprehend it , letting out a sigh and a shrug at the general election contest that may well remain a hypothetical for his candidacy .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know how this is all going to end .
This is uncharted territory , â€ � he said .
â€œBut from my mind , the Republican party has a very important decision to make : Are we going to be the party of fear or the party of optimism?â€ �"
2016-03-15,"On 15 March , the names of the remaining presidential candidates â€ “ Donald Trump , Ted Cruz , Marco Rubio and John Kasich on the Republican side , Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders for the Democrats â€ “ will be on ballot papers in five states and one US territory .
Although this Tuesday will be less frantic than Super Tuesday two weeks ago , when 12 states and one territory held primary elections , itâ€ ™ s just as important .
By 16 March , the race for the White House could look very different depending on how Florida , Illinois , Missouri , North Carolina and Ohio vote .
Thatâ€ ™ s partly because the delegate numbers in those states are so high â€ “ in total , 367 Republican and 792 Democratic delegates are available on 15 March .
That brings us significantly closer to the finish line of having just two presidential candidates : at the moment , 33 % of Democratic delegates have been pledged but by the time the polls have closed on 15 March , that number will rise to 50 % .
For Republicans , pledged delegates will jump from 46 % to 61 % .
Those percentages just mean that playing catch - up gets harder from here .
Clinton is still on track for the Democratic nomination â€ “ to change that , Sanders needs to pick up at least 326 of the pledged delegates ( in the Democratic race there are also 712 â€œsuperdelegatesâ€ � who are not pledged to a specific candidate based on primary results , so theyâ€ ™ re less relevant here ) .
The Republican contest is also likely to change significantly .
If , for example , Marco Rubio fails again to pick up a single delegate ( and polling suggests thatâ€ ™ s a real possibility ) , his pursuit of the 1,237 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination becomes futile â€ “ even if he were to win every single remaining delegate after 15 March .
Thatâ€ ™ s partly because , unlike Democrats , Republicans do not always distribute delegates in proportion to votes .
In fact , four states holding Republican primaries on 15 March will be the first in this election to assign delegates on a winner - takes - all basis , which is why this date is such a turning point in the 2016 political calendar .
Florida Primaries : Republican and Democratic presidential primaries Delegates : 99 Republican delegates , 246 Democratic delegates Things to watch out for : For Republicans , this is the most important state to vote on 15 March .
If Rubio were going to win big anywhere , it probably would be here , in his home state .
However , polling averages show that Trump has consistently been in first place for voters since September and is leading by 19 points in this winner - takes - all state .
Clinton , too , has had a clear lead in Florida for months â€ “ so far this month , polls have suggested she is 30 points ahead of Sanders .
Remember though , unlike the Republican race , the exact vote share matters for Democrats since this affects how delegates are distributed .
Sanders doesnâ€ ™ t need to win Florida , he needs only to erode Clintonâ€ ™ s lead here and collect around 100 of the pledged delegates that are available .
Demographics : Of the 15.9 million Floridians who are of voting age , 12 million are currently registered to vote .
The electorate is slightly older and more likely to be Hispanic than the national voting profile .
A poll from Monmouth earlier this month found that 35 % of Republicans donâ€ ™ t approve of the way that Rubio is handling his job as senator and just 7 % were undecided about who they would vote for .
Illinois Primaries : Republican and Democratic presidential primaries Delegates : 69 Republican delegates , 182 Democratic delegates Things to watch out for :
Illinois is a crucial state in the Democratic race .
Polling averages currently show that Clinton is ahead of Sanders by just 2 percentage points .
But thereâ€ ™ s a significant margin of error on those numbers , given that theyâ€ ™ re based on just three polls prior to which Clinton was easily leading in the double digits .
If polling turns out to be as flawed here as it was in Michigan last week , Sandersâ€ ™ climb to the White House might not be so uphill after all .
Thereâ€ ™ s also a lack of good polling data among Republicans that live here
â€ “ only six polls have been conducted here so far this year , but all show Trump with a small but steady lead on other candidates .
Demographics :
The profile of Illinoisâ€ ™ electorate is almost identical to the US national average .
And voter concerns are similar to those expressed nationally too â€ “ a CBS / You Gov poll of 1,681 registered voters in Illinois that was conducted from 9 - 11 March found that 74 % of respondents felt the economy in their state was doing badly .
Half of Republican voters in the poll said they felt that trade with other countries takes away US jobs
â€ “ a message that has been a key part of Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential campaign .
Missouri Primaries : Republican and Democratic presidential primaries Delegates : 52 Republican delegates , 84 Democratic delegates Things to watch out for : Although Missouri is holding Republican and Democratic primaries , the results of the Republican vote will not be binding â€ “ as was also the case in 2012 , when Rick Santorum won here .
Last September , the Missouri Republican state committee announced the rules governing this yearâ€ ™ s Republican primary : if a candidate wins an absolute majority of votes ( anything more than 50 % ) , Missouri will be a winner - take - all state ; if not , the candidate with the highest vote share in each congressional district would get five delegates , and the leading candidate statewide would be awarded nine delegates .
The remaining three delegates would be unbound , much like Democratic superdelegates .
In terms of outcomes , predicting the results in Missouri is pretty much guesswork .
Just two Democratic polls have been conducted there this year , and only one poll has asked Republican voters who they prefer â€ “ those surveys have suggested Sanders and Clinton are neck - and - neck while Trump is ahead of the Republican field .
But they simply arenâ€ ™ t a reliable indication of voter preferences in Missouri .
Demographics :
The electorate in Missouri is whiter with a slightly lower median household income than national averages .
Officials currently expect around 34 % of registered voters to show up and cast a ballot in Tuesdayâ€ ™ s primary â€ “ although this varies considerably throughout the state , from a projected low of 7 % turnout in Washington County to a high of 74 % in Caldwell County .
North Carolina Primaries : Republican and Democratic presidential primaries Delegates : 72 Republican delegates , 121 Democratic delegates Things to watch out for : Polls currently show Clinton leading steadily here and , to a lesser extent , Trump too .
Again , vote shares matter , including for Republicans â€ “
this is the only state where thereâ€ ™ s no minimum threshold to get delegates .
The GOP simply assigns them in proportion to votes received at the primary .
Results in North Carolina could be surprising â€ “ Trumpâ€
™ s lead here has varied in recent polls from just 9 points to as much as 20 .
Demographics : One in five voting - age residents of North Carolina are black ( nationally that figure is one in eight ) .
That might work against Sanders , who has struggled to appeal to black voters according to some exit polls .
Voter turnout was 35 % in 2012 and and 37 % in 2008 .
So far , Republicans have seen growth in primary turnout while the opposite is true for Democrats .
( There have been some exceptions â€ “ in Michigan , where Sanders won big last week , almost twice as many voters showed up as in 2008 . )
High turnout may work in Sandersâ€ ™ favour on 15 March .
Northern Mariana Islands Primaries : Republican caucus Delegates : 9 Republican delegates Things to watch out for :
The Northern Mariana Islands are a US commonwealth in the Pacific Ocean .
On Saturday , the first ever Democratic caucuses were held there .
Clinton received a total of 102 votes , Sanders received 65 and an additional 22 votes were cast for â€œuncommittedâ€ � .
As a result , Clinton collected an extra four delegates and Sanders two â€ “ on 15 March , nine Republican delegates will be chosen by Northern Mariana Islanders .
Demographics :
The islands have a population of 53,883 , according to the Census Bureau in 2010 .
No polling is available about the residentsâ€ ™ political preferences .
Ohio Primaries : Republican and Democratic presidential primaries Delegates : 66 Republican delegates , 159 Democratic delegates Things to watch out for
: This is the only state to vote on 15 March where Trump is not polling ahead of other candidates â€ “ John Kasich , who is the governor of Ohio , is 3 points ahead of him .
That might not sound like much , but Ohio is a winner - takes - all state with 66 GOP delegates available .
A win for Kasich wouldnâ€ ™ t give him any real chance of securing the nomination , but for Republicans , the strategy at this point may be simply about trying to erode Trumpâ€ ™ s delegate numbers as much as possible ( at least according to Rubio adviser Alex Conant ) .
If Kasich loses , he will almost certainly drop out of the race .
Clintonâ€ ™ s lead here has eroded in recent weeks from double digits to an average lead of 8 percentage points .
This is yet another state where Sanders might surpass expectations â€ “ particularly given the stateâ€ ™ s demographics .
Demographics :
Ohioâ€ ™ s electorate is whiter and has a slightly lower median household income than the US median ( $ 49,000 compared to $ 54,000 ) .
A poll from Quinnipiac University earlier this month found that gender could play a big role in Ohioâ€ ™ s primary for both parties .
The results showed that men back Trump over Kasich 40%-33 % while women choose Kasich 44%-37 % .
Among Democrats , the gaps were even larger with women backing Clinton over Sanders 56%-39 % and men choosing Sanders 55%-43 % .
As ever , itâ€ ™ s not just overall turnout numbers that matter , but more specifically which voters show up ."
2016-03-15,"Republicans go to the polls in five states on Tuesday facing a stark choice between Donald Trump and a protracted race that could descend into chaos and , some fear , potential violence .
On a critical day for the partyâ€ ™ s future , Trump could virtually lock up the nomination if he wins the delegate - rich states of Florida and Ohio , probably eliminating rivals Marco Rubio and John Kasich in the process .
But if the New York billionaire falls short , he could face an uphill struggle in the remaining primaries to clinch the 1,237 delegates needed for an outright win , raising the spectre of a contested Republican convention in July .
Even if Trump goes to the convention with the most delegates , the Republican establishment could mount a rearguard action to snatch the nomination from him .
Such a prospect has raised fears of a backlash from the populist outsider and his supporters , especially after a week in which his rallies seethed with discord and violence .
Ted Cruz , the Texas senator running second , has warned that meddling by the Washington establishment would cause a â€œmanifest uprisingâ€ � .
Host city Cleveland is planning to buy 2,000 sets of riot gear ahead of the convention .
Veteran journalist Dan Rather recalled the mayhem that engulfed the Democratic convention in 1968 , saying it was the only election year in his lifetime worse than 2016 .
â€œIf Trump wins Florida and Ohio , I think
heâ€
™ s the Republican nominee , â€ �
he told MSNBC .
But if he falls short of the delegate total needed , he added , â€œanything could happenâ€ � .
Despite the risks of such a scenario , many Republicans may see a potential floor fight under the worldâ€ ™ s gaze as the lesser of two evils .
Party elders are appalled at the prospect of a Trump nomination , regarding him as a demagogue and a bigot who will guarantee certain defeat by Hillary Clinton in November .
Rubio , while campaigning across his home state of Florida , cast the decision before voters on Tuesday as one that would determine not just the identity of the nation but also of the Republican party .
â€œTomorrow , you face a choice between optimism and fear , â€ � he told a crowd of a couple of hundred people who had assembled in the parking lot of a local diner in Melbourne .
Moments later , Rubio told reporters a Trump victory would â€œsplinter and divide the Republican partyâ€ � .
With each passing event , the senator only grew sharper in tone , swinging between being critical of Trumpâ€ ™ s rise and seeming helpless in the face of it .
â€œMy whole life
Iâ€ ™ ve been told being humble is a virtue , and now being humble is a weakness and being vain and self - absorbed is somehow a virtue , â€ �
Rubio told a packed gymnasium in West Palm Beach .
â€œMy whole life
I have been told no matter how you may feel about someone , you respect everyone because we are all children of the same God .
Now being respectful to one another is considered political correctness.â€
�
The senator is hoping for a historic victory from behind in Florida , where he trails Trump by double digits in many recent polls .
Barring an upset , Rubio is all but certain to suspend his presidential campaigning after the results are in .
He appeared to reach an acceptance of the prospect on Monday as the day wore on , capping off a bus tour at a park in West Miami blocks from where he grew up .
Switching between English and Spanish before the majority Latino audience , Rubio said : â€œNo matter where I go or what Iâ€ ™ ll be , I will always be a son of this community â€ ¦ I will always carry with me the hopes and dreams of the generations who made the dreams of mine.â€
�
At yet another tense event disrupted by protests in Tampa , Florida , on Monday , Trump made clear he is hoping to land a knockout punch on Tuesday night : â€œIf we win Ohio and we win Florida , then everybody agrees that itâ€ ™ s pretty much over
and then I can focus on Hillary , because thatâ€ ™ s what I really want to focus
on.â€
�
Watched by supporter
Sarah Palin , he also called on the party establishment to rally to his cause .
â€œThe Republican party has to come together .
Some of these people are angry people because theyâ€ ™ re not used to this .
One of the reasons they donâ€ ™ t like me running is because I donâ€ ™ t want their money , and unless they give me money , or unless they give somebody money , they donâ€
™ t have control.â€ �
But the partyâ€ ™ s anti - Trump forces continued to hammer him .
A Super Pac formed to oppose him released an ad on Monday featuring demeaning quotes from Trump about women , and urged people to oppose him â€œif
you believe America deserves betterâ€ � .
The White House press secretary , Josh Earnest , also weighed in , criticising Trumpâ€ ™ s rivals for declaring they would back him if he wins the party nomination .
â€œAt some point , somebody in the Republican partyâ€ ™ s going to have to step up and show some leadership , â€ � he said .
The frontrunner looks all but certain to win Florida , where 99 delegates are at stake .
Officials there reported that almost 1.2 million Republicans had already cast ballots in early voting , compared with nearly 850,000 Democrats .
But Trump faces a far closer call in Ohio , another winner - takes - all contest with 66 delegates up for grabs , where the latest polls show Kasich in the lead or tied .
Kasich said in February that he will end his presidential bid if he does not win the state that he governs .
Illinois , Missouri and North Carolina as well as the Northern Mariana Islands will also vote on Tuesday , with a total of 367 delegates available .
By the end of the night , Trump may have crossed an important threshold by collecting more than half the delegates awarded so far and , in effect , become the presumptive nominee .
But if he underperforms , a contested convention will be on the cards .
This would have political pundits salivating but has divided voters in Ohio this week .
Steve Hays , a machine shop owner , said he planned on voting for â€œeither Kasich or Trumpâ€ � â€ “ but intimated that Trump might earn his vote in the end because â€œIâ€ ™ m concerned about a brokered conventionâ€ � , and its potential to subvert the popular will .
Longtime Republican voters Red and Jayne Sterner of Jackson Township , Ohio , felt differently .
Jayne said : â€œIf Trump doesnâ€ ™ t get all of the delegates , the people in the know will decide things .
They have to know what Republicans want.â€
�
Red chimed in : â€œI think the convention is a good place to work it out.â€ � Tony Vrintlinger , from Westerville , Ohio , was even more excited about the possibility of a contested convention .
â€œItâ€ ™ s really the way a convention should be ,
otherwise why have
one?â€ �
he asked .
â€œIf itâ€ ™ s not contested , itâ€ ™ s already
decided.â€ � Kasich has crisscrossed Ohio over the past three days , visiting successful factory floors and answering numerous voter questions .
The former governor told voters : â€œWe donâ€ ™ t fix America by demonising people , we donâ€
™ t fix America by dividing people.â€
�
On Monday he was joined by Mitt Romney , the 2012 Republican nominee and arch - critic of Trump , who said : â€œThis is the guy Ohio has to vote for , and Americaâ€ ™ s counting on you.â€ �
Meanwhile Cruz , hoping to emerge as Trumpâ€ ™ s only rival for the nomination , focused his efforts on Illinois , making five stops in a last - minute attempt to rack up as many delegates as possible .
He made a pitch of â€œjobs , freedom and securityâ€ � and went after Trump as a liberal Democrat .
Cruz repeatedly attacked the businessmanâ€ ™ s past donations to Rahm Emanuel , the embattled Democratic mayor of Chicago .
Speaking in Springfield , he asked â€œhow much Trump Vodka would you have need to have hadâ€ � to give a $ 50,000 donation to Emanuel .
The crowd cheered and laughed at the reference , prompted by an audience member , to Trumpâ€ ™ s failed attempt to enter the liquor business .
Earlier on Monday , Cruz came closer to saying he would not vote for Trump in a general election than he has at any point in the past .
â€œI can give you one example where I would no longer support Donald Trump , â€ �
he told reporters , before referring to a notorious remark Trump made earlier this year : â€œIf , for example , he were to go out on Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody , I would not be willing to support Donald Trump.â€
�
The chaos that Trump has brought to the campaign trail invaded a Cruz event for the first time when a protester interrupted Cruz and started shouting â€œGo back to Canada!â€ � and waving a Trump sign at a campaign event in Peoria .
The candidate , who was born in Canada , responded to his shouts by saying â€œone difference between this and a Donald Trump rally is Iâ€ ™ m not asking anyone to punch you in the faceâ€ � as security eventually led the protester away ."
2016-03-16,"Marco Rubio , the Florida senator hailed in the aftermath of the 2012 election as the Republican partyâ€ ™ s likely â€œsaviorâ€ � , suspended his bid to become the first Latino president of the United States on Tuesday .
Speaking in his hometown of Miami , Rubio congratulated Donald Trump on his victory in the Florida primary while nodding to the grassroots uprising that had propelled the brash billionaire to frontrunner status .
â€œPeople are angry and people are very frustrated , â€ � Rubio said , before criticizing the political establishment as being out of touch with the American public .
â€œThere are millions of people in this country that are tired of being looked down upon â€ ¦ tired of being told by these self - proclaimed elitists that they donâ€ ™ t know what theyâ€ ™ re talking about and need to instead listen to the so - called smart people , â€ � he added .
At the same time , Rubio delivered an indictment of Trumpâ€ ™ s tactics and rhetoric without mentioning his opponent by name .
â€œThis nation needs a vibrant and growing conservative movement , â€ � he said ,
â€œbut one thatâ€ ™ s built on principles and on ideas , not on fear , not on anger , not on preying on peopleâ€
™ s frustrations.â€
�
â€œThe politics of resentment against other people will not just leave us a fractured party .
They will leave us a fractured nation , â€ � Rubio added .
Although not unexpected , Rubioâ€ ™ s inability to carry his home state served as the final nail in the coffin of a campaign caught perennially on the cusp of breaking through , but falling under the weight of its own expectations .
Rubio had , in recent weeks , suffered bruising losses in key primary contests that placed the senator well behind rivals Trump and Texas senator Ted Cruz .
Florida marked the last stand not simply for the 44-year - old senator , but also for a party seeking a consensus alternative to Trump .
It was a mantle Rubio himself embraced in the final weeks of his campaign , although in part to his detriment .
A series of personal attacks Rubio made against Trump , while hardly the sole reason for his failure , helped propel the senatorâ€ ™ s campaign into a downward spiral from which he never quite recovered .
As Floridians took to the polls , Rubio expressed regret over his uncharacteristically lowbrow tone and acknowledged he had embarrassed his wife , children and the supporters who looked to him as a role model .
When Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign launched last April , he drew immediate comparisons to another young orator : Barack Obama .
He , too , had the chance to make history and , in a nod to his roots as the son of Cuban immigrants , Rubio chose to make his announcement speech at the Freedom Tower in downtown Miami .
Standing 11 months ago in the building that once served as the landing place for millions of refugees fleeing Cuba in the 1960s , Rubio entered the race with the tale of his parentsâ€ ™ humble background as a bartender and a maid .
He returned to their personal story when suspending his campaign on Tuesday , recalling how his mother had arrived in the US from Cuba in 1956 with little education and neither money nor connections .
â€œIn this country , on this day , my mother , whoâ€ ™ s now 85 years old , was able to cast a ballot for her son to be the president of the United States of America , â€ � Rubio said .
As Rubio spoke , his supporters looked on with a blend of shock and dismay upon their tear - stained faces .
There were audible chants of â€œNoâ€ � when he announced his campaign would not continue .
Rubio himself grew emotional at times , with his wife and four children at his side .
For those who stood in the room clutching signs that bore his name , Rubioâ€ ™ s loss was stunning .
To his supporters , Rubio still represented the future of his party â€ “ a future now more uncertain than any time in recent memory with the rise of Trump .
Speaking to the Guardian on the evening before his presidential bid arrived at its close , Rubio forewarned of a dire road ahead if Republicans failed to recognize the perils of a Trump nomination .
â€œIf weâ€ ™ re going to be the party of fear , weâ€ ™ re going to spend some time in the wilderness , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œIf weâ€ ™ re the party of fear , with a candidate who basically is trying to prey upon peopleâ€ ™ s fears to get them to vote for them , I think weâ€ ™ re going to pay a big price in November and beyond.â€ �
If elected , Trump would not have the respect of allies around the globe , Rubio cautioned .
â€œI think heâ€ ™ s already an embarrassment , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œPeople around the world are watching this debate and this campaign and wondering whatâ€ ™ s happening here , because the things he says are nonsensical .
â€œWhen youâ€ ™ re the most powerful and important nation on earth , youâ€ ™ re not always going to be popular , â€ � he added .
â€œBut the question is , are you respected ?
And I donâ€ ™ t think Donald Trump is going to be respected.â€ �
He added :
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know how this is all going to end .
This is uncharted territory .
But from my mind , the Republican party has a very important decision to make : are we going to be the party of fear or the party of optimism?â€ �
As he confirmed his departure from the race on Tuesday , Rubio made a direct appeal to the American people .
â€œDo not give in to the fear .
Do not give in to the frustration , â€ � he said .
â€œFor we are a hopeful people , and we have a right to be hopeful.â€ � Hillary Clinton :
â€˜That doesnâ€ ™ t make Trump strong , that makes him wrongâ€ ™ Hours before Hillary Clinton took the stage in West Palm Beach â€ “ even before polls in the state closed â€ “ her election night party pulsed to the Latin rhythms blaring over the loudspeakers .
The cheered and chanted â€œHillaryâ€ � and â€œIâ€ ™ m with herâ€ � , growing louder as the night unfolded .
Then came Clintonâ€ ™ s first big win of the night : Florida .
The crowd erupted into deafening applause .
Wins in North Carolina and Ohio , where the race between her and opponent Bernie Sanders was expected to be close , followed .
Then the crowd erupted in wild cheers and chants as Clinton emerged on stage .
She smiled brightly , turned and waved to the crowd that encircled the podium .
â€œThis is another Super Tuesday for the campaign , â€ � Clinton says .
â€œThank for Florida , thank you North Carolina , thank you Ohio.â€
�
The crowd went wild again .
By the end of the night , Clinton said , her campaign expected to expand its lead over Sanders to more than 300 pledged delegates â€ “ nearly enough to block his path to the nomination .
With Tuesday nightâ€ ™ s wins , her campaign can confidently say it swept the south while rebutting the argument that she is a regional candidate whose wins are concentrated in states that Democrats donâ€ ™ t win in a general election .
At this stage , sheâ€ ™ s won the battleground states of Florida , Ohio , North Carolina , Virginia and Nevada .
The backdrop of the event â€ “ from the Latin music to the Spanish signage â€ “ worked as a reminder of the diverse coalition that has so far powered her biggest wins yet .
Latinos , and especially black voters , have been at the heart of her string of major victories .
While Sanders has made marginal gains among Latino and black communities , he has been unable to draw these voters away from Clinton in large enough numbers to make a difference .
During Clintonâ€ ™ s victory speech , she trained her fire on Donald Trump , who after big wins on Tuesday is increasingly likely to be the Republican nominee .
â€œThis may be one of the most consequential campaigns of our lifetimes ,
â€ �
she said .
â€œThe next president will walk into the Oval Office next January â€
¦
â€ �
â€œYes
she will!â€ � someone in the crowd shouted .
Clinton continued : â€œ ... sit down at that desk and start making decisions that will affect the livelihoods of everyone in this country , indeed everyone on this planet.â€ �
In the past week , Clinton has attempted to distinguish herself from Trump on an international stage , noting in the CNN debate earlier this week that she had world leaders reaching out to her about the tone and tenor of the election .
â€œOur commander in chief has to be able to defend our country , not embarrass , â€ �
Clinton said in her remarks on Tuesday night .
Clinton railed against Trumpâ€ ™ s most controversial proposals , including his calls for mass deportations of all undocumented immigrants and barring Muslims from entering the US , as well as his embrace of torture .
â€œThat doesnâ€ ™ t make him strong , that makes him wrong , â€ � she declared .
Though results were still pending in two states by the time her speech ended , Tuesday night clarified and all but cleared Clintonâ€ ™ s path to the nomination , pushing her campaign into a new and unpredictable stage of the race .
John Kasich : â€˜I will not take the low road to the highest office in the landâ€ ™
At the end of John Kasichâ€ ™ s victory speech in Berea , Ohio , confetti cannons blasted from behind the bleachers at the rear of the stage , pelting those in the rear row with bits of red , white and blue paper and sending up huge bursts of air that couldnâ€ ™ t have been comfortable for the candidate .
It didnâ€ ™ t dampen the mood .
After all , Kasich was celebrating his decisive home state victory in front of a friendly hometown crowd â€ “ save one pro - Trump protester who interrupted the start of his victory speech but was led out , without incident , by security .
Kasich cracked a joke , though â€ “ â€œWhen you went to college in the 1970s , you appreciate a good peaceful protest every once in awhileâ€
�
â€ “ and went back to his message of positivity .
It is that message of positivity â€ “ even the repetition of the line he has ended almost every other recent event with : â€œI will not take the low road to the highest office in the landâ€ � â€ “ that managed to break through for Republicans , in Ohio at least .
But as he regaled the crowd with some stories of personal sacrifice and neighborliness that he said defined America , some of his supporters wondered if that would be enough in an election cycle so seemingly dedicated to negativity .
â€œItâ€ ™ s clear that he has a connection , a personal connection , to Ohio
, â€ � said supporter Mike Harlow from the southern town of Portsmouth .
â€œBut it could be tough for him to make that a national thing , these personal connections.â€ � His friend SV â€ “ who asked not to be identified by name to avoid difficulties at work â€ “ disagreed .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a personal win , â€ � he said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s hard for him to spread his personal stories , to talk about the personal connections heâ€ ™ s made in this state to people like my family .
â€œBut itâ€ ™ s that personal connection that could help him elsewhere.â€
� A few feet away ,
Marty and Cathy Baron , who live in Berea , sat waiting for the crowd to clear out a bit .
Marty was Kasichâ€ ™ s roommate at Ohio State University and is , according to Marty , partially responsible for his long marriage .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s a really wonderful guy , â€ � said Marty .
â€œIâ€ ™ m so happy he came out for Ohio , and Ohio came out for himâ€ � said Cathy .
A younger supporter , Lauren Wojtowicz â€ “ who smiled coyly and refused to answer when asked who she voted for on Tuesday but admitted she wasnâ€ ™ t a Republican â€
“ said that she came away from Kasichâ€ ™ s victory speech â€œquite impressedâ€
� .
â€œIâ€
™ m really hoping he wins the nomination ,
â€ �
she said , â€œso I can vote for him in November.â€ �
That might not scare Trump and his supporters , but it might well strike a chill into the hearts of Democrats if Kasich makes good on his promise to take his campaign out to the remaining primary states and then back to Cleveland for a contested convention .
Bernie Sanders : â€˜Donâ€
™ t let people tell you that you canâ€ ™ t think bigâ€ ™ Bernie Sanders did not mention the nightâ€ ™ s dismal results during a rally for 7,200 supporters in Phoenix , Arizona .
It felt like a surreal end to a surreal few months for a campaign that has gone further than any expected yet may finally have run out of road .
â€œDonâ€
™ t let people tell you that you canâ€ ™ t think big , â€ � the Democratic contender told the crowd in what proved to be a standard rendition of his stump speech .
The only difference was far fewer mentions of Hillary Clinton than usual â€ “ a figure Sanders mainly referred to as â€œhis opponentâ€ � â€ “ rather than the more direct attacks of recent days .
Shortly after bad news from the east started flooding in , the campaign showed its determination to keep running by announcing a new rally on Friday in Idaho , another small state that has a primary election next week .
In the meantime , the Vermont senator and his exhausted team are planning a couple of days of recuperation in Sedona â€ “ a resort town in the desert north of Phoenix famous as a New Age hangout .
There is likely to be much reflection on why the momentum this campaign felt after Michigan failed to translate into success in Ohio or Illinois .
A win in Missouri will buoy some spirits , but there is no doubt that the campaign is moving slowly to the next phase : finding ways to capture the undoubted energy and passion of its supporters and turn it into something longer lasting , rather than focusing on the increasingly thankless job of counting delegates .
Donald Trump : â€˜Weâ€ ™ re going to make our country rich againâ€ ™ Donald Trump seemed deflated and unable to conjure his usual showbiz in a speech that lasted little more than 15 minutes and failed to congratulate John Kasich on his victory in Ohio .
He took no questions at what had been billed as a press conference .
All week Trump had been telling supporters that , should he win Florida and Ohio , the Republican race would be over and he could concentrate his fire on Democrat Hillary Clinton .
He changed his schedule at the last minute to intensify his campaign in Ohio but the prize got away .
So a night that was intended to be a coronation before hundreds of bejewelled guests in the ostentatious , Versailles - style ballroom of his Mar - a - Lago estate in Palm Beach , Florida , fell a little flat .
The jaded billionaire ignored shouted appeals from the media as he left amid his well - heeled supporters .
Despite Trumpâ€ ™ s multiple successes in Florida and elsewhere , Kasichâ€ ™ s win could give the Republican establishment a glimmer of hope that he can be stopped and his candidacy rejected at a contested convention .
Trump did not deal with that prospect specifically but made another appeal for unity in the party .
He said he had received a â€œtremendous callâ€ � from the House speaker , Paul Ryan , recently and had had a â€œgreat conversationâ€ � with the Senate majority leader , Mitch McConnell , earlier in the day .
â€œWe have to bring our party together ,
â€ �
Trump went on .
â€œThe Republican party is the biggest political story anywhere in the world .
Everybodyâ€ ™ s writing about it .
All over Europe , all over the world , theyâ€ ™ re talking about .
Millions of people are coming out to vote â€ ¦ People that have never voted before.â€ �
In a rambling speech , Trump also said he was â€œdisgustedâ€ � with companies that are leaving the US , called for better care for veterans and insisted that Isis would be destroyed , although he referred to the San Bernardino attacks as having happened in â€œLos Angelesâ€ � before correcting himself .
Some of his applause lines did not land quite as spontaneously as usual , although the crowd enjoyed his swipe at â€œdisgusting reportersâ€ � .
He promised :
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to make our country rich again .
Weâ€
™ re going to make our country great again .
And we need the rich in order to make it great , Iâ€ ™ m sorry to tell you.â€ �
While making no reference to Governor Kasich of Ohio , Trump described the margin of his victory in Florida as â€œphenomenalâ€ � and congratulated Florida senator Marco Rubio on having run â€œa really tough campaign .
Heâ€
™ s got a great future .
â€œBut I have to say , nobody has ever in the history of politics received the kind of negative advertising that I have.â€ �
Trump described the ads as â€œvicious , horribleâ€ � and â€œmostly falseâ€
�
â€ “ estimating the falsehoods at 90 % .
Ted Cruz : â€˜The media want Trump as the nomineeâ€ ™
The Ted Cruz campaign finally achieved a longstanding goal on Tuesday night of getting Marco Rubio out of the race .
However , the persistent presence of John Kasich , who one top Cruz aide described a â€œspoilerâ€ � , loomed over the Texas senatorâ€ ™ s effort .
On Tuesday night , with Donald Trump having won three states and Missouri still too close to call , Cruz took the stage to redouble his assault on the billionaire .
Preceded by top surrogates who bashed Trump â€ “ Texas lieutenant governor Dan Patrick who said the real estate mogul was â€œa
populistâ€ � and not a conservative , as well as former candidate Carly Fiorina who said Trump â€œdoesnâ€ ™ t represent meâ€ �
â€ “ Cruz described Trump as a man â€œwho has spent decades opposing your valuesâ€ � .
Cruz , who started off by paying tribute to Marco Rubio and said â€œhis passion inspires meâ€ � , segued to bash Trump as a weak candidate foisted by a pro - Clinton media on the Republican electorate .
â€œThe mainstream media network suits want Donald Trump as the Republican nominee â€
¦
They are partisan Democrats ready for Hillary.â€
�
The Texas senator , however , was less enthusiastic about his tortured path to the majority of delegates needed to clinch the nomination in Cleveland : â€œWe continued to gain delegates on our march to 1,237.â€ � The Cruz campaign was optimistic that with many forthcoming primaries only allowing Republicans to vote , the Texas senator would fare better .
The campaign has already written off Arizonaâ€ ™ s winner - take - all contest next week where a majority of voters has already cast ballots and instead is looking ahead to win coming races in Utah and Wisconsin .
However , Cruz is ready for a contested convention if it gets that far .
When asked if he was confident that all of the pledged Cruz delegates would support the Texas senator on a second ballot , top Cruz strategist Jason Johnson said with a smile , â€œAll of them and more.â€ �"
2016-03-16,"For years weâ€ ™ ve heard Marco Rubio is the future of the Republican party , but the chief question now seems to be : whatâ€ ™ s the future of Marco Rubio ?
After his dreams of capturing the presidential nomination were dashed in his home state of Florida last night , the still fresh - faced 44-year - old appeared to be trying to conserve political currency for his next move .
In a soaring speech Tuesday night , the usually rigid Rubio condemned the politics of division , blaming the establishment for failing to tune in to the needs of an increasingly fractured nation .
â€œAmerica is in the middle of a real political storm , a real tsunami , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œAnd we should have seen this coming.â€
�
It was clear Rubio had known for some time â€ “ and polls certainly predicted â€ “ he was going down that night .
It was also clear he was determined to do so with dignity .
So what exactly might he be saving himself for ?
His term in the Senate is up in January ( he was forced to give it up to run for the presidency last spring ) , and while he could run for governor in 2018 , last nightâ€ ™ s resounding loss to Trump in Florida suggests he still has some work to do in his there .
But the real question isnâ€ ™ t what specific position heâ€ ™ ll seek .
Itâ€ ™ s what heâ€ ™ s gleaned from his experience on the campaign trail , and who heâ€ ™ ll be going forward .
Early in his campaign he was the optimistic newcomer , determined to use his youth and enthusiasm to unite the splintering party .
More recently , as his initial approach foundered , he positioned himself as the only person capable of stopping Trump .
Then he briefly tried Trumpâ€ ™ s politics on for size , adopting the real estate mogulâ€ ™ s penchant for petty schoolyard taunts with his â€œsmall handsâ€ � comment .
It didnâ€ ™ t go well for Rubio , who was widely seen as embarrassing his campaign by stooping so low , while Trumpâ€ ™ s numbers , predictably , climbed ever higher .
Perhaps bullying and bluster doesnâ€ ™ t come naturally to Rubio , nor fanning the flames of the politics of hate .
A better lesson for him to learn from Trump might be the power of business bona fides in a country tired of establishment politics , especially since Rubio appears to have few places to go in politics but down .
By this logic he might disappear into the business world , or even go immerse himself in leadership of a university , re - emerging on the national scene when the timing is right .
And he does seem intent on re - emerging .
In his speech last night , he called for a Republican party â€œbuilt on principles and ideas , not on anger ,
â€ � adding that â€œwhile we are on the right side
, this year , we will not be on the winning sideâ€ � .
In doing so he framed the loss not just as his own , but as a loss for Republicans , suggesting another time in the future when he and the party might better be positioned to win .
Later in the speech he lamented : â€œIt is not Godâ€ ™ s plan that I be president in 2016 , or maybe ever.â€
�
Here the emphasis on â€œmaybeâ€ � suggests he isnâ€ ™ t giving up .
It isnâ€ ™ t a good time to be Marco Rubio or the GOP establishment , which , in losing Rubio just lost its only remotely viable option for the presidency ( sorry , John Kasich ) .
It will be interesting to see in the coming weeks and months whether he stands by his halfhearted pledge to back Trump should he win the nomination .
But one thingâ€ ™ s certain : a new kind of GOP is coming .
And Rubio , for his part , already seems to be looking four years ahead ."
2016-03-16,"It was always billed as a pivotal night in the 2016 election calendar and in some ways , it was .
Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s presidential hopes were laid to rest , Donald Trump looks set to win four out of five states and Hillary Clinton won either four or five ( vote counters in Missouri have gone home for the night â€ “ the numbers below are based on the 99.9 % of precincts that have reported results so far ) .
But actually the primaries on 15 March didnâ€ ™ t change the Republican race all that much :
Trump started the night needing 54.8 % of all remaining GOP delegates to clinch the nomination .
Now , he needs 51.4 % of all remaining delegates .
With so many states with large numbers of delegates left to vote , itâ€ ™ s likely that the Republican presidential contest will continue for weeks to come .
Trumpâ€ ™ s steady position may seem surprising given the way that the night played out .
North Carolina wasnâ€ ™ t a landslide victory .
Trump won the primary , but the 72 Republican delegates available there werenâ€ ™ t distributed on a winner - take - all basis , so the fact that the businessman won 40 % of the vote meant that he only picked up 27 extra delegates .
More importantly , Ohio was a big loss for Trump ( albeit one predicted by polling averages ) .
All 66 delegates in this winner - take - all state went to Governor John Kasich .
That doesnâ€ ™ t mean that Kasich , whose delegate count currently stands at 138 , has any real chance of winning ( at least through the primary process )
â€ “
but he did give hope to Republicans wanting to erode Trumpâ€ ™ s chances of getting the 1,237 delegates he needs to secure the partyâ€ ™ s nomination .
Increasingly , that appears to be the only viable strategy for preventing Trump from winning â€ “ forcing Trump to a contested convention in July at which the crown could be snatched away from him .
And it explains the rise in anti - Trump Super Pac spending in recent weeks .
Whether or not that strategy works depends in part on what Rubioâ€ ™ s delegates do now .
The Florida senator had 168 delegates at the time he made his resignation speech from the race on Tuesday evening .
But the rules governing what those delegates do now vary from state to state .
Rubioâ€ ™ s delegates could head to the Republican convention uncommitted and switch their vote to Trump .
But itâ€ ™ s also possible that Rubio will endorse another candidate such as Cruz and in so doing transfer some of his delegates to the Texas senator .
Which of those outcomes happens could give Trump a significant boost or dent his chances .
For Democrats too , on the face of it , the race didnâ€ ™ t change too dramatically .
Clinton started the night needing 59.2 % of all remaining pledged delegates and she finished the night needing 59.4 % .
As ever , though , Democratic numbers look very different if you factor in so - called â€œsuperdelegatesâ€ � â€ “ party luminaries who arenâ€ ™ t bound to voting for a specific candidate at the national convention .
Once those delegates are taken into account , Clinton already started the night in a much stronger position , needing only 40.3 % of remaining delegates to get the party nomination .
And she finished the night even stronger , needing just 34.2 % of remaining delegates .
Analysts will no doubt predict in earnest the end of Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ 2016 presidential chances .
Thereâ€ ™ s good reason for those forecasts â€ “ nationally
, Sanders is trailing 11 percentage points behind Clinton .
But itâ€ ™ s also worth remembering that Clinton might not maintain her advantage .
In 2008 , despite winning against Obama right up until May ( thanks largely to her superdelegate lead ) Clinton eventually slipped behind .
Whatâ€ ™ s more , dozens of superdelegates in 2008 used their right to switch between candidates and opted for Obama over Clinton .
The same may yet happen again .
The basic takeaway ?
Trumpâ€ ™ s performance in these primaries
shouldnâ€ ™ t be overstated , while Clinton has edged much closer to securing the partyâ€ ™ s nomination ."
2016-03-16,"Days before voters in Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s home state would seal the fate of his presidential ambitions , the Florida senator walked toward a group of reporters on a Saturday morning with a look of exhaustion and dismay on his face .
Protests outside a rally for Donald Trump had erupted in Chicago as demonstrators clashed with the Republican frontrunnerâ€ ™ s supporters in scenes that drew attention around the globe .
In the most public display of emotion of his 11-month campaign , Rubio held little back in his assessment of Trump : as a candidate , as a potential standard bearer for the Republican party , and as the potential leader of the free world .
â€œThis is the intentional injection of the use of peopleâ€ ™ s anger , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œThis is a political candidate â€ ¦ who has identified that thereâ€ ™ s some really angry people in America .
They feel as if theyâ€ ™ ve been mistreated by the culture , by society , by our politics , by our economy .
And he knows this .
â€œAnd along comes a presidential candidate and says to you , â€˜You know why your life is hard ?
Because fill in the blank â€ “ somebody , someone , some country
â€ “ theyâ€
™ re the reasons for it .
Give me power so I can go after them.â€ ™ â€
�
It appeared unfathomable to Rubio , not simply that he was losing to the candidate he later likened to a â€œthird - world strongmanâ€ � , but that his party had seemingly fallen into an abyss that could threaten its very existence .
Less than four years ago , the Republican party suffered massive losses in the 2012 election and emerged with a new mandate : the Grand Old Party must broaden its appeal among the groups of voters who reflected the changing demographics of America .
Republicans could no longer afford to ignore minorities , nor could they risk continuing to alienate young voters or single women .
Rubio appeared to be the answer to their prayers .
A young , dynamic senator , he was the bilingual son of Cuban immigrants with soaring oratory that drew instant comparisons to Barack Obama .
The media felt , too , as though Rubio was the living , breathing solution to the Republican partyâ€ ™ s predicament .
A Time magazine cover anointed him â€œThe Republican Saviorâ€ � and explored â€œHow Marco Rubio became the new voice of the GOPâ€
� .
What few knew then was that Republican voters had other ideas : not simply about Rubio , but about the identity they wished to preserve for their party .
That identity , four years later , has been manifested through Trump in an election defined by grassroots anger and frustration .
And while the brash billionaire may not have the support of the majority of Republicans , a growing plurality has propelled him to overwhelming victories in one contest after the other .
On Tuesday , it was in Rubioâ€ ™ s home state of Florida â€ “ forcing the senator , still viewed by many within his party as its future , out of the race .
Charting a different course Rubio suspended his campaign where it began â€ “ in his home town of Miami .
In April of last year , he had launched his presidential bid from the iconic Freedom Tower , the building where millions of Cuban refugees were processed in the 1960s after seeking asylum from the Castro regime .
At the heart of Rubioâ€ ™ s candidacy was a pitch to restore the American Dream , a theme with which he identified personally through the story of his immigrant parents , who worked as a bartender and a maid .
The senator then embarked on a barebones , under - the - radar campaign , a move aides said was strategic to avoid peaking too early .
Rubio , they knew , was already the second choice for a majority of voters .
They plotted to make him the first choice by February , when the first Republican nominating contests would begin .
Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign would be about electability and contrast .
As Obama did with his message of â€œhope and changeâ€ � in 2008 , Rubio would present himself as a leader of a new generation .
His youth would serve as a foil not simply to Hillary Clinton in November , but to Jeb Bush â€ “ the former governor of Florida and Rubioâ€ ™ s onetime ally who entered the race in June last year as the presumptive frontrunner with a campaign war chest of more than $ 100 m .
As Bush was quickly drawn into a nasty battle with Trump , the Rubio campaign charted a different course .
Looking to stay above the fray , the senator continued to campaign quietly in the early states â€ “ Iowa , New Hampshire and South Carolina â€ “ with a determined focus on policy .
He refused to attack other Republicans , telling reporters and voters the party had lost the 2012 election in part because their candidates had spent too much time tearing into each other .
The strategy appeared as though it was being executed flawlessly through the summer , capped off by a strong first Republican debate in Cleveland at which Rubio looked like the breakout star .
But that night in August would ultimately be one of many moments in which Rubio would find himself on the brink of breaking through without ever fully managing it .
As it turned out , his campaign had miscalculated on several fronts .
A made - for - TV strategy had been devised to put Rubio in front of as many voters as possible , operating under the premise that his skills as a candidate would shine through on the screen and win over new voters .
Complaints from some of his own backers subsequently emerged that Rubio and his campaign were ignoring the nuts and bolts of winning elections : with an insufficient ground game , skeptics asked , how did he expect to compete against his Republican rivals , much less Clinton in November ?
Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign manager Terry Sullivan was unfazed , memorably telling the New York Times : â€œMore people in Iowa see Marco on â€˜Fox and Friendsâ€ ™ than see Marco when he is in Iowa.â€ �
They would soon discover , however , that more people would see Trump than Rubio or any other candidate in the race â€ “ not just on Fox , but on virtually every cable network in the US .
And as Trump dominated the news cycle , setting the narrative with a controversial statement seemingly every week , Rubioâ€ ™ s message was quickly lost .
Whereas the senator had made foreign policy a centerpiece of his campaign , with polling showing national security as a top concern among Republican primary voters , the electorate was not drawn to his detailed descriptions of Vladimir Putinâ€ ™ s aggression in the Middle East or of Chinaâ€ ™ s military expansion .
On the domestic front , Rubio was selling optimism
â€ “
â€œThe best days of America are ahead of us , â€ � he often said .
That message â€ “ political orthodoxy for presidential hopefuls since Ronald Reaganâ€ ™ s day
â€ “ appeared out of touch with the voters supporting Trump in droves , an economically disenfranchised working class drawn to the business mogulâ€ ™ s success and pledge to â€œMake America
Great Againâ€ � , with its implication that America is not great now .
Perhaps most critically , Rubio had endeavored to resolve the nationâ€ ™ s broken immigration system in 2013 â€ “ working on a bipartisan , comprehensive reform bill that offered a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States .
It was anathema to conservatives , and Rubio had backed away from it almost as soon as it passed the Senate ( it reached a dead end in the House ) .
But the damage to his reputation had been done , and Rubio found himself struggling to keep up with attacks from both the right and the left .
He was attacked on the issue in the same week by Trump and Texas senator Ted Cruz , and by Obama and Clinton .
Rubioâ€ ™ s Republican rivals refused to let him forget his support for what they dubbed as â€œamnestyâ€ � , and his Democratic opponents seized on every rightward turn away from his legislation that he took .
By the end of his campaign , Rubio had gone from laying out a three - step immigration plan that maintained the central tenets of his Senate bill to recasting the issue entirely as having to do with national security and Islamic State .
Rolling out a new message
As the election year officially got underway , Rubio no longer resembled a sunny optimist .
He took to the stump in Iowa , New Hampshire and South Carolina painting a dark portrait of an America in decline , a country no longer recognized by some of its inhabitants .
Whereas he had formerly , on multiple occasions , condemned Trump for his controversial statements , Rubio shifted toward refusing to engage even when confronted by concerned voters at town halls .
â€œDonald has tapped into a frustration thatâ€ ™ s very real , â€ � he would say , before pivoting back to his own message .
On national security , Rubio went from nuanced warnings about radical Islam to declaring â€œa clash of civilizationsâ€ � .
At one point , he even confessed to purchasing a gun to protect his family against ISIS .
While Trump drew headlines for outlandish comments about banning foreign Muslims from America , Rubio found himself in the news for dismissing the notion that there was widespread discrimination against Muslims and even criticizing Obama for giving a speech on tolerance at a mosque .
His aides fumed at the suggestion he was embracing any form of Trumpism , insisting instead that Rubioâ€ ™ s message was consistent .
If there was any change in tone , they argued , it was to acknowledge the frustration among Trumpâ€ ™ s supporters â€ “ not to indulge it .
Even so , political observers and Rubioâ€ ™ s opponents on both sides took notice .
One article in the Atlantic put it harshly : â€œMarco Rubio sells out his principles.â€
�
In the final two weeks before the Iowa caucuses , Rubio sought more of a balance between optimism and impending doom , rolling out the message he would take with him to the final days of his campaign : â€œAnger is a motivator , it is not a solution , â€ �
he urged voters .
On the night of the Iowa caucuses on 1 February , Rubio was expected to finish in third place , and indeed he did , with Cruz as the victor .
But he exceeded his projected numbers and came within less than one percentage point of the second - placed Trump , a perceived victory in the eyes of Rubioâ€ ™ s team and the media .
Mounting the stage at his celebratory rally , Rubio channeled Obama in 2008 : â€œSo this is the moment they said would never happen.â€ �
A change in trajectory : Rubioâ€ ™ s repetition A group of Rubioâ€ ™ s friends sat around a table inside the lobby of the Holiday Inn on the eve of the New Hampshire primary .
They had spent the day braving the freezing temperatures to knock on doors in the hopes of persuading voters to support Rubio in the 9 February primary .
As many as 40 others had flown out from Florida to do the same , arriving in the state buoyed by Rubioâ€ ™ s stronger - than - expected finish in Iowa .
But that evening , their anxiety was palpable as they nervously dissected the Republican debate that had taken place in Manchester that weekend .
Seemingly overnight , Rubio had gone from being the most skillful debater in a crowded field to a scripted robot incapable of straying from his talking points .
Rival candidate Chris Christie had made it his mission to turn Rubioâ€ ™ s message discipline against him before the millions of viewers watching at home .
The New Jersey governor found his opportunity within moments of the debate , pouncing on Rubio as lacking the experience to be president .
Rather than engaging his opponent , Rubio instead pivoted to the notion that Obama was systematically seeking to change America .
â€œLetâ€ ™ s dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesnâ€ ™ t know what heâ€ ™ s doing .
He knows exactly what heâ€ ™ s doing , â€ � Rubio said .
He would go on to repeat the line â€ “ almost verbatim â€ “ four times in a painful exchange that in the course of just nine minutes would dramatically change the trajectory of Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign .
â€œThere it is , â€ �
Christie taunted .
â€œThe 30-second speech.â€ � Rubio had often been declared the winner of GOP debates by the media , but this time the reviews were brutal .
Even his supporters from within the conservative commentariat marveled at Rubioâ€ ™ s repetition , likening it to a broken record or a computer glitch .
â€œI feel nauseous , â€ � one of Rubioâ€ ™ s friends remarked in the Holiday Inn lobby .
As he spoke , a TV mounted on the wall behind him was switched to CNN .
The network was airing , for the umpteenth time , Rubioâ€ ™ s encounter with Christie .
The impact of the moment was profound , despite the best efforts of Rubio and his campaign to downplay it .
The pundits speculated each hour about whether Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign was over .
Memes spread across the internet mocking the senatorâ€ ™ s blunder , often using the hashtag # MarcoRoboto .
Democratic opposition groups dispatched staffers dressed as robots to Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign events .
Rubio had arrived in New Hampshire with the wind at his back .
Just over a week later , he placed fifth in its primary .
It was a bruising finish that immediately put on hold Rubioâ€ ™ s prospects of emerging as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz .
Adding further insult to injury , Bush edged just ahead of Rubio in the contest â€ “ a once unthinkable result that provided the former Florida governor with the incentive to press on toward South Carolina .
Donâ€ ™ t call it a comeback Rubio landed in South Carolina a humbled candidate eager to reset the narrative that had engulfed his campaign .
Once belonging to the top tier of candidates , Rubio was now being treated as dead in the water , faced with questions tailored as though the autopsies were already under way .
Rubio had always shown an ability to relate to voters on the campaign trail , drawing on his real - life experiences as a mid-40s father of four who was plagued by many of the same challenges confronting the average suburban household .
Until just a few years ago , Rubio would note , he remained saddled by $ 100,000 in student loan debt .
Only now , the same exchanges were cast as an urgent attempt by Rubio to show that he was indeed capable of being both personal and spontaneous .
But when Rubio â€ “ now an underdog â€ “ earned the endorsement of Nikki Haley , the popular governor of South Carolina , the pendulum abruptly swung back in his favor once more , and he was suddenly recast as the comeback kid , undaunted by his humiliating loss in New Hampshire .
Rubio seized on that moment , returning to his theme of a new generation of leaders .
â€œThe children of the Reagan revolution are ready to assume the mantle of leadership , â€ � Rubio said in Columbia at what felt like a victory rally â€ “ despite Trumpâ€ ™ s win â€ “ on the night of the 20 February primary .
That night it looked as though the pieces were finally falling into place for Rubio .
Bush exited the race that same evening after a distant fourth - place finish .
And Cruz , who had centered his strategy on winning the south , fell just behind Rubio at the close of polls .
â€œFor me , South Carolina will always be the place of new beginnings and fresh starts , â€ � Rubio declared .
The trouble was that in reality , it was an evening that cemented Trumpâ€
™ s prowess over the electorate while further diminishing his opponents .
What was branded as Rubioâ€ ™ s â€˜comebackâ€ ™ was actually a disappointing 22.5 % finish , 10 points behind Trump , a margin that helped the New York billionaire secure all of the stateâ€ ™ s 50 delegates .
It was arguably one of the more clarifying moments of Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign .
The problem was not that he lacked the momentum .
Itâ€ ™ s that voters simply werenâ€ ™ t buying what he was selling .
A shift in strategy By the time Rubio arrived in Nevada , the fourth and final early voting state , the writing was on the wall .
He was poised to lose yet another contest to Trump , and the senator knew it .
Rubio dutifully flew across the state in which he spent some of his formative years as a child , ties his campaign once cited to suggest that Nevada might be his launching pad .
But when the moment arrived , Rubio signaled an early defeat by skipping town on the night of the caucuses .
It turned out to be another second - place finish with an even more staggering deficit to Trump , who won by a margin of more than 20 points .
The Nevada result warranted a shift in strategy , and the message from Rubioâ€ ™ s donors was abundantly clear : the time had come to slay the dragon .
At the next debate , in Houston , for the first time in his campaign , the senator tore into every aspect of Trumpâ€ ™ s candidacy â€ “ from his command over policy and his preparedness to serve as commander in chief to his failed business dealings and hypocrisy on the issue of immigration .
It looked as though Rubio had succeeded where all of his rivals had failed : dumping the full opposition research book on Trump , with millions watching from home , and leaving the frontrunner visibly rattled .
The reviews for Rubio were positively glowing , something he appeared to relish in the following day .
Taking the stage in Dallas , Rubio began to read aloud from Trumpâ€ ™ s infamous Twitter account , mocking his spelling .
He ridiculed Trumpâ€ ™ s makeup regimen and suggested his opponent may have wet his pants during the debate .
The networks , which almost never cut in to Rubioâ€ ™ s rallies , suddenly carried him live .
It was the most exposure he had received in nearly 11 months â€ “ but it worked to his detriment .
Rubio had gotten carried away , taking a jab at the size of Trumpâ€ ™ s hands as a metaphor for his manhood .
â€œYou know what they say about men with small hands , â€ �
Rubio said at a rally days later in Roanoke , Virginia , to a seemingly shocked crowd .
He paid a price on the all - important Super Tuesday , notching up just one victory and 17 delegates , in Minnesota , on an evening in which 11 Republican states were voting and 367 delegates were up for grabs .
While his lowbrow attacks on the frontrunner were hardly the sole reason behind Rubioâ€ ™ s losses , exit numbers reflected the damage they had done to two of his greatest polling strengths : electability and favorability .
Trump hit back directly at the next Republican debate , saying : â€œHe referred to my hands â€ “ if theyâ€ ™ re small , something else must be small .
I guarantee you
thereâ€
™ s no problem.â€
�
The moment was widely considered a new low in presidential campaigning .
Rubio plummeted to new depths in subsequent contests , managing to win only in Puerto Rico and Washington DC .
Final push becomes farewell tour in Florida Not long after he arrived in Florida for what would become his final stand , Rubio expressed regret over the personal barbs he had directed toward Trump in a series of interviews and later before his supporters .
â€œLet me tell you , it embarrassed my children , it embarrassed my wife , it embarrassed young people that follow my campaign , â€ �
Rubio told the crowd inside a packed gymnasium in West Palm Beach on the eve of the Florida primary .
â€œI felt terrible about it .
I realized that win or lose , there are people out there that see what Iâ€ ™ m doing and follow it as a role model.â€ �
Although he slogged vigorously across his home state in the pursuit of every last vote , the final 10 days of Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign more closely resembled a farewell tour .
And the senator seemed to know it , embracing the full circle moment with repeated references to the day 11 months earlier when he had launched his campaign at Miamiâ€ ™ s Freedom Tower .
At one rally , Rubio acknowledged he had been driven off - message in a bitterly contested primary â€ “ telling the crowd he had not spent enough time lately talking about the optimistic message upon which he had intended to build his campaign .
By the end of his campaign , Rubio was aggressively defending the contributions of Muslim Americans and the importance of Muslim allies overseas .
Speaking to the Guardian roughly 24 hours before polls closed , Rubio placed some of the blame on the media for its horserace - style coverage at the expense of substance .
â€œThe debates and the campaign are increasingly covered as entertainment , â€ � Rubio said , lamenting the networksâ€ ™ hunt for ratings .
Those ratings came from Trump , Rubio added , while recalling how his rallies were only taken live when he began his attacks on the frontrunner .
â€œPeople wonder why Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s numbers are so high .
Well , he dominates our media , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œVirtually every one of his rallies and his speeches gets a live cut - in from a cable network , so thatâ€ ™ s worth hundreds of millions of dollars in television exposure.â€
�
An analysis released the following day affirmed that Trump had received a mammoth $ 2bn in so - called â€œearned mediaâ€ � , as opposed to paid advertising , dwarfing any of his rivals .
Rubio acknowledged there were other factors that played into Trumpâ€ ™ s rise , as he took aim at the political establishment for making unrealistic promises to an increasingly frustrated conservative base .
â€œPeople were told in 2014 : if you give us a majority in the House and Senate , weâ€ ™ d be able to do this , that and the other , â€ �
Rubio said of the midterm elections that swept Republicans back into control of Congress .
â€œWhat they left out was the presidentâ€ ™ s ability to veto things.â€ �
He added : â€œThe political establishment in Washington DC is not really interested in taking on the fight .
Theyâ€ ™ re more interested in winning elections , adding to the majority and maintaining themselves in power.â€ � Sitting aboard his bus on Monday evening , Rubio sounded much like the insurgent he campaigned as in 2010 , the role that earned him the title of â€œthe first senator from the tea partyâ€ � on the cover of the New York Timesâ€ ™ magazine .
But six years later , Rubio appeared to be confounded by how the labels within his party had evolved .
â€œIf
I took the position Donald Trump had on Planned Parenthood , I would be skewered .
If I took the positions he has on Israel , Iâ€ ™ d be skewered , â€ � he said , his voice brimming with frustration .
â€œBut somehow it doesnâ€ ™ t seem to matter when itâ€ ™ s him .
Somehow , because itâ€ ™ s Donald Trump and he speaks aggressively , heâ€ ™ s now supposedly a conservative even though his stance on multiple issues looks nothing like what the conservative movementâ€ ™ s been built on.â€ � Throwing up his hands , Rubio added : â€œThere are those who donâ€ ™ t seem to care.â€ �
Indeed , as the results poured in on Tuesday , it was evident once more that voters cared little about Trumpâ€ ™
s
unorthodox or wavering positions on conservative issues .
Ignoring Rubioâ€ ™ s dire warnings that the business mogul was a â€œcon manâ€ � seeking to hijack the conservative movement , Floridians handed Trump a massive victory over their native son .
Before Rubio had even taken the stage to deliver his concession speech , pundits were speculating over his next moves .
At just 44 years of age , his future remained bright , they concluded .
Perhaps he would run again in 2020 , or first run for Floridaâ€ ™ s governorship in 2018 and then return to the presidential field in 2024 .
Addressing reporters days earlier , Rubio showed little interest in feeding the fast - paced , ever - hungry news cycle .
â€œI
havenâ€

2016-03-16,"Hillary Clinton crushed hopes of a Bernie Sanders surge on a night of sweeping wins that saw her shift her gaze to the prospect of a bitter battle for the White House with Donald Trump .
As Clinton looked set to take all five states in the Democratic contest on Tuesday , Trump also tightened his grip on the Republican race , on the verge of winning four out of five contests and forcing Marco Rubio to suspend his campaign after inflicting a bruising defeat in his home state of Florida .
In the Democratic race , Sanders could not capitalise on last weekâ€ ™ s surprise win in Michigan as Clinton won by a distance in Florida , Ohio and North Carolina , before grinding out a much narrower win in Illinois .
A recount in two small precincts of Jackson County left the Missouri race on a knife edge , with Clinton leading by just 1,531 votes with 99.9 % of the votes in .
In her victory speech , Clinton increasingly turned to face Trump head - on , having secured crucial support from working - class Democrats in the industrial midwest who had shown signs of defecting to the more radical promise of Sanders .
â€œThis is shaping up to be one of the most consequential campaigns of our lifetime , â€ �
she said .
â€œThe next president will sit down at that desk and start taking decisions that will affect the lives and livelihoods of everyone in this country , indeed everyone on the planet .
â€œOur next commander in chief has to be able to defend our country , not embarrass it
â€ “ engage our allies , not alienate them , â€ � added Clinton in a direct challenge to Trump .
â€œWhen we hear a candidate for president call for rounding up 12 million immigrants , barring all Muslims from entering the United States , when he embraces torture , that doesnâ€ ™ t make him strong , it makes him wrong.â€
�
Her night began with expected but overwhelming victories in Florida and North Carolina â€
“ completing her clean sweep of the south â€
“
but it was a 14-point victory over Sanders in Ohio and a narrow 50.3 % to 48.8 % win in Illinois that allowed her to pull almost 300 delegates ahead .
Trump substantially cleared his path toward the Republican nomination , with the contest now down to only three candidates .
Conservative rival Ted Cruz was denied any wins from the five states up for grabs .
However , a recount was suspended for the night in Jackson County , Missouri , where only 1,726 votes divided Trump and Cruz in a winner - takes - all state which has 52 delegates at stake .
Only John Kasich raised hopes of denying Trump outright victory in the nomination race after winning in his home state of Ohio .
For those Republicans desperate to halt the billionaire television celebrity , the best hope now lies in denying him enough delegates to win a simple majority , forcing him into a contested party convention this July .
Trump , who is now more than halfway to securing the delegates he needs to avoid this scenario , was in combative mood at a victory celebration in Florida .
â€œThere is great anger , believe me , there is great anger , â€ �
he warned as he explained why he thought so many first - time voters and independents were flocking to his stark anti - establishment message .
Growing violence at Trump rallies has dominated media coverage in the days leading up to voting and led Barack Obama to warn that the xenophobic rhetoric risked tarnishing â€œAmericaâ€ ™ s brandâ€ � internationally .
Arguing that pluralism and tolerance were core American values during remarks on Capitol Hill , Obama warned : â€œWhy would we want to tarnish that?â€ �
Crowds at the Rubio rally in Miami gasped at the news of his defeat
â€ “ by 18 points â€“and broke into boos and chants of : â€œWe want
Marco!â€ �
Rubio soon emerged to congratulate Trump on a â€œbig winâ€ � but decried the politics of anger and resentment and warned : â€œAmerica is in the middle of a real political storm , a tsunami.â€ � Bowing out of the race , Rubio said : â€œThis may not have been the year for a hopeful and optimisticâ€ � candidate .
Rubioâ€ ™ s exit from the race deprives establishment Republicans of the candidate they viewed as the palatable alternative to Trump .
Whether they would be willing to rally around Cruz , the disliked Texas senator , remained unclear .
North Carolina was next , last in a slew of southern states to have dominated the early primary season and helped both Clinton and Trump take commanding leads over their rivals .
Strong support among African American voters once again helped Clinton beat Sanders in the south â€ “
she led North Carolina by a margin of 15 points with 74 % of votes counted .
Trump narrowly held off Cruz in North Carolina and then chalked up Illinois by eight points from Cruz .
Kasich was bullish after his victory in Ohio , but Cruz insisted he was now in a two - man race with Trump .
However , Trump who won 18 out of the first 27 states , is in a dominant position .
The biggest question in the Republican race now appears to be whether Trump can bag the 1,237 delegates needed to win the partyâ€ ™ s nomination outright and avoid a potentially ugly contested convention in Cleveland in July .
Having secured all 99 delegates from Florida , Trump was set to be the nightâ€ ™ s big winner , but he could yet fall short , raising the prospect of the party establishment attempting to snatch the nomination from him .
Such a move would risk provoking an outpouring of anger from his supporters and would be particularly difficult if he is only 100 or so delegates short and clearly ahead of his rivals .
Perhaps the most disappointed figure of the night was Sanders whose recent win in Michigan had rekindled some hopes on the left that his anti - corporate message could resonate in the rustbelt , but instead Sanders was left near - speechless at a rally in Arizona where he did not even mention the nightâ€ ™ s heavy defeats .
After Clintonâ€ ™ s string of victories on Tuesday , her campaign said her lead would be â€œvery hard to overtakeâ€ � but stopped short of saying it was insurmountable .
The campaign also refused to call on Sanders to exit the race .
â€œIt is not up to us when the Democratic primary ends ,
â€ �
Jennifer Palmieri , the Clinton campaignâ€ ™ s communications director , told reporters after Clintonâ€ ™ s speech in Florida .
â€œBut we believe that it is a very strong lead , twice the size of any lead Senator Obama had as a candidate over then
Senator Clinton.â€ �
Palmieri added : â€œWhen she ran against President Obama in 2008 she stayed in until the end .
She said that she would never call on someone to drop out.â€ �
In her speech , Clinton recalled her 2008 primary night victory in Ohio , which her campaign hailed then as a turning point in the hard - fought race against then Senator Barack Obama .
â€œEight years ago , on the night of the Ohio primary I said I was running for everyone whoâ€ ™ s ever been counted out but refused to be knocked out ; for everyone who has stumbled but stood right back up ; for everyone who works hard and never gives up .
Well that is still true , â€ � Clinton said in her speech ."
2016-03-16,"Donald Trump proffered a truce to the Republican establishment on Wednesday as party leaders faced the reality that they may soon have to get behind a reality television star as their most divisive presidential candidate in a generation .
A night of dramatic election night victories in Florida , North Carolina and Illinois , with another anticipated once the question of a recount is resolved in Missouri , left the billionaire celebrity and property developer in an increasingly unassailable position at the head of a dwindling field of candidates for the party nomination .
Only defeat by Governor John Kasich in his home state of Ohio marred an otherwise clean sweep of Tuesdayâ€ ™ s five primary states for Trump , who forced Florida senator Marco Rubio to drop out of the race entirely and prevented his main rival , conservative Texan Ted Cruz , from winning any new states .
Trump still faces an uncertain path to achieving the outright majority of delegates needed to seal his victory before the party meets at a national convention in July , though the chance that opponents could unite there to deny him the nomination if he keeps winning primary victories now looks slim .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s going to be a tremendous problemâ€ � if the Republican establishment tries to outmaneuver him at the convention , Trump told CNN in a series of morning television interviews .
â€œYouâ€ ™
d have riots.â€
�
Asked if he was now ready to make peace with the establishment , Trump said he would be happy to turn toward reconciliation but made clear there would little compromise in his bombastic campaign style .
â€œWith the party , yes , â€ � he told MSNBC .
â€œIâ€ ™ m fine with a turn .
At the same time , we donâ€ ™ t want to lose the edge.â€ �
The Senate majority leader , Mitch McConnell , is one of a number of senior figures to have held private talks with Trump in recent days as the party anxiously ponders the prospect of an outsider at the top of its ticket for crucial congressional races too .
But despite pressure for him to tone down his rhetoric and denounce violence at recent rallies , Trump made clear his determination to continue a highly combative approach while discussing Rubioâ€ ™ s departure .
â€œI liked him until about three weeks ago , when he started getting nasty , â€ � said Trump on Wednesday .
â€œAnd then , the problem is , I get nastier than him , and then I win , and then , you know , my numbers get hurt a little bit
because youâ€ ™ re so â€ “
youâ€ ™ re so tough that people donâ€ ™ t necessarily like it .
But you do what you have to do .
You know , we have to win.â€ �
The bombastic star of Celebrity Apprentice also refused to bow to pressure to name his foreign policy advisers amid concerns that his erratic comments on the Middle East were alarming US allies .
â€œIâ€ ™ m speaking with myself , number one , because I have a very good brain and Iâ€ ™ ve said a lot of things , â€ � he said .
â€œMy primary consultant is myself and I have â€ “ you know
, I have a good instinct for this stuff.â€ �
Not since controversial Arizona senator Barry Goldwater seized the party nomination in a conservative revolt in 1964 has the Republican party faced the prospect of such a divisive candidate .
Although Trump has shown stronger appeal among independent and first - time voters who have boosted turnout , many party strategists fear a repeat of the 1964 outcome : Goldwater lost in a landslide to Lyndon Johnson after carrying just six states in the general election .
On Tuesday night , Trumpâ€ ™ s remaining opponents sought to argue they still offered a viable alternative .
â€œI want to remind you tonight that I will not take the low road to the highest office in the land , â€ � said Kasich at his victory party .
Ohioâ€ ™ s winner - takes - all primary awards 66 delegates and , by winning those , Kasich will stay in the race and be able to play spoiler in a fierce contest between Cruz and Trump .
Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign manager , Jeff Roe , told reporters that Kasichâ€ ™ s presence in the race was â€œa jumpballâ€
� from his perspective .
On one hand , it meant the Ohio governor had kept Trump from earning 66 delegates in Ohio .
On the other , it meant that the anti - Trump vote in the party would continue to be divided .
With Trumpâ€ ™ s win in Florida and his loss in Ohio , the current frontrunner still needs to win 51.4 % of the available delegates to become the GOPâ€ ™ s nominee before the convention .
In this fiercely contested and still splintered field , that is a difficult task for Trump , but his continued dominance of the media coverage is likely to work in his favour .
Cruz bashed Trump as a weak candidate foisted by a pro - Clinton media on to the Republican electorate .
â€œThe mainstream media network suits want Donald Trump as the Republican nominee â€
¦
They are partisan Democrats ready for Hillary.â€
�
The Texas senator , however , was circumspect about his own treacherous path to reaching the majority of delegates needed to clinch the nomination in Cleveland , saying only : â€œWe continued to gain delegates on our march to 1,237.â€ � The Cruz campaign was optimistic that with many forthcoming primaries only allowing Republicans to vote , the Texas senator would fare better .
The campaign has already written off Arizonaâ€ ™ s winner - takes - all contest next week , where a majority of voters have already cast ballots , and instead is looking ahead to win coming races in Utah and Wisconsin .
However , Cruz is ready for a contested convention if it gets that far .
When asked if he was confident that all the pledged Cruz delegates would support the Texas senator on a second ballot , top Cruz strategist Jason Johnson said with a smile : â€œAll of them and more.â€ �
But Rubio struck a more sombre tone .
Speaking in his home town of Miami â€ “ the only part of the state the once promising senator won â€ “ he congratulated Trump on his victory in the Florida primary and acknowledged the grassroots uprising that had propelled the brash billionaire to frontrunner status .
â€œPeople are angry and people are very frustrated , â€ � Rubio said , before criticizing the political establishment as being out of touch with the American public .
â€œAmerica is in the middle of a real political storm , a real tsunami , â€ � he added .
â€œPeople are angry and we should have seen this coming.â€ �
Trump meanwhile , stuck to the central theme of his campaign : that his record in business makes him a deal - maker who can broker wins .
Pressed on who he might pick as a vice - presidential running mate , he replied on Wednesday : â€œI donâ€ ™ t like to talk about it
â€
¦ Iâ€ ™ m a closer , I like closing deals first.â€ �

2016-03-16,"March comes in like a lion and out like a lamb - and so , too , did todayâ€ ™ s political news .
Beginning with the aftermath analysis of 2 Super 2 Tuesday , fallout from the suspension of Florida senator Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s presidential campaign and Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s nomination of Merrick Garland to fill the current vacancy on the supreme court , Wednesday started as a banner day in this tempestuous campaign season .
Now that things have settled down a bit , letâ€ ™ s look back at some of the biggest political news of the day : Barack Obama nominated DC circuit judge Merrick Garland to the US supreme court , sketching the biography of a man who graduated first in his class at Harvard and paid his way through law school by selling his comic books .
( To pay for college that way nowadays , youâ€ ™ d better own a near - mint edition of Action Comics # 1 . )
Obama called on senate Republicans to â€œjust be fairâ€ � in considering the nomination , which leadership in Congress from Mitch McConnell on down has vowed to ignore until a new president is sworn in .
If no candidate is elected in the first round of voting at the national convention in July , presumably after having crossed the 1,237 delegate barrier , former speaker of the house John Boehner said heâ€ ™ s planning on supporting current speaker Paul Ryan for the Republican nomination : â€œThey all had a chance to win .
None of them won .
So Iâ€ ™ m for none of the above .
Iâ€ ™ m for Paul Ryan to be our nominee.â€ � Ryan , for his part , is not having it .
After Donald Trump declared that he would not be participating in the scheduled 21 March debate in Salt Lake City , a recent add to the debate calendar , Fox News cancelled the debate entirely .
Trump will instead be speaking to AIPAC , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee .
â€œIâ€ ™ m doing a major speech in front of a very important group of people that night , â€ � Trump said .
Florida governor Rick Scott endorsed Trump for president , a day after Trump beat home - state senator Marco Rubio by 19 points .
â€œWith his victories yesterday , I believe it is now time for Republicans to accept and respect the will of the voters and coalesce behind Donald Trump , â€ � a Scott statement says .
â€œThe voters are speaking clearly
â€ “ they want a businessman outsider who will dramatically shake up the status quo in Washington.â€

Pundits arenâ€ ™ t the only ones foreseeing chaos in Cleveland this summer at the Republican national convention - the candidates are too .
Trump , asked in a telephone interview with CNN this morning about the possibility of a brokered national Republican convention if no one candidate hits 1,237 delegates , declared that if such an event arises , there will be rioting in the street .
â€œIf weâ€ ™ re 20 votes short or if weâ€ ™ re you know 100 votes , and weâ€ ™ re at 1,100 and somebody else is at 500 or 400 , cause weâ€ ™ re way ahead

The fourth season of House of Cards is still fun , but the grim , satisfying resonance with the present is gone in the age of Donald Trump .
Did the showâ€ ™ s cynical view of politics contribute to making its own commentary obsolete ?
Netflixâ€ ™ s
House of Cards made its name by shocking and thrilling viewers with its political chiaroscuro and seductive cynicism .
The showâ€ ™ s gorgeous cinematography emphasized Washingtonâ€ ™ s clean lines and sharp edges .
The only dirtiness was Frank Underwoodâ€ ™ s , and his filth was philosophical .
Heâ€ ™ s a pseudo - Shakespearean devil , a cunning exploiter of defects .
The only character more compelling than Frank is his wife
â€
“ Robin Wrightâ€ ™
s magnificent turn as Claire Underwood exposed the metastasizing ambitions of a political partnership , and her riveting trajectory resonated with real events .
Through Claire , the show implicitly theorized the bitter and intoxicating vertigo of being â€ “ and becoming â€ “ Hillary Clinton , the brilliant ally and eventual political equal of a sweet - talkinâ€ ™ , power - hungry southern man .
Thatâ€ ™ s all to say that House of Cards was fun and dark , but also â€ “
and this is the key term

It no longer is .
So far , the road to the 2016 presidential election has been more like a terrifying parade of insults , fights and even featured the occasional white supremacist .
Itâ€ ™ s been an unpredictable campaign season ; Donald Trump is looking increasingly more likely to be the Republican nominee , establishment candidates like Jeb Bush dropped out early and despite her best efforts , Hillary Clinton still hasnâ€ ™ t locked in her place on the ballot .
Itâ€ ™ s no surprise weâ€ ™ re gripped with election anxiety .

An editorial written under Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s name appears to have heavily plagiarized a similar editorial written under the name of former presidential candidate Ben Carson , according to the Daily Caller .
Carsonâ€ ™ s editorial was published in the Marianas Variety , a newspaper in the Northern Mariana Islands , on February 26 .
Trumpâ€ ™ s
editorial was published in the Pacific Daily News , a newspaper in Guam , 12 days later .
Both pieces , written on the topic of territories and commonwealths of the United States , feature extensive passages that are identical word - for - word :
From Carsonâ€ ™ s piece : â€œMedical care in the American territories and commonwealths has historically lagged far behind the continental states , and Obamacare has only made the situation worse .
Good health is an essential part of a thriving society and economy , and citizens of the territories and commonwealths deserve policies that work .
More must be done to fix the broken healthcare systems.â€ �

The relationship between Trump and Carson , who endorsed the billionaire Republican frontrunner on March 11 , has been increasingly complicated following the suspension of Carsonâ€ ™ s campaign .
The retired pediatric neurosurgeon has admitted in interviews that he preferred other candidates but had been promised a position in Trumpâ€ ™ s administration in exchange for his support .
Chicago was just the beginning .
Millions of Americans are ready to form a grassroots movement against Donald Trump , activists say , determined to challenge the politics of prejudice and show there is now more at stake than the White House .
â€œThere was a deer in the headlights quality in the country at the rise of Donald Trump over the past year , â€ � said Ben Wikler , Washington director of the civil society group MoveOn.org .
â€œThatâ€ ™ s now
over.â€ �
An election campaign that has transgressed the normal boundaries of party politics demands a commensurate response in the eyes of many .
Even as the Republican party flounders and the media remains transfixed , there are signs that activists , students and ordinary citizens are ready to mobilise against Trump , whowon another series of states in the Republican primaries on Tuesday .
Wikler continued : â€œItâ€ ™ s rapidly coalescing .
The conversations are starting within movements and between movements across the country .
People are having conversations about how they can connect .
Whatâ€ ™ s clear is that there is an incredible hunger to push back against hate.â€ �
Oklahoma senator Jim Inhofe has announced his support for Ohio governor John Kasichâ€ ™ s presidential campaign this evening , calling the governor â€œmy guy.â€ �
I served with John in Congress when he successfully spearheaded the effort to balance the federal budget and , as a member of the Armed Services Committee , helped President Reagan enact his national security agenda ,
â€ �
Inhofe said .
â€œDuring this time , I also attended a weekly Bible study with him for eight years .
You learn a lot about a person when you attend a Bible study together , so I can tell you personally that he is a man of his word .
When he talked , people listened .
Now the country is listening to his message of optimism and results .
Thatâ€ ™ s refreshing .
Iâ€ ™ m proud to stand by his side as we spread this message to voters in the weeks
ahead.â€ � â€œIt is an incredible honor to receive the support of my friend and former colleague , Senator Jim Inhofe , â€ � said Kasich in the release .
â€œJim is a role model to several generations of conservatives , and I trust his expertise and judgment implicitly .
He knows Oklahoma voters better than just about anyone , so itâ€ ™ s a major win to have him in our corner going forward.â€

Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s pick for the supreme court is unlikely to be approved , writes Scott Lemieux .
But the political beating heâ€ ™ ll receive will make Republicans look bad â€ “ and thatâ€ ™ s the point .
In ordinary times , you would expect a president like Barack Obama to nominate a young , liberal judge for the US supreme court .
But these arenâ€ ™ t ordinary times .
On Wednesday , Obama announced his pick : Merrick Garland .
The 63-year - old Chief Judge of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals is older than many expected the nominee to be â€ “ and more moderate .
In other political circumstances , the choice of Garland would be unusual .
But these are not ordinary times .
The pick would be unusual in that Garland is more moderate than Obamaâ€ ™ s two previous supreme court nominees , Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor .
While not a conservative , he does have a conservative streak on some issues , most notably the civil liberties of criminal defendants .
As Obama observed more than once when announcing Garlandâ€ ™ s nomination , the judgeâ€ ™ s moderation earned him significant bipartisan support for his confirmation in the US Senate .
Had Garland been nominated in 2007 , liberal groups would be up in arms .
But itâ€ ™ s not 2007 .
Senate Republicans have made it clear that they will not hold hearings , let alone a vote , on any Obama replacement for Scalia .
Given the stakes â€ “ even if he is more moderate than Kagan or Sotomayor , Garland would still be the first Democratic nominee to be the median vote on the court since early in the Nixon administration and would move the court to the left â€ “ they have no reason to back off before the election .
Five deputies with the Cumberland County sheriffâ€ ™ s office in Fayetteville , North Carolina , have been disciplined after they witnessed an assault against an anti - Donald Trump protestor and restrained the protestor , rather than his assailant .
In a statement to local news station WRAL , Sheriff Earl Butler said that the deputies in question faced disciplinary measures for â€œunsatisfactory performance and failing to discharge the duties and policies of the office of the sheriff.â€ � â€œThe actions of the deputies and their failures to act in situations such as that which occurred during the Trump rally at the Crown Coliseum have never been and will never be tolerated under the policies of this office , â€ � Butler said .
Two deputies were suspended without pay for three days , while three more were demoted and suspended without pay for five days .
All five of the deputies were placed on a one - year probation .
At the rally on March 9 , Rakeem Jones was punched in the face by a Trump supporter â€ “ after which uniformed sheriffâ€ ™ s deputies tackled and detained Jones .
Charges have since been filed against his assailant .
Barack Obama will make an historic address to the Cuban people , calling for more freedom but stressing that the US is no longer seeking regime change on the island , according to the White House .
This first speech on Cuban soil by a US president in almost 90 years will be the highlight of a three - day trip that also includes a bilateral summit with RaÃºl Castro , a joint news conference , a private meeting with dissidents , a baseball game and a moment to pay homage to the Catholic church for helping broker talks that led to the opening of relations in September .
Obama , who will travel with his wife Michelle and daughters Malia and Sasha , will be the first US president to visit Havana since Calvin Coolidge in 1928 .
Scandal is about to get even more dramatic - with the addition of a character inspired by Donald Trump .

The character will be entering the showâ€ ™ s ongoing presidential race .
â€œThere will be a candidate who will emerge who has many qualities that Mr Trump has .

he will be as outrageous as Trump is.â€ � Kerry Washington , who plays crisis manager Olivia Pope , joked : â€œYou think the debates youâ€ ™ ve seen in the real world are fun!â€ � Video : Michelle Obama says that thereâ€ ™ s no way sheâ€ ™ d run for president With its eyes on the upcoming winner - take - all Republican primary in Arizona , the campaign of Texas senator Ted Cruz has announced a high - profile endorsement in the Grand Canyon State : Congressman David Schweikert , a Tea Party darling who represents parts of Phoenix and Scottsdale .
â€œMy top priority in Congress has always been to do what the Washington insiders simply refuse to do , and that is to reduce the size and cost of government and save our nation from the crushing debt that the Washington politicians have placed on the backs of each and every citizen of our nation , â€ � Schweikert said in a statement released by the campaign .
â€œThroughout the never ending battles to do this , Ted Cruz has always been a principled leader fighting to do the very same thing ,
â€ � Schweikert said .
â€œWith a federal debt that is quickly approaching an unfathomable $ 20 trillion , our countryâ€ ™ s future economic growth and prosperity are in grave danger unless we elect a principled conservative who is truly committed to stopping the out of control spending and borrowing that has led us to where we are today.â€ � â€œItâ€ ™ s clear that Ted is the conservative leader that we need as our next president , and my wife Joyce and I are proud to give him our strongest endorsement .
In the upcoming Arizona presidential preference primary , Ted is the clear choice for voters who want a conservative president who is truly committed to fixing the mess in Washington , â€ � Schweikert concluded .
â€œI am thrilled to have such a passionate fighter for liberty on our team , â€ �
Cruz said in the same statement .
â€œDavid has spent his time in Congress fighting against the Washington Cartel and protecting the interests of the American people .
He has worked to rein in Obamaâ€ ™ s lawlessness , repeal Obamacare , and stop the Presidentâ€ ™ s illegal executive amnesty .
David is a strong addition to our team and I am thankful for his leadership fighting on issues that are most important to conservatives.â€ � Donald Trump , whose strong rhetoric on immigration will likely strike a cord in the border state , has won the endorsements of Jan Brewer , the popular former governor who bore the brunt of nationwide criticism after she signed a controversial bill requiring immigrants to carry documents proving their legal status , as well as that of Joe Arpaio , â€œAmericaâ€ ™ s

Billionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson may be softening towards Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s contentious run for president .
Video obtained by Israeli political blogger Tal Schneider reportedly shows Adelson at a gala event in Las Vegas on 27 February stating :
â€œTrump is a businessman .
I am a businessman .
He employs a lot of people .
I employed 50,000 people .
Why not?â€ �
Although far from a gushing endorsement , the remarks suggest that Adelson , a Republican superdonor , may decline to fund a # NeverTrump movement to stop the GOP frontrunner from becoming the partyâ€ ™ s nominee .
Some establishment Republicans had held out hope that he would .
â€œIt reminds me of [ a joke],â€ �
Adelson said at the event , according to an article inthe Jewish Journal , which translated the quotes that Schneider posted in Hebrew .
â€œOne
Jewish man said to another Jewish man , â€˜Do you know why Jews always answer a question with a question?â€ ™
So the guy said , â€˜Why not?â€ ™ â€ �
Then he reportedly joked : â€œIf I were running I would have endorsed myself.â€

The election of Donald Trump to the presidency poses an existential risk to the global economy and the security of the United States , according to the Economist Intelligence Unit .
â€œIn the event of a Trump victory , his hostile attitude to free trade , and alienation of Mexico and China in particular , could escalate rapidly into a trade war - and at the least scupper the Trans - Pacific Partnership between the US and 11 other American and Asian states signed in February 2016,â€ � the respected economic analytical and risk - management firm declared in its list of top-10 global risks .
â€œHis militaristic tendencies towards the Middle East ( and ban on all Muslim travel to the US ) would be a potent recruitment tool for jihadi groups , increasing their threat both within the region and beyond.â€ �
Alongside a sharp economic downturn in China and the breakup of the eurozone , Trumpâ€ ™ s candidacy is described as a â€œhigh - impactâ€ � risk to global security .
In particular , his â€œexceptionalâ€ � hostility to free trade and â€œexceptionally right - wing stance on the Middle East and jiadhi terrorism , including , among other things , advocating the killing of families of terrorists and launching a land incursion into Syriaâ€ � are seen as having the potential to destabilize global markets and encourage Islamist terrorism .
Obamaâ€ ™ s nominee for the empty ninth seat on the US supreme court now finds himself in the middle of one of the most intense political and constitutional spats of modern times , writes the Guardianâ€ ™ s Ed Pilkington .

The Guardian sat down with a psychoanalyst , a meditation instructor , a cultural theorist and a massage therapist to find some respite from the vitriol and uncertainty that continues to plague the election cycle .
Retired pediatric neurosurgeon and onetime presidential candidate Ben Carson told Yahoo News today that billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s decision to compare him to a child molester was part of the â€œpolitics of personal destruction , â€ � - but a canny move nonetheless .
â€œIf someone like Mr. Trump can call you , an acclaimed and noted neurosurgeon , someone who lacks intellect or is a child molester , doesnâ€ ™ t that alarm as you as to how he can portray other people in this country as well?â€ � asked anchor Bianna Golodryga .
â€œWell , he said it was political , â€ �
Carson responded .
â€œHe was concerned about the fact that he couldnâ€ ™ t shake me .
I understand politics , and particularly the politics of personal destruction , and you have to admit to some degree that it did work .
A lot of people believed him ...
unfortunately , we live in a society where that kind of thing works.â€

Carson has endorsed Trumpâ€ ™ s bid for the Republican presidential nomination , in part because Trump has promised him a position in a potential administration .

The biggest cheer from the crowd , who had to wait three hours and go through airport - style security checks , came when Latifah asked if Michelle Obama would ever consider a presidential run .
â€œIâ€ ™ m going to continue to work with young people all over the world , â€ �
she said before pausing .
â€œNot as president .
I will not run for president.â€ �
After a chorus of playful jeers from the crowd she explained that one of the reasons was that so her children â€ “ Malia and Sasha â€ “ would no longer be in the spotlight .
â€œNo , no not going to do it .
One of the reasons why is that Iâ€ ™ ve got these two young people at home .
Being the kids , the daughters of a president , just think about it .
Come on young people , not so easy .
Theyâ€ ™ ve handled it with grace and with poise , but there are so many ways to impact the world and you donâ€ ™ t have to be president of the United States to do them.â€ �
She said she was planning to continue her advocacy work , with a special focus on working with young people , after her time at the White House and that she wanted a new generation of engaged young people to get into politics .
â€œI
just know that if I can do this and be here and have gone to great colleges and have all these wonderful experiences , you can do it too ,
â€ � she said .
â€œExperiencing this journey with our young people of all ages , Iâ€ ™ ll miss that , but Iâ€ ™ m going to keep doing it for the rest of my life.â€ �
Ted Cruz responds to the Garland nomination : Merrick Garland is exactly the type of Supreme Court nominee you get when you make deals in Washington D.C.
A so - called â€˜moderateâ€ ™ Democrat nominee is precisely the kind of deal that Donald Trump has told us he would make â€ “ someone who would rule along with other liberals on the bench like Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor . ...
I proudly stand with my Republican colleagues in our shared belief
â€ “ our advice and consent
â€ “ that we should not vote on any nominee until the next president is sworn into office .
The People will decide .
The Bernie Sanders camp says in a fundraising email that Clinton has hit â€œthe high water markâ€
� and Sanders will win a string of upcoming states .
The demographics bear him out on the â€œupcoming statesâ€ � part , with favorable conditions for Sanders in seven of the next eight states , according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis ... followed by gentle winds for Clinton in six of the last seven .
Of note : Sanders does not appear to have a path to overtake Clinton in the delegates race , barring an earthquake twist .
From the Sanders fundraising statement : What you will not hear from the political and media establishment is that , based on the primary and caucus schedule for the rest of the race , this is the high water mark for the Clinton campaign .
Starting today , the map now shifts dramatically in our favor .
[ ... ] That means we have an extremely good chance to win nearly every state that votes in the next month .
If we continue to stand together , weâ€ ™ re just getting started for our political revolution .

â€œItâ€

â€œThat is what the American people deserve , it is what our Constitution demands , and with millions of peopleâ€ ™ s lives in the balance , anything less is entirely unacceptable.â€ �
There used to be enough Republicans in the presidential race that one or two could rotate out of the debate schedule and youâ€ ™ d barely even notice .
That was then .
With both Trump and Kasich saying they would not attend a debate penciled in for this coming Monday in Salt Lake City , the debate has been canceled , AP reports : Karen Boe , a spokeswoman for the Salt Palace Convention Center , said they were informed Wednesday morning that the event was being scrapped .
Cruz taunts Trump as â€œducking Donaldâ€ � : Not only did Hillary Clinton outrun Bernie Sanders last night
â€
“
she outran her 2008 performances in , it appears , all five states to vote .
Not all precincts have reported in Illinois , but Clinton , who won the state , clearly did much better , mutatis mutandis , than in 2008 , when she was running against home - state senator Barack Obama .
Missouri is still too close to call , but again Clinton appears to be out - performing her previous primary run there , in terms of her share of what was admittedly a much different race .
Here are the 2008 - 2016 comparisons for Ohio and Florida : John Kasich aide John Weaver says the Ohio governorâ€ ™ s campaign will not be appearing at an event recently announced for next week unless Trump reverses his back - out .
Trump has released a video spot with a lot of creative editing to make it look like Russian president Vladimir Putin is laughing at Hillary Clinton barking like a dog after he does judo .

The ranking Democrat on the judiciary committee calls on colleagues to â€œdo your jobâ€ � and give the nominee a hearing : Now that the Garland news has settled a bit , letâ€ ™ s quick revisit a slice of the results from last night , in North Carolina , where Hillary Clinton came in 14 points ahead of Bernie Sanders .
( In a race where margins matter , she won Ohio by a similar margin and Florida by blink - blink 31 points .
Visit our county - by - county results page here . )
It was a much better showing for Clinton than in the 2008 Democratic primary , which she lost to Barack Obama :
Trump was asked in a telephone interview with CNN this morning about the possibility of a brokered national Republican convention if no one candidate hits 1,237 delegates .
â€œIf weâ€ ™ re 20 votes short or if weâ€ ™ re you know 100 votes , and weâ€ ™ re at 1,100 and somebody else is at 500 or 400 , cause weâ€ ™ re way ahead
â€
“
I donâ€
™ t think you can say we donâ€ ™ t get it automatically , I think youâ€ ™ d have riots , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œIâ€ ™ m representing a tremendous , many many millions of people ...
If you disenfranchise those people , I think you would have problems like youâ€ ™ ve never seen before .
I think bad things would happen .
I wouldnâ€

“
but I think bad things would happen.â€ �
Nice country you got there .
Be a shame if something happened to it .
Get to know Merrick Garland , in this official White House video : Obama called McConnell today to discuss the Garland nomination and the pair spoke , NBC News reports .
And apparently did not budge in their stances of total opposition on the Supreme Court nominee question .
Paul Ryan has just taken 50 % of the fun out of talk of a brokered national Republican convention by saying through a spokesperson that heâ€ ™ s not into the idea of swooping in as a last - minute presidential nominee .
â€œThe speaker is grateful for the support , but he is not interested .
He will not accept a nomination and believes our nominee should be someone who ran this year , â€ � Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said .
Now hereâ€ ™ s a profile in courage : Florida governor Rick Scott has endorsed Donald Trump for president , a day after Trump beat home - state senator Marco Rubio by 19 points .
â€œWith his victories yesterday , I believe it is now time for Republicans to accept and respect the will of the voters and coalesce behind Donald Trump , â€ � a Scott statement says .
â€œThe voters are speaking clearly
â€ “ they want a businessman outsider who will dramatically shake up the status quo in Washington.â€
�
Senator Pat Toomey , Republican of Pennsylvania , says he would be glad to consider the Garland nomination ... next year :
McConnell says the senate will consider the qualifications of the nominee â€œthe next president nominates , whoever that might be.â€ �
He tells the White House to â€œgive the people a voiceâ€ � â€ “ meaning wait a year for a new president .
McConnell is speaking .
Heâ€
™ s quoting Joe Biden on the senate floor in 1992 arguing against nominating supreme court justices in the thick of a presidential race .
McConnell repeatedly calls it â€œthe Biden rule.â€ � â€œInstead of spending more time to debate an issue where we canâ€ ™ t agree , â€ �
letâ€ ™ s work on things we can agree on , McConnell says .
Like jobs .
Hatch is behind McConnell in the chamber .
â€œPresident Obama and his allies may try to pretend this fight is about a person ,
â€ �
McConnell says .
â€œBut .. it remains about a principle and not a person.â€ �
McConnell accuses the White House of politicizing the process .
He says what the president has done â€œwould be unfair to any nomineeâ€ � and warns of â€œthe great costs this action could carry for our nation.â€ �
The Republican National Committee has send a fundraiser email asking people to contribute to â€œfight backâ€ � against the Garland nomination .
â€œObama wants to ram a Clinton - appointed judge , Merrick Garland , down the American peopleâ€ ™ s throats ,
â€ � the email says .
â€œBut our Party has launched the Supreme Court Task Force to fight back as the left attacks us for defending the American people.â€ � Clinton nominated Garland to the DC circuit in the mid-1990s .
He was confirmed by a senate vote of 76 - 23 .
Itâ€ ™ s official :
the White House announces a nomination sent to the Senate : Intermission .
Majority leader McConnell says he is headed to the Senate floor to deliver remarks on the Garland nomination .
Garland skims through prosecutions from gang prosecutions to the Oklahoma City case .
â€œWe promised that we could find the perpetrators , that we would bring them to justice and that we would do that in a way that would honor the Constitution.â€ � â€œTrust in justice ... is what in large part distinguishes this country from others ,
â€ �
Garland says .
He says judges must put aside personal views and preferences and â€œfollow the law , not make it.â€ � â€œIf the senate sees fit to confirm me ...
I promise to continue on that course.â€ �
He turns to the president and says he is â€œgrateful beyond
wordsâ€ � for the honor .
The trio goes back inside .
Garland is heading to the hill tomorrow for meetings with lawmakers , Obama said .
â€œThis is the greatest honor of my life other than Lynn agreeing to marry me 28 years ago , â€ � Garland says .
And the greatest gift , apart from the birth of our daughters , he says .
Heâ€ ™ s choking up .
Touching start .
He talks about his parents leaving Europe , â€œfleeing anti - Semitismâ€ � to land in Chicago .
He tells his father and motherâ€ ™ s story , his father instilling the importance of hard work and fairness , and his motherâ€ ™ s volunteer work teaching him the importance of service to the community .
He says his mother â€œis watching him on television and crying her eyes out.â€ �
He says he wishes his father could â€œsee this day.â€ �
He says his older daughter is hiking out of cell service range , and chuckles .
â€œHe is the right man for the job .
He deserves to be confirmed .
I could not be prouder of the work he has already done on behalf of the American people .
He deserves our thanks.â€ � â€ “ Obama â€œI said I would take this process seriously , and I did .
I chose a serious man and an exemplary judge , Merrick Garland ,
â€ � Obama says .
He says in all his conversations with lawmakers , â€œThe one name that has come up repeatedly from Republicans and Democrats alike is Merrick Garland.â€
�
â€œI recognize that we have entered the political season ... a political season that is even noisier and more volatile than usual .
â€œI also know because of Justice Scaliaâ€ ™ s outsized role on the court and American law ...
it is tempting to make this confirmation process simply an extension of our divided politics ...
â€œBut to go down that path would be wrong .
It would be a betrayal of our best traditions .
And a betrayal of ... our founding doctrines .
â€œThis is precisely the time when we should play it straight .
â€œThe Supreme Court is unique .
Itâ€ ™ s supposed to be above politics .
It has to be , and it should stay that way ...
â€œI simply ask Republicans in the senate to give him a fair hearing , and then an up - or - down vote .
If you donâ€ ™ t then it will not only be an abdication of the senateâ€ ™ s constitutional duty ...
it will mean everything is subject to the most partisan politics , everything.â€ � â€œThe reputation of the Supreme Court will inevitably suffer .
Faith in our justice system will inevitably suffer .
And our democracy will ultimately suffer as well .
â€œI have fulfilled my constitutional duty .
Now itâ€ ™ s time for the Senate to do theirs .
Presidents do not stop working in the final year of their terms .
Neither should the senate.â€
� Obama quotes current chief Justice John Roberts , Garlandâ€ ™ s former colleague on the DC circuit .
â€œAny time Judge Garland disagrees , you know youâ€ ™ re in a difficult area , â€ � Roberts has said .
But Garland is not just a great legal mind , Obama says .
He has â€œa dedication to protecting the basic rights of every American , â€ � including â€œeveryday Americans.â€ � â€œTo find someone who has such a long career in public service ... to find someone who just about everyone respects but likes , that is rare , â€ � Obama says .
Now Obama is quoting senior Republican senator Hatch .
â€œIn all honesty I would like to see one person come to this floor and say one reason why Merrick Garland does not deserve this position.â€
�
Hatch has since called Garland an easy consensus nominee .
Obama points out that Republicans voted to confirm Garland .
Then he was elevated to chief judge .
Heâ€
™ s spent 19 years on the DC circuit .
Obama says Garland has a â€œtrack record on building consensus as a thoughtful , fair - minded justice who follows the law.â€ � Obama sketches Garlandâ€ ™ s bio .
Born in Chicago .
Valedictorian of public high school .
Summa cum laude from Harvard and graduate of Harvard Law .
He sold his comic book collection to help pay for law school .
Yuk Yuk .
â€œStop .
Iâ€ ™ ve been there , â€ � Obama says .
He continues : Garland clerked for two Eisenhower appointees , Friendly and Brennan .
He entered private practice and rose to partner in four years .
In 1989 he â€œwalked away from a comfortable and lucrative law practice to return to public service.â€ �
He was a prosecutor in George HW Bushâ€ ™ s administration .
â€œHe quickly made a name for himself going after corrupt politicians and violent criminals.â€ �
He oversaw â€œevery aspect of the federal response to the Oklahoma City bombing.â€ � â€œMerrick had one evening to say goodbye to his young daughters before he went to Oklahoma City , where he would remain for weeks ...
he led the investigation and supervised the prosecution that brought Timothy McVeigh to justice .
Perhaps what was most important was the way he did
it.â€
�
â€œMerrick would take no chances that someone who murdered innocent Americans would go free on a technical challenge , â€ � Obama says .
He reached out to the victimsâ€ ™ families .
Garland calls it â€œthe most important thing I have ever done in my life , â€ � Obama says .
â€œItâ€ ™ s no surprise then ,
that soon after his work in Oklahoma City , â€ �
Garland was nominated to the DC Circuit court .
Obama is explaining and admiring the role of the court in US civil life .
â€œThis is nota a responsibility that I take lightly , â€ � he says .
It requires that he â€œset aside narrow politics.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ ve done my best to set up a rigorous comprehensive process , â€ � Obama says .
The WHite House talked with all judiciary committee members , scholars and experts .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve selected a nominee who is widely recognized not only as one of Americaâ€ ™ s sharpest legal minds , but someone who brings ... integrity , even - handedness and excellence.â€ � Obama calls Garland â€œuniquely
qualifiedâ€ � to join the court immediately .
â€œToday I am nominating chief Judge Merrick Brian Garland to join the Supreme Court.â€ � Applause .
Hereâ€ ™ s the president .
Vice president Joe Biden and Garland are with him .
Obama says few decisions are â€œmore consequentialâ€
� than nominating a court justice .
At least weâ€ ™ re all going into this looming nomination battle with the best of intentions :
Hereâ€ ™ s a live video feed of the Rose Garden , where the president is scheduled to speak momentarily : He has â€œa very good brain , â€ � in his assessment .
Donald Trump has made it official : heâ€ ™ s not participating in the scheduled 21 March debate in Salt Lake City , a recent add to the debate calendar .
Trump told Fox News that he would instead be speaking to AIPAC , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee .
â€œIâ€ ™ m doing a major speech in front of a very important group of people that night , â€ � he said .
While we wait for Obama to pop up in the Rose Garden in about 15 minutes , letâ€ ™ s take a quick scan of politics news lines .
Former House speaker John Boehner has just kicked the conceptual door wide open on a brokered convention in which someone not currently running for president emerges as the Republican nominee .
That someone would be Boehnerâ€ ™ s successor , Paul Ryan , the Ohioan told the Futures Industry Association in comments first reported by Politico .
Update :
Not happening , Ryan says .
If no candidate is elected in the first round of voting at the national convention in July , presumably after having crossed the 1,237 delegate barrier , Boehner said , â€œIâ€ ™ m for Paul Ryanâ€
�
: They all had a chance to win .
None of them won .
So Iâ€ ™ m for none of the above .
Iâ€ ™ m for Paul Ryan to be our nominee .
The number seven is significant because under the current 54 - 46 makeup of the Senate , it only would take five Republican senators to vote in favor of a nominee to confirm by majority .
Not that Garland will get anywhere close to a confirmation vote , or that senators who previously voted in his favor would again do so in this political climate .
Barack Obama is expected to intensify his fight with the Republican majority in the US Senate by nominating an appeals court judge with a record of challenging the federal government to the US supreme court in the wake of the death of the conservative justice Antonin Scalia , write the Guardianâ€ ™ s Ed Pilkington and Dan Roberts :
Merrick Garland , the nominee according to a White House official , now faces an almost insurmountable task of overcoming the dogged resistance of the Republican wing of the Senate that has made clear its intention to boycott any Obama nominee to the nationâ€ ™ s highest court .
His nomination puts him at the center of one of the most bitter disputes to erupt between the White House and conservatives in Congress .
At 63 , Garland the oldest of the candidates that Obama shortlisted for the top judicial post .
His age alone is likely to embolden Republican senators in their contentious opposition to confirming anyone , as it will arm them with ammunition against him based on his long previous record .
The nominee is chief judge of the federal appeals court of Washington DC , a panel that traditionally is seen as a training ground for future supreme court justices .
He was nominated for the DC circuit by Bill Clinton in 1997 .
It may not presage well that it took the US Senate of that day â€ “ which was also Republican - controlled â€ “ 18 months to complete the confirmation process .
The eventual vote was 76 to 23 , with 32 Republicans supporting him .
Read the full piece here : The Guardian has independently confirmed that Judge Merrick Garland is president Obamaâ€ ™ s pick to fill the court vacancy .
Democratic senator Chuck Schumer , a judiciary committee member , tells Reuters that Garland is indeed the presidentâ€ ™ s pick .
â€œItâ€ ™ s an excellent choice , a bipartisan choice .
If the Republicans canâ€ ™ t support him , who could they support , â€ � said Schumer .
Tom Goldstein of ScotusBlog has written a useful primer on Garlandâ€ ™ s career and jurisprudence .
He calls Garland â€œessentially the model , neutral judgeâ€ � :
He is acknowledged by all to be brilliant .
His opinions avoid unnecessary , sweeping pronouncements ...
He has broad support on both sides of the aisle , and he has few ideologically controversial rulings .
Conservative commentators have expressed support for a potential Garland nomination ...
Judge Garland would also likely have the most immediate influence on the Court .
He is well known to the Justices and is likely the most respected by them collectively , particularly the more conservative Justices .
The fact that Judge Garland is not only extremely intelligent and respectful but exceptionally careful and quite centrist would mean that his views would have particular salience with , among others , Justices Kennedy and Alito .
Republicans from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell on down have said that they will not consider an Obama nominee to fill the court vacancy .
In ten months a new president will take office .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know how many times we need to keep saying this : the judiciary committee has unanimously recommended to me that there be no hearing ,
â€ �
McConnell said last month .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve said repeatedly and Iâ€ ™ m now confident that my conference agrees that this decision ought to be made by the next president , whoever is elected.â€ �
McConnell said he saw no reason even to meet with an Obama nominee .
Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley , who would be in charge of convening any hearings on the nominee , has said he will not .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re not going to drop any nominee into that election - year cauldron , â€ � he said earlier this month .
â€œIâ€
™ m certainly not going to let it happen to the good people of Iowa.â€
�
( Grassley is senator for Iowa . )
Republicans have in the past said nice things in particular , however , about Garland , who led the prosecution of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh .
Senator Orrin Hatch , the bodyâ€ ™ s senior Republican , has said that Garlandâ€ ™ s
â€œintelligence and his scholarship can not be questionedâ€ � .
President Barack Obama will announce Merrick Garland , the chief justice for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit , as his nominee to replace late Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia , the Associated Press and various outlets are reporting .
Weâ€ ™ re working to confirm .
Garland was confirmed to the D.C. Circuit in 1997 with backing from a majority in both parties , including seven current Republican senators .
Hello , and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House .
President Barack Obama is about to announce , at 11 am ET , a supreme court nominee â€ “ a move sure to make major waves in the nominating races .
But it will be hard to top the crests last night , when Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump exceeded expectations to rack up delegates in five states with mixed demographics in various regions , demonstrating again the national caliber of each candidacy .
In one state , Missouri , the races were too close to call on both the Democratic and Republican sides .
That didnâ€ ™ t stop both the Clinton and Trump campaigns from claiming wins .
Senator Marco Rubio suspended his campaign after losing his home state of Florida badly to Trump , who swiped all 99 of the delegates at stake .
Governor John Kasich enjoyed a home - state victory in Ohio and vowed to fight to the July convention , though he seemed out of the delegates race .
Ted Cruz failed to notch a victory but said the race was between him and Trump .
Hereâ€ ™ s a snapshot of the delegates races as they stand :
Who do you think gets the supreme court nod this morning ?
As always , thanks for reading and joining in !"
2016-03-17,"With the dust finally settling after Super Tuesday : Civil War , Donald Trump ’s hold on the race for the Republican presidential nomination is beginning to impact every element of the campaign , from his own party ’s preparation for the convention in July to the presumptive Democratic nominee
’s focus on the November general election .
That is , if she is n’t too busy sashaying on RuPaul ’s Drag Race :
As we count down the days until the next crucial set of primary contests , let ’s look at the most important news from the campaign trail today :
Former presidential candidate Marco Rubio told Minnesota supporters on a conference call that he thinks fellow senator Ted Cruz is the “ the only conservative left in the race .
”
Rubio did n’t go so far as to endorse Cruz on the call , but he did warn of the dangers of potentially elevating a trailing candidate to nominee in a brokered convention .
Rubio ’s comments followed an assessment late Wednesday by Ben Carson , also a former candidate , that “ turmoil ” would attend a contested convention .
Part of the reason for Rubio ’s gloom - and - doom mood about the Republican nomination : A new Reuters / Ipsos poll that found half of American women have a “ very unfavorable ” view of Republican frontrunner Donald Trump , up from the 40 % who felt that way in October .
“
Women form just over half of the U.S. population , ” Reuters notes , “ and they have turned out at higher rates than men in every election since 1996 .
”
But political opinions are malleable , as former presidential candidate Lindsey Graham showed earlier today .
The South Carolina senator , who once compared choosing between Cruz and Trump to choosing between being poisoned or shot , has picked his poison : Graham now plans to host a fundraiser for Cruz .
At least one person does n’t hate Donald Trump : Onetime gubernatorial candidate and former grand wizard of the Ku Kluz Klan David Duke declared on his radio show that Trump ’s success could go a long way towards rehabilitating Adolf Hitler ’s public image .
“
They might be rehabilitating that fellow with the mustache back there in Germany , because I saw a commercial against Donald Trump , a really vicious commercial , comparing what Donald Trump said about preserving America and making America great again to Hitler in Germany preserving Germany and making Germany great again .
”
Bernie Sanders said today that he will not seek a recount of results in Missouri ’s Democratic presidential primary , conceding defeat to Hillary Clinton , for whom the election was called by the Associated Press only this afternoon .
“
I think it ’s unlikely the results will impact at all the number of delegates the candidate gets
and I would prefer to save the taxpayers of Missouri some money , ” the ever - conciliatory Sanders told the Associated Press .
That ’s it for this evening - check us out tomorrow , the next day , and every day after that for up - to - the - minute coverage of the 2016 presidential campaign .
Members of the Republican party leadership met privately today in the nation ’s capital in the hopes of crafting a strategy that would bring about the end of billionaire frontrunner Donald Trump ’s pursuit of the party ’s presidential nomination , according to the Associated Press .
Less than a week before another string of contests threatens to increase Trump ’s considerable delegate lead over the remaining contenders for the party ’s nomination , figures in the Republican establishment - which included commentator Erick Erickson and evangelical leader Bob Fischer - hoped “ to strategize how to defeat Donald Trump for the Republican nomination , and if he is the Republican nominee for president , to offer a true conservative candidate in the general election .
”
In a statement released after the conclusion of the meeting , the party leaders called for a “ unity ticket that unites the Republican Party .
”
Such a ticket would likely include at least one of the Republican presidential candidates who have suspended their campaigns in the face of the Trump juggernaut .
The group declined , however , to endorse one of the remaining Republican candidates .
“
Lastly , we intend to keep our options open as to other avenues to oppose Donald Trump , ” the statement said , in what appeared to be a veiled reference to a possible third - party run for the White House , either through a new party or the endorsement of a preexisting political party ’s presidential ticket , like that of the Constitution Party .
Former first lady Laura Bush is n’t falling into the same trap that has ensnared so many other Republicans in recent weeks .
In an interview with USA Today , the wife of former president George W Bush was tightlipped about whether she would vote for billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump , who once slammed her husband as having been unable to prevent the September 11 terrorist attacks that occurred during the first year of his presidency .
“
I ’m not going to answer ,
” Bush told USA Today ’s Capital Download .
“
Do n’t ask that .
” Bush , who was promoting her new book ,
We Are Afghan Women : Voices of Hope , which makes the case for continued US troop presence in Afghanistan , told USA Today ’s Susan Page that she has n’t committed to vote for any of the remaining Republican candidates .
Her brother - in - law , Jeb , dropped out of the race in February after a disappointing finish in the South Carolina primary .
“
We got off the sidelines for Jeb , ” she said .
“
He was our candidate .
”
She did venture to state her opinion on proposals adjacent to Trump - namely , the proposed ban on foreign Muslims from entering the United States , now supported by roughly two - thirds of the Republican electorate .
“
One of the reasons we are a country is because we believed in freedom of religion , ” she said .
“
We believed that people could be religious .
Or they could not worship , if they did n’t want to .
”
“
We do not have any religious test in the United States , and that ’s what we need to remember -
we need to remember what our values are .
”
The former first lady was once a Democrat before she married into the Bush political dynasty .
Gimme a break !
Bernie Sanders said on Thursday he will not seek a recount of results in Missouri ’s Democratic presidential primary , conceding defeat to Hillary Clinton .
“
I think it ’s unlikely the results will impact at all the number of delegates the candidate gets
and I would prefer to save the taxpayers of Missouri some money ,
” Sanders said in an interview with the Associated Press .
“
Whether we win by 200 votes or lose by 500 , it ’s not going to impact the delegate selection , ” the Vermont senator added .
“
It ’s going to be evenly divided .
”
Clinton ended Tuesday night with a narrow lead of 1,531 votes , but under state law , Sanders could have sought a recount because the margin was less than one - half of one percent .
Clinton will get an extra two delegates from Missouri for winning the statewide vote .
Michigan governor Rick Snyder , who is under pressure to resign over his response to the ongoing Flint water crisis , appeared before the House oversight committee in Congress on Thursday morning , telling members that the tragedy weighs on his mind “ day [ and ] night ” .
Snyder has faced increasing criticism in recent weeks following revelations he was aware of the scale of the lead poisoning in the city months before he took action to address the problem .
Three bruising Congressional hearings into the Flint water crisis , possibly the gravest US public health emergency since Hurricane Katrina , have produced plenty of bluster and finger - pointing , but also troubling suggestions that America ’s system of government is fundamentally broken .
A procession of elected officials , mayors , regulators and an emergency manager have appeared before the inquiry since February , to be berated over how a poverty - stricken city of 100,000 people was fed poisoned water for over a year before anyone started to heed warnings that all was not well .
An estimated 8,000 Flint children risk growing up with learning and developmental problems due to the lead that leached into their drinking supply .
America ’s complex web of water regulations gave ample opportunity for those questioned to hurl blame at others .
There was no shortage of targets .
At the time Flint fatefully switched its water supply to the Flint river in April 2014 , the decision was made by a state - appointed emergency manager , a sort of financial tsar with wide - ranging powers .
But there was still a mayor , a council , a state regulator , the governor the regulator reported to and the US Environmental Protection Agency .
Everybody , yet nobody , was responsible .
It was intended , according to its creator , as a “ warning to America ” , a horrifying and fantastical vision of the future in which the US – ludicrously – had elected as its president Donald Trump .
But with the property billionaire now the favourite to gain the Republican nomination for the presidency , the episode of The Simpsons that in 2000 foresaw such a laughable outcome has begun looking unnervingly prescient .
A possible future Trump presidency , said the episode ’s writer Dan Greaney , “ just seemed like the logical last stop before hitting bottom .
It was pitched because it was consistent with the vision of America going insane ” .
A few months ago , Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin seemed on course to becoming best buddies .
Asked in December for his view of the Republican presidential frontrunner , the Russian president described him as “ a colourful and talented person without any doubt ” and “ the absolute leader of the presidential race ” .
Trump welcomed the praise , saying : “ It is always a great honour to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond .
”
Any cosiness has been brought to an abrupt halt , however , after Trump lumped Putin in with Islamic State in a bizarre campaign ad featuring Hillary Clinton barking like a dog .
The video , posted on Trump ’s Instagram account , attempts to cast doubt over the Democratic party frontrunner ’s ability to deal with Putin and America ’s opponents in general , showing the Russian leader throwing an opponent in a judo bout , and an Islamist militant gesturing at the camera with a gun .
“
When it comes to facing our toughest opponents , the Democrats have the perfect answer , ” the video says , before cutting to footage of Clinton imitating a dog at a recent campaign event .
The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he had seen the clip but did not know if Putin had .
“
Our attitude is negative , ” he said .
Billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump got flack this week for saying that he primarily consults with himself on foreign policy issues , “ because I have a very good brain
and I ’ve said a lot of things .
”
Speaking of just who presidential candidates are consulting on international relations , fellow candidate Ted Cruz has chosen an interesting addition to his shadow cabinet of advisers : Frank Gaffney , the founder of think tank Center for Security Policy dubbed “ one of America ’s most notorious Islamophobes
” by the Southern Poverty Law Center .
Gaffney , who has speculated that Barack Obama is a secret Muslim and that Saddam Hussein was the mastermind of the Oklahoma City bombing , was the orchestrator of the poll that Trump has used to justify his proposed ban on foreign Muslims from entering the United States .
That poll , which purported to show that “ 25 % of [ American Muslims ] polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad ” and that 51 % of those polled “ agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Shariah , ” has been widely lambasted as methodologically incorrect .
Despite the popularity of his work with the Trump campaign , Gaffney has taken on the role of Cruz ’s top adviser on national security and foreign policy .
Well , that took ’em long enough .
When there is upheaval within China ’s own borders – riots , protests , vicious political power struggles – hardly a sniff of it will be found in the pages of the country
’s heavily - controlled press .
When it happens elsewhere – and particularly when it underscores the perils and pitfalls of democracy – it becomes front - page news .
Such is the case of Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump , who , for China ’s authoritarian rulers , has become the latest example of how allowing the masses a say in choosing their leaders is a bad idea .
“
The rise of a racist in the US political area worries the whole world , ” the party - controlled Global Times crowed this week ahead of of Trump ’s victory in the latest round of primaries .
“
He has even been called another Benito Mussolini or Adolf Hitler by some western media .
”
It added , darkly : “ Mussolini and Hitler came to power through elections , a heavy lesson for western democracy .
”
Donald Trump ’s speculation that a contested / brokered / open convention in Cleveland would lead to “ riots ” in the streets of Cleveland has lead to condemnation of the billionaire frontrunner ’s apparent threat - with the sharpest condemnation coming from fellow Republican candidate John Kasich .
In a series of tweets , the Ohio governor excoriated the real estate tycoon for his “ implicit acceptance of violence ” this afternoon .
Criticism of the billionaire ’s apparent acceptance - even endorsement - of violence at his campaign rallies has increased after a series of high - profile incidents , including an assault on a protestor , the manhandling of a female reporter by Trump ’s campaign manager and the cancellation of a rally in Chicago that threatened to turn into a full - bore riot .
We ’ll be watching and liveblogging ...
The bare knuckle fight over Merrick Garland could sway this election , writes Jill Abramson .
Garland ’s
temperate record magnifies the extremism of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz .
- and voters will be taking careful note of how the Republicans behave .
Garland ’s temperate record and demeanor also magnify the extremism of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz , the leaders for the GOP presidential nomination who could make their own court nominees if Garland is not confirmed by the election .
That could further scare off moderate Republicans .
No one has any idea , really , about Trump ’s judicial philosophy .
His statements about the Court have gyrated , praising Thomas , but calling Chief Justice John Roberts , another conservative , a “ disgrace ” for voting to uphold President Obama ’s health care law .
Meanwhile , he has said that his sister , a federal appeals court judge in New Jersey , would be a “ phenomenal ” pick .
But she scares some conservatives because of a pro - abortion ruling .
Predicting the candidates Trump might choose for the Court is harder than figuring out who will be left standing on The Apprentice .
Cruz will seek someone more Scalia than Scalia .
The Texan is a strict “ originalist ” who believes that only the literal words of the Constitution should guide the court ’s decisions .
His skepticism of federal power has been compared to John Calhoun , the states rights absolutist whose pro - slavery views helped spark the Civil War .
Cruz , who , like Garland , graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School , prides himself on being a constitutional scholar and was heavily involved in George W Bush ’s legal strategy to win the presidency in the contested election of 2000 .
His record as Texas ’s solicitor general and his legal views as a senator put him way out on the right fringe , where he could scare voters more than Trump .
Two days after suspending his campaign for president , Marco Rubio wasted no time returning to his day job on Capitol Hill .
Rubio , while addressing reporters just before an intelligence committee hearing , was quick to put to rest any immediate speculation over his future .
“
I ’m not going to be anybody ’s vice president .
I ’m not interested in being vice president , ” Rubio said .
“ I ’m not running for governor of Florida .
I ’m going to finish out my term in the senate ...
and then I ’ll be a private citizen in January .
”
Rubio , who declined to seek re - election for his senate seat while running for president , also ruled out a late entry into the Florida race to hold on to his seat .
Comments made by Rubio to his supporters earlier today on the state of the race garnered attention , after the senator reportedly said his former rival Ted Cruz was “
the only conservative left in the race .
” Rubio downplayed their significance while speaking with reporters , adding he was not making any endorsements at this stage .
“
Clearly Ted ’s positions on issues are conservative , but I do n’t have anything further to elaborate on , ” Rubio said .
He added that he likes Ohio governor John Kasich , too , but was simply stating his opinion on the remainder of the Republican field .
Rubio also held firm in his opposition to filling the supreme court vacancy left by the late justice Antonin Scalia under Barack Obama .
The senator said he did n’t plan to meet with Merrick Garland , the president ’s nominee , and even if they spoke it would n’t change his mind .
“
I know enough about his record to know I would n’t support him
and I know enough about the position in general to say I do n’t think we should be moving forward on a nominee in the last year of this president ’s term , ” Rubio said .
Onetime gubernatorial candidate and former grand wizard of the Ku Kluz Klan David Duke has declared that the success of Republican billionaire frontrunner Donald Trump could go a long way towards rehabilitating Adolf Hitler ’s public image .
Duke , who has endorsed Trump ’s bid for the Republican nomination , declared on his radio show this week that “ they might be rehabilitating that fellow with the mustache back there in Germany , because I saw a commercial against Donald Trump , a really vicious commercial , comparing what Donald Trump said about preserving America and making America great again to Hitler in Germany preserving Germany and making Germany great again .
”
“
This war that ’s going on against Donald Trump is really a war going on against America , it ’s a war going on against the European - American majority , ” Duke said later in the program .
“
The media has incited hatred and violence and repression of Donald Trump and the hundreds of thousands , the millions of people who support him , and that ’s what happened in Chicago .
”
Trump has gotten heat for dragging his feet on condemning Duke and the Ku Klux Klan , telling CNN that “ certainly I would disavow it if I thought there was something wrong .
”
Trump subsequently reversed course , tweeting :
“ As I stated at the press conference on Friday regarding David Duke –
I disavow .
”
General Joseph Dunford , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , discussed suggestions made by Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump on dealing with Islamic State terrorists , while appearing before the Senate armed services committee today .
While Trump was not mentioned by name , the general said asking members of the military to “ target civilian non - combatants and engage in techniques such as waterboarding ” – both of which have been championed by Trump – would have “ many adverse effects
” , including on force morale .
Republican opposition to the nomination of a supreme court justice is crumbling now that the “ stellar ” Merrick Garland has been put forward , senate Democrats claimed on Thursday .
The Republican leadership is holding out against senate confirmation hearings or a vote after Barack Obama named Garland to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia , who died last month .
Republican senators insist that the next president should make the selection .
But Chuck Schumer , Democratic senator for New York , said in response to a question from the Guardian on Thursday : “
We are seeing cracks on the Republican side .
About five or six members have agreed already to meet with the nominee and I think what happened is they saw how stellar the nominee was and they realised how bad it would be not to ...
They ’re feeling the heat and we believe we ’ll see many more cracks over the next two weeks .
” Schumer and other Democratic senators addressed reporters outside the supreme court ahead of Garland ’s first meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday afternoon .
He was due to make courtesy calls on Democrats Harry Reid and Patrick Leahy but not on Republicans .
Billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has discovered Twitter ’s polling function ...
Video – Top military official says Trump ’s plans would have ‘ adverse effects’ Kasich announces he will contest Utah , where Ted Cruz is expected to make a strong run among conservatives and Mormon voters .
Some observers raise an eyebrow , noting that by Utah ’s rules , a candidate who takes a majority of the vote wins all 40 of the state ’s Republican delegates .
Would n’t that be a better outcome than a split verdict in which Trump snags some delegates from the state , bringing him closer to the coveted 1,237 majority ?
The Kasich camp says the point is still to keep Trump out of the delegates – by keeping him below a 15 % threshold for winning any delegates .
Update :
it ’s not clear that Kasich plan is so solid .
Because the 15 % threshold ceases to apply if only two candidates clear it .
Who is the Kasich camp counting on to clear it , apart from Cruz and Kasich ?
Florida senator Marco Rubio , who is still a senator for 10 months , has announced on Capitol Hill that he would not join a Republican ticket as anyone ’s vice presidential running mate ; that “ I ’m not running for [ Florida ] governor , ” and that he would not run for reelection to the senate , according to various media reports .
What will he do ?
You wo n’t hear us say this much .
But .
This probably calls for gifs .
Here is video of senator Graham telling CNN ’s Dana Bash about his decision to back Cruz .
He stops short of calling it an endorsement .
“ John Kasich
I think is the most viable general election candidate , I just do n’t see how John gets through the primary , ” Graham says .
“
This is an outsider year , he ’s seen as an insider .
”
“
I think [ Cruz is ] the best alternative to Donald Trump
, he ’s certainly not my preference , senator Cruz is not ,
” Graham says .
“
But he ’s a reliable Republican conservative , of which I ’ve had many differences with .
“
I doubt Donald Trump ’s conservatism
and I think he ’d be a disaster for the party ,
so I ’m going to try to raise money for senator Cruz in the pro - Israel community .
”
The American Israel Public Affairs Committee is holding its annual policy conference in Washington next week .
Graham was to host a fundraiser Monday night .
“
I think the best alternative to Donald Trump , to stop him from getting to 1,237 , is Ted Cruz , ” Graham continued .
“
I ’m going to help Ted in every way I can .
”
Asked about his past differences with Cruz , Graham says : “ It tells you a lot about where we are as a party .
”
Is it any coincidence that just as news breaks of Lindsey Graham ’s support for Ted Cruz , a bald eagle hatchling emerged from its shell in Washington , DC ?
“
If you kill Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate , and the trial was in the Senate , nobody could convict you , ” Republican senator Lindsey Graham joked at a press club foundation dinner last month .
That was then .
Graham , heretofore one of Cruz ’s most vocal detractors in the senate , now plans to host a fundraiser for Cruz on Monday , CNN reports .
By now we know a bit about the presidential candidates , and more about state rules for delegate allocation than we ’d care to .
But we ’re trying to get a read on which issues matter most to you , our readers , this election cycle .
It ’s plain from your comments that income and wealth inequality , social issues , civil liberties , and US conduct on the international stage are central concerns .
But if you have a second we ’d like for you to tell us : which election issue matters most to you ?
Thanks for taking the time !
Ask Al Gore ?
Half of US women say they have a “ very unfavorable ” view of Donald Trump , according to Reuters /
Ipsos polling , up from the 40 % who felt that way in October .
The survey was taken from March 1 - 15 , and included 5,400 respondents .
Reuters expands : The rise in anti - Trump sentiment among women could pose a problem for the New York billionaire in his quest for the White House .
Women form just over half of the U.S. population , and they have turned out at higher rates than men in every election since 1996 , according to the U.S. Census Bureau .
A big general election challenge for Trump – especially , perhaps , if he ’s running against Hillary Clinton .
Read the full piece here .
Here ’s a piece to go with the video we posted earlier , with expert advice on how to cope with Trump anxiety .
A Muslim - American , a woman , an African - American , a journalist and a Mexican - American describe what about
Trump concerns them :
US secretary of state John Kerry on Thursday declared that acts committed by Islamic State against Christians and other minorities in Iraq and Syria are genocide , reports the Guardian ’s Amanda Holpuch : Kerry did not say how such a declaration would affect US involvement in areas controlled by Isis .
“
My purpose in appearing before you today is to assert that in my judgment , Daesh is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control including Yazidis , Christians and Shia Muslims , ” Kerry said , using an Arabic acronym for the extremist group .
“ Daesh is genocidal by self - proclamation , by ideology and by actions , in what it says , in what believes and in what it does .
”
John Kasich announces the endorsement of Michael Leavitt , former governor of Utah , which will award 40 Republican delegates in voting next Tuesday .
Anybody miss Ted Cruz on Megyn Kelly last night ?
Just in case , let ’s review : Cruz told Kelly that Donald Trump finds her “ a very very terrifying person ” and accused Trump of being “ scared to debate .
”
The Republicans scheduled a debate for Monday in Salt Lake City
but then Trump said he was n’t going and Kasich followed suit , and the debate was canceled .
“
The race has shifted to a terrain that is not favorable for him , ” Cruz says .
“
The closer we get to a one - on - one battle , the worse Donald Trump does .
”
Marco Rubio returns to his senate office , to warm welcome from staff .
The moment was captured by his comms team : Rubio got back to it after only two days .
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie withdrew from the race more than a month ago and he still has n’t gone back to work !
( That is n’t strictly true .
He has been campaigning for Trump a lot and that has kept him away from his home state .
We kid because we love .
Without the love part . )
South Carolina governor and Donald Trump critic Nikki Haley told the local Post and Courier that she was not prepared to make a new endorsement after her favored presidential candidate , senator Marco Rubio , dropped out of the race Tuesday .
But she is praying for Ted Cruz , Haley said .
“
As of now , I strongly believe I will support the Republican nominee , ” Haley said .
“
The only thing I can say now is my hope and my prayer is that senator Cruz can come through this .
“
That ’s who privately I ’m fighting for .
I do see a path for him , because I think he ’s been solid and strong the entire way .
I think that he ’s been disciplined in the way that he ’s done it .
”
Three North Carolina sheriff ’s deputies have been demoted and two suspended without pay for “ unsatisfactory performance ” at a 9 March Donald Trump rally at which a protester was sucker punched – leading deputies to pounce on the protester , ignoring his assailant .
The disciplinary measures were announced on the Facebook page of Cumberland County sheriff Earl “ Moose ” Butler .
“
We have disciplined five deputies following a professional standards investigation arising from the events at the Crown Coliseum in Fayetteville , ” the statement said .
“
Three deputies were demoted in rank , and they were suspended for a period of five days each without pay for unsatisfactory performance and failing to discharge the duties and policies of the Office of Sheriff .
“
Two other deputies were suspended for a period of three days without pay for unsatisfactory performance and the failure to discharge their duties .
”
Here ’s video of the incident : The assailant , John McGraw , was later charged with assault and battery .
In an interview at the rally he warned that the protester , Rakeem Jones , might be an Isis member and “ the next time we see him , we might have to kill him .
” Jones is not an Isis member .
He told local media that he was “ satisfied ” with the disciplining of the deputies but that his life had changed .
“
When I was threatened on national TV , this man was saying , ‘ we are going to have to kill him’ , ” Jones told TWCNews .
“
Though I ’m satisfied with the discipline of the sheriffs , I would like to know who is ‘ we’ ” .
The five disciplined deputies were placed on probationary status for a year , the sheriff ’s statement said .
“
The actions of the deputies and their failures to act in situations such as that which occurred during the Trump rally at the Crown Coliseum have never been and will not ever be tolerated under the policies of this office , ” the statement said .
Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson told CNN last night that there would be “ a lot of turmoil
” if Donald Trump was nudged aside by the Republican party in a brokered convention , should Trump ’s lead in the nominating race remain strong .
“
There ’s no question that there would be a lot of turmoil if the establishment tries to thwart the will of the people , recognizing that millions of new voters have come into the Republican fold , largely as a result of Donald Trump , ” Carson said .
Carson ’s remarks were prompted by a warning by Trump Tuesday
that if he holds a big lead going into the convention but not a full majority of delegates , and the party nominated someone else , “ I think you ’d have riots .
”
Rubio also warned of potential chaos from a brokered convention , in a conference call late Wednesday with supporters .
“ Winning a general election with a nominee that a significant percentage of the base thinks stole it , even though you did it through the rules of the RNC , would be pretty much fatal for the party , ” Rubio said .
Former presidential candidate Marco Rubio has told Minnesota supporters on a conference call that he thinks fellow senator Ted Cruz is the “ the only conservative left in the race , ” the Twin Cities Pioneer Press reports .
Rubio did not endorse Cruz on the call .
He did warn of the dangers of potentially elevating a trailing candidate to nominee in a brokered convention .
Rubio ’s comments followed an assessment late Wednesday by Ben Carson , also a former candidate , that “ turmoil ” would attend a contested convention .
“
Winning a general election with a nominee that a significant percentage of the base thinks stole it , even though you did it through the rules of the RNC , would be pretty much fatal for the party , ” Rubio said .
“ This election was entirely driven by national media coverage , in many ways , ” he said .
“
When the media narrative goes negative on you , and all the news is bad , it kind of knocks us off .

Let us know in the comments !"
2016-05-04,"Fresh off an overwhelming victory in Indiana that made him the presumptive Republican nominee , Donald Trump wasted little time in previewing his tactics against Hillary Clinton in a general election .
Trump has spent the last year batting away his Republican opponents , largely by turning them into caricatures .
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush was â€œlow - energyâ€ � , Florida senator Marco Rubio was
â€œLittle Marcoâ€ � and Texas senator Ted Cruz , who suspended his campaign on Tuesday , â€œLyinâ€ ™ Tedâ€ � .
Former secretary of state Clinton will be known as â€œCrooked Hillaryâ€ � .
During an interview with MSNBCâ€ ™ s Morning Joe on Wednesday , Trump attached several other labels to his likely opponent .
She was â€œunqualifiedâ€ � , he said , and â€œshould sufferâ€ � for her use of a private email server while in office .
The system was â€œriggedâ€ � in her favor .
â€œShe should not be allowed to run in the election , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œShe should suffer like other people have suffered who have done far less than she has â€ ¦
and here she is running for president like nothing happened.â€
�
The former reality TV star invoked comments last month by the other remaining Democratic candidate , Vermont senator Bernie Sanders , that Clinton was â€œunqualifiedâ€ � to be president .
â€œBernie Sanders said sheâ€ ™ s got poor judgment , â€ �
Trump said .
Sanders made his remarks as tensions escalated before the 19 April primary in New York .
The senator later walked back his statement , but not before it had been seized upon by Republicans .
The challenge for those Republicans , though , remains that as far as Trump is concerned , nothing is off limits â€ “ even if it risks turning off large swaths of voters .
The real estate mogul has already dug up Clintonâ€ ™ s past : earlier this year , dredging up the Monica Lewinsky scandal , he likened former president Bill Clinton to a sexual predator .
Also , last week , he handed Clinton a rallying cry by saying she was playing â€œthe woman cardâ€ � and had little else to offer than her gender .
Clintonâ€ ™ s team responded with a full - scale â€œwoman cardâ€ � fundraising drive that raised $ 2.4 m in three days , 40 % of which her campaign said came from first - time donors .
Such moments offer Clinton a chance to appeal to Republicans frustrated by what they view as the breakdown of their party .
Some GOP strategists in Washington were willing to declare their support for Clinton as early as Tuesday , when it became apparent that Trump would win Indiana and all but end the prospect of a contested convention in July .
The Clinton campaign on Wednesday circulated a list featuring some of them , as well as quotes from other Republican lawmakers and prominent conservatives who said they would never back Trump .
To further its case that Trump is unpalatable to his own party , Team Clinton released a new web video in the afternoon compiling footage of Trumpâ€ ™ s former Republican opponents attacking him on the stump and in interviews .
Featured in the video are Cruz referring to Trump as â€œutterly immoralâ€ � ; Florida senator Marco Rubio blasting him as a â€œcon artistâ€
� and â€œthe most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidencyâ€ � ; former Florida governor Jeb Bush saying â€œhe needs therapyâ€ � ; and multiple clips from an anti - Trump speech delivered earlier this year by 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney .
Although Clinton has long made it a staple of her stump speeches to condemn Trump as a demagogue , in particular regarding his anti - immigration and anti - Muslim rhetoric , it was only last week that her campaign began to pivot toward the general election in earnest .
The campaign named state directors in key battleground states , seeking to turn its attention to a ground operation geared for the general election â€ “ a critical area in which Trump may lag behind .
And while Clinton has continued to campaign in primary states , she made a stop on Tuesday in the must - win general election state of Ohio , to pitch her economic agenda .
Many working - class white voters in the so - called Rust Belt have been drawn to the populist appeal of both Sanders and Trump .
During his victory speech on Tuesday , echoing once more an attack used by Sanders , Trump launched into a critique of Clintonâ€ ™ s record on trade by tying her to Bill Clintonâ€ ™ s landmark North American Free Trade Agreement .
To win back the White House , Republicans will nonetheless need to secure more than a majority of white voters .
With a nominee whose unfavorability ratings position him as the least - popular nominee of either party in modern history , and whose primary campaign has alienated nearly every other demographic in the country , that will remain an uphill climb ."
2016-05-04,"Governor John Kasich planned a news conference in Ohio for this afternoon , where aides said he would suspend his presidential campaign .
He nabbed 153 delegates , just behind Marco Rubio .
Kasich , we hardly knew ye Republican operatives , conservative writers and a couple senators said they would never support Donald Trump , presidential election be damned .
They have six months to reconsider .
Republicans ditching GOP Trumpâ€ ™ s Tuesday night prediction notwithstanding â€

He will be best served by a running mate and by surrogates who fully embrace his campaign .
â€ “ Senator Marco Rubio House speaker Paul Ryan softened his opposition to Donald Trump a bit , in advance of a meeting on Thursday between the two top Republicans brokered by party chieftains .
I never said never .
I just said [ not ] at this point .
I wish I had more time to get to know him before this happened ...
I just want to get to know the guy ...

â€ “ Donald J Trump"
2016-05-10,"Marco Rubio , the former Republican presidential hopeful , has ruled out joining Donald Trump as running mate .
Rubio , who in March ended his campaign for the partyâ€ ™ s nomination , made it abundantly clear that he was not at all interested in being drafted in as Trump pick for vice - president .
In a Facebook post Rubio wrote : â€œI have never sought , will not seek and do not want to be considered for vice - president.â€ � â€œ[Trump ] will be best served by a running mate and by surrogates who fully embrace his campaign .
â€œWhile Republican voters have chosen Donald Trump as the presumptive GOP nominee , my previously stated reservations about his campaign and concerns with many of his policies remain unchanged.â€ � Rubio , who bowed out of the presidential race after being routed by Donald Trump in the Florida primary , said he was focused on his job in the Senate .
Anxiety over Donald Trump spread among congressional Republicans on Monday , pushing several to follow House Speaker Paul Ryanâ€ ™ s lead and withhold their support from the divisive billionaire .
Ryan himself declared there was no point in trying to â€œfakeâ€ � party unity .
â€œIf we go forward pretending that weâ€ ™ re unified , then we are going to be at half - strength this fall , â€ �
Ryan told the Journal Times in Racine , Wisconsin , defending his decision to refuse to endorse his partyâ€ ™ s presumptive presidential nominee .
Still , in interviews with home - state reporters Monday , Ryan denounced the idea of any Republican launching a third - party or independent candidacy to challenge Trump , telling the Milwaukee Journal - Sentinel it â€œwould be a disaster for our partyâ€ � .
Ryan said he would step aside from the House Speakerâ€ ™ s traditional role as chairman of the Republican National Convention if Trump wanted him to , a scenario that Trump has left open .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s the nominee .
Iâ€ ™ ll do whatever he wants in respect to the convention , â€ � Ryan said .
The comments from Ryan and Trump came as both men prepared for a face - to - face meeting Thursday , which Republican leaders hope will begin to mend the fabric of their party .
But other Republicans have also sought to distance themselves from Trump .
Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey , one of the most endangered Senate Republicans , wrote an opinion piece in the Philadelphia Inquirer drawing back from his long - stated intent to back the GOP nominee .
Toomey said he was â€œinclined to support the nomineeâ€ � of his party but wrote of Trump : â€œHis vulgarity , particularly toward women , is appalling .
His lack of appreciation for constitutional limits on executive powers is deeply concerning ...
In short I find his candidacy highly problematic , â€ �
Toomey wrote of Trump .
â€œThere could come a point at which the differences are so great as to be irreconcilable.â€ �
Trump has shrugged off the need for unity heading into the November general election and a likely match - up against Democrat Hillary Clinton , even though that would be the goal in any normal election year after a candidate effectively clinches the nomination , as Trump has done .
â€œI think this is a time for unity .
And if thereâ€ ™ s not going to be unity , I think thatâ€ ™ s OK , too
, â€ �
Trump said on Fox Business Network .
â€œI mean , Iâ€ ™ ll go out
and I think Iâ€ ™ ll do very well .
I think
Iâ€ ™ m going to win the race either way.â€ � With the Associated Press"
2016-05-10,"Ted Cruz refused to commit his support to Donald Trump as the Republican nominee on Tuesday , and did not rule out resurrecting his campaign for president despite having dropped out of the race last week .
In an interview with conservative talk show host Glenn Beck , the Texas senator said that picking a presidential candidate â€œis not a choice that we as voters have to make todayâ€ � .
His comments came as Marco Rubio , the Florida senator who suspended his own presidential bid in March , said he would support Trump as the nominee .
During an interview with CNN on Tuesday , Rubio said he intended to stick to a pledge signed by all of the Republican candidates last year to back the eventual nominee .
â€œI signed a pledge , put my name on it , and said I would support the Republican nominee and thatâ€ ™ s what I intend to do , â€ � Rubio said .
Cruz appeared less bound by the pledge , which has already been discarded by former contenders Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham â€ “ both of whom have come out against Trump despite his all but clinching the Republican nomination .
Cruz pointed out there were still two months until the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and six months until the general election , saying â€œwe need to watch and see what the candidates say and doâ€ � .
Although Cruz had long committed to supporting the Republican nominee in the past , his tone changed after Trump repeatedly made personal attacks against Cruz and his family .
The businessman branded his rival â€œLyinâ€ ™ Tedâ€ � , threatened to â€œspill the beansâ€ � on his wife while implying she was unattractive , and accused Cruzâ€ ™ s father of involvement in the assassination of John F Kennedy .
While Cruz once called Trump â€œa friendâ€ � and â€œterrificâ€ � , he held an abrupt press conference hours before ending his campaign at which he derided Trump as a â€œserial philandererâ€ � , an â€œamoral pathological liarâ€ � , and a â€œbraggadocious , arrogant buffoonâ€ � .
Nor would Cruz rule out returning to the campaign trail if â€œthereâ€ ™ s a path to victoryâ€ � .
The Texas senator suspended his campaign after losing the Indiana primary on 3 May by a margin of 53%-37 % , and said that with the loss he no longer saw a path to the Republican nomination .
On Tuesday , Cruz told Beck : â€œIf that changes , we will certainly respond accordingly.â€ �
However , Cruzâ€ ™ s campaign had a well - organized effort to put his supporters into positions of power among Republican delegates , who will elect the partyâ€ ™ s nominee at the national convention in Cleveland this July .
This effort means that although Trump is the only candidate left in the Republican primary , Cruz supporters will have significant influence on the convention floor , and that his delegates will probably hold control of crucial committees , such as those that write the convention rules and design the partyâ€ ™ s platform .
Cruz made clear that a return to the trail was very unlikely , though he would not rule it out .
â€œIâ€
™ m not holding my breath , â€ � he said , in response to questioning about a primary election in Nebraska , also on Tuesday , that he was once expected to win .
The Texas senator did dismiss the possibility of running as a third - party candidate or supporting a third - party alternative in November .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think thatâ€ ™ s very likely , â€ � he told Beck .
â€œItâ€
™ s always talked about ; I donâ€
™ t think itâ€ ™ s something thatâ€ ™ s likely to happen.â€ �
Cruzâ€ ™ s statements followed Trumpâ€ ™ s continued failure to unite the Republican party behind him .
Two former presidents have said they will not back him and key party figures like the speaker of the House , Paul Ryan , have declined to endorse him , at least for the present .
The former reality television star is scheduled to meet Republican congressional leaders in Washington on Thursday , as part of his effort to heal the rifts within the party .
Rubio said while he stood by his prior criticisms of Trump â€ “ which included dubbing his former opponent â€œan erratic con artistâ€ � â€ “ Republican primary voters had made their choice clear .
â€œMy differences with Donald â€ “ both my reservations about his campaign and my policy differences with him
â€ “ are well documented and they remain , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œBut Iâ€ ™ m not going to sit here right now and become his chief critic over the next six months , because he deserves the opportunity to go forward and make his argument and try to win.â€
�
He added : â€œI know what I said during the campaign ; I enunciated those things repeatedly .
And voters chose a different direction .
I stand by the things that I said.â€ �
Rubio nonetheless declined to offer Trump an explicit endorsement , hedging when asked if he planned to vote for the billionaire in November .
â€œI intend to support the nominee , â€ � Rubio said .
Pressed again by the CNN host Jake Tapper on whether that meant casting a ballot in Trumpâ€ ™ s favor , Rubio responded : â€œIâ€ ™ m not voting for Hillary Clinton .
Iâ€ ™ m not throwing away my vote.â€

2016-05-24,"While Donald Trump was wrapping up the Republican nomination for president at the beginning of this month , Marco Rubio was more than 6,000 miles away , touring the Middle East and far removed from the process that had engulfed the past 11 months of his political career .
The Florida senator , who suspended his presidential campaign in March after losing his home state , was no longer beholden to the gruelling schedule that required him to barnstorm as many as three states in one day in pursuit of votes .
And so he made use of a weeklong recess from the US Senate to travel from Qatar to Iraq to Turkey , to apprise himself of the latest developments in the battle against Islamic State and discuss the deep - rooted sectarian divisions in the region .
It was an official trip that had all the trimmings of a presidential visit , from sitdowns with local officials to a meet - and - greet with American troops .
But even if Rubio will not be the next commander - in - chief , the senator seems at peace , even rejuvenated .
During a recent interview in his Senate office , Rubio reflected on where his campaign went wrong , what he learned from his recent overseas trip and why he would rather make the most of his remaining seven months in federal office than opine about the state of the 2016 race .
â€œA lot of times it feels almost like the guy who built this really strong building , â€ �
Rubio said of the Republican contest , â€œand it was in the right place , and it was the way these buildings have always been built , but he got hit by a category five hurricane .
â€œItâ€
™ s not that we lost , itâ€ ™ s that Donald Trump won â€
¦
It was just a very unusual political year.â€
�
Unprecedented might be another word for it , in that the most pressing question Rubio faced upon his return from the Middle East had nothing to do with his trip but rather an all - too - familiar fixation with whether he would support Trump as the nominee
( the answer is yes ) , followed by mounting speculation over whether he would accept an invitation to be Trumpâ€ ™ s vice - president ( the answer is no ) .
But Rubio , a member of the Senate foreign relations and intelligence committees , was more fazed by his conversations with leaders in Iraq , a nation whose outlook he described as â€œvery uncertainâ€ � .
â€œThe long - term future of Iraq beyond Isis is in serious question , â€ � Rubio said , citing internal divisions that comprised a â€œcombustible mixâ€ � .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a sense that Isis will eventually be militarily defeated , but then what happens â€ “ between Shias and Sunnis , do Christian communities get to return , the future of Kurdistan , which is now asking for independence or greater autonomy ...
All of that complexity is happening at the same time as the fight against Isis is occurring.â€ �
Rubio acknowledged the role the US played in exacerbating tensions â€ “ lining up behind Nouri al - Maliki â€œwas a mistakeâ€ � , he said , characterizing the former Iraqi prime minister as a Shia politician â€œlooking for retributionâ€ � against the Sunnis .
But the senator maintained that the burden should not fall upon the US to invade and overthrow Isis - held territory .
â€œUltimately , the future of Iraq depends on the Iraqi people â€ “
it canâ€
™ t depend on the United States , â€ �
he said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not just about getting Isis out of the city , itâ€ ™ s about whoâ€ ™ s going to hold that city afterward
â€
¦
And itâ€ ™ s got to be local forces that have credibility with the population.â€ � â€¢â€¢â€¢ Rubio
had intended national security to serve as a centerpiece of his campaign , even as policy took a backseat to theatrics in a primary dominated by bitter feuds and the latest outlandish statement to emerge from Trumpâ€ ™ s mouth .
Although Rubio was eventually drawn into the cage fight , infamously saying of Trump : â€œYou know what they say about guys with small hands , â€ � the senator said he remained â€œproudâ€ � of his run and pointed to his fateful encounter with Chris Christie , the New Jersey governor , in the debate ahead of the New Hampshire primary as a 30-second period that cost him heavily .
â€œDid we make mistakes , or are there things
weâ€ ™ d do differently ?
Yeah , â€ � Rubio said , before zeroing in on the exchange in which he robotically repeated the same line three times almost verbatim .
â€œI think if we had made a strategic decision in New Hampshire different from the one I made â€ “ which was not to engage with Chris Christie , but to try to just ignore it and just stay on message â€ “ that would have been a nothing .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t think it impacted voters , but I do think it impacted media coverage in the days leading up to the New Hampshire vote , which I think ultimately hurt us , â€ � he added .
â€œI think we would have finished very strongly in New Hampshire had it not been for that , and it might have led to a different outcome in South Carolina and maybe changed the trajectory of the race.â€ �
Much of Rubioâ€ ™ s frustration remains rooted in the media and what he called its formation of narratives that influenced voters as they headed to the polls .
Even now , though he is no longer a candidate , Rubioâ€ ™ s actions are scrutinized through a political lens with the focus adjusted toward his next move .
The questions abound : will he reconsider quitting the Senate prior to the 24 June filing deadline for re - election ?
Does his renewed attention toward the local issues facing his state signal that Rubio will make a run for Floridaâ€ ™ s governorship in 2018 ?
And then there is already the conjecture surrounding a possible second bid for the presidency in 2020 .
Rubio has , on multiple occasions , insisted he will neither change his mind about leaving the Senate nor set his sights on the governorâ€ ™ s mansion .
And last week , he let his exasperation be known on Twitter â€ “ first taking aim at the Washington Post for quoting anonymous sources while musing about his future and then chastising NBCâ€ ™ s Today show for producing a political package from a tour he took of an embattled housing complex in Jacksonville , Florida , subsidized by the federal government .
Rubio , who was routinely criticized by his opponents for missing votes in the Senate while campaigning for president , would rather highlight an agenda chock full of challenges at both the state and federal level .
â€œI have seven months left , â€ � he said .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re trying to maximize that and do as much as we can.â€ � â€¢â€¢â€¢
The list includes addressing Puerto Ricoâ€ ™ s crippling debt crisis , cracking down on automatic benefits for certain Cuban immigrants amid reports of abuse , and fighting the implementation of the nuclear accord with Iran .
Rubio has already reversed his opposition to confirming Roberta Jacobson as the US ambassador to Mexico in exchange for extended sanctions against Venezuela , and has been the lone Senate Republican to argue in favor of fully funding the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s request of $ 1.9bn to fight the Zika virus , which poses the greatest risk to his home state of Florida .
He is less conciliatory on the issue of criminal justice reform , a debate currently pending before the Senate in which an overhaul of sentencing laws have drawn bipartisan support â€ “ including from influential Republicans such as John Cornyn , of Texas , Chuck Grassley , of Iowa , and Mike Lee , of Utah .
Rubio said he admired his colleaguesâ€ ™ intentions , but echoed the position taken by the Arkansas senator Tom Cotton that the US is actually struggling with under - incarceration .
â€œIf you look at some of these people that are in the federal [ prison ] system , for the most part , for the enormous majority , these are very significant lawbreakers , â€ � Rubio said , â€œand I think you can make the argument you need to do a better job of putting more bad people in jail .
â€œWe have this runaway drug problem in America now with opiates and the heroin epidemic â€
“
we should be locking up more of these people that are out there pushing this stuff at every level of these organizations so you can shut them down.â€
�
On the campaign trail , the senator was more amenable to lowering mandatory minimums for nonviolent offenders .
But Rubio argued that drug crimes , in his view , were inherently violent .
â€œI think if someoneâ€ ™ s out there trafficking in heroin or even selling at the street level , theyâ€ ™ re committing an act of violence , â€ � he said .
â€œEven if they didnâ€
™ t shoot somebody , they are harming people , they are harming communities , they are destroying families , they are destroying lives â€
¦
In my mind , theyâ€ ™ re violent even if theyâ€ ™ re not in possession of a gun.â€ � When he is not tending to Senate business in Washington , Rubio is a fixture back home in Florida , holding regular meetings with state lawmakers to discuss issues ranging from the heroin epidemic to the threat of Zika to federal housing abuses .
If he was faulted , leading up to the loss of his home state that forced his exit from the race , for not affording enough attention to his constituents , Rubio is determined to complete his tenure as their senator on a high note .
On Monday , he delivered the keynote address before a business charter school in Hialeah that contained a word of advice perhaps shaped by his own recent experience .
â€œYou are going to fail .
Thatâ€ ™ s going to happen , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œFailure in many ways is a benefit , because it teaches you in ways success
never can.â€ �"
2016-05-26,"Marco Rubio has signaled a thaw in his attitude to Donald Trump , saying that if asked he will speak on behalf of his former rival at the Republican convention in Cleveland in July .
The Florida senator was less willing to come around on the matter of seeking re - election , even as top Republicans mount a campaign to pressure him into doing so .
Rubio , who dropped out of the presidential race in March , after losing his home state to Trump , told CNN he planned to attend the Republican convention and would be willing to help the nominee â€ “ despite differences on policy and the brutal echoes of a primary in which , responding to the billionaireâ€ ™ s taunts , Rubio called Trump a â€œcon artistâ€ � and said he was too â€œerraticâ€ � to have access to the nuclear codes .
â€œYes
â€ “ Iâ€ ™
d certainly , yes , â€ �
Rubio said when asked if he would speak for Trump .
â€œI want to be helpful .
I donâ€
™ t want to be harmful because I donâ€ ™ t want Hillary Clinton to be president .
â€œLook , my policy differences with Donald Trump â€
“
I spent 11 months talking about them ,
â€ � he added in the interview , which will air in full on CNNâ€ ™ s State of the Union on Sunday .
â€œSo I think theyâ€ ™ re well understood .
That said , I donâ€ ™ t want Hillary Clinton to be president .
If thereâ€ ™ s something I can do to help that from happening , and itâ€ ™ s helpful to the cause , Iâ€ ™
d most certainly be honored to be considered for that.â€ �
Although Rubio had already committed to backing Trump , his latest comments stood in stark contrast to the impassioned pleas he made when the two were squaring off just months ago .
In the final weeks of his campaign , Rubio embraced the # NeverTrump hashtag .
Speaking to the Guardian the day before he left the race , he said Trump was â€œan embarrassmentâ€ � for whom the Republican party would â€œpay a big price in November and beyondâ€ � .
â€œYou have all kinds of people that are lifelong conservatives , or at least claim to be , who donâ€ ™ t seem to care that Donald Trump has never been and is not now a conservative on principles , â€ �
Rubio said in that interview , on the eve of the 15 March Florida primary .
â€œAnd theyâ€ ™ ve staked their reputation on their support of him.â€ �
To CNN , Rubio also said he would release the 167 delegates he secured in winning the Minnesota , Puerto Rico and District of Columbia primaries .
But he again ruled out any interest in serving as Trumpâ€ ™ s running mate .
â€œHe won the nomination and he deserves to have a running mate that more fully embraces some of the things he stands for , â€ � Rubio said .
Later in the day , the senator explained to Florida reporters that Trump was â€œsubstantially betterâ€ � than Clinton and he would vote for him .
â€œThe one other choice is someone who I believe is corrupt , â€ � Rubio said , according to the Miami Herald .
â€œIâ€
™ m not supporting her , and Iâ€ ™ m not going to abstain from voting.â€
�
Separately , Rubio spent much of the day trying to quell speculation that he might reconsider his decision not to run for re - election .
On Thursday Republican leaders in the Senate openly encouraged him to reverse course , ahead of Floridaâ€ ™ s filing deadline on 24 June .
In a closed - door lunch , the majority leader , Mitch McConnell , conducted a poll in which virtually everyone raised their hands when asked if the 44-year - old should jump back into the race .
John Cornyn , the second - ranking Republican in the Senate , called on Rubio to do so , as did the foreign relations committee chairman , Bob Corker .
Corker , from Tennessee , said in a statement : â€œMarco Rubio is a very valuable member of the Senate â€ “ especially in his role on the Senate foreign relations committee , where he demonstrates a deep understanding of foreign policy.â€ �
Rubio has repeatedly insisted that from January he will be a â€œprivate
citizenâ€
� once again .
Speaking to reporters on Thursday , the senator said : â€œFor me , I need time to even talk to anybody about it , but my sense of it is nothing has changed in my thinking .
â€œI
didnâ€
™ t think it was fair for me to run for president and freeze that seat in a competitive state â€
¦
I made that decision and Iâ€ ™ ve lived by that decision .
Nothingâ€ ™ s changed.â€ �
Republicans have voiced growing concerns over the Florida Senate race , in which a crowded primary has threatened the partyâ€ ™ s chances .
A longtime friend of Rubio , Floridaâ€ ™ s lieutenant governor , Carlos Lopez - Cantera , is among the Republican hopefuls .
Rubio has edged closer to endorsing Lopez - Cantera , hosting a fundraiser in Washington earlier this month .
â€œI have a very close personal friend in this race
and I think
heâ€
™ s a good candidate , â€ � Rubio said .
Asked how he would respond if Lopez - Cantera were to bow out , he said :
â€œI donâ€ ™ t do hypotheticals.â€ �
â€œItâ€ ™ s not like the Democrats have the greatest candidate , â€ � Rubio added , in reference to Democratic contenders Patrick Murphy and Alan Grayson , both of whom serve in the House of Representatives .
â€œOne guy keeps exaggerating his biography and the other guy is a certified lunatic.â€ �"
2016-05-27,"Marco Rubio seemed , maybe , to open the door on running for re - election to his Florida Senate seat , an option he had foreclosed in favor of his ill - fated presidential bid .
Rubio ready to speak at convention Rubio told CNN he wouldnâ€ ™ t run because a friend is running .
But if his friend dropped out ?
â€œMaybe .
Sure , maybe , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œI enjoy my work in the Senate.â€
�
He would have until 24 June to file .
Texas senator Ted Cruz is holding onto the delegates he won in the presidential race , for now , and was unwilling on Friday to say whether a â€œtrue conservativeâ€ � would endorse Donald Trump .
I am looking and listening to see what the candidates do .
I believe principles matter .
â€ “ Ted Cruz , not up for reelection After the Bernie Sanders camp accused Trump of â€œchickening outâ€
� of a plan to debate the Vermont senator in California
, Trump released a statement saying he would not debate .
A $ 10 m bid on a big debate Based on the fact that [ Democrats ] ... will not allow Bernie Sanders to win ...
it seems inappropriate that I would debate the second - place finisher ... as much as I want to debate Bernie Sanders ...
I will wait to debate the first - place finisher ...
probably Crooked Hillary Clinton , or whoever it may be .
â€ “ Donald J Trump Speaker Paul Ryan , whose slowness to endorse Trump could , Sarah Palin had warned , cost him his House seat , was doing OK in a poll of his Wisconsin district .

Chickens may not roost for Ryan"
2016-06-19,"One year almost to the day from the murder of nine black churchgoers in Charleston , Barack Obama flew to the scene of another massacre .
He had an unlikely political ally in tow .
Marco Rubio officially joined the president and vice - president on Air Force One on Thursday , in his capacity as a Florida senator â€ “ demonstrating national unity in one of the bleakest weeks in US history .
Where the Charleston killings stirred bitter memories of racial violence , the murder of 49 people and wounding of 53 at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando represented Americaâ€ ™ s deadliest mass shooting , one the worldâ€ ™ s worst homophobic atrocities and a seeming recurrence of jihadi - inspired domestic terrorism all in one sickening blur .
At first the political response appeared only to add to the heartache .
Within hours of last Sundayâ€ ™ s attack by Omar Mateen â€ “ a 29-year - old Muslim American whose father emigrated from Afghanistan â€ “ Donald Trump delivered an anti - immigration speech that was shocking , even by his standards , for its apparent suggestion that Obama was to blame .
When the Washington Post reported his subsequent insinuation that the president harboured a secret agenda somehow linked to the attack , he banned the newspaper from covering his campaign .
But just as some in Europe are now hoping that the assassination of the British MP Jo Cox could mark a turning point in the anti - immigration mood surrounding Britainâ€ ™ s referendum on EU membership , Trumpâ€ ™ s response to Orlando looks as if it may mark a high water point in the nationalist tide that has engulfed the US presidential election .
Coming swiftly after his criticism of a judgeâ€ ™ s Mexican heritage , Trumpâ€ ™ s apparent blanket attack on Muslim Americans was too much for many Republicans in Congress .
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said he â€œwas not going to be commenting on presidential candidatesâ€ � , even though campaigning is now in full swing .
Bob Corker , another elder statesman recently seen as Trumpâ€ ™ s most likely running mate , said he was â€œdiscouragedâ€ � by the words of his partyâ€ ™ s presumptive nominee .
In this context , Rubioâ€ ™ s appearance aboard Air Force One alongside Obama and Joe Biden was more than just a Florida courtesy .
Something had snapped .
This was the same Senator Rubio who , as a Republican presidential candidate , had spent much of the year attacking Obama as unfit to lead .
This was perhaps the fiercest critic of White House foreign policy throughout the 2016 campaign , coming to the scene of an Islamic State - inspired terrorist attack and making clear he stood with the president , not his partyâ€ ™ s likely nominee .
This weekend , rumours are swirling again in Washington of one final bid to deprive Trump of his place as the Republican nominee when the party convention meets in Cleveland next month .
Late on Friday Sean Spicer , communications director of the Republican National Committee , was forced to remind plotters that Trump has â€œbested 16 highly qualified candidates and received more primary votes than any candidate in Republican historyâ€ � .
â€œAll of the discussion of the RNC rules committee acting to undermine the presumptive nominee is silly , â€ � he insisted .
Yet many Republicans fear not just the prospect of losing the White House in a landslide this November , but also ceding control of the Senate and House of Representatives .
If Trump is at the top of the ballot , their partyâ€ ™ s brand could be tarnished for a generation .
Democrats are compiling a growing list of GOP figures willing to back their nemesis , Hillary Clinton , rather than contemplate Trump any longer .
It is not just disarray in the Republican party that is bringing Washingtonâ€ ™ s political establishment slowly back together .
Obama himself is undergoing a renaissance in popularity , hitting his highest approval ratings since 2012 just as Trump hits new record lows .
At the last midterm elections , in 2014 , not even Democratic senators would be seen with Obama , such was his reputation for repelling moderate voters .
The Senate was lost .
But now , even the most hawkish of Republicans would rather be seen with the president than the titular head of their own party .
Images of Rubio and the Obama shaking hands on the tarmac were all the more surprising amid rumours â€ “ confirmed this weekend
â€ “ that the Florida senator was about to change his mind about not standing for re - election this November .
â€œNo hug .
No hug .
I might run again , â€ � ran a spoof caption on a viral video of the two appearing to come close to an actual embrace
â€ “ something that once nearly sank the career prospects of New Jersey governor Chris Christie , after hurricane Sandy .
Not all Republicans are ready to embrace the presidentâ€ ™ s foreign policy .
The veteran Arizona senator John McCain , a moderate with hawkish national security credentials , appeared briefly to come to Trumpâ€ ™ s rescue on Thursday , telling reporters he also believed Obama was â€œdirectly to blameâ€ � for Orlando .
He later retracted the remark , but only partly .
Even Obamaâ€ ™ s own administration is far from unified on the vexed question of how to handle Isis .
It emerged this week that 51 diplomats had signed a memo , via an internal â€œdissentâ€ � procedure at the State Department , that was sharply critical of the presidentâ€ ™ s policy on Syria .
Nonetheless , what began as a terrible week for America , looked like ending as a good one for its president .
Although the Orlando massacre forced Obama to postpone the first of many planned rallies in support of Hillary Clinton as the presumptive Democratic nominee , her opponent was already working hard to make him look more popular than he has in a very long while .
Obama is fast becoming the ace up Clintonâ€ ™
s sleeve , a figure who , by comparison with Trump at least , now appears a unifier .
Clinton and Obamaâ€ ™ s postponed trip to Green Bay on Wednesday points to the presidentâ€ ™ s likely role over the coming months .
He won Wisconsin handily in 2008 and 2012 , but the state is typical of the blue - collar union battlegrounds in which Trump hopes to rewrite the electoral map .
Not since 1988 , when Ronald Reagan headlined some 20 rallies to help his vice - president , George HW Bush , has an incumbent planned such an active role in the election of his successor .
Even then , the Gipperâ€ ™ s alleged Alzheimerâ€ ™ s appears with hindsight to have been a limiting factor .
Bill Clinton and George W Bush were not seen by Al Gore and John McCain as key electoral assets , due to the problems they faced toward the end of their administrations : chiefly Clintonâ€ ™ s impeachment and Bushâ€ ™ s Iraq war legacy .
Republicans long assumed that they could hurt Hillary Clinton by linking her to the divisive aspects of the current White House : foreign policy , Obamacare , immigration and gun control .
Against a more orthodox Republican opponent , these might still have been liabilities , particularly in swing states where socially conservative voters are important .
Now , Clintonâ€ ™ s decision during the primary to embrace this characterisation of her as an extension of Obamaâ€ ™ s third term is likely to continue into the general election , especially now that she is running against an opponent who , like Bernie Sanders , will target her in the relatively liberal rustbelt .
In more diverse swing states like Florida , Trumpâ€ ™ s divisive rhetoric on race also increases the benefits of having Obama onboard .
In the sunshine state , with its large Hispanic vote , even a Republican senate candidate such as Rubio is more likely to benefit from having the president on his arm than by getting too close to the Donald .
For Clinton , there could hardly be a better reminder of her credentials as a grown - up â€ “ and a more experienced commander - in - chief â€ “ than her old boss ."
2016-06-22,"Marco Rubio will seek re - election to a second term in the US Senate , he announced on Wednesday , marking a reversal from his repeated vows to become a private citizen after the failure of his presidential campaign in March .
â€œIn politics , admitting youâ€ ™ ve changed your mind is not something most people like to do .
But here it goes , â€ �
Rubio said in a statement .
â€œI have decided to seek
re - election to the United States Senate.â€ � Rubioâ€ ™ s decision , which will shake up one of the most competitive Senate races in the country , caps off weeks of speculation about his political future .
And while it provides a boon to Republicans , who see Rubio as one of their best hopes to retain a majority in the Senate , it also inextricably ties his fortunes to Donald Trump as the partyâ€ ™ s standard - bearer in November .
Rubio , who has endorsed Trump , acknowledged that he was breaking a pledge to leave the Senate in January .
But he cited his dissatisfaction with both Trump and Hillary Clinton , the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee , as reason to stay in the chamber and try to shape the direction of the country .
Standing by his support for Trump , Rubio nevertheless told CNN he viewed his Senate seat as a way to â€œact as a check and balance on the next president ... even against a president in my own partyâ€ � .
The senator also stated he did not plan to campaign with Trump , whose effect on down - ballot races may well prove toxic in November .
â€œI think the differences between us on key issues are so significant that ... Iâ€ ™ ve got to run my own race , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œI have my own identity .
I have my own position on issues.â€ �
But Rubio reiterated his intention to vote for Trump , and signaled he would not go out of his way to undermine his former opponent in a way that might help Clinton .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a choice between someone who I disagree with on a lot of things and someone who I disagree with on everything , and itâ€ ™ s not the choice I wanted , â€ � Rubio said .
Rubioâ€ ™ s decision , two days before Floridaâ€ ™ s 24 June filing deadline , has already resulted in significant repercussions for a Senate race that until his entry comprised a crowded Republican field .
Two GOP candidates â€ “ congressman Ron DeSantis and the stateâ€ ™ s attorney general , Carlos Lopez - Cantera â€
“ confirmed on Wednesday they would bow out of the contest following Rubioâ€ ™ s announcement .
Rubio had previously cited his loyalty to Lopez - Cantera as one of the main reasons he was reticent to enter the race â€ “ but following the 12 June massacre in Orlando , Lopez - Cantera said he himself urged Rubio to reconsider re - election .
Representative David Jolly , another GOP contender for Rubioâ€ ™ s seat , announced late last week that he would drop out of the race .
The main source of defiance came from businessman Carlos Beruff , who vowed to pour as much as $ 15 m into a primary campaign to defeat Rubio .
â€œCareer politicians like Marco Rubio worry more about keeping the job than doing the job and are constantly looking for their next political promotion , â€ � Beruff said in a statement Wednesday .
â€œThis isnâ€ ™ t Marco Rubioâ€ ™ s seat , this is Floridaâ€ ™ s seat.â€ �
During the Republican presidential primary , Rubio was walloped by Donald Trump in his home state â€ “ leading to the termination of his campaign in March .
Rubio won just one of Floridaâ€ ™ s 67 counties , his home of Miami - Dade , in a bruising 19-point loss that foreshadowed other challenges he might face in his bid to hold on to his Senate seat .
Alex Conant , the former spokesman for Rubioâ€ ™ s presidential campaign who will now serve as an adviser to his Senate bid , conceded the race would be competitive .
But he pointed to the obvious advantages associated with Rubioâ€ ™ s name recognition â€ “ from a vast donor network to a widespread grassroots following .
â€œMarco enters the race in a much stronger position than he did six years ago , â€ � Conant said , while adding that a new poll showing Rubio comfortably ahead of likely Democratic opponent Patrick Murphy reaffirmed that the senator â€œis excellently positioned to winâ€ � .
Murphy , a member of the House of Representatives , previewed an ugly battle ahead over the weekend by attacking Rubio as one of the countryâ€ ™ s â€œmost homophobicâ€ � senators and accusing him of exploiting for political gain the mass shooting at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando that left 49 dead and another 53 injured .
Murphy responded swiftly to Rubioâ€ ™ s re - election news on Wednesday with a statement dubbing the senator â€œonly out for himselfâ€ � .
â€œMarco Rubio abandoned his constituents , and now heâ€
™ s treating them like a consolation prize , â€ � Murphy said .
Democrats are eager to seize upon Rubioâ€ ™ s prior criticisms of the Senate while running for president .
During his campaign , Rubio routinely sought to tap into voter frustration with Washington by expressing his own disenchantment with political leaders in both parties .
â€œNever in our history has Washington been more out of touch , â€ � he declared .
Defending his then abysmal attendance record in the Senate , Rubio in essence made the case that the body had little influence in moving policy .
â€œI have missed votes this year , â€ �
Rubio said at a Republican debate in October .
â€œYou know why ?
Because while as a senator I can help shape the agenda .
Only a president can set the agenda .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re not going to fix America with senators and congressmen , â€ � he added .
Rubioâ€ ™ s colleagues hardly took the criticism to heart .
Led by the Senate majority leader , Mitch McConnell , Republicans mounted a pressure campaign in recent weeks to persuade him to run for re - election .
And as Rubio announced his decision on Wednesday , even his former presidential rivals were quick to jump on board .
Texas senator Ted Cruz , Ohio governor John Kasich , and even former Florida governor Jeb Bush â€ “ who bitterly sparred with Rubio in the Republican primary â€ “ all offered their stamp of approval .
Trump had already expressed his enthusiasm for a second Rubio term in a tweet late last month .
Whether voters in Florida can be as convinced to give Rubio a second chance remains to be seen .
The senatorâ€ ™ s
efforts to mend his image in his home state began immediately after his exit from the presidential race , as he returned to the Senate with renewed vigor and began to squarely focus on issues affecting Florida , including the Zika virus , the Puerto Rico debt crisis and subpar publicly subsidized housing .
While victory would help Rubio secure a triumphant comeback , a second loss in his home state could all but end his political career .
Rubio declined on Wednesday to rule out seeking the presidency once more â€ “ even as early as 2020 .
The senator simply stated he was done making â€œunequivocal pronunciationsâ€ � after reversing course on the Senate race , having memorably tweeted just last month : â€œI have only said like 10,000 times I will be a private citizen in January.â€ � Rubio did , however , appear willing to accept the notion that he was wagering his political future on one of the most volatile election cycles in modern history .
â€œIf my plan was to run for president in 2020 , jumping into a race like this , with all the political risks associated with it , would not be the decision one would make , â€ �
Rubio said in his interview with CNN .
â€œIâ€ ™ m fully prepared to have the US Senate be the last political job that I ever have.â€ �"
2016-06-26,"Marco Rubio , the Florida senator and former Republican presidential candidate who this week changed his mind about leaving Congress , said on Sunday he â€œdidnâ€ ™ t run for Senate to run for president againâ€ � .
â€œAny political expert would tell you this is not the right way to do it , â€ �
Rubio told CBS on the program Face the Nation .
â€œExpose yourself in another election , in a very unpredictable , to say the least , election cycle after saying you werenâ€ ™ t going to do it .
Itâ€ ™ s a tough election in a strong swing state.â€ �
Rubio did not rule out running for the White House again , and disagreed with a suggestion it was not a good idea to run while serving in the Senate .
During the presidential race , Rubio was strongly criticized by Republican rivals for his sparse attendance and voting record .
He withdrew in March from what he called a â€œvibrantâ€ � Republican primary , after losing heavily in his home state to Donald Trump , now the presumptive nominee .
In the final few weeks of the campaign he was castigated by fellow Republicans for a controversial decision to make personal attacks on Trump .
This week , after three months of insistence that he would leave public life , he said he would after all seek re - election to the seat he has held since 2010 .
â€œI have only said like 10,000 times I will be a private citizen in January ,
â€ � he tweeted a month ago .
Two Republican candidates who would have opposed him in a primary , including the stateâ€ ™ s lieutenant governor Carlos Lopez - Cantera , have since withdrawn from the race .
A Quinnipiac poll released this week showed Rubio beating both his possible Democratic opponents .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not the safest route forward , â€ �
Rubio said on Sunday .
â€œIâ€ ™ m running for re - election , because Iâ€ ™ m going to be a senator .
Iâ€ ™ m going to spend six years in the Senate making my mark on behalf of the people of Florida , but also on behalf of the things that are important for America.â€
�
Rubioâ€ ™ s about - face wasencouraged by Republican leaders who seek to keep control of the Senate , and who fear congressional elections are indelibly coloured by Trumpâ€ ™ s divisive rhetoric and unpredictable behaviour .
Despite having said during the primary that Trump was â€œerraticâ€ � and a â€œcon manâ€ � , not fit to hold the nuclear codes , Rubio has since endorsed the businessman and said he will vote for him .
Unlike other primary foes , he added that is willing to speak at the Republican convention in Cleveland in July .
Askedwhat he had learned from his presidential bid , Rubio said : â€œYou know , first of all , I learned the Republican party is a diverse party .
It truly is much more diverse than the Democratic party .
â€œIt has elements of libertarianism that are very strong .
It continues to have its traditional elements of strong on national security , pro - family , pro - constitution.â€ �
In remarks made resonant by events in Britain this week , where older voters and those in economic straits propelled the leave campaign to a shock victory in a referendum on membership of the European Union , he added : â€œIt has a growing number of people that have been badly hurt over the last eight years by the economic downturn , by the changes in the global economy.â€
�
The anger was natural , Rubio insisted .
â€œPeople call that populism .
I just say itâ€ ™ s people that have been hurt in their own lives , â€ �
he said .
â€œYou know , theyâ€ ™ re 55 years old .
They were getting ready to retire .
Their house lost all its value .
They lost their job .
No one will hire them at the job they once had .
And theyâ€ ™ re hurting and theyâ€ ™ re angry .
â€œAnd the Republican party has become a home for a lot of people like that as well .
So itâ€ ™ s a diverse party , and itâ€ ™ s one of the reasons why you saw such a vibrant presidential primary.â€ �"
2016-08-07,"Florida senator Marco Rubio has said women infected with the Zika virus should not be allowed to have abortions , even if their babies have microcephaly , the severe developmental disorder than can result from infection with the disease .
â€œIf Iâ€ ™ m going to err , Iâ€ ™ m going to err on the side of life , â€ � the Republican told Politico .
Rubio , who has championed Zika funding bills in the Senate , also blamed Democrats for the failure to pass such federal aid .
According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) figures , Florida is the state second - worst affected by Zika , after New York , but is the only state to have infections caused by local mosquitoes .
Most Zika cases in the US have been found in people who travelled to affected countries and territories .
On Sunday , the Florida governor , Rick Scott , told NBC that despite his state having identified 16 cases of mosquito - borne Zika infections , â€œwhat weâ€ ™ re doing is working.â€ �
Scott also called for increased federal aid , in addition to the several million Barack Obama has released in existing grants .
On Friday , the federal Food and Drug Administration cleared a private company to release genetically altered mosquitoes which could help the fight against Zika on an island in the Florida Keys .
The project will be subject to a local referendum in November .
Rubio ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination and only recently decided to run for re - election rather than give up public life .
During the presidential campaign , he said he was opposed to abortion in all instances , including in cases of rape or incest .
â€œI understand a lot of people disagree with my view â€
“
but I believe that all human life is worthy of protection of our laws , â€ � he said on Saturday .
â€œAnd when you present it in the context of Zika or any prenatal condition , itâ€ ™ s a difficult question and a hard one .
But if Iâ€ ™ m going to err , Iâ€ ™ m going to err on the side of life.â€
�
In the Senate , Rubio has supported the provision of funding for work against Zika .
In May , after a $ 1.1bn funding measure he sponsored passed the Senate , he cited an estimate from the CDC director , Tom Frieden , that the lifetime cost of caring for a child born with microcephaly could reach $ 10 m .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to be dealing with Zika for multiple years , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œOutside of the human cost is the economic cost of this .
Weâ€
™ re going to be spending money on Zika for the foreseeable future.â€ �
On Saturday , he added : â€œObviously , microcephaly is a terrible prenatal condition that kids are born with .
And when they are , itâ€ ™ s a lifetime of difficulties .
So I get it .
â€œIâ€
™ m not pretending to you that thatâ€ ™ s an easy question you asked me .
But Iâ€ ™ m pro - life .
And Iâ€ ™ m strongly pro - life .
I believe all human life should be protected by our law , irrespective of the circumstances or condition of that life.â€ �
Obama asked Congress for $ 1.9bn of funding , which was blocked in the Senate in June .
House Republicans had appended unrelated provisions to the bill â€ “ involving , for instance , abortion restrictions and the Confederate flag â€ “ and Senate Democrats refused to pass it in its altered form .
Rubio blamed the failure to pass any anti - Zika funding on Democrats , who have blamed Republicans for inserting such â€œpoison pillâ€ � clauses into the relevant bill .
One such clause had a measure to defund Planned Parenthood , the womenâ€ ™ s health provider and a frequent target of anti - abortion campaigners .
â€œThe Planned Parenthood angle is something they basically made up to have a political reason not to pass Zika so they can come back in August and campaign on it , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œThatâ€
™ s what I mean by political volleyball .
Both sides have played that game .
I would have preferred the House just passed a clean funding bill and Iâ€ ™ ll vote for that if it comes out.â€ �
On NBC , Scott was asked if it was now safe to travel to Wynwood , the Miami neighbourhood in which mosquito - borne Zika has been found .
â€œAbsolutely , â€ � he said .
â€œI was there on Thursday â€
¦ we are doing a very good job working to get rid of the mosquitoes .
Our department of health at the local level is doing a very good job .
We have 16 cases â€ “
weâ€ ™ ve been able to reduce the area we had a concern about by 10 blocks on Friday , so weâ€ ™ re working on it .
â€œEverybody pregnant has the option for a test if they want it ; weâ€ ™ re picking everybody up .
What weâ€ ™ re doing is working.â€
�
The CDC has warned pregnant women and their partners not to travel to Wynwood , and advised those who live there to try to prevent mosquito bites , wear a condom , and be tested for infection .
Couples trying to get pregnant should also avoid the area , the health officials said .
Scott was also asked about criticism he has received over a 40 % cut to the stateâ€ ™ s mosquito control budget in 2011 .
â€œWhat weâ€ ™ ve done is allocate the dollars better , â€ �
he said .
â€œWe reduced some funding originally but we dramatically increased the funding over the last five , six years Iâ€ ™ ve been in office .
We have a very good mosquito board .
Iâ€ ™ ve allocated $ 26.2 m of state funding.â€ �
As of Friday , Florida officials had released only $ 1.9 m of those funds , according to documents acquired by the Miami Herald .
â€œThe feds need to become a partner , â€ � Scott continued , saying he had asked Frieden â€œfor 10,000 more Zika preparedness kits .
We still need the federal government to show up .
The president and Congress still need to work together .
This is a national , federal issue , not just a Florida issue.â€ �"
2016-08-30,"Republicans hope to shore up their defence of the US Senate in primary elections on Tuesday that are an important test of residual anti - establishment sentiment in both parties .
Senators Marco Rubio in Florida and John McCain in Arizona are both predicted to win their battles to retain the GOP nomination when voting closes late on Tuesday .
But tighter - than - expected results , particularly from McCainâ€ ™ s conservative challenger Kelli Ward , could signal tough fights to come for both incumbents against Democrats in November .
Rubio only decided to seek re - election in June , despite a failed bid for the presidential nomination , as party leaders saw him as a crucial bulwark against a possible Donald Trump - inspired attack on the partyâ€ ™ s grip over Congress .
McCain , whose 80th birthday on Monday has become a surprise attack line for his opponent , also faces a tricky balancing act between acknowledging Trumpâ€ ™ s popularity among primary voters and minimising a potentially toxic association when appealing to Arizonaâ€ ™ s diverse general electorate .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not separating myself from it , or anything like that , â€ � McCain told NBC on the eve of polling when asked about Trump .
â€œItâ€ ™ s the people of Arizona who know me .
I have 100 % name ID , they all know me very well , Iâ€ ™ ve been here for many years .
So I donâ€ ™ t think their judgment is affected by anything but what they view of me , how they view me.â€ �
McCain said he would also let the people of Arizona â€œmake the judgmentâ€ � about whether Ward was right to suggest he was too old to seek a sixth term in office .
Democrats also face their own internal challenges if they are to unite around sufficiently strong candidates to net to the four seats needed to take back control of the Senate .
In the Florida Senate primary , a challenge from progressive firebrand Alan Grayson has fizzled somewhat following domestic abuse allegations , and fellow Democratic congressman Patrick Murphy looks most likely to end up competing against Rubio .
Instead it is congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz , the controversial former chair of the Democratic National Committee , who is attracting most attention from liberal activists .
Tim Canova , her opponent in the primary for the strongly Democratic House district around Miami , has been endorsed by Bernie Sanders after his bitter battle against Wasserman Schultz during the presidential race .
Strong support for the incumbent from party leaders such as Hillary Clinton should save her from fresh embarrassment , but Democrats will be looking to enthuse voters with a positive message about the status quo amid strong attacks from the right too .
Rubio , in particular , is seen as a potential key figure in the defence of the Senate and is looking to exploit recent unease about the effectiveness of
Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s
flagship healthcare reforms .
â€œPatrick Murphy promised voters that Obamacareâ€ ™ s state exchanges would bring down costs and create more competition , but Floridians are finding themselves with fewer healthcare options and skyrocketing premiums they canâ€ ™ t afford , â€ � said Rubio spokesman Michael Ahrens in a new attack .
â€œOnly someone like Patrick Murphy who has consistently embellished the facts about himself could read the latest devastating headlines about the failure of Obamacare and declare it a success that should be expanded.â€
�
Neither Rubioâ€ ™ s nor McCainâ€ ™ s brand of conservatism has proved radical enough for Republican voters in the past year , but these colourful national figures could be just the right side of the anti - establishment mood to make life hard for Democrats .
McCainâ€ ™ s
likely opponent in November , congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick â€ “ who hopes to become the first Democratic senator from Arizona since 1995 â€ “ has in turn been running adverts reminding voters
just how many times this â€œmaverickâ€ � Vietnam veteran has been forced to express grudging support for Trump ."
2016-08-30,"Late - breaking news :
The Washington Post reports that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is considering a last - minute meeting with Mexican president Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto tomorrow in Mexico City , hours before he is scheduled to deliver a major address on immigration in Phoenix aimed at clarifying his increasingly murky stance on the issue .
The State Department says about 30 emails that may be related to the 2012 attack on U.S. compounds in Benghazi , Libya , are among the thousands of Hillary Clinton emails recovered during the FBIâ€ ™ s recently closed investigation into her use of a private server .
Marco Rubio has launched his political comeback with a decisive victory in the Florida primary that sets up a battle with Democrats for control of the US Senate in November .
Despite announcing his decision to seek re - election only two months ago , the freshman senator saw off a challenge from Trump - supporting real estate developer Carlos Beruff to win the Republican nomination by a comfortable 71 percentage points to 19 in tonightâ€ ™ s contest .
In an interview with MSNBC , Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s gastroenterologist implied that he has had access to Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s medical records , and what he has seen of the former secretary of stateâ€ ™ s medical history is â€œreally not so goodâ€ � .
The admission by Dr. Harold Bornstein - a likely violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act , if Bornstein is indeed referring to Clintonâ€ ™ s private medical records - came as part of a longer interview with MSNBC in which Bornstein attempted to play down the four - paragraph letter he penned in December that claimed Trump â€œwill be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidencyâ€ � if he is elected .
Florida congresswoman and former head of the Democratic National Committee Debbie Wasserman Schultz has won her Democratic primary , according to the Associated Press , winning 58 % of the vote in Floridaâ€ ™ s 23rd District with 56 % of precincts reporting , compared to 43 % for law professor Tim Canova .
Canova raised more than $ 3 m after Vermont senator Bernie Sanders called for his election following Schultzâ€ ™ s resignation from the chairship of the DNC after leaked emails revealed a climate of anti - Sanders sentiment in the upper echelons of the DNC .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s Dan Roberts has more on Marco Rubioâ€
™ s victory in the Florida primary : Marco Rubio has launched his political comeback with a decisive victory in the Florida primary that sets up a battle with Democrats for control of the US Senate in November .
Despite announcing his decision to seek re - election only two months ago , the freshman senator saw off a challenge from Trump - supporting real estate developer Carlos Beruff to win the Republican nomination by a comfortable 71 percentage points to 19 in Tuesdayâ€ ™ s contest .
Previously , Rubio had announced his retirement from politics after losing his home state to Trump by some 20 points in the presidential primary election .
He was persuaded to change his mind as Republican leaders in Washington sensed that the senate race in the state could prove pivotal .
On Tuesday night the Associated Press also projected Florida congressman Patrick Murphy had won the Democratic nomination to run for the Senate â€ “ by a margin of 59 to 18 percentage points .
It sets up a tight race with Rubio in November , who is now narrow favourite to hold the state and could prevent Democrats netting the four seats nationwide they may need to swing control of the Senate .
Murphy saw off a lackluster challenge from a once promising leftwing fireband , Alan Grayson , who was badly damaged by domestic abuse allegations and reacted angrily to probes into his background .
It looked to be a disappointing night overall for the progressive wing of the Democratic party , which had also hoped to unseat the former Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz after she was seen to take sides against Bernie Sanders in the presidential race .
Sanders endorsed the anti - establishment candidate Tim Canova in the 23rd House District around Miami , but he was trailing Wasserman Schulz by some 16 percentage points by the time of the Senate declarations .
Canova , who did not receive much direct support from Sanders , hinted at a possible concession as soon as the polls closed , telling supporters : â€œNo matter what happens , we should all be proud of what weâ€ ™ ve accomplished in a short period of time.â€ � Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s new campaign manager , Kellyanne Conway , said that â€œHillary and Obama were arguing about whether she should let him sit on the back of the bus of her presidential ticketâ€ � in an appearance on Larry King Live in 2008 , a comment with racial undertones that the Democratic Coalition Against Trump is emphasizing in a video released of the remarks .
The Washington Post reports that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is considering a last - minute meeting with Mexican president Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto tomorrow in Mexico City , hours before he is scheduled to deliver a major address on immigration in Phoenix aimed at clarifying his increasingly murky stance on the issue .
Talks on logistics and security for the candidateâ€ ™ s potential visit are still ongoing between Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign team and the Mexican government .
Trump is scheduled to appear at fundraisers in California tomorrow morning , as well as deliver his immigration address in Phoenix at 6 pm local time ( 9 pm ET ) .
The trip to Mexico City to meet with Nieto - who has previously invited Trump to debate him in Mexico - would occur somewhere in the middle of the day .
The trip was first broached with the US embassy in Mexico City earlier this week , a fast - tracking of an international visit by an American presidential candidate that is typically planned over the course of weeks , not days .
Trumpâ€ ™ s
approval ratings among Latino voters are historically bad , and his at - this - point theoretical relationship with Nietoâ€ ™ s government is even worse :
Trump has long pledged to force Mexico to pay for a 2,000-mile border wall along the US - Mexico border , a suggestion Nieto responded to coldly .
â€œNo way , â€ �

Republican Governor Chris Christie today vetoed an attempt to raise New Jerseyâ€ ™ s minimum wage to $ 10.10 an hour in the next year and to at least $ 15 an hour over the next five .
Christie said raising the minimum wage would burden small businesses and described the proposal as the â€œheavy hand of governmentâ€ � .
Announcing his decision at an event at a market in Pennington , the governor said raising pay was the job of business owners .
â€œAll of this sounds great , raising the minimum wage , when youâ€ ™ re spending someone elseâ€ ™ s money , â€ � he said .
Democrats , who control the statehouse , and liberal groups have put the legislation at the center of their agenda .
The legislature sent Christie the measure in June .
Democratic leaders say they will pursue a constitutional amendment to raise the minimum wage without the need for Christieâ€ ™ s approval .
â€œThe governorâ€ ™ s actions have only served to temporarily thwart a unified effort to raise New Jersey families and provide a much needed boost to our economy , â€ � said Analilia Mejia , director of the left - leaning group NJ Working Families .
Republican senator and onetime presidential candidate Marco Rubio has won his primary in Florida this evening , and is set to face off against Florida congressman Patrick Murphy in the general election .
At the time the Associated Press called the race , Rubio had won 71 % of the vote to developer Carlos Beruffâ€ ™ s 20 % ; Murphy had won 59 % to congressman Alan Graysonâ€
™ s 18 % and
Pam Keithâ€ ™ s 15 % .
Rubio had originally intended to retire in the event of his race for the White House ending unsuccessfully , but his decision in June to re - enter the race nearly cleared the field of would - be Republican nominees .

The Guardianâ€ ™ s Ben Jacobs has more on former Texas governor Rick Perry joining the cast of Dancing With the Stars : Rick Perry may have infamously forgotten the third government agency he wanted to abolish in 2011 â€ “ but heâ€ ™ ll need to remember his dancing shoes this fall .
The three - term governor of Texas and two - time failed Republican presidential candidate is appearing on the reality show Dancing With The Stars .
According to a report from Entertainment Tonight , Perry will join Olympian Ryan Lochte , one - hit rapper Vanilla Ice and former NFL star Calvin Johnson on the televised dance competition .
Although the show has been televised for 23 seasons , Perry will be only the second former elected official to take his turn twirling on stage .
However , he wonâ€ ™ t be the first competitor with close ties to the GOP .
Past seasons have featured the former House majority leader Tom DeLay , who resigned in 2006 after being charged with campaign finance violations , as well as Sarah Palinâ€ ™ s daughter Bristol , and Antonio Sabato Jr , a former soap opera actor who spoke in support of Donald Trump in Cleveland in July .

In its latest poll , PPP found that in addition to widely supporting Trumpâ€ ™ s signature policy proposal of building a wall along Americaâ€ ™ s border with Mexico , nearly one in three - 31 % - of the Republican presidential nomineeâ€ ™ s followers support building a wall along the Atlantic Ocean to keep Muslims from entering the country from the Middle East .
PPP found that 52 % are opposed to that idea .

That letter , penned in five minutes as he awaited a Trump Organization limousine , was the result of a request from Trump himself , Bornstein told MSNBC : â€œI guess he called
and he said the Clinton organization was going to publish a letter on her health ,
and I know her physician , and I know some of her health history , which is really not so good
, so I said â€˜Why not .
I would do that for you too , â€ ™ â€ � Bornstein said .

The pharmaceutical company Mylan is facing more political pressure to confront the price hike of EpiPen after 20 US senators , including Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders , sent an open letter on Tuesday to the company criticising its â€œexorbitantly expensiveâ€ � price hikes .
Reports emerged last week that the company had implemented a series of gradual price increases inflating the price of the drug from $ 56.64 to $ 317.82 , a 461 % increase in cost since Mylan acquired the rights to EpiPen in 2007 .
During that same time , Heather Bresch , chief executive officer of Mylan , saw her pay rise $ 2,453,456 to $ 18,931,068 , a 671 % increase .
Last week , she sold 100,200 of her shares in the company for more than $ 5 m .
â€œThe EpiPen auto - injector delivers a life - saving dose of epinephrine to patients suffering from anaphylaxis .
Anaphylactic shock can lead to serious injury or death if untreated ; thus , making sure the EpiPen is readily available for use is a critical part of life for millions of Americans living with severe allergies , â€ � the Democratic senators wrote in the eight - page letter addressed to Bresch .
â€œThe EpiPen , however , has become so exorbitantly expensive that access to this life - saving combination product is in jeopardy for many Americans .
â€œMylanâ€ ™ s near monopoly on the epinephrine auto - injector market has allowed you to increase prices well beyond those that are justified by any increase in the costs of manufacturing the EpiPen , â€ � the senators wrote .
Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential campaign has , at long last , debuted its print pool of reporters , which includes news outlets like the Washington Post , Politico , Buzzfeed News and the Huffington Post , all of which have been blacklisted from attending Trumpâ€ ™ s events in official capacities for months , according to Politico .
The print pool - a rotating cast of reporters that follow the candidateâ€ ™ s daily movements in order to share resources with other pool members , avoiding redundancy and expenses - is a tradition for most presidential campaigns , but the Trump campâ€ ™ s hostility to the idea ( and the press in general ) has delayed its creation .
Itâ€ ™ s unclear whether the informal blacklist against certain outlets and reporters will continue upon the poolâ€ ™ s creation .
Most journalists from blacklisted outlets have had their credentials to Trumpâ€ ™ s events denied for months , forced to enter and file as members of the public and occasionally kicked out of venues anyway .
The inclusion of blacklisted outlets in the pool may mean that reporters who cover Trump one week from the pool may be banned from even attending his rallies the next .
The most powerful fundraisers in Republican politics are cutting their pursestrings in the race for the US Senate in Ohio , suggesting that incumbent Rob Portman has all but locked up his reelection .
According to a report from the Hill , the so - called â€œKoch networkâ€ � of donors and operatives on the dole from billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch has cancelled $ 2.1 m in advertising meant to bolster Portmanâ€ ™ s chances against former Ohio governor Ted Strickland .
The Koch network has already poured more than $ 10 m into the race in advertising dollars , with the results to show it : Portman currently leads Strickland by roughly seven points in an aggregate of polls , and Democrats have shown signs of giving up on Portmanâ€ ™ s seat as part of their plan to retake control of the senate .
â€œRob Portman has run one of the strongest campaigns of the cycle , he maintains a significant lead in virtually every poll , and the dynamics of the race have changed , â€ � Koch network spokesman James Davis told the Hill .
â€œWe will remain on air through September 14th with our current ads , but given Portmanâ€ ™ s strong position in the race , we are going to drop the remaining reservation and reserve flexibility over future spending.â€ � CNNâ€ ™ s
Phil Mattingly says that Trump supporters have been told that Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s appearance in Snohomish County , Washington - where Barack Obama beat Mitt Romney by 17 points in the 2012 lection - will likely be his last in the liberal Pacific Northwest : Preparations for the first presidential debate in four weeks vary wildly between candidates , our man in Washington David Smith reports , with Hillary Clinton said to be deep in books and Donald Trump taking a more freewheeling approach .
It is being described as the political equivalent of the Super Bowl , World Cup final and Rumble in the Jungle rolled into one â€ “ or the smartest person in the room versus the class clown .
When Hillary Clinton faces Donald Trump in the first presidential debate on 26 September , a record TV audience of tens of millions is expected to watch a fascinating clash of styles that could go a long way to determining who wins the White House .
Clinton , the Democratic candidate , is said to be deep in books and painstaking rehearsal , mastering every policy detail and leaving nothing to chance .
Republican rival Trump , characteristically , is understood to be taking a more freewheeling approach , hoping that his experience as a reality TV celebrity will carry the day .
â€œItâ€
™ s really different this time because Trump is such a wild card , â€ � said Lanhee Chen , who helped prepare Senator Marco Rubio for this yearâ€ ™ s Republican primary debates against Trump .
â€œThe most important thing as someone facing him is to have your own strategy and not get thrown off .
The danger is to chase ever shiny objects that he throws out there .
She should ignore the shiny objects and stay disciplined.â€

The first contest , at Hofstra University on Long Island , New York , will take place 56 years to the day after the first ever televised debate between John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon ; the more telegenic Kennedy went on to win a narrow election .
The setpiece duels have not always been so consequential , but there is a sense that , in this most extraordinary of election years , Clinton v Trump could be a game changer .
The State Department says about 30 emails that may be related to the 2012 attack on U.S. compounds in Benghazi , Libya , are among the thousands of Hillary Clinton emails recovered during the FBIâ€ ™ s recently closed investigation into her use of a private server , AP reports : Government lawyers told U.S. District Court Judge Amit P. Mehta Tuesday that an undetermined number of the emails among the 30 were not included in the 55,000 pages previously provided by Clinton .
The State Departmentâ€ ™ s lawyer said it would need until the end of September to review the emails and redact potentially classified information before they are released .
Mehta questioned why it would take so long to release so few documents , and urged that the process be sped up .
He ordered the department to report to him in a week with more details about why the review process would take a full month .
The hearing was held in one of several lawsuits filed by the conservative legal group Judicial Watch , which has sued over access to government records involving the Democratic presidential nominee .
The State Department has said the FBI provided it with about 14,900 emails purported not to have been among those previously released .
Clinton previously had said she withheld and deleted only personal emails not related to her duties as secretary of state .
With the November election little more than two months away , Republicans are pressing for the release of as many documents related to Clinton as possible .

Clinton running mate Tim Kaine gets into the questions about Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s health raised by Rudy Giuliani and other Trump surrogates .
What about Trumpâ€ ™ s health , Kaine asks .
â€œEvery presidential candidate should prove .. that theyâ€ ™ re healthy enough , â€ � Kaine says .
As for the â€œconspiracy theoriesâ€ � about Clintonâ€ ™ s health , â€œcan I give you an up - close - and - personal on this?â€ � Kaine asks .
â€œI have been on the trail with Hillary for five weeks
and I can barely keep up with her .
Iâ€ ™ ve been on the trail five weeks .
Sheâ€ ™ s been going for 17 months.â€ � â€œTrump is the guy who released a medical note from his doctor that ... even said , Trump would be the healthiest individual to serve as president in the history of the country .
â€œIâ€ ™ d like to see him go one - on - one with president Obama , but thatâ€ ™ s for another day ...
â€ � â€œIs
that the standard that the American voter is entitled to ?
â€œHillary Clinton has met every test of disclosure we expect ...
Donald Trump has failed all of these tests miserably.â€ �
Tim Kaine is speaking now in Erie , Pennsylvania â€ “ watch live :
Former models who worked with Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s
Trump Model Management have told Mother Jones that they worked in the United States without the appropriate visas and faced steep expenses charged by their employer .
From the Mother Jones piece : According to a financial disclosure filed by his campaign in May , Donald Trump earned nearly $ 2 million from the company , in which he holds an 85 percent stake .
Meanwhile , some former Trump models say they barely made any money working for the agency because of the high fees for rent and other expenses that were charged by the company .
[ ... ] Two other former Trump modelsâ€”who requested anonymity to speak freely about their experiences , and who we are giving the pseudonyms Anna and Kateâ€”said
the agency never obtained work visas on their behalf , even as they performed modeling assignments in the United States .
The Trump campaign declined to answer questions about Trump Model Managementâ€

use of foreign labor .

A new Monmouth University poll of likely Pennsylvania voters shows Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump by eight points , 48 - 40 , in a four - way presidential race .
Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson gets 6 % in the poll and 1 % back
Jill Stein , while 4 % are undecided .
The poll also finds the Democratic candidate , Katie McGinty , with an edge in the US senate race over incumbent Pat Toomey .
Polling averages have the race neck - and - neck .
The latest installment of the NBC / Survey Monkey national tracking poll , conducted online from August 22 through August 28 among registered voters , has Clinton ahead of Trump by six points , 48 - 42 .
Last week , Clinton led Trump in the tracking poll by 8 points .
Does that mean the race is tightening ?
FiveThirtyEightâ€ ™ s
Nate Silver points out that Clintonâ€ ™ s numbers appear to have settled a bit , while Trumpâ€ ™ s are stagnant : The Washington Post today posted thousands of documents upon which were built the recently published newsroom book Trump Revealed : The documents include transcripts of interviews with Trump .
In one of the transcripts , the internet has noticed , Trump refers to the â€œMetsâ€ ™ George Steinbrenner.â€ � Steinbrenner , who died in 2010 , owned the Yankees , not the Mets .
What Trump said is like referring to â€œBoston Celtics star Michael Jordanâ€ � or the â€œLakersâ€ ™
Mark Cuban.â€ �
Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh , a primary source of information for Republican primary voters , said on his show Monday that â€œI never took him
seriouslyâ€
� on Trumpâ€ ™ s vow to deport the 11 - 12 million undocumented migrants in the United States .
Last fall , Trump repeatedly called for a â€œdeportation forceâ€ � to conduct the expulsions .
Competing primary candidates were not willing to follow him to that policy extreme .
They lost .
It appears now that Trump no longer supports a deportation force
â€ “
the candidate is due to roll out his immigration policy proposals , again , in a speech in Phoenix tomorrow .
A Limbaugh caller challenged the radio host on why he was pretending that Trump was not shifting on immigration .
Cornered , Limbaugh revealed that he never took Trump seriously on the issue â€ “ a stance he forgot to share with listeners at the time .
It was all sleight of hand , but only some people were in on it ?
What else does Limbaugh know Trump was faking ?
Media Matters has posted audio and a transcript :
CALLER :
For you to sit here and say that now that he adopts all the positions of everybody he ridiculed as not even being a flip flop and itâ€ ™ s no big deal ?
This is why so many Republican voters have such a hard time going to the con man .
RUSH LIMBAUGH ( HOST ) :
Well , in the first place , I donâ€
™ t think Trump has actually changed that much from what he said , and Iâ€ ™ m also not aware that he told every Republican they had to agree with him or else --
whatever he was going to do to them he did .
Iâ€ ™ m just -- the point --
what is it --
CALLER :
With all due respect , Rush , on Chuck Toddâ€ ™ s show , he specifically said when asked the question , â€œyou mean youâ€ ™ re going to rip the families apart , â€ � he said ,
â€œno , Iâ€ ™ m not going to rip the families apart .
They all have to go ,
even the U.S. citizen children.â€ � [ ... ]
Come on .
You were watching the debates as well as the rest of us were .
You know exactly what he said and you know exactly the way he ridiculed everybody on that stage .
LIMBAUGH :
Yeah .
I guess the difference is -- or not the difference .
I guess the thing is -- this is going to enrage you .
I could choose a path here to try to modify you .
I never took him seriously on this .
CALLER :
Yeah .
But 30 million â€ “ 15 â€ “ 10 million , excuse me , 10 million people did â€ “ LIMBAUGH :
Yeah , and they still donâ€ ™ t care .
Thatâ€ ™ s my point , they still donâ€ ™ t care .
Theyâ€ ™ re going to stick with him no matter what .
Maine governor Paul LePage has told a local radio station that he might â€œmove onâ€
� after a string of controversies culminating last week in a voicemail in which he called a state legislator a â€œlittle son - of - a - bitch socialist cocksuckerâ€ � and a video in which he expounded on the criminal nature of people of color .
â€œIâ€
™ m looking at all options , â€ � LePage said on WVOM , the Press Herald reported .
â€œI think some things Iâ€ ™ ve been asked to do are beyond my ability .
Iâ€ ™ m not going to say that Iâ€ ™ m not going to finish it .
Iâ€ ™ m not saying that I am going to finish it .
â€œIf Iâ€ ™ ve lost my ability to help Maine people , maybe itâ€ ™ s time to move on.â€
�
â€ ™ Update :
LePage tweets an indication that heâ€ ™ s not resigning :
LePage , a top Donald Trump supporter whose daughter works for the Trump campaign in Maine , has bragged about his proximity to Trump : â€œI was Donald Trump before Donald Trump became popular , â€ �
he said in February .
â€œSo I think I should support him because weâ€ ™ re one of the same cloth.â€ �
LePage has a long history of controversial , racially tinged statements .
Read further : Hillary Clinton running mate Tim Kaine will unleash a multi - pronged attack on Donald Trump in an afternoon rally today in Erie , Pennsylvania , the Clinton campaign advises .
Sounds like we may hear about the fact that Trump has not released his tax returns and the fact that much of Trumpâ€ ™ s business dealings are hidden from public view .
â€œWhile the public is in the dark about his finances and fitness , they know about Trumpâ€ ™ s long track record of alleged fraud , making his need to answer these questions all the more urgent , â€ � the Clinton campaign says in a statement .
The president will guest edit the November issue of Wired , the technology magazine , the publication has announced .
Check out the pocket squares on these guys :
Surely the theme must be technology and elections ?
Nope , the theme of the issue is â€œFrontiers , â€ � the magazine advises :
The theme of the issue : Frontiers .
Like WIRED , our 44th president is a relentless optimist .
For this completely bespoke issue , he wants to focus on the futureâ€”on the next hurdles that humanity will need to overcome to move forward .
These will include personal frontiers , from precision medicine to human performance ; local frontiers , including using data in urban planning and making sure renewable energy works for everyone ; national frontiers , from civil rights to medical data ; international frontiers , like climate change and cybersecurity ; and final frontiers , including space travel and Artificial Intelligence .
Also of note : The White House is also announcing a Frontiers conference , inspired by the issue , which President Obama will host with the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University on October 13 .

Speaking of elections ...
people are actually voting today .
In Floridaâ€ ™ s Democratic US senate primary , Representative Patrick Murphy is on track to defeat Representative Alan Grayson and claim the opportunity to face incumbent Republican Marco Rubio in November .
Rubio is expected to nuke his primary opponent and averages five points ahead of Murphy in general election polls .
Politicoâ€ ™ s Florida oracle Marc Caputo is predicting , meanwhile , a primary win for embattled Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz , who was toppled from her perch atop the Democratic national committee last month when hacked emails revealed the DNC had a finger on the scale for Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders .
Arizona senator John McCain faces a challenger from the right , state senator Kelli Ward , in a primary contest today .
McCain would be glad to come through with a comfortable margin before he braces for what looks like an even more difficult general election battle ahead , against Representative Ann Kirkpatrick .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not so much I think itâ€ ™ s close .
I just donâ€ ™ t think you should heighten expectations , â€ � McCain told Politico in an interview about the primary contest .
â€œThe one thing you never want to do in politics is heighten expectations .
You always want to lowball it .
Thatâ€ ™ s just the best way to handle it .
Plan for the worst and hope for the best.â€

As the Donald Trump campaign alternately pokes fun at Hillary Clinton for her policy wonkery and accuses her of an unwillingness to engage â€œon the issues , â€ � the Associated Press has spent some serious quality time with the candidatesâ€ ™ web sites and determined that Clinton has supplied more information about her policy positions .
A lot more .
Like 1,253 % more : From the start , Trump has never been the kind of candidate to pore over thick policy books .
Indeed , he has mocked Clinton on the subject .
â€œSheâ€
™ s got people that sit in cubicles writing policy all day .
Nothingâ€ ™ s ever going to happen .
Itâ€ ™ s just a waste of paper , â€ �
he told Time Magazine in June .
â€œMy voters donâ€ ™ t care and the public doesnâ€ ™ t care .
They know youâ€ ™ re going to do a good job once youâ€ ™ re there.â€ �
To date , Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign has posted just seven policy proposals on his website , totaling just over 9,000 words .
There are 38 on Clintonâ€ ™ s â€œissuesâ€ � page , ranging from efforts to cure Alzheimerâ€ ™ s disease to Wall Street and criminal justice reform , and her campaign boasts that it has now released 65 policy fact sheets , totaling 112,735 words .
Trumpâ€ ™ s
campaign manager , meanwhile , is taunting Clinton for what she , the manager , paints as a failure to engage on the issues : One metric at which the Trump campaign has excelled the Clinton campaign is aides making headlines .
A Washington Post analysis found that Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook has failed to get his name in half as many headlines as the Trump chairman who has been in his job about two weeks now .

Senate minority leader Harry Reid , who is retiring at the end of the year , has asked the FBI to investigate possible Russian tampering in the US election , claiming the threat â€œis more extensive than is widely known and may include the intent to falsify official election resultsâ€ � .
Reidâ€ ™ s letter follows a report by Yahoo News that the FBI had uncovered evidence that foreign hackers â€œpenetrated two state election databases in recent weeks , prompting the bureau to warn election officials across the country to take new steps to enhance the security of their computer systems , according to federal and state law enforcement officialsâ€ � .
â€œThat incident was only a small part of what disturbed me , â€ �
Reid said in his letter to the FBI , which was obtained by the New York Times .

2016-08-31,"John McCain and Marco Rubio have sealed a night of comebacks for the political establishment with the senators seeing off primary challenges to secure the Republican nominations for crucial senate races in Arizona and Florida .
Facing tougher opposition from Democrats in November , the two big - name national figures who once had eyes on the White House are instead on the frontline of their partyâ€ ™ s battle to hold on to power in the US Senate .
A similar night of consolidation for the Democratic mainstream means Rubio will face the Florida congressman Patrick Murphy , who comfortably beat off his partyâ€ ™
s
leftwing challenger Alan Grayson on Tuesday night .
McCain needs to beat Ann Kirkpatrick , who won her
Arizona senate primary unopposed for the Democrats .
Both incumbent Republican senators have an uneasy relationship with Donald Trump , whom they felt obliged to endorse as the partyâ€ ™ s presidential nominee .
He may face more vocal criticism from them now their primary battles are over .
McCain in particular was seen as vulnerable to a populist challenge by Kelli Ward in Arizona , but was comfortably ahead by 55 to 35 percentage points when the Republican primary result was called shortly before 9 pm local time .
Rubio launched his political comeback earlier on Tuesday night with a decisive victory in the Florida primary setting up a more winnable battle with Democrats , one that could determine control of the US Senate in November .
Despite announcing his decision to seek re - election only two months ago , the freshman senator saw off a challenge from Trump - supporting real estate developer Carlos Beruff to win the Republican nomination by a comfortable 72 percentage points to 18 .
Previously Rubio had announced his retirement from politics after losing his home state to Trump by some 20 points in the presidential primary election .
He was persuaded to change his mind as Republican leaders in Washington sensed that the Senate race in the state could prove pivotal .
â€œThis has been an unusual road back here with you tonight .
As you know , after my race ended in March for the presidency I was prepared to become a private citizen
, â€ � Rubio told supporters after the result .
â€œBut I just couldnâ€ ™ t be at peace with the idea that we were going to not just potentially lose the Senate seat but lose the balance of power in the Senate at this critical moment in our nationâ€ ™ s history.â€ �
The Associated Press also projected that congressman Murphy had won the Democratic primary in the state by a margin of 59 to 18 percentage points .
It sets up a tight race with Rubio in November , who is now narrow favorite to hold the state and could prevent Democrats netting the four seats nationwide they may need to swing control of the US Senate .
Murphy saw off a lackluster challenge from Grayson , who was badly damaged by domestic abuse allegations and reacted angrily to inquiries into his background .
It was a disappointing night overall for the progressive wing of the Democratic party , which had also hoped to unseat former Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz after she was seen to take sides against Bernie Sanders in the presidential race .
Sanders endorsed anti - establishment candidate Tim Canova in the 23rd House district around Miami , but he lost to Wasserman Schulz by nearly 14 percentage points .
Canova , who did not receive much direct support from Sanders , hinted at a possible concession as soon as the polls closed , telling supporters : â€œNo matter what happens we should all be proud of what weâ€ ™ ve accomplished in a short period of time.â€ �
In another Florida House primary , the incumbent Democratic congresswoman Corrine Brown lost the party nomination following an indictment on fraud charges .
But it is Rubioâ€ ™ s strong comeback against anti - establishment forces within the Republican party that is likely to be the most memorable feature of the Florida primary .
Beruff , a real estate developer who self - funded the campaign in a similar vein to Trump , had attacked Rubio for missing votes during his presidential campaign , not being anti - immigration enough and failing to wholeheartedly support Trump as the partyâ€ ™ s eventual nominee .
Similarly , Ward blasted McCain for being soft on immigration and too old to seek his sixth term as senator of the increasingly diverse state .
In Arizona the other big local news was the victory of controversial immigration control champion Sheriff Joe Arpaio in his primary ."
2016-09-09,"Practice may not make perfect for Donald Trump but the Republican nominee has clearly refined his appeal to evangelical voters in the past year .
One year after Trump was booed at the conservative Values Voters Summit for calling Marco Rubio â€œa
clownâ€ � , the Republican nominee gave a more polished speech where he ignored politically divisive issues like abortion and same - sex marriage and instead focused on school vouchers and changing federal law to allow tax exempt churches to engage in political advocacy .
For Trump , school choice , which he advocated in a speech on Thursday , was a needed innovation .
â€œThe education canâ€ ™ t get worse , â€ �
he said while also pledging to â€œcampaign to get the states to reallocate another $ 110bn of their education budgets to school choice programsâ€ � .
Speaking from teleprompters , it served as a pointed contrast to his speech a year ago which seemed to focus on the importance of saying â€œMerry Christmasâ€ � instead of â€œHappy Holidaysâ€ � .
This year , Trump was still not a natural in front of a crowd of ardent social conservatives , even once referring to attendees as â€œyou peopleâ€ � .
Trump also railed against the Obama administration for not admitting Christian refugees from Syria into the United States , a major cause of concern for evangelicals Christians who have long advocated for minority Christian communities in the Middle East .
Not mentioned was Trumpâ€ ™ s own refugee policy , which would be a blanket ban on anyone from the region entering the United States .
Trump did seem to recognize that no one would mistake him for a devout evangelical .
At one point in the speech he joked that his support for repealing the Johnson amendment , which would allow churches to engage in partisan politics while keeping their tax - exempt status , was the only way he could get into heaven .
But the biggest applause was not for Trump himself but for when he proclaimed : â€œHillary Clinton is unfit to be president.â€ �
The room exploded in applause and one attendee could be seen waving his tricorne hat in support .
The Values Voter Summit is sponsored by the Family Research Council and has a constellation of conservative groups represented .
Even the far - right John Birch Society had a table in the groupâ€ ™ s exhibition hall .
But Trumpâ€ ™ s performance seemed to ease the concerns of attendees who represented some of the most ardent cultural warriors in the party , a group that has long been uncomfortable with the partyâ€ ™ s nominee , and preferred other candidates like Ted Cruz during the primary .
Dylan Miller , a rising community college freshman from north - west Florida said the speech changed his mind about Trump .
â€œHe
doesnâ€ ™ t seem maniacalâ€ � , the teenager said , contrasting Fridayâ€ ™ s speech to the Republican nomineeâ€ ™ s frequent televised performances .
Miller had said he had always planned on voting for Trump â€œbecause he wasnâ€ ™ t Hillaryâ€ � but Trumpâ€ ™ s performance made him feel far more comfortable with his vote .
Another attendee , Sarah Ocker , a student at Tulsa Community College in Oklahoma , said she was closer to voting for Trump after his speech .
She said that she â€œagreed with a lotâ€ � of what Trump said , particularly about â€œreligious libertyâ€ � .
But Ocker still had major hesitations about Trump and couldnâ€ ™ t commit to voting for him , although she was â€œhopingâ€ �
she could find a reason to do soby November .
Vernon Lewis of Marshall , Texas , was further along in the process .
Lewis had once thought he would have to hold his nose to vote for Trump , but after Trump granted him and other Christians a private meeting in New York , as well as seeing his speech on Friday , Lewis said he was enthusiastic .
â€œHe is a very gentle guy.â€ �"
2016-09-29,"Barack Obama has a â€œ0%â€
� chance of getting his nomination for ambassador to Cuba approved by Congress , according to the union representing US diplomats .
The president this week announced Jeffrey DeLaurentis as his choice to become the first American ambassador to Cuba in more than half a century , aiming to put the seal on his detente with the communist island nation .
But while Havana welcomed the move , Republican senators including Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas have pledged to block any ambassador nomination , citing a lack of progress in democracy and human rights .
Asked to rate the chances of DeLaurentis being approved ,
Ã �
sgeir
SigfÃºsson , spokesman for the American Foreign Service Association , said : â€œI would say 0 % .
With Marco Rubio on the Senate foreign relations committee , itâ€ ™ s never going to happen.â€
�
Rubio and Cruz are both sons of Cuban immigrants .
â€œThey have sworn to do anything they can against the normalisation of relations , â€ �
SigfÃºsson added .
â€œHe might not even get a hearing.â€
�
It is therefore a seemingly futile gesture on Obamaâ€ ™ s part , SigfÃºsson said .
â€œThe president is exercising his right to be a late lame duck president trying to do everything he can .
Itâ€ ™ s symbolic .
He drove through the normalisation of relations and gets to claim heâ€ ™ s the one who did it.â€
�
The US and Cuba severed diplomatic ties in 1961 , deep in the cold war .
Obama and President RaÃºl Castro of Cuba made a surprise announcement in December 2014 that they had secretly agreed to restore diplomatic relations , including reopening embassies in each otherâ€ ™ s countries .
Obama made a historic visit in March , and commercial flights resumed last month .
Obama called the naming of an ambassador a â€œcommonsenseâ€ � step toward more productive relations and said DeLaurentis â€ “ currently the top diplomat at the US embassy in Havana â€ “ is the best person for the job .
â€œThere is no public servant better suited to improve our ability to engage the Cuban people and advance US interests in Cuba than Jeff , â€ � the president said in a statement .
â€œJeffâ€ ™ s leadership has been vital throughout the normalisation of relations between the United States and Cuba.â€ �
He added : â€œHaving an ambassador will make it easier to advocate for our interests , and will deepen our understanding even when we know that we will continue to have differences with the Cuban government .
We only hurt ourselves by not being represented by an ambassador.â€ �
On Wednesday , Gustavo MachÃ­n , deputy director for US affairs in the Cuban foreign ministry , described the news as â€œwelcomeâ€ � but said he will use a bilateral commission meeting in Washington on Friday to push for more .
â€œThe Cuban delegation will point out the lack of advances in the economic , commercial sphere , â€ �
MachÃ­n said in Havana .
â€œWe consider the measures adopted by President Obamaâ€ ™ s administration are positive but still insufficient and limited.â€
�
Obama should also use his executive power to further narrow the trade embargo imposed on Cuba after its 1959 revolution , Machin said .
â€œIf the president could â€ ¦ allow investment in telecoms , why canâ€ ™ t
he authorise investments in other areas?â€ �
Cubaâ€ ™ s top diplomat in Washington , JosÃ © CabaÃ±as , was given the rank of ambassador last year .
But the battle over â€œour man in Havanaâ€ � is already under way .
Rubio said : â€œJust like releasing all terrorists from GuantÃ¡namo and sending US taxpayer dollars to the Iranian regime , rewarding the Castro government with a US ambassador is another last - ditch legacy project for the president that needs to be stopped .
â€œA US ambassador is not going to influence the Cuban government , which is a dictatorial and closed regime .
This nomination should go nowhere until the Castro regime makes significant and irreversible progress in the areas of human rights and political freedom for the Cuban people , and until longstanding concerns about the Cuban regimeâ€ ™ s theft of property and crimes against American citizens are addressed.â€ �
Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont , the top Democrat on the appropriations subcommittee that oversees the state department and foreign operations , took a different view .
â€œ[DeLaurentis ] is a career diplomat who is universally respected by his peers , and by Democrats and Republicans in Congress , for his intellect , his integrity , and his thoughtfulness , â€ � he said .
â€œThe decision to resume diplomatic relations with Cuba has been widely supported , and the number of Americans traveling to Cuba is increasing dramatically .
We need an ambassador who knows Cuba , who is respected by the Cuban government , and who will stand up for US interests and values .
Jeff is that person .
The Cuban people have their ambassador in Washington .
The American people need their ambassador in Havana.â€ �
Since diplomatic relations were restored on 20 July last year , DeLaurentis has led negotiations with Cuba on issues including the billions of dollars in US claims against Cuba for properties that were confiscated during the revolution .
The Republican presidential candidate , Donald Trump , said earlier this month that , if elected , he would undo Obamaâ€ ™ s efforts at rapprochement unless Cuba permits religious freedoms and releases political prisoners .
After a logjam last year that left numerous would - be ambassadors in limbo , the situation has much improved with eight awaiting confirmation , of whom five are expected to be approved this week , according to SigfÃºsson ."
2016-10-09,"Hours after a leaked video emerged in which Donald Trump bragged about groping women without their consent , Florida senator Marco Rubio condemned the Republican nomineeâ€ ™ s comments as â€œvulgar , egregious [ and ] impossible to justifyâ€ � .
But as Republicans fled from Trump en masse on Saturday and in many cases called on him to step aside , Rubio did not rescind his endorsement of the former reality TV star .
Rubio has avoided campaigning alongside the nominee , a notable absence from Trumpâ€ ™ s multiple appearances in Florida in recent months , and has no plans to campaign with him before election day .
To Patrick Murphy , the Democratic congressman challenging Rubio for his Senate seat , the senatorâ€ ™ s
silence raises questions about his character .
â€œIf he wasnâ€ ™ t such a coward he would stand up immediately and withdraw his endorsement , â€ �
Murphy said in an interview with the Guardian late Saturday .
â€œIt speaks , unfortunately , to who he is as a person .
For Marco Rubio to continue putting his own political ambitions in front of what he knows is best â€ ¦
I donâ€
™ t know how he can look himself in the mirror after these comments and think itâ€ ™ s
OK.â€ �
In the video from 2005 , which emerged on Friday , Trump boasted that when approaching beautiful women he could â€œgrab them by the pussyâ€ � and kiss and grope them because he is a star .
For Rubio , who endorsed Trump despite the two sparring bitterly in the Republican presidential primary , the routine of distancing himself from the real estate mogulâ€ ™ s controversial rhetoric is nothing new .
The senator constantly found himself rebuking Trumpâ€ ™ s statements â€ “ whether on immigrants , Muslims or women â€ “ during his unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination .
Rubio similarly denounced Trumpâ€ ™ s attacks on an American judge of Hispanic descent and the Gold Star parents of an Iraq war hero ; but while seeking re - election to the Senate , Rubio has also openly advocated for electing Trump to the presidency even as he maintained prior criticisms that included not trusting his former rival with the nuclear codes .
And as other Republicans have struggled to walk the fine line between supporting Trump and fully embracing him , for Rubio the balancing act has appeared to pay dividends .
He overwhelmingly defeated a challenge from the right in the Florida Senate race â€ “ critical to Republicansâ€ ™ chances of holding on to an already precarious majority â€ “ and has run ahead of Murphy in most polls even as Trump has trailed Hillary Clinton .
A new NBC / WSJ / Marist survey released on Sunday showed a potentially tighter race , with Rubio holding just a two - point lead .
Trumpâ€ ™ s latest comments could open a new front for Democrats in a race they recently signalled was no longer competitive by pulling back resources such as ad spending .
The progressive group MoveOn.org released a new spot on Sunday , in which it played Trumpâ€ ™ s comments about women against a side - by - side photo of him and Rubio .
â€œRubio stood by Trump after months of indefensible behavior like this , â€ � the ad read .
As other Republican Senate candidates , such as Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Joe Heck of Nevada , withdrew their support for Trump , Murphy pounced with an op - ed calling on Rubio to either rescind his endorsement of Trump or withdraw from the race .
Reached for comment , a spokeswoman for Rubioâ€ ™ s campaign said the senator was focused on recovery efforts following Hurricane Matthew and pointed back to his initial statement on Twitter .
â€œNo one should ever talk about any woman in those terms , even in private , â€ � Rubio wrote late Friday .
On Saturday , the senator took an aerial tour of the damage caused by the storm but did not wade into the political fallout surrounding Trump .
Murphy told the Guardian he , too , had been occupied with the hurricane .
But it was not a sufficient excuse , in his view , for Rubio to decline to weigh in further on Trump when dozens of Republicans in Congress had launched a mass exodus away from the nominee .
â€œThe fact that heâ€ ™ s only going to tweet on this speaks volumes , â€ � Murphy said .
â€œA lot of people are waiting for some strong actions or some strong words on this .
I think heâ€
™ s making a calculated decision about his political career and that having Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s support will help him long term.â€ � Complicating matters for Rubio was the growing list of Republicans dropping Trump by the hour .
Among them was Rob Portman , a senator from the battleground state of Ohio , who like Rubio has succeeded thus far in running a parallel race to Trumpâ€ ™ s , absent the damage associated with the nomineeâ€ ™ s toxic brand of politics .
â€œWhile
I continue to respect those who still support Donald Trump
, I can no longer support him , â€ � Portman said in a statement late Saturday , while stating his intention to write in Trumpâ€ ™ s running mate , Indiana governor Mike Pence , for president .
â€œI continue to believe our country can not afford a Hillary Clinton presidencyâ€ � .
Senator John McCain , facing a tough re - election battle in Arizona , also pulled his endorsement of Trump .
Ted Cruz , the Texas senator who reluctantly backed Trump last month after declining to endorse him at the Republican National Convention in July , was reportedly reconsidering his decision .
Conventional wisdom holds that Cruz and Rubio will seek the presidency once more .
Murphy , who has hammered Rubio for refusing to commit to serving a six - year term if re - elected to the Senate , told the Guardian his opponentâ€ ™ s calculus with respect to Trump had only to do with a second presidential bid as early as 2020 .
â€œItâ€ ™ s hard to know who the real Marco Rubio is anymore , â€ � Murphy said .
â€œI
just think
heâ€
™ s going regret

2016-10-11,"Donald Trump railed against his fellow Republicans on Twitter on Tuesday morning , after a week in which many in the party have deserted him following the release of a tape of him boasting about groping women .
The move came as prominent Republicans Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz both reaffirmed that they were standing by the nominee .
Trump described his party â€ “ which he first joined in 1987 before several years as a Democrat and an independent â€ “ as disloyal and unable to win , while labeling the House speaker , Paul Ryan , the most senior Republican in Congress , â€œvery weak and ineffectiveâ€ � .
Ryan has been a vocal critic of Trumpâ€ ™ s and this week announced he would no longer defend Trump or campaign with him , although he stopped short of formally unendorsing him .
Trumpâ€ ™ s outburst marked yet another sign of the growing divisions between the candidate and the rest of his party , and the candidateâ€ ™ s willingness to throw political prudence to the wind to attack any dissenter .
â€œIt is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to , â€ � he tweeted .
His tirade came days after dozens of elected Republicans abandoned Trump in the wake of leaked video where he bragged about groping women .
The backlash culminated in a conference call on Monday with House Republicans at which Ryan essentially cut Trump loose and seemed to acknowledge that Hillary Clinton would win the election .
Shortly after landing in San Antonio for a closed press fundraiser , Trump extended his attacks , railing against the 2008 GOP nominee , John McCain , for withdrawing his endorsement .
â€œThe very foul mouthed Sen John McCain begged for my support during his primary ( I gave , he won ) , then dropped me over locker room remarks!â€ � Trump tweeted .
McCain issued a statement that he was unable to even offer his partyâ€ ™ s nominee â€œconditional supportâ€ � on Saturday in the wake of what the Arizona senator called Trumpâ€ ™ s â€œboasts about sexual assaultsâ€ � .
Trump had previously mocked McCain , a decorated war hero , for being captured during the Vietnam war after his plane was shot down .
Rubio , who ran against Trump in the presidential primary , said his position had not changed in a statement on Tuesday after facing mounting pressure from his opponent in the Florida Senate race to dump Trump .
â€œI disagree with him on many things , but I disagree with his opponent on virtually everything , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œI wish we had better choices for president .
But I do not want Hillary Clinton to be our next president .
â€œWhile
I respect that voters chose him as the GOP nominee , I have never hesitated to oppose his policies I disagree with , â€ � he added of Trump .
â€œAnd I have consistently rejected his offensive rhetoric and behavior.â€ �
Rubio did not specifically address in his statement the tape in which Trump bragged about assaulting women .
The senatorâ€ ™ s only remark on its content was a tweet late on Friday , in which he said
Trumpâ€ ™ s comments were â€œvulgar , egregious [ and ] impossible to justifyâ€ � .
The senator was trounced by his former rival by 20 points in the Florida primary , and needs Trumpâ€ ™ s base of support to be re - elected in his home state next month .
His statement came shortly after Ted Cruz , another 2016 contender expected to seek the presidency again , also reaffirmed his support for Trump .
â€œI am supporting the Republican nominee because I think Hillary Clinton is an absolute disaster , â€ �
Cruz said in an interview with a local Texas station .
â€œNow my differences with Donald , I have articulated at great length during the campaign , â€ � he added .
â€œThis is an election unlike any other but Iâ€ ™ ll tell you , Hillary Clinton , I think , is manifestly unfit to be president.â€ �
Trump attacked Ryan with his first tweet this morning , writing : â€œDespite winning the second debate in a landslide ( every poll ) , it is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support!â€ � and then continuing â€œour very weak and ineffective leader , Paul Ryan , had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyaltyâ€ � .
Polls conducted using more rigorous methodology â€ “ rather than the self - selecting online polls Trump has highlighted â€
“ have ruled that Clinton â€œwonâ€
� the second debate on Sunday night .
Trump then boasted that â€œthe shackles have been taken off meâ€ � before attacking fellow Republicans for perceived disloyalty .
A spokesperson for Ryan shrugged off the comments , saying in a statement : â€œPaul Ryan is focusing the next month on defeating Democrats , and all Republicans running for office should probably do the same.â€ �
However , Trumpâ€ ™ s criticisms come at a time of growing schism between the nomineeâ€ ™ s supporters and other Republicans .
Trump supporters rallied outside the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington on Monday in protest against what they saw as the national partyâ€ ™ s anti - Trump bias .
The protest was organized by the Trump campaignâ€ ™ s Virginia state chairman , who was fired for what the deputy campaign manager , David Bossie , called â€œa stunt in front of the RNC without the knowledge or the approval of the Trump campaignâ€ � .
Meanwhile Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson bragged on Twitter on Monday about the number of people who were voting for Trump but not voting for Republican candidates for the Senate and the House .
Earlier this year , while the primary process was still taking place , Trump renounced a pledge he had made to support the GOP nominee whoever he or she was because â€œI have been treated very unfairlyâ€ � .
Before his 2016 run for the White House , Trump , who most recently registered as a Republican in April 2012 , had donated to a number of Democratic politicians and flirted with a third - party campaign for the presidency in 2000 ."

Barack Obama assailed Republican nominee Donald Trump on Tuesday over remarks about groping women , also criticizing Republicans who continued to support the candidate .
â€œYou donâ€
™ t have to be a husband or a father to hear what we heard just a few days ago and say thatâ€ ™ s not right , â€ � the president said in Greensboro , North Carolina , in his first public remarks since the release of a 2005 tape showing Trump bragging about groping and kissing women without their consent .
â€œYou just have to be a decent human being to say thatâ€ ™ s not right.â€ �
Hillary Clinton used the global climate crisis as a weapon for another assault on Donald Trump on Tuesday , enlisting the help of her husbandâ€ ™ s former vice - president Al Gore to urge Americaâ€ ™ s voters not to risk sending a â€œclimate change denierâ€ � to the White House .
In a joint address in Miami , Clinton and Gore repeatedly hammered the Republican nominee for his stance on climate change and his belief that global warming is a hoax initiated by the Chinese .
â€œClimate change is real , itâ€ ™ s urgent , and America can take the lead in the world in addressing it , â€ � Clinton said , promising investment in clean energy .
The 2016 campaign has jumped the shark .
Specifically , the shark from Jaws .
In a conversation with Fox News host Megyn Kelly , former Arkansas governorMike Huckabee declared that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump may be rough around the edges , but when the chips are down , heâ€
™ s the person you can trust to save your life â€ “ not unlike Captain Quint in the film Jaws .
The repercussions were swift following last Fridayâ€ ™ s leak of the Access Hollywood tape , in which Donald Trump can be heard bragging about sexually assaulting women : House speaker Paul Ryan told fellow Republicans that he would no longer defend the partyâ€ ™ s nominee , while hordes of party members distanced themselves from Trumpâ€ ™ s comments with some â€ “ including Senator John McCain â€ “ even saying they could no longer vote for Trump .
Supposedly , things could get even worse for the Republican nominee .
Following the release of the footage by the Washington Post , Bill Pruitt , a producer on the first two seasons of The Apprentice , the NBC reality show Trump hosted from 2004 - 2015 , tweeted that there are â€œfar worseâ€ � behind - the - scenes tapes of Trump on the program .
Emmy award - winning producer Chris Nee has alleged that Trump says the n - word in the recordings .
The BeyHive did not take kindly to Trump surrogate Betsy McCaughey calling Hillary Clinton a hypocrite for criticizing Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s sexist remarks despite also being a fan of BeyoncÃ © .
â€œHillary Clinton expresses that she finds the language on that bus horrific , â€ � said McCaughey on CNN on Monday , noting that she herself did not like â€œrap musicâ€ � .
â€œBut in fact she likes language like this : â€˜I came to slay bitch , when he fuck me good ,
I take his ass to Red Lobster , â€ ™

Donald Trump , on Al Gore :
Didnâ€ ™ t he say he was the founder of the Internet ?
He wasnâ€ ™ t .
Live from Florida : Watch it live here : Texas congressman Blake Farenthold has swiftly apologized for telling an MSNBC anchor that he would have to think about revoking his endorsement of a candidate who said that he â€œreally liked raping women.â€ �
Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign fired back on Tuesday as Wikileaks released a new tranche of hacked emails from the account of its chairman John Podesta , dubbing the website a â€œpropaganda arm of the Russian governmentâ€ � seeking to help elect Republican nominee Donald Trump .
The latest batch of more than 2,000 emails , disclosed on Monday , offered a glimpse into the inner workings of the Clinton campaign .
They included insights on multiple fronts , such as a lack of preparedness for Bernie Sandersâ€ ™ insurgent campaign , concerns raised by Chelsea Clinton over potential conflicts of interest for the familyâ€ ™ s foundation , and efforts by aides on how to best frame the former secretary of stateâ€ ™ s second bid for the White House .
Last week , Wikileaks published other hacked emails from Podestaâ€ ™ s account , which included alleged excerpts of Clintonâ€ ™ s paid speeches to Wall Street .
Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign has neither confirmed nor denied authenticity of the emails , but in recent days escalated its charge that the hack was conducted by Russian state actors .
Brian Fallon , a spokesman for Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign , fired off a tweet storm late Monday in which he assailed Wikileaks and its founder , Julian Assange , for working on behalf of the Russian government .
â€œYou are no media organization , â€ �
Fallon tweeted at Wikileaks .
â€œYou are a propaganda arm of the Russian government , running interference for their pet candidate , Trump.â€ � Texas congressman Blake Farenthold , asked on MSNBC this evening whether he would continue to support Donald Trump if he said â€œI really like to rape women , â€ � did not commit to revoking his endorsement of the Republican presidential candidate .
â€œThat would be bad and Iâ€ ™
d consider it.â€ �
Donald Trump , making his first appearance in a one - on - one interview since the release of video recordings that showed him bragging about sexually assaulting women and since the second presidential debate , petulantly told Fox Newsâ€ ™ Bill Oâ€ ™ Reilly that â€œI get along with everybodyâ€ � that that House speaker Paul Ryan had committed a craven act of political betrayal by refusing to defend him .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve been having a problem - we have millions and millions of followers , â€ �
Trump said ,
â€œand Paul Ryan , open borders and amnesty and bad budgets by the way , very , very bad budgets ...
The shackles are some of the establishment people the weak and ineffective people within the party.â€ � â€œTheyâ€ ™ re not giving support - they donâ€ ™ t give the kind of support , â€ �
Trump said , when Oâ€ ™ Reilly asked why he was so angry with Republican leadership .
â€œThey donâ€ ™ t give the support that we really need .
Maybe weâ€ ™ ll do better without their support.â€ �
When Oâ€ ™ Reilly asked if Trumpâ€ ™ s â€œthrowing off of the shacklesâ€ � of cooperating with Republicans meant that he would become more outspoken , Trump denied that he was outspoken at all .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think Iâ€ ™ m that outspoken to be honest with you - I think Iâ€ ™ ve been very nice , â€ � Trump said .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think so - look , I went to Ivy League schools.â€
� â€œIâ€ ™ m just tired of nonsupport - and I donâ€ ™ t really want support.â€ �
Asked how he would address his cratering support among women after release of video in which he grabbed about being able to â€œgrab [ women ] by the pussyâ€ � without consequence because of his fame , Trump dismissed the remarks as â€œlocker room talk.â€ � â€œMost people have heard it before , and Iâ€ ™ ve had a lot of women come up to me and say Iâ€ ™ ve heard that before , and Iâ€ ™ ve heard a lot worse , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œIf thatâ€ ™ s what it takes to lose an election
, I think thatâ€ ™ d be pretty sad.â€
� Oâ€ ™ Reilly said that his popularity among women has taken a hit , which Trump denied .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not sure I believe it - Iâ€ ™ m not sure I believe it , â€ � Trump said .
â€œWhat women want is they want secure borders , they want safety , they want law and order , they want a police department that is allowed to so its job , they want justice for all , â€ � before going on a tirade about Hillary Clinton creating Isis , which he said â€œIâ€ ™ m sure she was very proud
of.â€
� â€œTo be honest with you , Bill , I get along with people.â€ �
Hillary Clinton used the global climate crisis as a weapon for another assault on Donald Trump on Tuesday , enlisting the help of her husbandâ€ ™ s former vice - president Al Gore to urge Americaâ€ ™ s voters not to risk sending a â€œclimate change denierâ€ � to the White House .
In a joint address in Miami , Clinton and Gore repeatedly hammered the Republican nominee for his stance on climate change and his belief that global warming is a hoax initiated by the Chinese .
â€œClimate change is real , itâ€ ™ s urgent , and America can take the lead in the world in addressing it , â€ � Clinton said , promising investment in clean energy .
â€œWe can transform our economy , we can rally the world to cut carbon pollutions and above all we can fulfill our moral obligation to protect the planet .
Just remember what is at stake .
My opponent is a guy who denies science , who denies climate change every day.â€ �
Yet it was Gore , who lost the 2000 presidential election to George W Bush by less than 500 votes in Florida , who delivered the more powerful message about why the climate crisis is one of the most serious issues in this campaign , and why he believes Clinton is the only candidate who can help solve it .
President Barack Obama , on the stakes of the 2016 election : Civility is on the ballot !
Respect for women is on the ballot !
Tolerance is on the ballot !
Justice is on the ballot !
Equality is on the ballot !
Democracy is on the ballot !
If you want to send a message in this election , make it a resounding message !
Closing out his remarks by speaking directly to young voters , President Barack Obama urges them to turn out , despite the coarsening of the American political process during the 2016 campaign .
â€œThere are a lot of things about our politics that can seem cheap , and trivial , and frustrating , â€ � Obama says , â€œbut hereâ€ ™ s a chance to reject a divisive and mean - spirited politics that would just take us backwards .
And thereâ€ ™ s nothing cheap or trivial about that.â€ � â€œThatâ€ ™ s real - that is true .
And young people , you have a chance to do that
, so donâ€ ™ t fall for the easy cynicism that says my vote doesnâ€ ™ t matter , or all politicians are the same ,
â€ � Obama continues .
â€œI promise you - your vote
matters!â€ � â€œIf you care about equality
, if you supported Bernie in the primaries , youâ€ ™ ve got a choice!â€ � Obama says .
â€œWhen he asks you what you have to lose , you answer - youâ€ ™ ve got everything to lose!â€ �
â€œSend a message for hope !
Send a message by voting for Hillary Clinton!â€ � Obama closes .
â€œSend a message about who we are as the American people , and make our kids proud!â€ � â€œLetâ€ ™ s get to work!â€ � President Barack Obama turns his attention to national security , often seen in polling at Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s strongest quality among voters , deriding the notion that Trump would be a safer commander - in - chief than Hillary Clinton .
â€œIf youâ€ ™
re concerned about whoâ€ ™ s gon na keep you and your family safe in a dangerous world
, the choice is even clearer , â€ � Obama says , and
â€œsheâ€ ™ ll do it without resorting to torture , or banning entire religions from our country.â€ � â€œHe might be up , I guess , at 3 am , but thatâ€ ™ s tweeting insults at someone who got under his skin instead of getting a good nightâ€ ™ s sleep to do the job of being president of the United States!â€ �
â€œCome on!â€ � Obama shouts , as the audience laughs .
â€œWhen , in the middle of a debate , you threaten to put your political opponent in jail - no trial , no indictment , no lawyers - when you welcome Russian meddling in our electoral process , then youâ€ ™ re disregarding not just things like facts or evidence or a free press , but youâ€ ™ re chipping away at core values like tolerance and due process and mutual respect , â€ � Obama says .
â€œAnd our democracy doesnâ€ ™ t work that way.â€ � â€œWe have stood in contrast and in opposition to those kids of ideas , and I frankly never thought Iâ€ ™ d see the day when we have a major - party candidate who would be promoting those kinds of notions!â€ � President Obama reacts to Alex Jones : He said me and Hillary are demons .
Said we smell like sulfur .
Ainâ€ ™ t that something ?
Now , I mean , come on , people !
Democracy does not work if you just say stuff like that !
President Barack Obama , on Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s age : At 55 , itâ€ ™ s hard for me to change
- I know at 70 itâ€ ™ s gon na be harder !
President Obama , extending an olive branch to Republicans who have been no fan of his administration for the past eight years , tells the audience in Greensboro , North Carolina , that not all Republicans ( # NotAllRepublicans ? ) say or believe the things that Donald Trump does - but that heâ€ ™ s a creation of their that they need to expressly disavow .
I do not believe that every Republican official thinks the way Donald Trump does - many of them do not .
The overwhelming majority of Republicans , they love the families , they love their country , theyâ€ ™ re good and decent people doing all sorts of good things for this country .
What is true is that over the last eight , ten , however long you wanna say , if youâ€ ™ ve been only about obstruction , if in order to score political points , you tell your voter base crazy stuff like I wasnâ€ ™ t born here , or
that Iâ€ ™ m a Muslim , or thatâ€
”
well , itâ€ ™ s just a long list .
â€œAnd you repeat it over and over again , and so that your only agenda is negative and you just make up facts , â€ � Obama continues , as call - and - response â€œYeahs!â€ � echo throughout the hall , â€œover time what happens is that you produce a nominee whoâ€ ™ s all about obstruction and insults and makes up his own facts !
Now , I donâ€
™ t think thatâ€ ™ s how the majority of Republicans think , but this is the habit you get into that
creates this kind of nominee .
And now you find a situation in which the guy says stuff that nobody would find tolerable if they were applying for a job at 7/11 .
The fact that now youâ€ ™ ve got people saying , well , we strongly disapprove , we really disagree , we find those comments disgusting , but weâ€ ™ re still endorsing him , we still think he should be president , that doesnâ€ ™ t make sense to me !
Iâ€ ™ m certainly not perfect , nobodyâ€ ™ s perfect , and I too believe in forgiveness and redemption , but that doesnâ€ ™ t mean Iâ€ ™ m going to elect the person president !
â€œYou donâ€
™ t have to be a husband or a father to hear what we heard just a few days ago and say ,
â€˜Thatâ€ ™ s not right
, â€ ™ â€ � President Barack Obama says , of Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s remarks about sexually assaulting women .
â€œYou just have to be a decent human being to say , â€˜thatâ€ ™ s not right.â€ ™
And if it makes you mad , you can do something about it!â€ � â€œNobody fully understands - including me - the jobs and demands of this job until youâ€ ™ ve sat behind this desk ,
â€ � Obama continues .
â€œThe buck stops here !
And so , like , tweeting doesnâ€ ™ t qualify you .
Soundbites donâ€ ™ t qualify you .
Insults certainly donâ€ ™ t qualify you .
Nobody can fully know what itâ€ ™ s like to manage a global crisis , or know the feeling of sending a young person into war , but I tell you , nobodyâ€ ™ s been closer to those decisions than Hillary.â€ � â€œShe knows what it means , she knows what it takes , â€ � Obama continues .
â€œShe understands that the decisions you make in this job mean life or death , affect soldiers and veterans and workers who need a raise or a decent retirement .
She understands that it counts for families that are trying to climb into the middle class , or stay in the middle class.â€ � â€œNo matter how daunting the odds , or how many times she gets knocked down , she doesnâ€ ™ t point fingers or throw blame ,
she doesnâ€ ™ t
say the system is rigged
, she doesnâ€
™ t check her mic ,
â€ � he says , tapping the microphone .
â€œShe is qualified to be president of the United States of America.â€ � President Barack Obama , woke AF : You donâ€ ™ t have to be a husband or a father to hear what we heard just a few days ago and say ,
â€˜Thatâ€ ™ s not right.â€ ™
You just have to be a decent human being to say , â€˜thatâ€ ™ s not right.â€ ™ Speaking at a raucous rally in Greensboro , North Carolina , President Barack Obama outlines the progressive victories of the past eight years of his administration - and points to the threat to that agenda posed by the election of Donald Trump .
â€œI wanted to say thank you for all of the support youâ€ ™ ve given us over the years , â€ � Obama says .
â€œWhen we look back , eight years later , we fought back from the recession , our auto industry is setting new records , our businesses have turned job losses into 15 million new jobs ...
incomes are rising , poverty is falling , uninsured rate at an all - time low , across America you can marry whoever you love , brought our brave troops to our families , delivered justice to Osama bin Laden , shut down Iranâ€ ™ s nuclear weapons program , opened a new chapter with the people of Cuba ...
no wonder Iâ€ ™ ve gone grey , â€˜cause weâ€ ™ ve been busy !
Weâ€ ™ ve been busy!â€
�
â€œThatâ€ ™ s why Iâ€ ™ ve got all this grey hair !
Iâ€ ™ ve been busy!â€
�
Obama continues , the crowd eating it up .
â€œBut Michelle says I still look good.â€ �
â€œBut I am telling you , Greensboro , all that press goes out the window if we donâ€ ™ t make the right choice just four weeks from today .
The closer we get , the clearer the choice becomes , â€ � Obama continues .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve got a choice right now between somebody who is as qualified as anybody who has ever run for the White House , and somebody who has proven over and over again that he is unfit to represent this county.â€ � â€œHe doesnâ€ ™ t have the temperament or the knowledge or apparently the inclination to obtain the knowledgeâ€ � to serve as president , Obama says , â€œand that was before we knew about his attitudes towards women!â€
� Watch
it live here :
Former House speaker John Boehner has declared that while Donald Trump is â€œnot a conservative , heâ€ ™ s barely a Republican , â€ � he still plans to vote for him :
Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s lead over Republican rival Donald Trump has widened to 8 points among likely voters less than a month before Election Day , according to a new Reuters / Ipsos poll that shows one in five Republicans hold the opinion that Trumpâ€ ™ s predatory remarks about sexually assaulting women disqualify him from holding office .
The survey , which was conducted after news of Trumpâ€ ™ s remarks to Access Hollywood in 2005 as well as after the second of three presidential debates between the two candidates , unhelpfully declines to include the specific percentages of likely voters supporting either candidate , other than stating that Clintonâ€ ™ s lead has extended from a 5-point lead the last time the survey was conducted .
( Thanks , guys ! )
According to voters who watched at least part of the second presidential debate , 53 % said that Clinton won , while only 32 % saw Trump as the winner - surely information that Trump will take into account the next time he tweets that every poll taken after the debate showed him winning by massive margins .
According to the poll , 42 % of American adults - and 19 % of Republicans - find that Trumpâ€ ™ s comments in 2005 , in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women and being able to get away with it by virtue of his fame , believe that Trumpâ€ ™ s remarks disqualify him from the presidency .
Hillary Clinton has wished her Jewish supporters an easy fast as Yom Kippur begins at sundown : Jake Tapper is about three more news cycles away from striking a panelist .
Breitbart News , the far - right website that has become a functional extension of Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential campaign , reportedly merged certain editorial operations with the Republican nomineeâ€ ™ s presidential campaign a year before its executive chair joined the campaign as its CEO , according to a report from the Daily Beast .

closest advisors , wrote in an email sent on August 30 , 2015 to a former writing partner .
When asked if it was true , Bannon responded : â€œDonâ€ ™ t u ever read breitbart -- its trump central.â€

Bannon then lauded Trump as â€œa nationalist who embraces [ Sen. Jeff Sessionsâ€ ™ s ] immigration
planâ€ � as the reason the site became â€œTrump central.â€

The repercussions were swift following last Fridayâ€ ™ s leak of the Access Hollywood tape , in which Donald Trump can be heard bragging about sexually assaulting women : House speaker Paul Ryan told fellow Republicans that he would no longer defend the partyâ€ ™ s nominee , while hordes of party members distanced themselves from Trumpâ€ ™ s comments with some â€ “ including Senator John McCain â€ “ even saying they could no longer vote for Trump .
Supposedly , things could get even worse for the Republican nominee .
Following the release of the footage by the Washington Post , Bill Pruitt , a producer on the first two seasons of The Apprentice , the NBC reality show Trump hosted from 2004 - 2015 , tweeted that there are â€œfar worseâ€ � behind - the - scenes tapes of Trump on the program .
Emmy award - winning producer Chris Nee hasalleged that Trump says the n - word in the recordings .
In light of the allegations , Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer studios , which owns the rights to the show , and The Apprentice creator Mark Burnett are facing mounting pressure to make public the footage .
But on Monday , MGM and Burnett said in a joint statement to the Guardian , that they do â€œnot have the ability nor the rightâ€ � to release the material , citing â€œvarious contractual and legal requirementsâ€ � .
MGM and Burnett also refuted allegations that staffers have been threatened with legal action for releasing the outtakes , stating that : â€œthe recent claims that Mark Burnett has threatened anyone with litigation if they were to leak such material are completely and unequivocally false.â€ � Burnett â€œhas consistently supported Democratic campaignsâ€ � , the statement said .
In past presidential cycles , he has been a prominent donor to Democratic candidates and the Democratic National Committee .
But leaking The Apprentice tapes comes for an alleged asking price of $ 5.1 m â€ “ needed to cover the potential penalty fee for breaking Burnettâ€ ™ s non - disclosure agreement .
Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign is officially using Kate McKinnonâ€ ™ s portrayal of the candidate as part of its communications strategy : The 2016 campaign has jumped the shark .
Specifically , the shark from Jaws .
In a conversation with Fox News host Megyn Kelly , former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee declared that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump may be rough around the edges , but when the chips are down , heâ€
™ s the person you can trust to save your life - not unlike Captain Quint in the film Jaws .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s like Captain Quint in the original movie Jaws , â€ � said Huckabee .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s vulgar , heâ€
™ s
salty , he might even get drunk ...
But hold on here : heâ€
™ s the guy whoâ€ ™ s gon na save your butt and save your family .
And so , at the end of the day , when he kills the shark , youâ€ ™ re happy about it.â€ � Huckabee , who has long been a critic of American popular culture , continued with the analogy .
â€œNow , Hillary is the shark , â€ �
Huckabee said .
â€œSheâ€
™ s going to eat your boat , sheâ€ ™ s gon na have open borders , immigration out the kazoo , and so the choice is , do you vote for Captain Quint , whoâ€ ™ s gon na save your family , or do you vote for the shark ?
Thatâ€ ™ s the choice you get to make.â€
� Kelly , clearly a scholar of summer blockbusters , burst Huckabeeâ€ ™ s bubble by reminding the former governor that Quint was devoured by the shark .
â€œNow , governor , I hate to be the one to tell you this , â€ � said Kelly .
â€œCaptain Quint got eaten by the shark.â€ �
â€œBut he died saving the other people!â€ � Huckabee protested , laughing .
â€œBut he died!â€ � Kelly said .
â€œWent down in flames and the shark won as between the two of them!â€ � Huckabee continued , despite the blow to his theory .
â€œThe shark didnâ€ ™ t win !
The shark got blown up !
Look , any analogy can fall apart , Megyn , â€ �
Huckabee said , laughing .
â€œCome on , work with me!â€ �
Kelly rounded out the segment by singing Quintâ€ ™ s song from the film , Fairwell And Adieu to You Fair Spanish Ladies , because this campaign needs at least a little levity .
Actor Richard Dreyfuss , who starred as Hooper , the dreamy oceonographer , in the film , backed up Kellyâ€ ™ s assertion on Twitter :
Former vice president Al Gore reminds the audience in Miami that he knows better than anyone the importance of a vote in Florida - and encourages them to not let that opportunity go to waste .
â€œThe stakes in this election simply could not be higher , â€ � Gore says .
â€œHonestly , to those of you here and to those who can hear my voice by whatever means , this election really matters .
The world is on the cusp of either building on the progress of solving the climate crisis , or stepping back , washing our hands of americas traditional role of a leader in the world ...
the choice is that clear .
Itâ€ ™ s that stark.â€
�
Pounding the lectern , Gore reminds the audience of his 500-odd vote loss in the 2000 presidential election that ended up delivering the presidency to Republican rival George W. Bush .
â€œPlease take it from me - every single vote counts !
Every single vote counts!â€ � Gore shouts .
â€œIf you are not registered to vote , do so today !
If you are on the fence about whether to vote , remember what is at stake in this election , and if you think your vote does not matter , take it from me : your vote can make all of the difference in this election !
Vote early !
And donâ€ ™ t let your friends sit this election out.â€ � Returning to the main theme of the event - climate change , Gore lauds Hillary Clinton as a leader â€œwho gets it , who cares about it , whoâ€ ™ s internalized it , whoâ€ ™ s passionate about it.â€ � â€œThatâ€ ™ s why I am here and thatâ€ ™ s why I will vote for Hillary Clinton!â€ �
Gore says .
â€œI know that my vote counts , I know that your vote counts , I hope you will consider carefully the future in making your decision this November.â€ � â€œTogether , we have the opportunity to look back on this year as a time when our national finally chose to answer the alarm bells on the climate crisis , and went into action to solve it .
I know that there are still some who doubt in their hearts that we as human beings and we as Americans have the ability to bring about such a big and important change ...
the will to change and build a brighter future is itself a reusable resource!â€ �
The last line of Goreâ€ ™ s speech is wildly popular - not least of all , with Clinton herself .
â€œThatâ€
™ s a great line
- I love that!â€ � Clinton shouts .
Al Gore , speaking to a slightly listless crowd in Miami , is lauding Hillary Clinton as the candidate who will help turn the United States into a â€œrenewable - energy superpower.â€ �
â€œThe Paris Agreement is a big deal , â€ � Gore elaborates .
â€œIt is by far the biggest step forward the world has ever taken to solve the climate crisis .
Every nation in the world , virtually ... agreed to phase out these greenhouse - gas emissions and go to net - zero emissions in the second half of this century.â€ �
â€œThe question in this election , â€ �
Gore continues , â€œis which of these candidates is going to continue this progress .
With Hillary Clinton weâ€ ™ ll build under the progress made by President Obama , and she will seize the opportunities.â€ � â€œItâ€ ™ s already creating millions of jobs , and it continues to get cheaper and cheaper every single week - world records are being broken.â€ � Al Gore , speaking in Miami , warns the audience that the warming of the Atlantic Ocean presents a clear and present danger to the state of Florida - and its residents .
â€œJust in the last year , we have seen one - in - a - thousand - year downpours , â€ �
Gore says .
â€œThis is not normal - it is becoming the new normal , which is now a set of conditions that we have created with all of this man - made global warming pollution.â€ � â€œEvery vertical inch of sea - level rise means four - to - eight feet of water going inwardâ€
� during storm surges and high tides , Gore continues .
â€œJust yesterday , there were six more cases of Zika in Dade County ... but the changing climate conditions change the places where these tropical diseases become endemic and put down roots!â€ � â€œThese any many other consequences , â€ � Gore continues , â€œare really wake - up calls for us .
Mother Nature is giving us a very clear and powerful message : we can not continue putting 110 m tons of global - warming pollution into the atmosphere like itâ€ ™ s an open sewer .
Weâ€ ™ ve got to wake up.â€
�
Speaking to a raucous crowd of Hillary Clinton supporters in Miami after an extended speech on the issue of climate change , former vice president Al Gore tells the audience that â€œwhen it comes to the most urgent issue facing our country and the world , the choice in this election is extremely clea : HC will make solving the climate crisis a top national priority.â€ � â€œHer opponent , based upon the ideas that he has presented , will take us toward a climate catastrophe , â€ �
Gore says .
â€œThe climate crisis is and must be considered a top national priory , and
a top global priority.â€ �
â€œFor those of you who are younger than 25 , you might not remember the election of 2000 , and what happened here in Florida and across the country , â€ �
Gore , who lost Florida and the election in 2000 , tells the audience to scattered boos and chants of â€œYOU WON!â€ � â€œHereâ€ ™ s my point : I donâ€
™ t want you to be in a position years from now where you welcome Hillary Clinton and say â€˜actually , you did win , it just wasnâ€ ™ t close enough to make sure that all the votes were counted , â€ � Gore says .
â€œElections have consequences !
Your vote counts !
Your vote has consequences!â€ �
After being introduced by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton as the single most influential person regarding the issue of climate change , former vice president Al Gore takes the stage in Miami .
Watch it live here :
Patrick Murphy , the Florida Democrat challenging Marco Rubio for his seat in the US Senate , has unloaded on his rival and Donald Trump during his warm - up speech for Clinton and Al Gore in Miami , at which climate change will be the topic of the day .
â€œI grew up on Floridaâ€ ™ s coast , I could swim before I could walk , I could fish before I could talk ,
â€ � he told an appreciative crowd .
â€œFloridians donâ€ ™ t need to be told about the effects of climate change , weâ€ ™ re seeing it first hand .
With the future of the environment on the line , who are the Republicans trying to elect ?
Donald Trump and Marco Rubio .
Weâ€ ™ re not going to protect our waterways with Donald Trump attacking immigrants .
â€œWhen Donald Trump goes low , Marco Rubio is right there with him .
Despite overwhelming existence of the effects of climate change , Marco Rubioâ€ ™
s
quote is :
â€˜Iâ€ ™ m not a scientist.â€ ™ High tides are flooding the streets of Miami Beach and still he refuses to act .
Climate change is real and we need to act.â€ � Press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters that the United States would respond to Russian hacking of the DNC and other hacking .
The intelligence community announced last week that it believed Russia was behind hacking of the Democrats which appears to extend to the hacking of Clinton campaign officials feeding the current Wikileaks dump .
â€œWe obviously will ensure that our response is proportional , â€ � Earnest said , according to a pool report .
â€œIt is unlikely that our response would be announced in advance.â€ �
â€œThe president has talked before about the significant capabilities that the US government has to both defend our systems in the United States but also carry out offensive operations in other countries ...
So there are a range of responses that are available to the president and he will consider a response that is proportional.â€ �
Hereâ€ ™ s a breath of fresh air in the 2016 election cycle :
former vice president Al Gore is about to take the stage in Miami with Hillary Clinton .
Live video stream here :
Barack Obama is scheduled to rally voters on behalf of Hillary Clinton in Greensboro , North Carolina , this evening .
He has just landed outside the city .
Aboard the flight , press secretary Josh Earnest said of Trumpâ€ ™ s hot mic remarks , â€œthose statements consisted of sexual assault , â€ � according to a pool report .
Update : hereâ€ ™ s a transcription of Earnestâ€ ™ s remarks : â€œThe president found the tape as repugnant as most Americans didâ€ � .
â€œThere has been a pretty clear statement by people all along the ideological spectrum that those statements consisted sexual assault.â€ � â€œThatâ€ ™ s why many people I believe have concluded that those statements are worthy of sharp condemnation.â€ �
For the latest on Billy Bush , Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s bus buddy , read CNNâ€ ™ s Brian Stelter :
How is Billy Bush related to the other Bushes ?
His father is a younger brother to George HW Bush .
That makes Billy first cousins with Jeb and George W.
The NBC / WSJ poll , which yesterday released numbers for a survey ending before the second debate , has released new numbers taking in the debate .
The poll has Clinton up 10 points on Trump , 50 - 40 , in a head - to - head matchup .
She leads in the poll by nine points in a four - way race : Wikileaks has released a third tranche of John Podesta emails â€ “ the veracity of which the Clinton campaign has not denied â€
“ revealing discussion inside the campaign about how to adapt to Bernie Sanders , how to walk back Clintonâ€ ™ s comments about Aids at Nancy Reaganâ€ ™ s funeral , how to describe â€œeveryday Americansâ€ � and other topics .
Search the Wikileaks emails on the Wikileaks web site here .
The Clinton camp wrestled with Sandersâ€ ™ rise .
â€œMessage needs to be more positive , upbeat , hopeful .
Bernie is saying we can change the world , â€ � an adviser wrote to Podesta , the campaign chairman , at one point .
After Sanders won big in the February New Hampshire primary , the Clinton team discussed its strategy for the upcoming states of South Carolina and Nevada .
In Nevada , an adviser wrote , â€œOur biggest concern is enthusiasm and caucus knowledge .
Sanders supporters are more likely to know the ins and outs of the caucus .
To mitigate this , in the upcoming days our field team is focusing on caucus education among our supporters.â€ �
In South Carolina , the same adviser , Elan Kriegel , noted : â€œLike
Nevada , our support is particularly high with people of color and we are roughly tied with white voters .
The difference between the states is that far more African - American voters will participate in South Carolina than Nevada.â€ �
The campaign had lengthy discussions over how to retract and apologize for Clintonâ€ ™ s assertion at Nancy Reaganâ€ ™ s funeral that the former first lady had â€œstarted
a national conversationâ€ � about HIV / Aids â€œwhen
before nobody would talk about it.â€ �
The Reagans did not acknowledge the epidemic as it unfolded .
On a separate email chain , aides discuss whether the phrase â€œeveryday Americansâ€ � should be in a Clinton speech in New Hampshire about small business .
A draft of the speech had Clinton saying : Iâ€ ™ m running for President because you and Americans everywhere need a champion .
And I want to be that champion .
At which Podesta weighed in : I know she has begun to hate everyday Americans , but I think we should use it once the first time she says Iâ€ ™ m running for president because you and everyday Americans need a champion .
I think if she doesnâ€ ™ t say it once , people will notice and say we false started in Iowa .
Do you notice how Podesta did not place the phrase â€œeveryday Americansâ€ � in quotes in his email ?
So have a lot of Trump supporters , who are asserting that the email is a smoking gun proving that Hillary Clinton has begun to hate everyday Americans , which it isnâ€ ™ t .
On a separate email chain , then - DNC vice chair and CNN commentator Donna Brazile shares in advance a question about the death penalty that Clinton might face at a CNN town hall : â€œHereâ€ ™ s one that worries me about HRC ,
â€ � Brazile wrote .
Much of the emails show the campaign discussing media strategy and emailing with the media , in some cases on friendly terms .
Hereâ€ ™ s a section discussing responses to a potential Joe Biden presidential run :
And the Green Party takes offense at a Podesta email referring to Ross Perot , the Reform party nominee who ran against Bill Clinton and George HW Bush in 1992 .
After campaign manager Robby Mook suggests â€œWJC redux of 1992,â€ � Podesta replies , â€œjust need a third party spoiler and weâ€ ™ ll be all set.â€ �
â€˜Iâ€ ™ m beginning to worry about Rubioâ€ ™
The senate majority leader forecloses any discussion of his partyâ€ ™ s presidential nominee : Have you read David Brooksâ€ ™ concern - trolly column about Trump in todayâ€ ™ s New York Times ?
Hereâ€ ™ s a bit : Trump breaks his own world record for being appalling on a weekly basis , but as the campaign sinks to new low after new low , I find myself experiencing feelings of deep sadness and pity .
Imagine if you had to go through a single day without sharing kind little moments with strangers and friends .
Imagine if you had to endure a single week in a hate - filled world , crowded with enemies of your own making , the object of disgust and derision .
You would be a twisted , tortured shrivel , too , and maybe youâ€ ™
d lash out and try to take cruel revenge on the universe .
For Trump this is his whole life .

Trumpâ€ ™ s interlocutor in the â€œgrab them by the pussyâ€ � video has been suspended from the morning variety show he starred on , Today , and erased from a digital billboard outside NBCâ€ ™ s famous headquarters : Trumpâ€ ™ s spray of fire tags the Arizona senator : So add another name to this list ...
Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton now has an 11 percentage point lead over her Republican opponent Donald Trump , according to a poll released by PRRI and the Atlantic on Tuesday , writes Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi : If that werenâ€ ™ t already reason enough for Trump supporters to worry , a poll from NBC and the Wall Street Journal released on Monday put Clintonâ€ ™ s lead at 14 percentage points .
But why the difference in numbers ?
If you want to follow polls in the 28 remaining days before the US votes , I strongly recommend you ignore the date that the poll was published â€ “ and focus instead on the dates that the poll was conducted .
That PRRI / Atlantic poll was based on landline and cellphone interviews that took place October 5 - 9 while the data for the NBC / WSJ poll was gathered October 8 - 9 .
Those dates are potentially significant given that on October 8 , a 2005 recordingwas released of Trump saying that , thanks to his fame , he was able to grab women â€œby the pussyâ€ � .

: Update :
Rubioâ€ ™ s challenger for the senate seat , Representative Patrick Murphy , hits back : Bill Clinton is about to appear at a get - out - the - vote event in Belle Glade , Florida .
Hereâ€ ™ s a live video stream :
Guess which campaign is doing a better job registering voters in Florida ?
And North Carolina : Hereâ€ ™ s related reading from the New York Times :
The first wave of data from states like Florida and North Carolina shows preliminary signs that Mrs. Clinton was building a slight edge even before the revelation that Donald J. Trump had bragged about sexual assaultroiled the race .
Democrats are requesting more absentee ballots in Florida than they were at this point in 2012 , with increases of 50 percent in the heavily Hispanic areas around Miami and Orlando .
In North Carolina , where Mitt Romney built enough of a lead in early voting four years ago to edge out a victory over President Obama , Democrats are requesting mail - in ballots in larger numbers than in 2012 , while Republicansâ€ ™ participation is declining .
If Clintonâ€ ™ s ground game is as solid as it appears , and recent polling trendlines hold , and with a couple other caveats , itâ€ ™ s easy to imagine a map like this : With voter registration deadlines falling today in numerous states , the Guardian interactive team has taken a look at voter turnout in each state .

Former Fox talker Glenn Beck , an erstwhile Ted Cruz friend who has ranted about Barack Obama being a racist and compared Al Gore to Hitler , has written on Facebook that Hillary Clinton is
the â€œmoral , ethicalâ€ � choice in this election .
â€œIt is not acceptable to ask a moral , dignified man to cast his vote to help elect an immoral man who is absent decency or dignity ,
â€ �
Beck writes .
â€œIf the consequence of standing against Trump and for principles is indeed the election of Hillary Clinton , so be it .
At least it is a moral , ethical choice .
If she is elected , the world does not end ....
Once elected , Hillary can be fought ...
The alternative does not offer a moral person the same opportunity .
If one helps to elect an immoral man to the highest office , then one is merely validating his immorality , lewdness , and depravity .

Both campaigns have released new ads out today .
The Trump campaign argues that Clinton is not the right leader for these dangerous times , while the Clinton campaign uses people reading from her book â€œIt takes a villageâ€ � to appeal to Mormon voters to give her a look .
First the Trump ad .
It adds a twist to the world - is - scary campaign video trope by mixing in video of Clinton stumbling getting into her van , coughing and being helped on a staircase .
â€œOur next president faces daunting challenges in a dangerous world ...
Hillary Clinton failed every time as secretary of state , â€ � the narrator says .
â€œHillary Clinton doesnâ€ ™ t have the fortitude , strength and stamina to lead in our world.â€ �
The Clinton campaign ad , â€œWe are Mormons for Hillary , â€ � could not frame a stronger contrast .
It features sweeping shots of beautiful western landscapes and pictures kids flying kites , with a voiceover message about mutual reinforcement and the common good .
Ohio governor John Kasich , whoâ€ ™ s not # nevertrump but whoâ€ ™

Everyone is : There has been no shortage this election cycle of stories about how Paul Ryan , the top elected Republican , might un - endorse Donald Trump .
Itâ€ ™ s now 11 October â€ “ 28 days out
â€ “ and Trump is attacking Ryan highly publicly as â€œvery weak and ineffectiveâ€
� and Trump appears to be trying to crush , Stephen Bannon - style , the rest of the Republican party which is essential to Ryanâ€ ™ s life work if anything is .
And here this morning Politico has another story , based on unnamed sources , about how Ryan may un - endorse Donald Trump : Paul Ryan may not be done yet .
As thoroughly as the House speaker shocked the national political establishment Monday by saying heâ€ ™ s done with Donald Trump and itâ€ ™ s time to focus on his House majority , thereâ€ ™ s a distinct possibility Ryan will go a step further and completely yank his endorsement , sources close to him told POLITICO .
In fact , Ryan has personally been on the edge of pulling the plug but has held out because his decision is about more than just his personal feelings :
Itâ€ ™ s about saving his massive 60-seat majority .
The Wisconsin Republican is in an excruciating spot :
He feels torn between his own conscience and his obligations as the top Republican in the country , according to multiple sources in leadership familiar with the internal discussions .
Not to mention , nearly everyone in House Republican leadership believes there are more embarrassing revelations about Trump to come before Nov. 8 .
For now : Instead of embedding each new Trump tweet in its own block , weâ€ ™ ll do periodic roundups ( if he keeps going ) .
Hereâ€ ™ s volume one , including his new tweet , for posterity :
Maybe this is Trumpâ€ ™ s strategy : get the headlines away from the debate his surrogates are pushing about whether unwanted genital - touching constitutes sexual assault .
Itâ€ ™ s a distraction technique ?
Thereâ€ ™ s another possible explanation for Trumpâ€ ™ s erratic strategy : he is an erratic candidate .
Whatâ€ ™ s Trumpâ€ ™ s game here ?
Is he hoping that a spectacular split with elected Republicans will give him the votes he needs in ME-2 to tip the dominoes through New Hampshire and North Carolina which all , assuming he wins Mitt Romneyâ€ ™ s states , would give him 272 electoral votes and the presidency ( see this scenario , mapped ) ?
Or is this more a look at shackles - off Trump , a Trump who does not need state parties and polls and least of all â€œunderachievingâ€ � John Kingâ€ ™ s electoral map ?
While Trump is focused this morning on # winning by doing things his own way , his son Eric Trump is trying to make sure voters donâ€ ™ t miss registration deadlines .
Which is precisely the kind of thing that the national party infrastructure could help with .
There are indications , meanwhile , that for Republicans , the only reward for bailing on Trump now may be spiritual .
Hereâ€ ™ s Democratic pollster Nick Gourevitch :
Doesnâ€ ™ t sound that bad , for a made - for - TV movie ?
Maybe if itâ€ ™ s raining , and nothing else is on ?
Speaking of Tipper Gore , who founded and led the anti - expression group showcased in the previous blockâ€ ™

video â€ “ former vice president Al Gore , from whom Tipper separated in 2010 , is scheduled to campaign with Hillary Clinton in Miami , Florida , this afternoon .
This blog has not made it common practice to showcase the thinking of Katrina Pierson , the Trump surrogate whose controversial statements often seem to play out over in the corner while the campaign action is at midfield .
However in this case , Pierson gives voice to an argument heard elsewhere in the last 24 hours from the mouths of other prominent Trump supporters : itâ€ ™ s hypocritical to find fault with Trumpâ€ ™ s hot mic statement about grabbing genitalia without consent because , hip - hop .
Pierson :
But I do quite [ sic ] find it rich that we have Democrats and the left talking about rape culture , when theyâ€ ™ re the ones backed fully by Hollywood .
This rape culture is purported [ sic ] by none other than the entertainment industry , none other than hip - hop music , which you can hear on local radio stations .
The culture war on hip - hop is as old as rap and was preceded by fear of rock â€˜nâ€ ™ roll .

Trump :
Ryan â€˜very weak and ineffectiveâ€ ™
This morning on Twitter , Trump has attacking House speaker Paul Ryan and by extension the Republican leadership and rank and file : At least three Republicans on Ryanâ€ ™ s conference call Tuesday were quoted as objecting to what they said was the leadershipâ€ ™ s cowardice and defeatism .
Hereâ€ ™ s what Ryan is up to this morning : Republicans who break with Donald Trump may face ballot box retribution , pollster Frank Luntz points out .
( They may sense this . )
Hello and welcome to our live - wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House .
Republican officials have been tying themselves in tightening knots in an attempt to argue that touching womenâ€ ™ s genitalia without consent , as described by Donald Trump , does not constitute sexual assault .
The communications director of the Republican national committee , Sean Spicer , appears to have lied point - blank to the Washington Post last night , denying a quote that had been attributed to him in which he dodged the sexual assault question by saying : â€œIâ€ ™ m not a lawyer.â€ � Confronted with a recording of his remarks , Spicer finally admitted saying it , and released this further statement : Spicerâ€ ™ s comments follow remarks by Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway , who admonished people on Monday to quit saying â€œsexual assaultâ€
� : â€œThatâ€
™ s a very unfortunate phrase , and people really should stop using it , â€ � Conway said .
Alabama senator Jeff Sessions , meanwhile , told the conservative magazine the Weekly Standard that he wouldnâ€ ™ t characterize unwanted touching and kissing as sexual assault .
â€œI think thatâ€ ™ s a stretch , â€ � he said .

Thank you for reading and please join us in the comments ."
2016-10-30,"As Marco Rubio and Patrick Murphy squared off in the final debate of their Florida Senate race , the discussion turned to the Syrian civil war .
Rubio , a former presidential candidate and member of the Senate intelligence committee , challenged his rivalâ€ ™ s understanding of the factions on the ground .
Murphy , a two - term congressman , reverted to a familiar line .
â€œIt just goes back to the same point , â€ � he said , â€œthat Senator Rubio continues to support Donald Trump , and it is shameful that he stands there with him.â€
�
The audience laughed , faintly , at one of nearly 20 mentions of the Republican presidential nominee during the one - hour debate .
When Murphy next mentioned Trump , Rubio was quick with a rejoinder based on a famous Joe Biden rebuke of Rudy Giuliani :
â€œA noun , a verb and Donald Trump : thatâ€ ™ s his answer to everything.â€
�
The race in Florida , among the most closely watched in the country , could help determine whether Republicans keep control of the Senate .
Democrats see the vote as a referendum on Trump .
But Murphyâ€ ™ s mentions of the businessman underscored the potential limitations of using the top of the ticket to mount attacks down the ballot .
Murphy has questioned how Rubio can endorse Trump , whom Rubio has called â€œa con manâ€ � , untrustworthy with the nuclear codes , and â€œthe most vulgar person ever to aspire to the presidencyâ€ � .
In recent weeks , polls have given the Democrat hope , in part because Trump is trailing Hillary Clinton in Florida by around three points .
But with nine days left before Election Day , Rubio is about seven points up on Trump in the state .
â€˜Less than ideal choicesâ€ ™
This week , both candidates spoke to the Guardian .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve said all along that these are less than ideal choices before us , â€ � Rubio said , â€œand
thatâ€ ™ s why we need a senator willing to stand up to the next president no matter who it is â€ “ even if itâ€ ™ s from your own party.â€ �
Rubio was speaking on the day the FBI director , James Comey , said the agency was reviewing emails that might be pertinent to the closed investigation into Clintonâ€ ™ s use of a private server while secretary of state .
â€œThe question now is will Patrick Murphy still 100 % trust Hillary Clinton , as he has said in the past , â€ � he said .
Murphy , who spoke earlier in the week after appearing with Clinton at a rally in Coconut Creek , said there was no comparison between the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees .
â€œIâ€ ™ m grateful that Senator Rubioâ€ ™ s connecting me to Secretary Clinton , â€ � Murphy said .
â€œYou look at what sheâ€ ™ s been fighting for her entire life , and you contrast that to Donald Trump .
You talk about a contrast of both qualifications and temperament for who our next world leader is going to be.â€ � Citing Trumpâ€ ™ s litany of inflammatory comments â€ “ against immigrants , Muslims , women , the Gold Star parents of an Iraq war hero , prisoners of war and more â€ “ Murphy said it was â€œappalling to a lot of Floridians that Marco Rubio continues to stand by Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s
sideâ€ � .
â€œA lot of people had the courage to stand up to Donald Trump , â€ �
he added , noting the flurry of Republicans who withdrew their support earlier this month after a video was unearthed from 2005 in which the former reality TV star bragged about groping and kissing women without consent .
Rubio , despite condemning Trumpâ€ ™ s comments , was not among them .
He has kept Trump at a distance , however , making no campaign appearances with the nominee despite his frequent presence in Florida .
Rubioâ€ ™ s rationale rests primarily in the balance of the supreme court , where the vacancy left by Antonin Scalia remains .
In the primary , Rubio doubted whether Trump would nominate a conservative .
He told the Guardian a list of potential appointees released by Trump was â€œencouragingâ€ � .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ll have to wait and see who wins the election and whether heâ€ ™ ll actually do that , â€ � Rubio said .
â€œBut theyâ€ ™ ll be held to the same standard , whether itâ€ ™ s a Republican president or a Democrat president
â€ ¦ Iâ€
™ m looking for people that will apply the constitution according to the original intent of the words of the constitution.â€ � Rubio also expressed confidence that he would be judged on his own record .
Saying his opponent lacked any legislative accomplishments despite having served in Congress for four years , Rubio touted his own work on issues such as human trafficking , sanctions against Venezuela and Hezbollah , and veterans affairs .
Asked if he would be willing to work with Clinton , he stopped short of naming potential areas of agreement .
â€œI have a record of working with people across the aisle , and Iâ€ ™ ll work with anyone if theyâ€ ™ re pursuing ideas that I think are good for America , â€ �
he said .
Murphy , whose time in Congress has been been spent in the minority , denied he had little to show .
He listed funding for the Everglades , preventing cuts to a key component of Medicare , and securing lower flood insurance rates , and stated his commitment to issues such as climate change , equal pay and raising the minimum wage .
He has nonetheless struggled with a lack of name recognition , compounded by limited resources after national Democratic groups withdrew millions of dollars in reserved ad spending .
The decision has drawn criticism from some observers , for its apparent abandonment of a race many believe is winnable .
Others complain of a missed opportunity to deliver a fatal blow to Rubio , whom many believe will make another run for the presidency , potentially challenging Clinton in 2020 .
But some involved in Democratsâ€ ™ efforts to retake the Senate defended their move , citing Floridaâ€ ™ s expensive media markets in comparison to battlegrounds such as Indiana , Missouri , and North Carolina , where money can prove more influential .
â€œI do think the threat of him running for president in 2020 is real , â€ � a Senate Democratic strategist said of Rubio .
â€œBut our goal is to take back the Senate and win the White House right now .
Weâ€
™ re not running a campaign for 2020.â€ �
â€˜The height of cynicismâ€ ™
Another Democratic strategist familiar with the Florida Senate race said internal polling conducted by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Clinton campaign showed Murphy trailing Rubio by high single digits .
On Thursday , FiveThirtyEight gave Rubio an 81 % chance of defeating Murphy , finding the sitting senator ahead in 48 of 50 public polls .
On Sunday , two new polls showed Rubio up by eight and nine points .
Pressure to reinvest in the race did pay some dividends last week , when a Super Pac affiliated with Senate minority leader Harry Reid confirmed it was transferring a seven - figure sum to a pro - Murphy super pac in Florida .
Nonetheless , Murphy has largely had to rely on earned media coverage and high - profile surrogates .
Among the most vocal has been Barack Obama , who called Rubioâ€ ™ s support for Trump â€œthe height of cynicismâ€ � .
â€œHow can you call him a â€˜con
artistâ€ ™ and â€˜dangerousâ€ ™ and object to all the controversial things he says and then say , â€˜But
Iâ€ ™ m still gon na vote for him?â€ ™ Câ€ ™ mon , man!â€
�
Obama said at a campaign stop in Miami Gardens .
â€œThatâ€
™ s the sign of somebody who will say anything
, do anything , pretend to be anybody , just to get elected .
And you know what ?
If youâ€ ™ re willing to be anybody just to be somebody , then you donâ€ ™ t have the leadership that Florida needs in the United States Senate.â€ � Clinton has also urged voters to back Murphy and made a familiar connection : â€œUnlike his opponent , Patrick Murphy has not been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump and his dangerous , divisive campaign.â€ � Such high - profile support , however , may prove too little , too late .
For one thing , Rubio has a solid base of support among Hispanic voters , many of whom identify with the Spanish - speaking son of Cuban immigrants and in 2012 accounted for 17 % of Floridaâ€ ™ s electorate .
Murphy ramped up his outreach to the Hispanic community â€ “ somewhat belatedly , some say .
In doing so , he sought to revive Rubioâ€ ™ s involvement in a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013 , noting that the senator backed away from the issue when faced with backlash from conservatives .
It has been an uphill battle .
In Miamiâ€ ™ s Little Havana recently , at one of Clintonâ€ ™ s 81 Florida field offices , volunteers labored to get out the vote .
Dozens of voters , mostly Latino , entered and left the building .
Among them were Azalia and Lucia Rodriguez .
Originally from Nicaragua , they were motivated in part by resentment of Trump and said they would vote for Clinton .
They did not support Rubio , they said .
But they also did not plan to vote for Murphy .
Their reason ?
They hadnâ€ ™ t heard of him ."
2016-11-01,"What do Rosie Oâ€ ™ Donnell , Serge Kovaleski , Megyn Kelly , John McCain , Jeb Bush , Marco Rubio , Ted Cruz , Gonzalo Curiel , Khizr Khan and Alicia Machado have in common ?
All have been on the receiving end of Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s insults as the businessman spent more than a year pursuing futile feuds that may go a long way toward costing him the White House .
A chorus of hands slapping against Republican foreheads was almost audible each time the nominee threw off any pretence of self - discipline and lashed out , distracting onlookers from his efforts to present himself as moderate or exploit Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s weaknesses .
This week they are doubtless praying that he doesnâ€ ™ t squander the golden opportunity presented by the FBIâ€ ™ s investigation into a new batch of emails that may be related to Clintonâ€ ™ s private server .
â€œTrump is on the verge of blowing it , â€ �
Ari Fleischer , former White House press secretary , tweeted on 30 September .
â€œFree advice : Focus on Hillary .
No one else .
Hillary is your opponent .
No one else is.â€ �
For William Cohen , a former defence secretary and Republican senator for Maine , the breaking point came in July last year .
Soon after launching his presidential campaign , Trump said of the Arizona senator and former Vietnam prisoner of war John McCain :
â€œHeâ€ ™ s not a war hero .
Heâ€ ™ s a war hero because he was captured .
I like people who werenâ€ ™ t captured.â€ �
It later emerged that Trump had been granted four education draft deferments and one medical .
The latter was due to bone spurs in his heels .
Cohen , who was McCainâ€ ™ s best man , recalled : â€œI was outraged about it .
To this day John McCain canâ€ ™ t lift his arm to shoulder level .
To say that about what he went through being tortured , his sense of patriotism , from a man who avoided the draft with a bone spur ?
No , I donâ€
™ t think so .
It turned me immediately.â€
�
Then there was the Republican primary in which Trump dismissed rivals as â€œlow energyâ€ � Jeb Bush , â€œLittleâ€ �
Marco Rubio and â€œLyinâ€ ™
â€ � Ted Cruz .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s gone out of his way to demean , degrade , denigrate and delegitimise , â€ � Cohen said , â€œall the Ds you can think of .
I think that gives you real insight into the manâ€ ™ s character.â€ � Cohen , 76 , now heads a business advisory firm .
He added : â€œItâ€ ™ s unheard of in my lifetime to see anyone engaged in this vulgarity and crudity of language and attitude .
What weâ€ ™ ve seen is something pretty horrific in our political system that Iâ€ ™ ve never seen before and I hope Iâ€ ™ ll never see again.â€ �
The McCain incident also weighed heavily on Republican strategist Rick Wilson , despite his own past clashes with the 2008 presidential nominee .
â€œBut the most outrageous and revealing thing , â€ � he said , â€œwas the attack on the Khan family and the continued attacks from his supporters.â€ � Khizr Khan , whose son , an American Muslim , was killed in Iraq , denounced Trump at the Democratic national convention in July , while brandishing a copy of the US constitution .
Trump criticised the Gold Star family while claiming that he too had made sacrifices as a businessman , triggering a wave of revulsion .
Wilson continued : â€œThe list of people heâ€ ™ s insulted is long and distinguished .
There are no boundaries on this guy about who heâ€ ™ s going to offend .
Heâ€ ™ s angry at everybody and acts in a way that reflects his poor impulse control .
Heâ€ ™ s basically inhumane .
â€œPolitics is a tough game and we have elbows out but there are certain lanes we try not to play out of .
Iâ€ ™ m one of the toughest
but I leave children out of it .
Iâ€
™ m astonished at what heâ€ ™ s gotten away with.â€ �
According to a running total compiled by the New York Times , Trump has insulted 279 people , places and things on Twitter alone .
Republicans were ultimately forced to conclude that Trump would be Trump , a 70-year - old man who can not change and has no intention of doing so .
They will never know if staying â€œon messageâ€ � might have left him running far closer in the polls .
â€˜The straw that broke the camelâ€ ™ s backâ€ ™ Rich Galen , once press secretary to vice - president Dan Quayle , said his patience ran out in July when the nominee claimed that Gonzalo Curiel , a judge who was born in Indiana , was biased against him in a civil case over Trump University because his parents were from Mexico .
â€œThat was antithetical to everything Iâ€ ™ ve worked for in public life ,
â€ �
Galen said .
â€œIt looks like the actual turning point was the Miss Universe woman , which not only offended women but they told their husbands they should be offended too .
Itâ€ ™ s one thing to diss John McCain but
heâ€ ™ s a big boy and can look after himself .
When he went after a woman over an image problem , that would unite 90 % of women and men and was the straw that broke the camelâ€ ™ s back.â€ � Machado won the Miss Universe pageant in 1996 .
Clinton brought up the largely forgotten case at the end of the first presidential debate , saying Trump had called her â€œMiss Piggyâ€ � and , because she is Latina , â€œMiss Housekeepingâ€ � .
To the dismay of his party , Trump took the bait and talked about Machado for days , telling Fox News : â€œShe gained a massive amount of weight , and it was a real problem.â€ � â€œHe sees the entire universe in terms of how it affects him , â€ �
Galen said .
â€œHe simply doesnâ€ ™ t have the temperament to be president of the United States .
He figured out what the country had been mad about ; he was the wrong messenger for the right message.â€ �
Trump accused Mexican immigrants of being â€œrapistsâ€ � , drug traffickers and criminals at his campaign launch in June 2015 .
He said Fox News presenter
Megyn Kelly had â€œblood coming out of her whereverâ€ � .
He mocked Kovaleski , a New York Times reporter who has a congenital joint condition .
When a videotape came to light in which Trump boasted about groping women , and then several women came forward to accuse him of sexual assault , he did what he always does : he picked a fight with his accusers and the media that reported their claims .
Trumpâ€ ™ s outlandish statements have stunned Republican party grandees .
William Brock , 85 , a former chair of the Republican National Committee who served under Ronald Reagan as US trade representative and secretary of labor , criticised him for attacking both politicians , who are fair game , and civilians , who are not .
â€œThere has not been a distance drawn between individuals not involved in politics
â€
“ Rosie Oâ€ ™ Donnell , the Khan family â€ “ and the Obamas , the McCains , the Clintons , which are a part of his core message and tend to reinforce what his supporters want , â€ � Brock said .
â€œThere has been an unwillingness or inability to choose the targets that really would validate his message rather than just what pops up at that moment.â€ � Brock is no fan of Clinton and feels she has made insults of her own .
â€œThe thing thatâ€ ™
s troubling about the Trump support base , â€ � he said , â€œis
itâ€
™ s almost they donâ€
™ t exist to much of Washington .
When Clinton said theyâ€ ™ re deplorable , thatâ€ ™ s a judgment thatâ€ ™ s unethical and wrong.â€ �
Given Clintonâ€ ™ s high unpopularity rating , and the current flare up around the FBIâ€ ™ s probe into whether she mishandled classified information as secretary of state , a conventional Republican in a conventional year might have fared well against her .
Republican consultant James Harris believes that if he had managed to avoid all his gaffes , Trump would be leading in the polls .
It is a case of what might have been .
â€œBut for Trumpâ€ ™ s comments and self - inflicted wounds and random tangents , â€ � he said , â€œhe would be tied or up a point or two in Florida , Ohio , North Carolina , Nevada .
â€œIf you look at wage stagnation in those states , they want change , but he is not articulating a vision of change .
Voters are worried about the future direction of the country but weâ€ ™ re talking about Miss Universe .
Who gives a ratâ€ ™ s ass about that?â€ �"
2016-11-08,"The 2016 Republican primary was supposed to be an embarrassment of riches for the GOP .
In contrast to 2012 , the Republican party was set to feature a slew of young , articulate conservative superstars fighting it out for the nomination .
The only question was whether it would be the year of a tough - as - nails union - busting Wisconsin governor ( Scott Walker ) , an inspiring Florida senator ( Marco Rubio ) , an ideological Texas firebrand ( Ted Cruz ) , or perhaps an Oxford - educated policy wonk from the Bayou ( former governor Bobby Jindal ) .
Or , maybe , one of the more seasoned former conservative governors would win the day , such as Floridaâ€ ™ s Jeb Bush or Texasâ€ ™ s Rick Perry .
But such hopes were dashed on 16 June 2015 when one Donald J Trump took what he now calls the â€œfamous escalator rideâ€ � down Trump Tower to announce his candidacy .
The establishment immediately mocked him .
But he went on to shock them .
Over the next 11 months , the ideologically malleable alleged billionaire browbeat his way to the Republican nomination .
He tagged his opponents as too low energy ( Bush ) , too dishonest ( Cruz ) and too little and sweaty ( Rubio ) for the Oval Office .
He would allow nothing to stand in his way â€ “ certainly not the truth â€ “ in his quest for the Republican nomination .
To evangelicals , the thrice - married New Yorker with a potty mouth that made even Howard Stern blush pretended to be a committed Christian , even declaring that the reason the IRS was auditing his tax returns was probably because of his religious devotion .
To immigration hawks , he pledged to deport each and every illegal immigrant in the country , even though he said after the 2012 election that the reason Mitt Romney lost was because of his harsh stand on immigration .
But Trump didnâ€ ™ t win the Republican nomination because of his policy positions .
He won because of his personality and brand .
For nearly four decades , he painted himself as the worldâ€ ™ s greatest businessman .
Trumpâ€ ™ s
lifelong marketing scheme got a boost from Hollywood in 2004 when he was cast as the star of the NBC reality TV show The Apprentice , where he flaunted his executive authority each week in front of millions .
Trump was at his best when he wasnâ€ ™ t talking specifics .
He promised to make all Americaâ€ ™ s problems go away , to make America great again , if Americans just put their faith in him .
He was the strongman who was going to make everything OK if you just trusted him and didnâ€ ™ t ask questions .
And it worked in the Republican primary .
But the nomination fight revealed much more about Trumpâ€ ™ s Republican opponents and the Republican electorate than it did about Trump .
To those who cared to look , it was well known before Trump ever entered the presidential race that he was a dishonest lout whose business success was far less than claimed .
But Trumpâ€ ™ s presence in the race revealed that the supposed GOP superstars were too weak to stand up to the charlatan in their midst .
As for the Republican primary electorate , we learned that perhaps they donâ€ ™ t care so much about conservative principles after all â€ “ that the conservative movement may be nothing more than a collection of magazine offices and think tanks in Manhattan and Washington , DC .
No true believer in conservative principles could ever get behind Donald Trump .
In winning the Republican nomination , Donald Trump may have destroyed the Republican party and drastically set back the conservative movement .
His anti - immigrant vitriol , his mainstreaming of conspiracy theories , his portrayal of American exceptionalism as an arrogant concept , his anti - women invective and , yes , his occasional racism will taint the Republican party for the foreseeable future .
Well , it will taint the Republican party if it lasts .
But that remains an open question .
The odds are Hillary Clinton will win , and the question will then be : what will become of the Republican party ?
Will the # NeverTrump wing and the Always Trump forces come together ?
Or will a civil war break out , ultimately tearing the party it apart ?
The GOP should have been ascendant this election cycle .
Instead , it lies in ruins , all thanks to Donald Trump .
Heâ€
™ s the man of the hour , exactly as he would want it to be ."
2016-11-17,"US senators have called for a travel ban and asset freeze for Chinese officials who abducted five Hong Kong booksellers in 2015 , amid fears that Donald Trump will turn a blind eye to Chinese human rights abuses in a bid to improve relations with Beijing .
Last year five book publishers based in Hong Kong were detained by Chinese authorities and held incommunicado for months , with two abducted from Thailand and Hong Kong .
Legislation introduced by Senators Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton would require the US president to list those responsible for â€œthe surveillance , abduction , detention , or forced confessionsâ€ � of the book publishers , freeze any US - based assets and deny them entry to the US .
â€œIn recent years Beijing has consistently undermined the â€˜one country , two systemsâ€ ™ principle and infringed on the democratic freedoms of the residents of Hong Kong , â€ �
Rubio said in a statement .
â€œIt is critical in the days ahead that the democratic aspirations of the people of Hong Kong be a vital US interest and foreign policy priority.â€
�
The bill would also require the US secretary of state to issue a yearly report on Hong Kong .
However the current legislative session is almost over , making it unlikely the bill will be passed .
When the UK handed the territory to China , Hong Kong was allowed under the â€œone country , two systemsâ€ � framework to keep freedoms not available on the mainland .
Rubio introduced the legislation after meeting with democracy activist Joshua Wong , who led 79 days of street protests against the Chinese government in 2014 .
The 20-year - old chairman of a Hong Kong political party spoke at an event organised by the US congressional - executive commission on China .
Wong said : â€œBeing a businessman I hope Donald Trump could know the dynamics in Hong Kong and know that to maintain the business sector benefits in Hong Kong , itâ€ ™ s necessary to fully support human rights in Hong Kong to maintain the judicial independence and the rule of law.â€ �
He added the international community had a moral responsibility to Hong Kong .
Human rights activists in China and the US fear Trump will cast aside the interests of pro - democracy activists and human rights campaigners in a bid to seal what some think could be a historic rapprochement with Beijing .
Rubio also slammed a ruling by Hong Kongâ€ ™ s high court to ban two elected lawmakers from taking office after they staged a protest during a swearing - in ceremony .
â€œChinaâ€ ™ s assault on democratic institutions and human rights is of central importance to the people of Hong Kong and to its status as a free market , economic powerhouse and hub for international trade and investment , â€ � Rubio said ."
2017-01-04,"Three Republican senators have introduced legislation to recognise Jerusalem as Israelâ€ ™ s official capital and move the US embassy there from Tel Aviv , a plan backed by Donald Trump but likely to ignite fierce protests .
After being sworn into the 115th Congress in Washington , Ted Cruz of Texas , Dean Heller of Nevada and Marco Rubio of Florida unveiled the Jerusalem Embassy and Recognition Act .
Similar moves by Republican majorities over the past two decades have come to nought , but this time they have a sympathetic president - elect in Trump .
He has repeatedly pledged to relocate the embassy to Jerusalem and nominated a US ambassador who shares that view .
Critics warn that the move could unleash a wave of violence and further rattle the Israel - Palestine peace process and the future of a two - state solution .
Cruz , runner - up to Trump in the Republican presidential primary , said on Tuesday : â€œJerusalem is the eternal and undivided capital of Israel .
Unfortunately , the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s vendetta against the Jewish state has been so vicious that to even utter this simple truth â€
“ let alone the reality that Jerusalem is the appropriate venue for the American embassy in Israel â€ “ is shocking in some circles .
â€œBut it is finally time to cut through the double - speak and broken promises and do what Congress said we should do in 1995 : formally move our embassy to the capital of our great ally Israel.â€
�
A statement from Heller said that some state department funds would be withheld until the embassy was relocated .
He said : â€œFor years , Iâ€ ™ ve advocated for Americaâ€ ™ s need to reaffirm its support for one of our nationâ€ ™ s strongest allies by recognising Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel .
â€œIt honors an important promise America made more than two decades ago but has yet to fulfill .
While administrations come and go , the lasting strength of our partnership with one of our strongest allies in the Middle East continues to endure .
Rubio added : â€œJerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish state of Israel , and thatâ€ ™ s where Americaâ€ ™ s embassy belongs .
Itâ€ ™ s time for Congress and the president - elect to eliminate the loophole that has allowed presidents in both parties to ignore US law and delay our embassyâ€ ™ s rightful relocation to Jerusalem for over two decades.â€
�
The US embassy has been located on Tel Avivâ€ ™ s HaYarkon Street for half a century .
US state department policy has long held that the status of Jerusalem will only be determined in final talks between Israel and the Palestinians .
Although the US Congress passed a law ordering the move to Jerusalem in 1995 , every president since then has exercised a six - month waiver to prevent it taking place , usually citing â€œnational security concernsâ€ � .
Saeb Erekat , a senior Palestinian official and peace negotiator , warned last month that moving the embassy to Jerusalem would result in the â€œdestruction of the peace process as a wholeâ€ � .
But David Friedman , the pro - Israel hardliner Trump nominated as his ambassador to Israel , has said he looks forward to serving in Jerusalem .
Israelâ€ ™ s ambassador to the US has described the move of the embassy as a â€œgreat step forward to peaceâ€ � and something that â€œshould have happened a long time agoâ€ � .
Last month Obama angered Israel â€ “ and Trump â€ “ by allowing a UN security council resolution condemning Israeli settlement construction to be adopted ."
2017-01-23,"One of Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s most important and precarious cabinet picks , former oil executive Rex Tillerson as secretary of state , was narrowly approved by a Senate committee on Monday as the last Republican holdout in the upper chamber declared his support .
Tillerson is widely expected to win confirmation from the full Senate when his confirmation goes to a vote , expected next week , after its foreign affairs committee voted 11 - 10 along party lines to support him .
Florida senator Marco Rubio said he still had reservations about Tillersonâ€ ™ s commitment to defending human rights abroad but would vote for him in view of his business credentials and the national interest , and because the former ExxonMobil chief had addressed at least some of Rubioâ€ ™ s concerns during a combative Senate hearing earlier this month .
Two other sceptical Republican senators , John McCain and Lindsey Graham , announced their backing on Sunday .
They also voiced reservations â€œabout his past dealings with the Russian government and
President Vladimir Putinâ€ � , but said they were encouraged by his stated support for US alliances .
After the committee vote on Monday evening , its chairman , Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee , said : â€œI personally have no doubt that Rex Tillerson is well - qualified .
Heâ€ ™ s managed
the worldâ€ ™ s eighth largest company by revenue with over 75,000 employees .
Diplomacy has been a critical component of his positions in the past , and he has shown himself to be an exceptionally able and successful negotiator who has maintained deep relationships around the world.â€ � Senate Democrats , however , remained unanimously opposed to Tillerson .
Ben Cardin , the ranking Democrat on the committee , said the nominee had been â€œrepeatedly prioritising narrow business interests ahead of these core national security interestsâ€ � .
With Republicans holding 52 of the 100 Senate seats , Tillersonâ€ ™ s confirmation looks assured , but a vote of the full chamber is not expected before next week .
Later , Mike Pompeo was approved by the Senate to lead the CIA , something that had been expected .
Pompeo joins the secretary of defense , James Mattis , and homeland security secretary John Kelly , as Trumpâ€ ™ s first confirmed cabinet members , as the new president strives to stabilise his administrationâ€ ™ s shaky start .
Its first four days have been overshadowed by the presidentâ€ ™ s spats with the press and the intelligence community , and continuing reported leaks about investigations into possible contacts between Trump campaign officials and Moscow during the election .
The latest came on Sunday , as the Wall Street Journal reported that US counter - intelligence officials were investigating communications between the national security adviser , Michael Flynn , and Russian officials .
With the administrationâ€ ™ s legitimacy facing unprecedented questions in the wake of Russian election hacking , a Tillerson confirmation looked set to be a significant victory .
â€œI believe the president is entitled to significant deference when it comes to his choices for the cabinet , â€ � said Rubio , who had been the only Republican holdout on the committee .
â€œTherefore , despite my reservations , I will support Mr Tillersonâ€
™ s nomination in committee and in the full Senate.â€
�
Rubioâ€ ™ s statement came less than two weeks after his acute grilling of Tillerson at the latterâ€ ™ s confirmation hearing , in which the senator lectured Trumpâ€ ™ s nominee on the need for â€œmoral clarityâ€ � in the world .
Rubio was dissatisfied when Tillerson declined to label Putin a â€œwar criminalâ€ � or condemn the human rights abuses of the Philippine president , Rodrigo Duterte .
But on Monday , Rubio said that , although his concerns remained , he ultimately deemed it counterproductive to hold up Tillersonâ€ ™ s nomination at a time of global instability .
â€œGiven the uncertainty that exists both at home and abroad about the direction of our foreign policy , it would be against our national interests to have this confirmation unnecessarily delayed or embroiled in controversy , â€ � Rubio said .
Following his vocal doubts at Tillersonâ€ ™ s 11 January confirmation hearing , Rubio found himself under intense pressure from Trumpâ€ ™ s allies , including senior members of past Republican administrations , who worked vigorously behind the scenes to secure the senatorâ€ ™ s support .
Rubio and Tillerson met privately last week with Vice - President Mike Pence and Trumpâ€ ™ s chief of staff , Reince Priebus , also in attendance , according to the Washington Post .
Mark Dubowitz , the head of the hawkish foreign policy group the Foundation for Defence of Democracies , welcomed Tillersonâ€ ™ s imminent confirmation .
â€œTillersonâ€ ™ s confirmation will bring a tough , savvy , clear - eyed negotiator to the State Department who adversaries will not be able to run circles around ,
â€ �
Dubowitz said ."
2017-01-24,"Key hearings and votes for Trumpâ€ ™ s cabinet Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s controversial choice for secretary of state , Rex Tillerson , overcame the first hurdle in his confirmation on Monday after gaining the support of the majority of the foreign affairs committee .
Marco Rubio , the last holdout from the Republicans on the committee , pledged his support for Tillerson after doubts over his commitment to defending human rights abroad .
Rubioâ€ ™ s vote gave the former ExxonMobil CEO an 11 - 10 vote on the committee , with members voting along party lines .
Tillerson will now face a wider vote in the Senate , which he is expected to pass .
Other picks for Trumpâ€ ™ s cabinet will face votes in the Senate on Tuesday , including education secretary Betsy DeVos , commerce secretary Wilbur Ross and UN ambassador Nikki Haley , among others .
In an abrupt move on Monday night , Democrats indefinitely delayed votes on confirmations for Rick Perry and Ryan Zinke , who are are nominated for the energy and interior departments , without explanation .
Trumpâ€ ™ s nominee for health secretary , Tom Price , will face another hearing in front of the Senate , and will likely face more questions on his opposition to the Affordable Care Act .

conflicts resurface in Scotland Questions around the presidentâ€ ™ s conflicts of interest have begun to swirl again after filings have revealed that Trump resigned as director from four Scottish golf firms , but has maintained his holdings .
According to filings at Companies House , the UK government agency that holds and publishes documents on all British businesses , the US president quit as director the day before the inauguration , 19 January , but still owns four different golfing companies : Trump International Golf Club Scotland , DT Connect Europe , SLC Turnberry and its parent company , Golf Recreation Scotland .

Trump has refused to put his company in a blind trust , despite calls from ethics lawyers and the governmentâ€ ™ s ethics office .
He has instead transferred control of his companies over to his family .

Our next mission : Donald Trump Assange :
â€˜It was all about meâ€ ™
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s decision to grant Chelsea Manning clemency was intended to â€œmake life hardâ€ � for him .
Speaking to an Australian current affairs program , Assange also slightly walked back his pledge to accept extradition to the US , despite there being no order for his extradition .
WikiLeaks had tweeted that Assange would submit himself to the US Department of Justice if Manning were granted clemency .
Manning , who was arrested in 2010 for leaking more than 700,000 diplomatic cables , videos and documents to WikiLeaks , had her sentence commuted by Obama during his last days of office .
She will be released in May. Assange , who has been living in the Ecuadorian embassy since 2012 , now says his team would like to strike a deal with the US justice department to see if â€œthere is some way you guys can drop itâ€ � .
The only existing extradition order against Assange is to Sweden where he is wanted on rape allegations .

2017-06-20,"With the death of the 22-year - old American student Otto Warmbier , American officials are calling for revenge .
â€œThe United States can not and should not tolerate the murder of its citizens by hostile powers ,
â€ �
Senator John McCain said in a statement .
That evening , Senator Marco Rubio tweeted : â€œNorth Korea must be held accountable for its brutality.â€ �
And Donald Trump said in a statement : â€œOttoâ€ ™ s fate deepens my Administrationâ€ ™ s determination to prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people.â€ �
Warmbier allegedly tried to steal a propaganda poster in Pyongyang on New Yearâ€ ™ s 2016 ; the regime sentenced him to 15 years of hard labor in March 2016 .
Last week , Pyongyang released him , in a coma
â€ “ probably caused by injury to the brain â€
“ and he died six days later .
He is probably the first American to die at the hands of North Koreans in decades .
â€œThe awful torturous mistreatment our son received at the hands of the North Koreans ensured that no other outcome was possible beyond the sad one we experienced today , â€ � the Warmbiers said on 19 June .
Protecting the lives of Americans abroad is essential , and one of the state department tasks that citizens most value .
And yet , responding to the passing of Warmbier by provoking or attacking North Korea goes against American interests â€ “ and would cause other tragic deaths .
The best - case scenario for America would be denuclearizing North Korea , and reducing the threats posed by its chemical and conventional weapon stockpile and million - man army , without risking a horrific war .
In the decades following Richard Nixonâ€ ™ s 1969 decision not to retaliate after Pyongyang shot down a US spy plane , killing the 31 Americans on board , US presidents have wisely decided not to risk a conflict by responding in kind to North Koreaâ€ ™ s provocations .
Not because Pyongyang should be allowed to act with impunity , but because inaction coupled with regional diplomacy â€ “ or , as Barack Obama called it , â€œstrategic patienceâ€ � , is the least bad choice .
In an excellent July / August 2017 cover story in the Atlantic , the journalist Mark Bowden outlines the four major options for handling North Korea .
They are â€œpreventionâ€ � , ie war ; â€œturning the screwsâ€ � â€ “ in other words , attacks that would compel North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to change his behavior ; â€œdecapitationâ€ � , removing Kim and his inner circle ; or â€œacceptanceâ€ � : â€œacquiescing to Kimâ€ ™ s developing the weapons he wantsâ€ � .
Bowden reluctantly suggests acceptance , because the risks of moving substantially beyond diplomacy are too high .
Moreover , as perverse as it may sound , Pyongyang probably saw the comatose return of Warmbier on 13 June as an olive branch : it often releases American citizens when it wants to deepen diplomatic dialogue with Washington .
While that might not be palatable to many following Warmbierâ€ ™ s death , especially after Pyongyangâ€ ™ s risible missile tests and threats over the last several months , engaging with the North Koreans can potentially help reduce tensions in the future .
And that , in turn , would lead to fewer cases like Warmbierâ€ ™ s .
If calls for revenge come too loud for Trump to ignore , compelling China to restrain North Korea is a more effective way to channel those voices .
Long Pyongyangâ€ ™ s most important ally , Beijing now accounts for roughly 90 % of the countryâ€ ™ s trade â€ “ meaning any efforts at meaningful sanctions will fail if China doesnâ€ ™ t support them .
Want to punish North Korean generals , as opposed to the long - suffering North Korean people ?
Work with , or compel , China to deny them and their mistresses the ability to fly to Beijing â€ “ the major airport for international travel from Pyongyang â€ “ to prevent them from buying luxury goods in China , or from transiting on to vacations in Paris .
Using Beijing to punish individual , prominent North Korean officials would be a better strategy than trying to censure them without Chinaâ€ ™ s involvement .
And itâ€ ™ s certainly better than something that could trigger a shooting conflict â€ “ and not just because of Trumpâ€
™ s incompetence in matters requiring delicacy and self - control .
War , as the US secretary of defense , James Mattis , said in a May interview , would be â€œcatastrophicâ€ � and probably â€œthe worst kind of fighting in most peopleâ€ ™ s
lifetimesâ€ � .
Bowden agrees .
â€œAny effort to crush North Korea flirts not just with heavy losses , but with one of the greatest catastrophes in human history , â€ � Bowden writes .
Think not only of the roughly 30,000 American troops stationed in South Korea , or of the tens of thousands of other Americans living in the country , within range of North Korean conventional artillery .
Think not only of the millions of South Korean and Japanese citizens whose lives this jeopardizes .
Spare a thought for the many innocent North Koreans
â€ “ the farmers , doctors , fathers , and daughters whom American soldiers and weapons would slaughter .
Perhaps war would force regime change , and end the brutal Kim dynasty .
But that war would create thousands of North Korean Mr and Mrs Warmbiers , mourning the deaths of their innocent sons ."
2017-06-21,"Ivanka Trumpâ€ ™ s ramrod posture and the ungainly movements of a Republican senator were all it took to distract the public from a government meeting on Wednesday about paid family leave .
The Florida senator Marco Rubio appeared to fail in an attempt to hug the presidentâ€ ™ s daughter before the meeting , creating an awkward image that adds to Rubioâ€ ™ s enduring collection of physical gaffes .
He has also accidentally hit a child with a football and clumsily drunk water in a live speech broadcast to the nation .
Those moments required significant clean - up from Rubioâ€ ™ s press team , but he had an ally on Wednesday as he and Trump laughed off the awkward incident in nine tweets following the incident .
In the tweets , they exchanged banter about the hug being investigated by the Senate intelligence committee , which is expected to meet with Trumpâ€ ™ s husband , Jared Kushner , this month as Congress investigates her fatherâ€ ™ s administrationâ€ ™ s ties to Russia .
The Russia scandal seemed far from the minds of Rubio and Ivanka Trump as they tweeted about the failed hug , which went viral and overshadowed the ensuing meeting of Republican senators , representatives and Trump addressing family leave .
The United States is the only industrialized country that does not guarantee workers paid family leave , in part because of Republican resistance to providing federal funding for such a program .
Trump has proposed addressing this with a plan to offer six weeks of mandatory paid leave for mothers and fathers , marking a possible shift in typical Republican policy .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a growing desire in the Republican conference in the Senate and House to address the fundamental fact that there are people in America who have decided they canâ€ ™ t afford to have children because they canâ€ ™ t get a month off of work and not get paid , â€ � Rubio told reporters after the meeting .
The meeting was only with Republicans , though Trump has expressed interest in hearing from the left about her plan .
So far , Democrats have been critical of Trump for pushing for paid family leave as her fatherâ€ ™ s administration cuts other support programs geared towards low - income families .
The lingering moment from Trumpâ€ ™ s meeting with Republicans , however , is likely to be the stilted hug ."
2017-09-10,"Hurricane Irma has battered Florida with gusts of up to 145 mph , flooded downtown Miami , brought dangerous storm surges to the west coast and cut off the Florida Keys .
After millions were ordered to evacuate , those left behind hunkered down .
But Marco Rubio , the senator for Florida , said in a television interview : â€œYou
canâ€ ™ t hide from the water .
Thatâ€ ™ s our biggest fear.â€
�
When it struck the Keys about 9 am local time , Irma was a category 4 hurricane and close to the force of its rampage across the Caribbean , which flattened buildings and led to the deaths of at least 25 people .
In a midday briefing on Sunday in the state capital Tallahassee , the governor , Rick Scott , said south - western coastal areas could be hit by storm surges of 10ft-15 ft ( 3 - 4.5 metres ) above ground and breathtakingly fast waves as tall as a one - storey home .
Tampa should expect surges as large as 5 ft ( 1.5 metres ) , he said , while south - eastern parts of the state would have surges high enough to float cars or submerge a person .
The islands of the Florida Keys recorded 12 in ( 30 cm ) of rain .
All of south Florida could expect another 8 - 15 in ( 20 - 38 cm ) , Scott said .
More than 3.3 m homes and businesses in the state have lost power .
In an interview with NBC , Scott said : â€œThe most important thing is to pray for us.â€ � Four hundred miles wide , Irma initially moved at 8 mph , slower than forecast , and lost strength as it raked the peninsula .
the hurricane made landfall on Marco Island as a category 3 storm , after hours of blasting south Florida with stinging , near horizontal rain , and sudden tornadoes .
Early on Monday , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) downgraded Irma to category 1 .
As of 2 am EDT , the storm was centred about 25 miles north - east of Tampa and moving north - north - west at almost 15 mph .
The city has not been hit by a major storm since 1921 , when its population was about 10,000 .
About 3 million people live in the greater Tampa area , which includes St Petersburg and Clearwater .
On Sunday afternoon , large volumes of water were temporarily pushed out of Tampa Bay by winds , leaving an ominous plain behind .
Irma leaves a trail of devastation in its wake , lashing islands in the Caribbean .
The UK foreign secretary , Boris Johnson rejected criticism of the UKâ€ ™ s emergency preparations on the British Virgin Islands , one of the worst - hit places , where five people died .
Britainâ€
™ s response has been compared with other countries with territories in the Caribbean , such as the Netherlands and France .
Pressure on the prime minister , Theresa May , could build after the French president , Emmanuel Macron , tweeted that he would visit the French territory of St Martin on Tuesday .
Johnson told BBC Radio 4â€ ™ s Today programme : â€œI stress that this is a very big consular crisis , and I am confident that we are doing everything we possibly can to help British nationals .
But you must understand that there are a million of them affected.â€ �
He said 700 British troops were in the region , with UK police officers arriving too , and that the government would be providing assistance to affected areas â€œfor the long termâ€ � .
â€œWe were there as soon as the crisis broke , â€ � he said .
â€œIt doesnâ€ ™ t make any sense when a hurricane is impending to send in heavy aircraft or to send in ships that are not capable themselves of withstanding the storm .
â€œIn fact , the French had to ask us for assistance later on , because weâ€ ™ d got the right sort of kit there.â€ �
Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat and Labourâ€ ™ s Stephen Twigg , who chair the foreign affairs and development committees respectively , said on Friday that Britainâ€ ™ s response had an â€œapparent lack of forward - thinkingâ€ � .
The premier of the BVI , Orlando Smith , said the situation was â€œcriticalâ€ � and called for the UK to provide economic support â€œover the long - term in order to return to normalcyâ€ � .
In St Petersburg , Florida , many refused to leave .
With plywood extremely difficult to find and no gas available , many houses were not boarded up .
Further south , Naples , a city of about 20,000 people in a wider metropolitan area of more than 300,000 , the tide rose by 5.5 ft , according to recordings taken by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
Rubio warned residents not to become complacent after the winds seemed to die down .
â€œStorm surge doesnâ€ ™ t come until the storm passes , â€ � he told CBS .
Floridaâ€ ™ s other senator , Bill Nelson , told CBS Irma would â€œtake a wall of water into the bays and estuaries on the Gulf Coast of Floridaâ€ � .
In his hometown of Miami , Rubio said Irma was â€œnasty , brutalâ€ � , though the city was not even in the eye of the storm .
â€œIt is going to be exponentially worse everywhere up the west coast of Florida .
So if you live in Naples , in Fort Myers , in Sarasota , in the Tampa Bay region , this storm has the potential to be that sort - of - worst - case scenario that meteorologists and emergency planners
dread.â€

Florida Power and Light said more than 17,000 workers were positioned to move in once the most dangerous weather passed , but officials warned that some areas could be without power for weeks .
Emergency services were suspended in Miami - Dade and Broward , with fire and police officials evaluating 911 calls on a case - by - case basis .
In Broward , a county - wide curfew was in effect until 10 am on Monday .
The National Weather Service issued tornado warnings in Floridaâ€ ™ s four southernmost counties : Miami - Dade , Broward , Palm Beach and Collier .
Funnel clouds were spotted over Fort Lauderdale beach and a tornado touchdown was reported in Oakland Park , to the west of the city .
Two giant cranes collapsed in downtown Miami , one leaving its boom dangling by metal cables .
Fire chief Joseph Zahralban said conditions were too dangerous to send crews to secure the cranes .
Authorities repeated warnings to anyone not among the 7 million who had already evacuated .
About 127,000 Floridians were in shelters .
Brock Long , administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Administration , told CNN : â€œYouâ€ ™ re on your own until we can actually get in there and
itâ€ ™ s safe â€ ¦
you put your life in your own hands by not evacuating.â€ �
On Fox News Sunday , he said : â€œOnce this system passes through , itâ€ ™ s going to be a race to save lives and sustain lives.â€ �
All 7,000 members of the Florida national guard were activated and 10,000 guardsmen from other states were on their way to help .
President Donald Trump declared a major disaster in the state .
It has been estimated the storm will cost up to $ 300bn ( Â£228bn ) in cleanup and insurance claims , and also drive up US food prices because of Floridaâ€ ™ s position as the second - largest produce grower in the country .
In the Caribbean , Hurricane Jose , a category 4 storm , shifted north and away from land , giving hope to the survivors of Irma ."
