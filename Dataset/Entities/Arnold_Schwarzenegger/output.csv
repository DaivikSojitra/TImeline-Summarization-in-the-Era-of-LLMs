"Terminator III it was n't .
But Arnold Schwarzenegger yesterday caused real - life political carnage when he unwittingly brought about the downfall of one of Japan 's most controversial politicians .
The minister of justice , Shozaburo Nakamura , an outspoken nationalist and Japan 's richest politician , handed in his notice early yesterday morning .
He explained that he was taking responsibility ' for upsetting the management of parliament by my words and actions ' .
What he did n't explain was why he had allowed the star of the Terminator series to destroy his prominent political career .
The saga began when Mr Schwarzenegger , affectionately known as ' Schwa'chan ' in Japan where he has appeared in television commercials for instant noodles , landed in Osaka last October for the opening of a new Universal Studios theme park .
Arriving at Kansai airport , he reported his American passport stolen .
Mere mortals would have been put on the next plane back home .
But Mr Schwarzenegger , the former Mr Universe who at his cinematic peak commanded $ 20 million per film , was worthy of special treatment .
Or so the minister thought .
When he was contacted late at night from the airport , he promptly gave his permission for the Hollywood star to be allowed entry into the country .
All Schwarzenegger had to do was write a letter setting out why he wanted to visit ' beautiful Japan ' .
Opposition politicians were not amused .
Why , they demanded , had Mr Nakamura allowed in the former body - builder ?
Simple , the justice minister replied : ' If I had n't said yes , I would have been killed by my wife and children , who are his fans . '
Then last week it emerged that the hapless minister had not only shooed Mr Schwarzenegger through immigration , but he had also ' lost ' the actor 's letter .
Opposition MPs accused him of being so star - struck he had taken it home to keep as a souvenir .
As the row deepened , one lawmaker solemnly asked the minister : ' Are you a fan of the actor Arnold Schwarzenegger ? '
Mr Nakamura , in equally solemn tones , confessed he was .
And then came Mr Nakamura 's political death - knell .
When pressed about what had happened to the letter , he blamed his secretary for forgetting to file it an excuse that caused such uproar it paralysed parliament .
So what of Mr Nakamura 's future ?
Unlike the Terminator , do not expect a sequel ."
"From the people who brought you Adolf Hitler , and worse still , Arnold Schwarzenegger , comes a new menace to mankind .
It is called Rum Ta Ta .
But do n't be deceived by the innocent sounding name .
It may have started out as simple Austrian folk music but it has metamorphosed into dangerously addictive variants like acid oompah and blues yodelling .
Already whole swathes of the German - speaking world have been by seduced .
We could be next .
So virulent is this new Alpine craze , that thousands of skiers have been persuaded into lederhosen or dirndl - the traditional aproned , laced dresses - and packed into beer halls only to emerge hours later yodelling like true - born Tyrolers .
There are an estimated 500 folk bands currently stomping around Austria 's beer halls and cowsheds .
All sell themselves as simple country folk doing their bit to keep ancient customs alive , but at least half of them have fan clubs and their own lines of merchandise , with items ranging from baby bibs to condoms .
They 've even cracked Hollywood - playing at Arnie 's birthday bash in LA .
The appeal of groups like Mountain Fire , the Alpine Cats , the Hardroasters and the Skirt Chasers ( literally - translated as the Apron Hunters ) spans generations .
And if the kings of oompah , Alpine Rebels , are anything to go by , that appeal is based on virtuoso displays of farting , burping and animal impersonations .
The thigh - slapping Rebels transformed the traditional folk music scene when their song Country Bumpkins became a nationwide hit in 1994 .
The band 's leader and rhythm guitarist , 34-year - old Armand Beran , explains their appeal thus : ' Our hallmark is ' rock mood ' music .
You should feel the bass in your stomach .
We do n't go in for sentimental tripe , ' he says , wiping the beer foam from his lips .
As the sleeve notes on their new CD , I Do n't Want Anything , puts it : ' Even the ballads have been tousled by the raw mountain winds . '
Mountains and wind feature in a lot of the oompah new wave ( not to mention all the wind - breaking on stage and in the audience ) .
But the Alpine Rebels do n't just do drinking songs , they do love songs too . '
If it meant I could win you over / I'd climb a glacier with no trousers on , ' runs one romantic number in praise of a milk maids .
With lyrics like that , and bare knees to boot , no wonder their female fans pelt them with underwear .
But the biggest hit on their album Come , Rip Me Up !
goes one better .
Milker Rap Sepp combines rock accordion with a rapping cow and some Elvis - influenced yodelling .
The Rebels have just returned by private jet from a concert tour of Germany to their home village of Bad Gleichenberg in south - eastern Austria .
This is the land of Styria , the heart of Austrian folk music .
The Rebels are the star attraction at Bad Gleichenberg 's very own Musikantenstadl - the most successful folk music TV programme in the world .
It broadcasts throughout the German - speaking world ( to eight million Germans , one million Austrians and around one and a half million Swiss ) .
The show has been staged in Moscow , Melbourne and Florida and next year it will even be available to fans in China .
A Chinese contingent from the embassy in Vienna is sitting in one corner of the studio sheepishly sipping their beer , described on the advertising billboards around the room as ' the beery beer ' .
The two - and - a - half hour show is best described as the Generation Game , Val Doonican show , and Opportunity Knocks rolled into one .
The set resembles the interior of a mountain hut full of cardboard flowers with love hearts growing on trees .
Johannes Brandlemayr , an optician and father of five from Upper Austria , makes his TV debut and receives three encores , bursting into tears on receiving his cuddly toy at the end .
In between acts the students of Bad Gleichenberg 's school of tourism demonstrate how to make local delicacies like Styrian pumpkin soup and ' beer meat ' .
This picturesque village , we 're told , was last year the sunniest spot in Austria .
Next up are the Edlseer , alias Fritz , Andreas and Manfred , Styria 's answer to Boyzone .
Their finger - tapping number is called Austria Is Mega - Cool , which goes : ' Austria is international / and that 's why everyone should go there /
And as to our women?/You wo n't find any like them anywhere else / People ca n't believe our country when they see it . '
It gets worse .
The Alpine Rebels start up with a song which ends , ' You may go out into the world / but nothing is like Styria / so I turn round and come back again . '
Then , as if following a directive from the Agriculture Ministry to give an important message to the world about Austrian cows , the Apron Hunters deliver a number called On Sunday In The Church .
It goes thus : ' We give the cows their injections/ so they 'll grow as they 're supposed to / Saturday we go to confession/ Sunday we go to church . '
In the spirit of new - wave folk , everyday themes are paramount . '
It 's not dissimilar to blues , ' says Alois Winkler , promoter of the ultra - masculine Kastelruth Sparrows . '
The songs are about dogs being knocked down , divorce , sick kids , being made redundant , getting poisoned on mushroom - picking expeditions , that sort of thing . '
Not everything in the beer garden is rosy .
The Hardroasters have been shunned by the strongest traditionalists for turning down an invitation to appear on Musikantenstadl .
They , more than most bands , embody the ' reality ' philosophy .
Their most famous song could n't be more gritty or surreal : '
Dad said I should clear up the hay /
But I misunderstood him and slaughtered the calf instead . '
Accordionist Florian defends the band : ' You can remain true to your roots without having to romp around in lederhosen and talk in heavy slang .
And once we found out where we came from we were able to tackle hip - hop and other music styles . '
As they prove with their reggae - yodel mix of Papa
Was A Rolling Stone ( which is almost comparable with the Klostertaler 's classic gospel - yodel version of Oh Happy Day ) .
Then there 's the acid jazz number , Duke Johann , You
Ca n't Dance
Well If You Have Lederhosen And A Hat .
Music journalist Klaus Winniger believes bands like the Hardroasters have found a winning combination . '
Austrians are not just countryside - oriented , provincial and uncool .
They 're also cosmopolitan , chic and cool .
And the Hardroasters have proved it 's possible to make a modern , up - to - date Austrian pop by combining both old and new . '
Austria has more to offer than just its amazingly rich classical music legacy , says Peter Paul Skrepek , drummer with the late Falco , the only Austrian pop band to make it as yet on the international scene ( Remember Amadeus ? ) .
' We have to make people realise that Mozart is not the only music to come out of here , ' he says ."

There are a few women in the top 50 - like Sharon Stone , revealing her minge in Basic Instinct .
Does n't leave much for us , does it , girls ?
So let 's balance out this men - only top 10 by looking at a few moments featuring screen goddesses .
After all , who would n't rather be Grace Kelly than Nicolas Cage ?

How much would you give to have been the first person to say that ?
And to Bogart .

But they ignore her immortal line , as she settles for the lover who 's not quite good enough : '

 4 Joanne Woodward in A Big Hand
For The Little Lady Nobody can resist the cool of a perfect sting and Woodward plays this one to perfection as she takes over a poker hand when husband Henry Fonda feigns a heart attack at the table .
The other ( male ) cardsharps sympathise with the ' little lady ' struggling to understand the game .
Smiling demurely , Woodward - of course - fleeces the lot of them .
 5 Stockard Channing in Grease Nobody ever emulated boring old Sandy ( Olivia Newton - John ) .
We dreamed of being Rizzo : dancing on the bed in hotpants , while Sandy throws up after having her ears pierced ; belting out her satirical song , then shinning down the drainpipe and zooming off with the lads .

 7 Frances McDormand in Fargo Up the stick in real life , McDormand was just perfect as the pregnant no - nonsense cop in the weird Minnesota town .
Her accent is hilarious ,
her wit razor - sharp , her style impeccable .
Bending over suddenly in the snow , as her inferior asks eagerly : ' Found something , chief ? '
she mutters : ' Nah -just morning sickness . '
 8 Carrie Fisher in Star Wars Fisher is , of course , cool anyway .
As Princess Leia she was at her best .
Arrested by Darth Vader 's henchmen , her home planet about to burn , Leia is ( as Peter Cushing snarls ) ' charming to the last ' .
Unrepentant , she greets him : ' Ah , Governor Tarquin .

 9 Christina Ricci in Addams Family Values
An unusual choice , admittedly .
But Ricci turns in a terrific performance as pissed - off adolescent Wednesday , leading the revolt of the Ugly Children against the blonde visions who torture her at summer camp .
For a teenage girl , no heroine could be more reassuring - or cooler .

"Terminator II and Verminator II - not films starring Arnold Schwarzenegger , but techniques for creating new plant varieties that will not germinate naturally .
What are they ?
What is their purpose ?
Why are some people worried about them ?
The techniques are those of genetic engineering , used to produce genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) .
These could be plants , bacteria , or animals , including human beings , in which the normal genes have been changed .
Genes control the traits that are passed on from generation to generation .
In a plant , the genes might pass on the ability to resist certain diseases , to tolerate weed - killers so that competing weeds can be killed , to increase its protein content , or to make it more drought - resistant .
All very useful features , but all needing changes to the plant 's original genes .
Genes are made up of deoxyribose nucleic acid , or DNA , which consists of two long strands of four types of bases - adenine ( A ) , cytosine ( C ) , thymidine ( T ) and guanine ( G ) - linked by a sugar - phosphate "" backbone "" , and arranged in a double helix ( like a spiral staircase ) .
These bases are put together in different sequences to form a generic code .
This code carries the instructions that the cells follow to give the organism its characteristics .
If you change a sequence by inserting genes from another organism , resistance to disease might change .
So what is Terminator II ?
This is a "" knock - out "" gene that is inserted into the plant 's DNA , where it stops its seed from germinating .
At the same time another gene is inserted which , on application of a chemical trigger , restores the ability to germinate .
However , seed from this plant , whilst being fit to use for flour , could not be re - grown .
The chemical trigger would have to be applied to allow the new seed to germinate .
So its life , without the special chemical , is terminated .
The farmer would have to keep buying the special seed , or at least the chemical trigger , in order to reuse any of the seed for the next crop .
For many , this would be no different to what they do now .
They buy new seed annually in order to have the same quality each year .
With Verminator II , a gene from a rat - hence its name - is inserted into the plant 's DNA to produce a chemical that will kill the seed or plant .
At the same time , another pair of genes is inserted that stop the action of the killer gene when exposed to a special chemical .
Again , the final product can be processed as normal , but any reuse of the seed needs to be accompanied by the special chemical .
Why is this being done ?
Producing GM seeds with the extra qualities such as disease resistance costs a lot of money , and so the developers would not wish farmers to buy them only once .
Using this technique , whereby the seeds can not be used for re - growing the crop the following year , forces farmers to repurchase if they want the benefits .
This wo n't be put to use yet , but possibly over the next five to 10 years .
Large seed and chemical companies need to profit from their expensive research and development .
They take out patents on the techniques to prevent others from copying without paying large fees .
Why are people worried ?
Well , the GM plants might affect non - GM ones of the same species growing nearby and cause them to produce seeds that will not germinate naturally .
There would then be no other choice but to use GM seed .
In the less wealthy parts of the world , farmers would not have enough money to purchase such seed .
Currently they use part of their crop for re - sowing each year .
There may also be an effect on soil organisms , insects and birds that feed on or infect plants .
This may affect crops grown in later years .
Some question whether the plant 's nutritional properties remain unchanged ; others wonder what unforeseen effects there might be .

"Mel Gibson may have gone through an alcoholic phase and , more recently , taken to wearing face paint , but he never urinated on a pot plant in front of a nursery - school class - well , not on screen at least .
Arnold Schwarzenegger prematurely terminated more than a few lives , but he never co - starred with a talking turd .
And although Sylvester Stallone 's porno past earned him the nickname of the Italian Stallion , he drew the line at sex with an apple pie .
Call them old - fashioned , but these guys had standards .
A few years ago , cinema was dominated by the action movies of Arnie , Sly , Mel and Bruce , and concern was mounting about the dangerous effect of all that violence on audiences .
When would this carnage end ?
And would audiences be desensitised by their exposure to it ?
The evidence of the current American box - office chart ( ie the one that will be the British box - office chart in a few months ) suggests it is now all over , though whether emotional sensibilities are returning to normal is open to debate .
The nearest we have to a traditional violent action hit this summer is The Phantom Menace , complete with laser fights and car chase .
There are guns in the summer 's second biggest hit , Austin Powers : The Spy
Who Shagged Me , but it is played for laughs , and copycat fans may pose more of a danger to dental hygiene than law and order .
American audiences are turning their backs on action movies and embracing comedy in a big way .
The guardians of public morality should , on the face of it , be cock - a - hoop as the sound of laughter drowns that of gunfire .
But the latest hit comedies include scenes more shocking and disgusting than anything provided by Laurel and Hardy or , for that matter , Schwarzenegger and Stallone .
You can intellectualise all you want about the mayhem in the Lethal Weapon series , but the scene in which Austin Powers drinks shit instead of coffee elicits a purely gut response , baby .
The shock value of brains splattering across a pristine white wall has been dissipated , and film - makers and , it seems , audiences , are looking for new thrills - the grosser the better .
Hollywood has discovered the appeal of a new four - letter word : yuck .
In Big Daddy , Adam Sandler is a slovenly bachelor landed with looking after a five - year - old boy .
He teaches him such valuable life lessons as how to let saliva dangle out of his mouth and suck it back just before it hits the ground , and he sets him straight on the notion that toilets ( or , failing that , beds ) are a prerequisite for urination .
Despite being a charmless and vulgar oaf , Sandler 's character loses one babe , acquires another and becomes a doting parent .
To these critical eyes , it seemed an unfunny and uncomfortable attempt to mix gross comedy with gross sentimentality , but it is rocketing towards the $ 150 million mark at the north American box office .
It was succeeded in the No 1 spot by American Pie , a comedy in which one of the central characters - four nerdy teenagers who are determined to lose their virginity - is advised that "" third base "" feels like apple pie .
He inserts his finger into his mother 's fresh - baked apple pie ( no , that 's not a euphemism ) and ends up "" going all the way "" with it - prompting the unlikely tag line "" there 's something about pastry "" .
"" Comedy is part of the zeitgeist today , "" says Michael De Luca , head of production at New Line , the company that made the Austin Powers films and Dumb and Dumber .
"" People want to see someone poke fun at authority , to take the wind out of the windbags of our society .
The 1980s were very politically correct ; the culture was n't into irreverent satire or gross - out humour .
But , as the 90s developed , TV shows like The Simpsons and the Farrellys ' films signalled a new attitude .
Suddenly you could make fun of a lot of sacred cows - everybody was fair game .
"" Five years ago , Dumb and Dumber helped secure Jim Carrey 's position as the clown prince of grossness and turned its creators , brothers Peter and Bobby Farrelly , into a cinematic force .
Carrey and Jeff Daniels were a Laurel and Hardy for the 90s .
They shared Stan and Ollie 's aspirations to be successful members of society and their determined refusal to recognise their own stupidity .
Stan and Ollie had wives , though sexual allusions were kept to a minimum .
Carrey and Daniels may have had problems in fulfilling their sexual desires , but they expressed them with the articulate confidence of roughnecks on shore leave .
Carrey and Daniels combined a certain witless charm with the most appalling toilet habits ever committed to celluloid .
Daniels urinates on Carrey 's back ; Carrey urinates into beer bottles from which a police patrolman drinks ; and Daniels suffers a lengthy bout of diarrhoea in a posh house , in which the toilet will not flush - complete with tortuous facial expressions and the most spectacular sound effects since Earthquake .
British film - makers had tended to be smutty , rather than gross , alluding to bodily functions , rather than depicting them .
It is not so long ago that a title like Carry On at Your Convenience was regarded as risque in itself .
Monty Python and Peter Greenaway did their bit to push back the frontiers of British grossness , but it was Ewan McGregor who finally exploited the full dramatic potential of diarrhoea when he disappeared down the worst toilet in Scotland in Trainspotting .
An obscure ( and quite dreadful ) British comedy ,
I Bought a Vampire Motorcycle , can , however , claim credit for pioneering the concept of talking turds years before it was adopted by South Park , the cult animated TV series recently transferred to the big screen as South Park : Bigger , Longer and Uncut .
After Dumb and Dumber , Trainspotting and South Park , excrement , like violence , had gone about as far as it could go .
It was going to be increasingly difficult to hit the fan with sThere 's Something About MaryThere 's Something About Mary , that turned the arc lights onto semen , in one of the most disgustingly memorable scenes of the 90s .
Dumb and Dumber was a one - off , whereas There 's Something About Mary - which grossed $ 176 million in north America - started a trend .
Los Angeles Times writer Patrick Goldstein has suggested that "" in times of prosperity and complacency , audiences seem to prefer comedy that aims for the gut and the groin , not the head "" .
But analysing humour is a risky business .
I remember my old English teacher explaining that someone falling on a banana skin is funny , but someone cutting his hand off with a chainsaw is n't .
We roared with laughter .
Of course we were laughing at him : he was the joke , not the severed hand , a perfect example of the comedy of discomfort .
Audiences laugh at the discomfort of others ; they thank fate it is not them in that awful situation , and they maybe even empathise with the poor unfortunates on screen .
Who has n't , on occasion , mistaken semen for hair gel ?
It was argued that audiences were getting a visceral thrill from violence ; now film - makers are dispensing with the violence , but trying to keep the visceral thrill , with characters being subjected to ever more horrible physical torments .
Bullets - been there ; nail guns - done that ; jobbies - got the T - shirt .
Semen ?
That has potential .
There 's Something About Mary opened just as American Pie was about to go into production , and Paul Weitz , one half of cinema 's latest comedy sibling auteurs , admits that Mary 's success encouraged them to go further than they might otherwise have done .
American Pie manages a fresh take on the routine in which bodily fluids are mistaken for more traditional beverages , after one of the female characters spits a mouthful of semen into a glass of beer .
Like all good comedy , comedy of discomfort is about repetition and escalation , and American comedies are now engaged in a struggle to outgross each other .
Talking turds and drinking semen are signs of the times - which is why I can not imagine Ollie drinking a glass of semen or Stan 's bottom exploding all over the toilet .
That was one fine mess he managed to avoid ."
"Planet Hollywood , the theme restaurant chain part owned by some of the biggest stars of the 1980s , lost any of its remaining lustre yesterday when it filed for bankruptcy .
The company , launched nine years ago with the red carpet treatment normally reserved for a film premiere , was forced to file for protection from its creditors after defaulting on its debts in April .
Original shareholders in the company , including Arnold Schwarzenegger , Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone , have seen their original investment in the group reduced to almost nothing .
At its launch the company was worth almost $ 2bn , compared with just over $ 40 m a few weeks ago .
An investment group including Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal and Ong Beng Seg , a Singapore billionaire , have agreed to inject just $ 30 m to head off demands from guaranteed bondholders .
If the proposed restructuring is agreed , these two multi - billionaires will own 70 % of the remaining group along with a trust set up for the children of Robert Earl , the one - time British pub operator and founder of the restaurant chain .
It was unclear last night how much original investors such as Whoopi Goldberg and Demi Moore were set to lose from their disastrous involvement in the company .
Many invested several million dollars .
The collapse of Planet Hollywood comes as several theme restaurants popular at the beginning of the decade have suffered a fall in ratings .
Other groups such as the Fashion Cafe , launched to take advantage of the growing fame of supermodels in 1995 , and the David Copperfield Magic Cafe have also suffered financial difficulties as restaurantgoers turn to chains which offer better food at cheaper prices .
The fall from grace of Planet Hollywood could have come straight from a movie script .
Analysts say its managers became obsessed by expansion as they tried to milk the maximum amount of money from the public 's attraction for celebrity .
It was a trend that alarmed Wall Street 's finest , who feared the company 's core business was being neglected .
Within eight years of its launch , there were 87 Planet Hollywood units operating across the world in 36 countries .
But as losses mounted , Robert Earl scrapped ambitious plans to open 300 branches by 2003 , with analysts accusing management of focusing on expansion at the expense of taking care of their existing outlets .
It was decided to close branches .
Recent closures include those of flagship premises in Aspen , Colorado , Jakarta and Prague .
This month a new chief executive , Bill Baumhauer , took over after second quarter revenues dropped to $ 105.1 m from $ 121.9 m .
In 1996 the company 's first initial stock offer was hailed as a success after a partial flotation in the US raised $ 200 m .
Richard Harden , co - editor of Harden 's London restaurant guides said : "" It is great for tourists .
Or for those who want a day out with the kids .
But it is a one - off .
A case of ' been there , done that ' .
"" There is no reason why the public should come back . ""
Mr Earl yesterday accepted that rapid expansion of his chain for some of its financial difficulties .
He said : "" We remain committed to providing consumers with an exciting and unique dining experience , including great good at great prices , and we believe that the restructuring will put us in a position to do just that for many years to come . ""
Mr Earl 's promotional skills were credited with garnering support from a host of stars when the chain was launched .
Few of these existing stars have been seen at Planet Hollywood events in recent years .
There have been signs of trouble at the group since the beginning of the year .
But in a statement issued in January the company said "" 1999 will be a turnaround year "" .
It forecast a return to profits by 2000 .
Actors who tried to pump up profits 
Planet Hollywood opened its first branch in New York in 1991 .

It was fronted by Hollywood musclemen Sylvester Stallone , Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis .
But the money was pumped in by Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal and Singapore hotelier Ong Beng Seng .

"Total Recall 2070 9 pm ,
Sky 1 Sky packs most of its season premiers into the space of two days with this spin - off from the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie - though , disappointingly , Arnie does n't get his memory wiped every episode .
Instead , a unarmed future cop ( Michael Easton from another short - lived Canadian sci - fi , VR-5 ) , his new partner , and his nudity - prone girlfriend take on corporate abuses in a heavily Blade Runner - influenced 21st century .
For fans of more conventional space opera , it 's preceded at 8 pm by a new run of Stargate SG-1 .
One Fine Day ( Michael Hoffman , 1997 ) 10 am , 6 pm , Sky Premier Likeable , easy - on - the - eyes romantic comedy , with George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer ditto as New Yorkers , he a hardhitting columnist , she an architect , meeting via their five - year - olds at the school gates .
It could have been intolerably schmaltzy , but Hoffman captures the frenzy of modern urban life , and the lead pair are so much more charming than , say , Streep and De Niro in Falling in Love .

Even before he became Agent Mulder , that David Duchovny was a strange one .
Here he 's an academic hooked on the macabre acts of serial killers , but taking off for California with his girlfriend , erotic photographer Michelle Forbes , they pick up the genuine article : psychotic Brad Pitt and his nymphette Juliette Lewis .
Suddenly it 's the real thing , the knife in the soft underbelly of the crazy States ; X Files material , or what ?
Vengeance is Mine ( Shohei Imamura , 1979 )
12.10am , FilmFour This little - seen Japanese thriller is an extremely interesting addition to FilmFour 's current Killing Time season .
It starts like a standard true crimes policier : two bodies found in the undergrowth , the cops taking notes and closing in on the killer .
But through a series of flashbacks Imamura draws a complex portrait of real - life multiple murderer Iwao Enokizu ( played with hatchet - faced anger by Ken Ogata ) , whose flashes of violence are driven by hatred of his father ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger is considering running for the governorship of California in 2002 .
Quizzed on the possibility in an interview in Talk magazine , the Austrian - born star responds , "" Oh yeah , I think about it many times .
The possibility is there because I feel it inside .
I feel there are a lot of people standing still and not doing enough .
And there 's a vacuum . ""
Schwarzenegger is linked by marriage to America 's most famous political dynasty .
His wife , Maria Shriver , is JFK 's niece and cousin to the recently deceased golden boy John F Kennedy Jnr .
Arnie is unable to rival Warren Beatty in a run for the presidency , however , as he was n't born in the USA .
In Arnie 's words , he 's a "" compassionate conservative "" in the mould of gun - totin ' , Cold War - evokin ' George Bush Jnr , the leading Republican candidate for the presidency .
The Republicans , says the Terminator star , must become a party of inclusion and show they "" love the foreigner as much as the gay person "" .
Unlike Bush , or indeed President Clinton , Arnie answered a probe into his own drug history with a breezily honest "" I inhaled , exhaled , everything . ""
Hollywood in non - stereotyping shock
After years of perceived stereotyping by Hollywood , Arab - Americans are praising the well - rounded portrayals of Arabs in David O. Russell 's Gulf War movie Three Kings , which opens in the States today .
"" It shows the Arab and the Muslim and their complexity , with feelings and normal aspirations , "" said Hala Maksoud , president of the American - Arab Anti - Discrimination Committee .
"" We 're happy that for once we are not stereotyped by Hollywood . ""
Recent films to have enraged America 's Arab community include Executive Decision with Kurt Russell and Edward Zwick 's recent The Siege .
The producers of Three Kings took pains not to offend the community , hiring three Arab and Arab - American consultants who supervised slogans , prayer scenes and Gulf War history , and ensured that the actors spoke Arabic with correct Iraqi accents .
The film , which stars George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg as US soldiers out to retrieve relics seized by Saddam Hussein from Kuwait , is opening to a considerable buzz .
According to online magazine Film.com , "" a great deal of David O. Russell 's film has [ a ] kind of giddy newness .
While built along the lines of a perfectly engrossing action - movie plot , Three Kings manages to venture into places that most American films never go -
it 's like a madly inventive hybrid of Dr Strangelove and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre . ""

"Actors just hate being typecast , or so they say .
But deep down Arnold Schwarzenegger probably does n't harbour hopes of playing Romeo , and Sharon Stone is unlikely to put herself forward for a remake of The Sound of Music .
So , unlike these peers , Toni Collette has reason to feel aggrieved .
Collette , an Australian , came to attention in her first major screen role as the cartoon frump in P.J. Hogan 's international hit Muriel 's Wedding .
She did n't have to beat stiff opposition to win her signature role .
Many actresses were offended by being asked to read for the role of the Abba - obsessed social misfit .
But Collette cast aside her vanity and piled on the pounds , gaining three stone in seven weeks .
She emerged as the Nineties equivalent of Lyn Redgrave 's hapless Sixties heroine Georgy Girl .
She was , perhaps , too good as Muriel Heslop .
Irritatingly , the image blurred with reality .
On meeting her in 1996 , a US interviewer could n't believe the svelte , attractive woman in front of her was the same person .
The article began : ' My God , ' I shriek . '
You are so gorgeous . '
In the past few years , Collette has made movies in Europe , America and Australia but never as the romantic leading lady .
She is commonly the gawky best friend , the ugly duckling or the bad - hair girl .
No wonder she has twice played second fiddle ( in The Pallbearer and Emma ) to Hollywood golden girl Gwyneth Paltrow .
Collette , a refreshingly free spirit , declared Jane Austen 's novel ' boring , boring , boring ' .
She finally got to play the vamp in last year 's glam - rock odyssey Velvet Goldmine .
In Australian Vogue she described her role as ' a mad , drug - fucked , camp woman who is a complete slut ' .
Again her method instincts kicked in : she shed a stone , started smoking , partied wildly and tottered around in her character 's platform heels for the whole nine - week shoot .
Her latest role is a partial return to her trademark kitchen - sink glamour .
In The Sixth Sense , a beguiling supernatural thriller starring Bruce Willis , Collette is the anguish - ridden mother of a young boy ( Haley Joel Osment ) with ESP ability .
The scenes between Willis and Osment are outstanding , but Collette 's sympathetic performance as a woman frustrated by her son 's increasingly bizarre behaviour lie at the heart of the film .
Apparently the 26-year - old actress wept when she first read the script , which allayed her fears of acting alongside Mr Die Hard .
The Sixth Sense has been the sleeper hit of the year , and insiders are beginning to predict Oscar nominations for the film .
It can only have a positive effect on her profile .
1
She began a year - long relationship with Velvet Goldmine co - star Jonathan Rhys Meyers during filming .
2
Although top of her class , she left school at 16 to pursue an acting career .
3
As a teenager she used to wear rings on every finger , wore numerous earrings and had her bellybutton pierced .
4
After a few informal gigs singing in Sydney , she was offered a record contract and plans to make an album .
5 ' I just ate and ate and ate .
I was bursting out of my clothes , ' she says of her preparation for her role in Muriel 's Wedding ."
"The last time I saw Vayu Naidu perform the Indian epic folk tale , Ramayana , it included references to Arnold Schwarzenegger , the Budget and the turnover of managers at Aston Villa .
But that was a few years ago in Birmingham .
Here in the studio at the Leicester Haymarket , she sticks to a more traditional version , calculated to appeal to a large section of the audience .
That includes 35 elderly Gujeratis who are visiting a theatre for the first time in their lives .
There are young people , too , white as well as Asian .
One is so young he 's still in nappies , harnessed to his mother and mesmerised into silence by this exotic figure with flashing eyes and twirling , bejewelled fingers .
Dr Naidu is a woman of many talents : she 's the first person to gain a PhD in story - telling from a British university , she 's a playwright and , more recently , a theatre administrator .
For the past year she has been associate artistic director of the Haymarket , the only regional rep in the country that has integral to its structure an Indian theatre or "" Natak "" .
Nearly 30 % of Leicester 's population is Asian .
Many are Gujeratis who came from east Africa in the early 70s after Idi Amin 's purges in Uganda .
Naidu is trying to appeal to that generation , as well as their children and grandchildren . ""
Although the second and third generation are westernised , they 've held on to a lot of Indian values , "" she says .
"" Even those who 've never been to India . ""
Yes , but Leicester 's Asians might still enjoy , say , a classic comedy like JM Synge 's Playboy of the Western World , which appeared on the main - house stage for much of September .
Why did she feel it necessary to work round the clock for six days to produce a parallel studio work called The Playboy of the Asian World ?
Well , partly because she was asked to do it by the Haymarket 's artistic director , Paul Kerryson , and partly because she is trying to address what she calls "" the visibility factor "" .
While there are , she says , "" many shared values between Indian and Irish communities , young Asians want their identity to be visible rather than inferred through another culture .
"" Playboy kicked off Natak 's autumn season , which coincides with Leicester 's Diwali celebrations , the biggest in Europe .
Underpinning the theatre 's folk tales , classic adaptations , Asian dance and comedy , though , is a commitment to produce challenging modern drama .
Hence the opening this week of Timeri N Murari 's theatrical version of his controver sial film The Square Circle , which might shatter a few illusions about the "" homeland "" .
Gang rape and transvestism are featured .
"" This is the real India , not the version put out by Bollywood , "" Murari says .
"" This is the India where women are casually molested and many men are male chauvinists . ""
Murari has flown in from Madras , grateful to Vayu Naidu for giving him the chance to direct his work in the way that he intended rather than the way it was treated in Bollywood .
"" She 's obviously a kindred spirit and we both know that in the theatre the writer has control , "" he says over a drink in the Haymarket bar .
He 's a former journalist - a Guardian man full of entertaining tales of old Fleet Street .
But he 's a serious writer too , with 10 novels to his name and a burning desire to erase the memory of director Amol Palekar 's treatment of his film .
The script examines the relationship between an itinerant actor who dresses up as a woman and a young village girl he persuades to dress up as a man for her own protection after she has been abducted and raped .
Eventually they become lovers .
Not exactly a typical Bollywood movie , then .
The miracle is that Murari managed to get it produced at all by a film industry where screen sex is usually confined to a gyrating navel in a see - through sari .
"" My script is about sexual identity , "" he says .
"" How we define ourselves as men or women and how that identity governs the way we live our lives . ""
Having gone so far with it , he was appalled when Palekar changed the ending and had the transvestite hero bumped off by the same men who had raped his girlfriend .
"" We rowed about it , but once a director gets the bit between his teeth there 's no stopping him .
There was no reason for it .
I can only think that Palekar was disturbed by the character and wanted to take revenge on him . ""
The ending that Murari envisaged will finally be revealed in the studio at the Leicester Haymarket .
You have been warned . 

"Disney and Pixar 's Toy Story 2 .
Arnold Schwarzenegger 's Satanic comeback , End of Days .
Two very different movies with one thing in common : good reviews .
Toy Story 2 got nothing but good reviews .
And End of Days did n't get any good reviews at all .
Well , actually there was one .
On the poster .
"" More chilling than The Exorcist ...
More haunting than The Sixth Sense !
It will scare the hell out of you . ""
( It bored the hell back into me . )
This feverish , preposterously upbeat assessment was written by , or at least typed by , or perhaps even dictated to , someone styling himself Earl Dittman of Wireless , which is as good a reason as I can think of for offloading all those hereditary peers .
First things first , though .
Toy Story 2 broke a large number of exceedingly tedious box - office records this weekend , earning $ 80 m over the extended Thanksgiving holiday .
It opened on Wednesday and profited from the two non - school days and from the fact that well - positioned , big - budget animated features always do revolving - turnstyle repeat business among kids .
And there were two extra matinees to serve them all .
Actually , Disney was only breaking records it has set itself on previous holiday weekends :
A Bug 's Life and The Lion King are now only the second and third most successful of Disney 's animated Thanksgiving releases .
The World is Not Enough , the somehow rather insufficient new Bond movie , dropped to number two from the top spot but still made almost as much money this week as last ( $ 35 m to $ 37 m ) .
So Arnold , back in a starring role for the first time since 1996 , had to settle for third place when End of Days took in $ 30 million .
Arnold seems to have been away an awfully long time .
His last movie , Eraser , was so forgettable I had to rack my brains for an hour before I managed to unearth it from the "" discard "" skip deep in my cerebellum .
I threw it straight back .
An apt title , as it happens .
Before that there was the gormless True Lies , suffused with what Arnold and scorched - earth director James "" Ahab "" Cameron no doubt thought was a bracing whiff of misogyny .
Oh , and his seasonal comedy Jingle all the Way , which I just bet they rerun endlessly in Hell on Jesus 's birthday , just to guarantee a Black Christmas for all the children who have n't been nice .
It probably seems ungentlemanly of me to overload this heaving dung - wagon
but hey , let 's chuck the epically stinky Batman and Robin - in which he played Mr Freeze , a cunning exploitation of his famous lack of warmth - right up there on the top of the heap .
So where 's he been all this time ?
I often try to picture the Austrian Oak , this pinnacle of the medium - to - well - barmy wing of the Republican party , cooling his heels up at Hyannisport , warmly enclosed by the collective familial bosom of his staunchly Democratic Kennedy in - laws (
Arnie 's married to Kennedy cousin Maria Shriver , who has some toy job as a TV anchor - mannequin ) .
I imagine him smoking fat stogies in the airless drawing rooms of the super - rich , daring billionaires to hit him in the stomach as hard as they can , arm - wrestling with Martha 's Vineyard 's bartenders , making tasteless jokes as Maria guns the HumVee over the Chappaquiddick Bridge , and generally living that fenced - in , fast - track - thru - customs VIP lifestyle that keeps our beloved superstars safely inoculated against reality .
We were afforded a privileged glimpse into this magical world earlier this week when Sylvester Stallone was sued by a gaggle of his former servants , all of whom alleged that they were ordered never to make eye contact with the master of the house or his wife , Jennifer Flavin .
If Stallone entered a room , they were supposed to leave immediately , eyes downcast .
They were collectively fired for accepting gifts - and signed eight by 10 photos - from Stallone 's infamously freaky mother , Jackie ( not to be confused with , um , Arnie 's Jackie ) , with whom the fragrant Flavin is said to be at daggers drawn .
Not only does Sly get married at Blenheim Palace , he seems to live now in some parallel Versailles of his own devising .
Anyway , Schwarzenegger - who I 'm sure is perfectly fine with the help - has lingered too long in this world , and , in the meantime , ours has changed drastically without him .
In my mind he 's long since been replaced by the wonderfully insulting caricature of him that appears on The Simpsons : Rainier ( it rhymes with "" veneer "" )
Wolfecastle , star of the insanely violent , right - wing vigilante McBain movies that Bart and Homer love so much .
Wolfecastle satirises the old Arnie - sorry , the young Arnie - of Total Recall and The Terminator movies , and makes fun of his accent and the dubious political leanings of his forebears .
Actually , I could handle a decent Terminator movie right this minute , but Arnold wo n't be doing another one , sadly .
Instead we have End of Days , which , suffice it to say , is not one iota "" more haunting than The Sixth Sense "" .
It 's not one iota more haunting than The Haunting , and only marginally "" more chilling "" than Mr Freeze .
First strike against it is that it 's a Peter Hyams movie - the guy who made The Presidio , The Narrow Margin , Running Scared and other mediocre movies of which one strains to recall a single frame .
Gabriel Byrne plays Satan in much the same way he played a Catholic priest in Stigmata , and poor Robin Tunney , who was very persuasive as a girl with Tourette 's syndrome in the otherwise negligible Niagara , Niagara , is here just dumbed down into jailbait for the audience .
The special effects , crucial in a dumb - bell project like this , are atrocious .
And Arnold , let 's be frank , lacks the charm to animate or enliven this dross .
With this new release failing to hit number one , and with Demi Moore 's career stuck in the basement ( last summer Newsweek candidly mused , "" Why is this woman paid all this money when she has n't had a hit in years ? "" ) , and with Stallone 's still trapped in some action - bozo holding pattern , it 's tempting to envisage - and raise a glass to - the slow demise of the entire Planet Hollywood plutocracy .
With the likely exception of Bruce Willis , who , like the poor , and like poor movies , seems destined always to be with us ."
"She 's innocent , yet feisty , according to Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Which is why , apparently , he chose her to star alongside him in this month 's satanic blockbuster , End of Days .
It certainly is n't the inconsequential wife - or - girlfriend part an attractive 27-year - old actress might be slotted into : Robin Tunney is cast as a millennial Mia Farrow , destined since birth to play mummies and daddies with Old Nick ( played by Gabriel Byrne ) sometime before midnight on 31 December 1999 and usher in a new century of fire and brimstone - unless the Austrian Oak can intervene .
Interviewers have been tempted to present Tunney as the Alanis Morissette of Hollywood starlets , because of her predilection for dark , angsty roles .
True , she 's played a disaffected punk in Empire Records ( 1995 ) , and a telekinetic teen in the high - school pic The Craft ( 1996 ) .
So she 's not exactly Meg Ryan .
Glib explanations for her affinity with the tormented and her compulsion to tackle tough parts range from her Irish - Catholic background ( her father , Patrick , came to the US as a teenager ) , to her strong family work ethic ( dad sold cars ; mother was a bartender ) to her being the youngest of four children .
Tunney 's breakthrough came as a young woman afflicted with Tourette 's syndrome in 1997 's Niagara , Niagara .
On the road to Niagara Falls with her lover , her character 's medication runs out , causing her to become increasingly unstable and abusive .
It was the showy , physical kind of role that attracts awards and , while the project was probably too low - key to win an Oscar , she did pick up the Best Actress award at the 1997 Venice Film Festival for the role . '
I do n't know if casting directors go "" Hey , we 've got another suicide - let 's call Robin Tunney "" , ' she says . '
It 's weird , but they 're all different , and I guess it gives the characters some kind of power .
At least I play women who are strong enough to take the power into their own hands !
And kill themselves !
So many women in films should just shoot themselves in the head anyway , because they 're not really there for any reason . '
In the flesh , though , journalists seem to find her far more affable than her on - screen image would suggest , and Tunney ( or more probably her publicist ) seems keen to tone down the despair in her recent photoshoots .
But it would appear she is still , for the moment , resisting the kind of light ,
FHM -friendly roles that might propel her into the Cameron Diaz / Drew Barrymore league .
Next up is The Vertical Limit , in which she stars as a world - class mountain climber ( she was , it seems , unperturbed by the eight weeks of gruelling training required ) .
In the meantime , End of Days took $ 31.5 million in its opening weekend in the US , which should mean from now on , even if she continues to mine the seam of disaffection and isolation , at least the paydays will probably be bigger ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger is extraordinary .
His face is so familiar , so cartoonishly iconographic , that simply to look at him feels like falling headlong into an Andy Warhol painting .
He seems to have pectorals in his cheekbones and a six - pack in his lips .
Set with cement - solid purpose , he resembles some heroic Soviet statue , giving nothing away , save for indomitable purpose .
He seems to be more an object than a man .
Something to be worshipped rather than loved .
Perhaps that 's the way he always wanted it .
Up close , he is - as you 'd expect - big , tall and wide .
But the biggest thing about him is his presence .
It is gargantuan , presidential in its authority .
Like everything about him , this authority is contrived - but so seamlessly contrived as to appear utterly natural .
Even before anyone ever believed in him , Arnie believed completely in himself and set out to turn himself into a myth .
Eventually we all bought into it .
The myth , helped nicely along by his carefully sculpted body and stoic Aryan face , is the self - created fable of invincibility . ""
For me and my career , "" he says , "" the image has been everything .
More important than the reality .
The most powerful thing is what people perceive and believe about me . ""
When I met Schwarzenegger last week , he 'd marched into Britain to promote his latest movie , End of Days .
Directed by Peter Hyams , it is a millennial tale of a former cop ( played by Arnie ) trying to save the world from Satan .
The initial attention - grabbing plan for the film 's premiere was to have Arnie drive a speedboat up the Thames and into Surrey Quays , in London 's Docklands , where the premiere was being held in the local UCI multiplex - to be greeted by a huge crowd of locals .
Sadly , the speedboat ride was rained off .
But , still , Arnie made one hell of an entrance .
As he and co - star Gabriel Byrne swaggered down the 12-foot - wide red carpets that led into the cinema , they were greeted with positively hysterical acclaim .
Hordes of scruffy south - east London herberts bawled out , "" Hasta la vista , baby , hasta la vista "" with the kind of dedicated passion they might normally reserve for , "" We are Millwall .
No one likes us .
We do n't care . ""
For a moment , you could almost be convinced that Arnie was still the biggest movie star in the world .
For a moment , just for a moment , he was right back up there again .
Inside the cinema , minutes before the movie rolled , Arnie mounted the stage and gave the assembled critics , celebrities and hangers - on a little speech .
More like a pep talk really .
On just how great the new movie was .
He ended with the words , "" Goodnight , London , I 'll be back . ""
Then , without further ado , the movie began .
And then he was up there on the screen , sounding the same , looking the same .
For the first 20 minutes , it 's hard to distinguish between fantasy and reality .
With Arnie , of course , it 's always been difficult to know where image ends and reality begins .
He 's never given the impression of being like anybody else .
Unlike , say , David Bowie or Madonna , whose reinvention of themselves always seemed playful and quite deliberately theatrical , Arnie 's self - invention has always appeared to come out of a raw need to prove himself .
His metamorphosis from smalltown Austrian weakling to champion bodybuilder , then Hollywood superstar , has always been inextricably linked to his sense of survival and superiority .
Possibly one and the same thing in Arnie 's case .
During his early bodybuilding days , he famously remarked , in words all too reminiscent of Nietzsche 's Thus Spake Zarathrustra : "" I look down on people who are helpless . ""
So , when Arnie is asked what frightens him , he sounds somewhat unconvincing when he replies , "" I think the same things as other people .
I think everything that scares anyone else scares me .
I 'm not like you see me on the screen -
a guy that 's not scared of anything .
I 'm as vulnerable as anyone else is , and that 's it .
"" It is probably the only lie he tells during the course of our interview .
Arnie , so the legend goes , worked out and built himself up - to the point where he became larger than life .
A living myth .
A living legend .
The legend is largely true .
Arnie , who dominated the global box office for more than 15 years , did indeed turn himself from a skinny Austrian nobody into an American Ubermensch .
To this day , he holds dual nationality .
As an Austrian and an American , he exhibits both Teutonic determination and new - world optimism .
He once famously proclaimed that , though he was born in Austria , it was America that made him .
And America is where Arnie 's ambitions were always focused .
When he was just 13 , he told his father he would run away to Hollywood to become a film star .
His father , presumably a good judge of character , believed him .
Purpose , perseverance and control are what Arnie is all about .
That , in a nutshell , is what that look and body convey .
Schwarzenegger is not so much an actor as an athlete , perpetually attempting to outperform his competitors and outrun himself .
He assaulted Hollywood with the same pathological focus and missionary zeal he previously brought to his body - building career .
However , once serious to the point of being po - faced , he has of late introduced irony and self - deprecating humour to his repertoire .
Particularly in his dealings with the media .
From his earliest days in Hollywood , he demonstrated a remarkable ability for self - promotion .
"" I 'm a salesman , "" he once claimed .
"" I know exactly what it takes .
"" It would seem that little has changed .
The product is still Arnie and , boy , is he going to sell it .
Whatever it takes .
Up close and personal , he is indefatigably affable and humorous .
An easy man to warm to .
It 's only when you later step back and listen to his disembodied voice on tape that you begin to suspect that all this good humour is just part of the hard sell .
It 's the same with his appearance .
Dressed in a long black jacket and dark trousers , with immaculate two - day stubble , he looks exactly as he does in End of Days .
With anyone else , you might suppose this was simply a happy coincidence .
With Arnie , you kind of know that this perfectly dishevelled chic is all part of the act .
He wants us to believe in his new , world - saving role .
With Arnie , it 's now soft sell as hard sell .
It 's simply what 's required at a point when his career is , undeniably , on the slide .
Like fellow action heroes Stallone and Willis , Arnie attempted to cast himself against type during the 1990s , in movies such as Junior , Kindergarten Cop and Jingle All the Way .
But the humour of these films depended wholly on a single joke .
A superhuman Terminator like Schwarzenegger being pregnant , in charge of toddlers , or succumbing to the pressures of Christmas shopping .
Stallone and Willis had always played parts that suggested a certain emotional frailty .
Arnie , on the other hand , had become famous for playing an emotionless automaton .
By the mid-90s , he was trapped .
"" I did n't consciously attempt to avoid doing action movies , "" he says .
"" For a while , I wanted to try something different .
But I could n't have kept making the kind of action movies I was doing in the 80s .
Action movies are different now .
The audience expects them to be different .
They still like the action , they still like the visual effects , the great stunts , and all those things , but they also like it to be a thinking person 's movie . ""
Since 1997 , following a string of flops , a heart operation and the sudden slump of Planet Hollywood , the restaurant chain he part - owns , he has started to look as vulnerable as that other former icon of invincibility , Mike Tyson .
In LA 's bars and studios , Perrier - sipping cynics reckon Arnie 's time has come and gone .
Box office returns would suggest that they are not entirely wrong .
End of Days was widely regarded as his make or break .
His do or die .
Arnie 's last stand .
And End of Days is not doing all that well .
Imagine a hybrid of The Omen and Commando .
Or a shotgun marriage between Stigmata and The World is Not Enough .
While the latter two movies , released at the same time as Arnie 's latest , have cleaned up at the box - office , End of Days has yet to come anywhere near to recouping its $ 85 m investment .
Having built up his edifice on the illusion of almost Hitlerian supremacy , Arnie , like Tyson , is finding that the myth only holds up so long as the public can be convinced of that supremacy .
As soon as things take a downward turn , the illusion is shattered .
His heart surgery served to prove that Arnie was not quite the invulnerable man - machine his roles had led us to believe he was .
His recent movie flops served as a reminder that no movie star , even Arnie , is immune to box - office failure .
While appearing to be acutely aware of this , Arnie has turned what might to others seem to be an insuperable obstacle into simply another challenge .
He gives the impression that nothing , not even failure , can come between him and success .
"" There 's two points here , "" he tells me .
"" One is connected with the physical baggage that I bring to the table .
When people see you almost as a machine , then they are shocked and amazed when something goes wrong with your body .
Like when I underwent the heart surgery .
Because I was originally known as the guy with the perfect body , people found it hard to believe that my body was as vulnerable as the next guy 's .
After something like that , I was n't so much concerned how it would affect me .
It was far more important to convince the world that it had n't affected me .
To convince the world I was OK and that I was back -
that was the big concern for me .
That 's why I took on the role in End of Days .
It 's a very physical role .
"" The second thing is about box - office .
I think that you can make movies that are hits and movies that are failures .
The only difference is that , if you make a few failures in a row , people start to doubt you .
I do n't think there 's anyone that expects to have hits all the time .
From time to time , you 'll make a decision that is wrong , or sometimes the director does not see the picture clearly .
"" There was a time in the late 80s and early 90s when Schwarzenegger movies sold themselves .
Back then , he would do the bare minimum of promotional interviews .
Nowadays , despite the fact that he is more famous than Jack Nicholson or Dustin Hoffman - who have no need and even less desire to talk to the press - Arnie has made himself globally available .
He travels the world with a team of PRs and minders .
By all accounts , he expects his team to be as ruthlessly organised and winningly ebullient as himself .
"" I do n't take any shit , "" he declares , sounding much as he did in the first Terminator movie .
"" I have to be a bit of a five star general .
I have no time for slacking off or failure .
Everyone knows that I 'm a tolerant guy .
But everyone also knows I do n't like laziness .
If you want to be part of the team , then you have to go and kick butt .
"" If you do n't like that kind of pressure then get the hell out .
Like , if someone flies with me to seven different countries , I do n't want them telling me they 've got problems with sleeping .
Or they 've got jetlag , or they 're tired .
Who cares ?
Go home , man .
Go to bed .
We 'll bring someone else in .
That 's not what I need .
I have to be up .
Sometimes I have to fly 13 hours a day .
So I need a team that is as enthusiastic and as quick and as organised as I am .
I demand certain things .
I do n't blame anyone if they mess up .
I just have to bring someone else in that can do the job . ""
A very reasonable man , then .
He does n't blame people .
He just sacks them .
In the past , Arnie did not particularly care who he talked to , providing they were carefully chosen and there were n't too many of them .
For End of Days , however , he has covered the waterfront , allowing everyone from The Big Issue to Tina Brown 's Talk magazine into his presence .
Where previously he might only have appeared on Johnny Carson , he 's now perfectly happy to shoot the shit with Jonathan Ross , Johnny Vaughan , et al .
To give him the benefit of the doubt for a moment , this media saturation might just indicate a new - found enthusiasm on his part to communicate with as many as possible .
On the other hand , the almost Grecian opulence of the End of Days post - movie premiere party had the vague whiff of desperation about it .
Half - a - dozen smouldering cars hung from the ceiling as rubber - clad go - go dancers leapt from vehicle to vehicle .
Every possible drink was free .
A dodgems rink had been installed .
The chill - out room had been done out as a Satanic chapel , complete with three four - poster beds for the more carnally inclined .
All well and good .
Except that End of Days , the movie , is frankly a long way from justifying this kind of hype .
Still , you ca n't blame Arnie for the big push .
Essentially , despite his more media - friendly profile , he is the same as ever .
Pushing himself and selling himself , in competition with no one but himself .
His problem is , however , that he is now trapped by the persona he created more than 30 years ago in an Austrian gym .
Valued at more than $ 120 m , married to a Kennedy , with an art collection to match Jeffrey Archer 's , he should n't lose too much sleep over the fact that his movies no longer rake in the pot like they used to .
And , to be fair to him , he does n't .
Arnie is eternally , almost supernaturally , optimistic .
Things will work out .
He will be back .
It is rumoured that he might yet stand for the American senate , or even the Austrian presidency ; rumours he chooses neither to confirm nor deny .
With his movie career in precarious balance , a move into politics might not seem like a bad option .
Far - fetched perhaps .
But , then again , given America 's proclivity for politician actors and Austrian political tendencies , he would seem to have at least an outside chance .
Whatever he decides , it will have little to do with either showbiz or politics and everything to do with his desire to be king of the hill .
"" Being Number One is still the important thing , "" he says .
"" Being a winner .
That 's what gives me the most satisfaction .
Because , really , there 's nothing quite like winning . ""
Ask him if he expects to get back on top and he flashes you a look that says , "" Do n't doubt it for a moment . ""
With a look like that , the kind of look that brooks no argument , how could he possibly fail ?
Because failure is strictly off the map .
"" I 'll be back , "" he smiles , echoing his most famous and oft - repeated line , with a knowing wink .
The screaming kids that greet him at the south - east London cinema still believe in that look , still believe that Arnie is the invincible Aryan Ubermensch all of us once believed in .
However , behind Arnie 's wink and smile , there 's surely a man who knows that he 's got further to fall than any of us ."

There is a lot of raw animal talent in Hollywood - literally .
A few weeks ago a spokeswoman for Disney said that the company had found "" exceptional live dog talent "" for the forthcoming 102 Dalmations , and now director Frank Darabont is waxing lyrical about the star of his film , The Green Mile .
No , not Oscar - tippedTom Hanks , but a mouse .
Yet it was n't easy casting exactly the right rodent for the adaptation of Stephen King 's best - selling novel .
Darabont held a number of auditions to cast the mouse that becomes a vehicle for the magical powers of a prisoner on Death Row : "" we had about two dozen mice and we probably used a core group of a half a dozen of the most talented ones .
We brought them onto the set and if they got bored or distracted you 'd just replace them . ""
But the mice delivered the goods .
Darabont reveals that there were hardly any graphics used for the mice scenes - it was all real .
He says , "" In the film there 's a grand total of five seconds worth , but everything you see , 99.99 per cent of it , is for real .
When he 's charging up the mile it looks like a little wind - up toy -
that 's a real mouse .

"Here is a portrait of the future .
A future where humankind is under threat from hugely powerful and self - determining computers .
This was the world of Arnold Schwarzenegger 's Terminator , of Philip K. Dick and Dr
Who , of mad scientists - until last week .
Now it is a deadly serious projection of a technological Armageddon , being examined in the office of the world 's most powerful man .
A 20,000-word essay written by leading software innovator Bill Joy , published in the magazine Wired , has proved so provocative that President Bill Clinton 's office requested a copy .
The tract , titled ' Why The Future Does n't Need Us , ' argues that new twenty - first century technologies of digital , biological and material science present us with dangers at least as fearsome as nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , if not more so , and suggests that accelerating technological change could cause ' something like extinction ' of human beings within two generations .
Joy 's critique is not so much remarkable for its message - there have always been social critics and marginalised scientists warning of danger in the progress of technology - but because it came from within the highest reaches of a technological establishment that rarely breaks rank in offering an optimistic future of the new sciences as wealth and health enhancing . '
Finally , someone who is responsible for creating significant parts of today 's technological infrastructure is voicing the concerns that have been labelled "" Luddite "" when voiced by others , ' says Howard Rheingold , founder of
The Well , a pioneering Bay Area Internet community in San Francisco . '
Technology is a wonderful vehicle , but we have no road map , headlights , or rear - view mirror . '
Joy , co - founder and Chief Scientist at Sun Microsystems , the Silicon Valley software giant , said his warning was meant to be reminiscent of Albert Einstein 's famous 1939 letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt , alerting him to the possibility of an atomic bomb .
But Einstein 's warning at the dawn of the nuclear age was directed towards a small number of decision makers .
Joy , by contrast , set his sights on a far larger community of technologists and scientists , funded by private enterprise , unconstrained by government - potentially more difficult forces to rein in .
In the twentieth century , he points out , ' building nuclear weapons required , at least for a time , access to both rare - indeed , effectively unavailable - raw materials and highly protected information . '
But the twenty - first century technologies - genetics , nanotechnology and robotics - are so powerful that they can spawn whole new classes of accidents and abuses .
For the first time , these accidents and abuses are within the reach of individuals or small groups .
Knowledge alone will enable the use of them . '
And Joy certainly fears the worst : ' I think it is no exaggeration to say we are on the cusp of the further perfection of extreme evil , an evil whose possibility spreads well beyond that which weapons of mass destruction bequeathed to the nation - states , on to a surprising and terrible empowerment of extreme individuals . '
Within scientific and technological communities , Joy 's doomsday scenario has been welcomed as an articulate exercise but one that underestimates the profound benefits technology has brought and promises in the future . '
Bill Joy is probably the most influential commentator at present because he 's spreading a message that makes people anxious , ' says Charles Platt , a science writer at Wired . '
Anything that creates fear get a lot of attention
but it 's bad news for people if they want , say , genetically engineered medicine to avoid age - related diseases or to avoid getting killed by the next global viral plague that comes along . '
Nathan Myhrvold , a theoretical physicist who studied under Stephen Hawking and is currently on sabbatical from his job as chief technology officer at Microsoft , pointed out that such dire predictions are usually inspired by fear of change . '
Every other "" unprecedented "" challenge of the past has been overcome , ' he says .
' Is this case really different ?
Or are we once again falling into the trap of overestimating technology 's downside and underestimating people 's ability to cope ? '
Bruce Sterling , the techno guru who was among the first cyberpunk writers , takes a wry approach : ' I 'm touched by the guy 's sincerity .
It 's clear he 's troubled by this issue and thought it was something he ought to share with the rest of us .
He 's clearly gone to pains to research the issues , to look for other people who might have shared his problems in the past , and he hit on an excellent one with Robert Oppenheimer .
But if you 're going to have an Oppenheimer moment my feeling is you should have it before you detonate the device . '
The author 's apocalyptic vision of the future centres on new technologies which will be able to replicate themselves , without human help - nightmarish scenarios in which technologies exceed man 's power to control them .
By using the struggle to limit nuclear , chemical and biological weapons as his inspiration , Joy concludes by proposing that we stop to consider where our progress is leading before we enable our own extinction . '
The only realistic alternative I see is relinquishment : to limit development of the technologies that are too dangerous , by limiting our pursuit of certain kinds of knowledge . '
If Joy 's fear of twenty - first century technologies is exaggerated , his arguments have at least opened up a debate over whether technology fits the society we want . '
He is making the case for technological determinism - if I can do something , I will do it - but that has been proven not to be the case , ' says Dr Charles Bugliarello , chancellor of Polytechnic University in Brooklyn . '
There is a constant see - saw between technological advances and societal advancement .
Sometimes machines are ahead , then society adjusts .
In other cases , society advances and then machines catch up .
The essential issue is that machines have not had the benefit of the evolutionary process that biological organisms have had .
Their development has been so rapid that we do n't have a way of checking whether their development makes sense . '
For Jason Lanier , a pioneer in the field of virtual reality , one remedy would be to reject machine - centred designs that supplant human decision - making .
A simple example of this is the common function in word processors that inserts capital letters at the start of sentences and periods at the end .
Joy 's concerns centre on three areas , many of which have been addressed by science - fiction writers and technologist - authors such as Ray Kurzweil in The Age of Spiritual Machines : When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence , Hans Moravec in Robot : Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind , and George Dyson in Darwin Among the Machines : The Evolution of Global Intelligence .
Joy predicts that by 2030 , computers will be a million times more powerful than today , lending the possibility that robots may exceed humans in intelligence and have the ability to replicate themselves .
Primitive examples of the kind of thing Joy is talking about include ' replication attacks ' in the virtual world of computer viruses , the kind which have caused shutdowns of Internet sites and e - mail systems .
He also points to nanotechnology - the science of creating minute machines atom by atom - that could in time produce tiny , self - reproducing mechanisms , and warns these could wreak havoc if released accidently or by malicious intent .
In genetics , he supposes that the widening availability of knowledge about powerful genetic engineering could lead to a ' white plague ' - an artificially designed disease that can kill selectively .
In making his argument , Joy finds he 's walking in the shoes of Theodore Kaczynski , the lapsed scientist widely discredited as a madman who conducted a 17-year bombing campaign against scientists in protest at technology , the so - called ' Unabomber ' .
Though he unequivocally condemns Kaczynski 's use of violence , he notes he now shares the jailed bomber 's terror of the ' unintended consequences , a well - known problem with the design and use of technology ' .
Like Kaczynski , Joy fears the potential positive applications of science are outweighed by the dangers : ' I have always believed making software more reliable , given its many uses , will make the world a safer and better place , ' Joy writes . '
If I were to come to believe the opposite , then I would be morally obligated to stop this work .
I can now imagine that such a day may come . '"

The third instalment in the Terminator series looks in the direst trouble after James Cameron , director of the first two movies , absolutely - positively confirmed that he will not be returning for a third bite at the cherry . ""
Not gon na do it , "" Cameron quipped brusquely to reporters at a film premiere this week , and his insistence leaves the project up in the air .
Up until recently , original star Arnold Schwarzenegger was enthusiastic about reprising his role as the indestructible agent of vengeance , and assured journalists that the film would shoot this year .
But his involvement was always on the assumption that his old friend Cameron was behind the camera .
With Cameron gone , it seems certain that Arnie will bail out too .

In Big Gun Shocker ?

Ah , so on the 6th day the Lord decreed that all Hollywood stars stereotyped by appearing in muscle - bound action movies would henceforth unshackle themselves and be reborn as caring , sharing liberals ?
That 's cynical .
Be fair to Arnie : he 's not a muscle - bound lug any more , he 's a hugely versatile actor .
He made Twins , for God 's sake !
And he 's upset about all the killing ' n ' that : Columbine High and that other shooting - Vietnam , was it ?
Ca n't you feel his pain when he says : "" If people say movies lead to violence , we should make a concession . ""

Who can possibly follow the footsteps , or indeed fill the ripped clothes of previous Incredible Hulk , Lou Ferrigno ?
Ed Nicholson , Ladbrokes ' entertainment odds compiler , reckons there 's a very obvious choice . ""
Arnold Schwarzenegger is fit , loved by the public , and used to be a body builder "" , says Ed .
As a cult TV series with a long fan base , the Hulk should be someone who is a little long in the tooth .
"" I think the part is made for him - it would also appeal to his sense of humour . ""
But considering that the film version of the Marvel comic strip is to be scripted with both the kitsch and the serious filmgoer in mind , and could well develop into a summer blockbuster , maybe a younger actor would fit the bill . ""
Ben Affleck has the handsome chiselled features "" , observes Ed .
He has got a very nice torso , too . ""
That could work well .
He is also someone that the youngsters will want to go and see , and has been involved with action movies .
But whether he 'd want to rip his expensive clothes up to get the part is a different question altogether .
"" Ripe for the part is Nicholas Cage , having just had his biggest film opening with Gone
In 60 Seconds .
He has completed quite a few thinking - man 's action flicks and is basically a cheap version of Tom Cruise . ""
Or perhaps Antonio Banderas is the man .
His body is sure to go down well . ""
"" Finally what about Keith Chegwin ?
I think I speak for all of us who witnessed his naked torso recently on television ( among other smaller parts of the body ) , when I say we would certainly like to see more colour in those cheeks - but green would n't be an appropriate one . ""
Interview by Jennifer Rodger"
""" If I go to Russia , when I was in China or when I go anywhere in Europe or in Africa , it 's the most asked question , ' Will you do another Terminator ' ? ""
Now Arnold Schwarzenegger has made the heart of a thousand fan boys leap - he 's announced that , yes , he will make another Terminator movie .
Arnie last starred as cinema 's favourite cyborg in T2 ( 1991 ) , having introduced the character in Terminator in 1984 .
After insisting in recent years that he 'd never make T3 , the Austrian man - mountain now says , "" I like the idea , but it 's not only me .
I always go by what the people out there in the world would like to see . ""
Schwarzenegger 's one reservation concerns T1 and 2 's director James Cameron .
Arnie insists that the Oscar - winning helmer do T3 - but Cameron has said he is not interested in the movie .
In an interview with Access Hollywood , Arnie says he hopes Cameron will change his mind : "" A script is being written as we speak and it 's a film that Jim will definitely produce .
If he will direct it or not , I do n't know yet because he never makes up his mind until the script is all done and perfect . ""
Terminator co - stars Linda Hamilton ( Cameron 's ex - wife ) and Edward Furlong are both said to be interested in reprising their roles .
There remain , however , inconsistencies in Arnie 's statements .
Independent producers Andrew Vajna and Mario Kassar have bought the rights to the franchise , and are set to make instalments 3 and 4 on their own .
At the present time , Kassar is apparently keen for Arnie to come on board , but Cameron is definitely out of the picture .
Describing the direction the films would take , Vajna and Kassar 's colleague at the production company C-2 , James Middleton , said : "" T3 will be present - day , 2000 , about the first engagement between Skynet and humans , and about the beginning of the war . ""
The fourth movie will be set in the future , "" after the nuclear conflagration has ended .
There will be a protector Terminator , and an antagonist machine . """
"James Cameron will not direct Terminator 3 although Arnold Schwarzenegger remains on board .
Associates of the Terminator and Terminator 2 director cite irreconcilable differences with producers Mario Kassar and Andy Vajna .
Kassar and Vajna are now looking at a shortlist of new directors for the next instalment of the franchise .
That hotlist - from which the ultimate selection must be approved by Arnie - includes Ridley Scott , Fight Club helmsman David Fincher and Independence Day 's Roland Emmerich , as well as Christian Duguay , who directed a Joan of Arc TV mini - series in the US .
Cameron 's long - time producing partner , Rae Sanchini , said : "" I do n't think [ Cameron ] has talked to Mario or Andy about this in over a year . ""
Acknowledging that Cameron and Schwarzenegger had worked well together in the past , Sanchini nevertheless insisted : "" Yes , they are fabulous friends , and yes , they love working together , but no , he wo n't be directing the movie . ""
While Cameron says hasta la vista to the long - awaited sequel , details have been released about Arnie 's evil alter - ego .
It was already established that Schwarzenegger 's ageing android would be battling a state - of - the - art , next - generation Terminator - now we hear that this mechanic menace will be female .
Rumours that Demi Moore is already in training for the role have been hotly denied ."

Star Wars fansite TheForce.net reports that muscleman Arnold Schwarzenegger has challenged the sci - fi saga 's muppet grandmaster , Yoda , to a fight .
Arnie contemplated the face - off in a response to an email on his official website , which asked who would win in a tussle between the Jedi veteran and the last action hero .
Says Arnie : "" This is the funniest question anyone 's ever asked me .
Actually , I 've seen the Star Wars films a few times [ and ] what I can say about Yoda is that he 's character with a strong , serious mind and a disciplined will .
To become a Jedi Master , Yoda would have had to work very hard and make tremendous sacrifices .
By now , I think you 'll see what I 'm getting at : becoming a Jedi Master is not unlike becoming a champion bodybuilder , or becoming an actor .
and that takes discipline and willpower first .

"' It was in Graz that I built up my biceps from 14 inches to 19 inches ' , quivered a proud Arnold Schwarzenegger at the ceremony held by Sturm Graz in 1997 to honour their favourite son . '
I always dreamed of being a bodybuilder and going to Hollywood
but I never dreamed I would make it this big . '
In this case , making it big meant having the small - town Austrian club name their stadium after him .
The good people of Graz clearly forgave Arnie for leaving Austria the minute his biceps hit the 20-inch mark .
Since they began playing at the Arnold Schwarzenegger Stadium , Graz , then managed by former Bayern Munich defender Klaus Augenthaler ( pictured , left ) , have won successive Austrian league titles and are the surprise team of this year 's Champions League , having beaten Rangers , Monaco and Galatasaray at home to qualify for the second phase and another crack at Manchester United .
United defeated Graz home and away in the first phase last season .
The Austrians have beefed up since then , though .
Current manager Ivica Osium , Augenthaler 's Yugoslav successor , has signed the unpredictable Russian Sergei Yuran ( centre ) .
The 31-year - old forward scored four of the 11 goals that helped Sturm top their group .
Yuran has been a revelation in Austria .
The man nicknamed ' The Tank ' bears no resemblance to the player who in 1996 made a dozen appearances for Millwall .
Mick McCarthy , then manager at the New Den , signed Yuran on loan from Spartak Moscow , along with compatriot Vasili Kulkov .
On signing Yuran said : ' We have played for some great clubs in Europe but this is the pinnacle of our careers ' .
Derision followed diplomacy - Millwall 's fans soon rumbled Yuran as more ' Pie ' than ' Tank ' .
Jimmy Nicholl , who replaced McCarthy , described Yuran as ' definitely the worst professional I have ever seen in my life ' .
The Tank has defied his many critics since those dark days - now comes the chance to make Arnie proud .
Hasta la Vista , Fergie .

"After a spate of mediocre movies and lukewarm box - office , Arnold Schwarzenegger must be hoping that the long - awaited second sequel to Terminator will put him back on track .
It 's certainly got the budget to dazzle spectators : Terminator 3 lining up to take the dubious distinction of the most expensive film ever made .
Movie spy site Coming Attractions reports that the film , tentatively scheduled for release in 2002 , will have a budget of $ 210 m ( £ 147.4 m ) , $ 10 m more than the previous record holder , Titanic .
And that 's the scaled down estimate .
Schwarzenegger told Metro newspaper on Friday : "" The two drafts I read were so big it would have cost $ 250 m to make .
So now they 're toning it down .
I think we can do it on a football field somewhere
so it does n't cost that much .
"" As we reported last summer , Schwarzenegger is overseeing rewrites of the script himself , and during promotion for his current box - office outing
The Sixth Day , the star began hinting at plot details .
The villain will be a female Terminator , he revealed .
"" She can disappear , she can mould into someone else , and she is sometimes just an energy , "" he told The New York Post , in refreshingly plain English .
Big Arn let slip more of his cunning plan to Ananova . ""
They used a girl as one of the villains in X - Men and it worked for them .
Our lady would also be very attractive and , of course , have a thing about me . ""
Lucky lass Carrie - Anne Moss ( best known for The Matrix ) is reputed to be the producers ' first choice for the role .
The current script focuses on the rise to self - awareness by global artificial intelligence system Skynet , before it turns on its makers and attempts to eliminate mankind .
Only Schwarzenegger and Edward Furlong , who played the young John Connor in Terminator 2 , have agreed to star in the movie .
As we reported earlier this month , Linda Hamilton has declined to reprise her role as feisty mum ."
"More news from Variety 's columnist Michael Fleming about Terminator 3 .
As we reported in last week 's news , Arnold Schwarzenegger told reporters that there was to be a "" sexy female villain "" for him to grapple with in the much - hyped production .
Fleming notes that Famke Janssen ( pictured ) has emerged as the frontrunner to play the female terminatrix who will be menacing poor old Arnie and his co - star Edward Furlong , who will also be reprising his T2 role .
The 35-year - old Dutch actress has more than amply proved that she can play it black .
She first came to public prominence in 1995 's GoldenEye as Xenia Zaragevna Onatopp , when she almost managed to derail James Bond with her killer thighs .
After the huge success of this summer 's X - Men , Janssen has recently signed to play the telekenetic Jean Gray once again in a sequel that is currently in pre - production ."
"You 're a big man , but you 're out of shape ...
And so , with the release of last year 's bovine millennial thriller
End
Of Days , the cry went up among the world 's movie - goers : is Arnold Schwarzenegger ( pictured ) , staunch Republican and professional Teuton , still a relevant force in modern cinema ?
And then , from a million voices , came the answer : no .
Not that anyone appears to have told the ageing he - man about the transient nature of popular culture , as he pitches up in the UK to promote the release of The Sixth Day , yet another vehicle for his rapier wit and out - size triceps , this time involving the novel Maguffin of human cloning ( think Twins , but without Danny De Vito and set in the future ) .
Which , aside from the fact it 's written by a couple called Wibberley - something I found inexplicably funny - is pretty much all there is to say about it .
The cumbersome Austrian will be entertaining the media with his noted repertoire of piquant one - liners ( "" I 'll be back""/""Hasta La Vista""/""Did you know my coronary bypass involved being fitted with a pig 's heart valve ? "" ) , before waving to the paparazzi at the film 's Leicester Square premiere this Thursday evening .
Like grunge never died ...
Meanwhile , whatever the collective noun is for thirtysomething US hairies who make their living providing a soundtrack for pubescent boys to grapple with each other while developing tinnitus , there 'll be a ( insert noun here ) of them scratching themselves at customs this week en route to the sticky floors of Britain 's concert venues .
To wit , Dave Grohl 's Foo Fighters are due over to begin a UK tour tomorrow night at the Manchester Apollo ; the profitably snotty Green Day turn up for a short stint in support of their LP , Warning ; and , last but not least , J Mascis , one - time frontman of the seminal Dinosaur Jr , drops in on Sunday to plug his album More Light .
And that , deafeningly enough , is that ."
"As reported in an earlier story , The 6th Day star Arnold Schwarzenegger stands accused of reminding female interviewers in London of one of his earliest movies : Predator .
The teutonic action hero allegedly became ' frisky ' with a gaggle of British TV presenters this week , in consecutive interviews to promote his new film .
According to reports in The Sun , Schwarzenegger grasped Boddington 's model turned TV starlet Melanie Sykes around the waist . ""
Get your hands off me -
I 'm scared , "" she is reported to have said , whereupon the married father - of - four made a lunge for Sykes ' breast instead .
The further accusations revolve around interviews the actor had with presenters Denise van Outen and Anna Richardson , also conducted in London 's Dorchester hotel .
Richardson told the tabloid : "" I wanted to say , ' You dirty bastard ' .
But you ca n't tell a powerful man like him to f * * * off ...
He kept saying how fantastic I looked and staring at my [ breasts ] .
"" At the end of the interview , claims Richardson , "" He pulled me onto his knee , saying ' I really want to know if your breasts are real ' "" Spokesperson for Schwarzenegger , Jill Eisenstadt , flatly denies the charges .
"" I was n't there .
I do n't know this woman [ Sykes ] .
But he 's always had a great relationship with journalists , and he 's always acted appropriately ...
I just do n't believe it for a second . ""
Eisenstadt pointed out that Richardson 's complaint was filed only after she was barred by Columbia Tri - Star from future interviews because of alleged improper behaviour during her meeting with Schwarzenegger .
Schwarzenegger 's lawyer Marty Singer agrees .
He says Richardson : "" Is the one who basically came on in a very provocative manner to Mr Schwarzenegger ...
Asking him to basically check her out .
She left in a very happy mood .
It 's a case of three people getting their name in the paper ...
Quite frankly , my client did n't do anything inappropriate . """
"
As film pairings go , this must be one of the most unlikely in history .
Rumour has it that Arnold Schwarzenegger ( pictured ) has tired of his tough guy image and , in a bid to make more intellectual movies , is to work with Woody Allen . ""
In the 1980s men were not very secure and were happy to see a man with muscles , "" said the former Mr Universe .
"" Now no - one is interested in that ...
[ Woody Allen and I ] are talking about the script at the moment .
"" This will presumably be alongside his commitments to the ultimate tough - guy no - brainer role he is to take in Terminator 3 next year .
 Showbiz Ireland reports that 18-year - old singing star Samantha Mumba has auditioned for a role in the new vampire movie Blade 2 .
Mumba 's manager told the site : "" I can confirm that Sam will be in America for nearly all of next year and that she has just done the screen test . ""  While the world 's press camps outside Dornoch , one person at least is unaware what all the fuss is about .
Reverend Susan Brown , who is to marry Madonna and Guy Ritchie later today , admitted she had little idea who either of them were , and no idea that they were so famous .
"" I have n't got any Madonna records , "" she told reporters .
"" I have n't seen any Guy Ritchie films , although Madonna has one named after me , I think , called Desperately Seeking Susan . """
"It is 5.30pm .
The bottle store is closed and young men are watching an Arnold Schwarzenegger video in a khaki army tent that is hot as an oven .
Women walk listlessly across the vast , dusty compound of the semi - refugee camp at Smidtsdrift in South Africa , where 4,000 !
XU and Khwe San bushmen and their families have waited over 10 years for resettlement ( the exclamation mark before names is another letter in their alphabet which produces a clicking sound ) .
Only children seem to be interested as , like latterday vaudevillians , we set up the projector , screen and generator near a large thorn tree for an open air screening of The Great Dance - a feature documentary about !
Xo San bushman hunters who live several hundred miles north , in the heart of the Kalahari desert .
Earlier in the day , Meita Gooi , a tiny chisel - cheeked bushman grandmother had announced the screening on the local radio station K - X Radio . ""
This film made my heart sore , "" her voice wavers .
"" It reminded me of the old life .
It is about people like us , about our race and it made us proud . ""
Meita and husband Piet , had been so moved by the film at an informal screening in Cape Town , that they asked the film - makers if they could take it home to show their families .
The tented camp , known as Mahongo - "" place of suffering "" - is a depressing pit - stop on the way .
Stunted trees give no relief from the blinding midday sun or the wind blowing through the camp , pirouetting in dramatic "" wind devils "" - mini tornadoes - which send dust , paper , plastic bags high into the air .
Nothing much happens here .
On a tiny fire in the centre of Katoti 's tent , a weak soup with a rotting fish head is cooking .
It has been a long time since her family has had meat .
But it used not to be like that .
Back in Namibia , her husband Peza had been a renowned hunter . ""
He hunted eland , kudu , buffalo and would bring meat to the whole village , "" she says .
"" But there is nothing here : no animals to hunt , no fruit to eat , no water , no wood or grass .
There is only air to live on .
Sometimes God brings you a good dream , sometimes he brings you a bad dream .
This is a bad dream . ""
The last 350 years in southern Africa has been devastating for the San .
In that time they have been pushed off their land , hunted with guns , forced to work on white farms and prevented from speaking their languages .
It is remarkable they have survived at all .
And it has been at least two decades since these San bushmen , former trackers with the South African Defence Force from Namibia and Angola , have lived as hunter - gatherers .
The teenagers wear baseball caps and trainers , want education and computers , while many of the older men , frustrated by loss of land and animals , drink themselves into a stupor .
Last year , The Great Dance swept the awards at Wildscreen 2000 , winning three Pandas , the equivalent of Oscars in the natural history world , and beating off competition from David Attenborough and Walking with Dinosaurs .
In New York it was highly acclaimed by the critics and in South Africa
it became the most popular feature documentary after Bueno Vista Social Club .
Co - directors Craig and Damon Foster , two South African brothers , filmed in the central Kalahari on and off for two years , travelling 50kms a day through the bush in temperatures of over 45C for a month at a time , returning to Cape Town , skeletal and dehydrated .
Their aim was to capture footage of the mythic San "" chasing hunt "" when , if poison runs out in the dry season , master hunters chase down their prey until the animal collapses from sheer exhaustion - running for hours in the midday heat , when ( in the words of the San ) , the sand "" burns like a second sun . ""
The brothers knew they were filming a lifestyle under huge pressure but had underestimated the wealth of knowledge still alive to this generation .
"" They have an understanding of the natural world which would confound the greatest western scientists .
They feel and see the bush in a way that we could hardly grasp , reading signs invisible to our eyes and hardened sensibilities , "" says Craig .
""
Each tiny mark in the sand tells a story .
They carry the weather of the last two weeks in their heads alongside an enormous understanding of tracks and animal behaviour .
These skills take at least 25 years to master . ""
The Fosters took early cuts of the film back to the hunters who helped them edit the footage and even gave them the idea to put miniature cameras on to the animals to best show what they are feeling as they hunt . ""
They explained how eventually they become the mind of their prey , how they feel the stripe of a gemsbok on their cheeks , the prickle of animal sweat on their limbs and the trickle of blood on their ribs before they make a kill .
Their hunting relies not on their weapons but on their uncanny ability to divine the animal 's movements and the mood of the winds .
It is like a sixth sense to them , "" says Craig .
"" We had no idea how important hunting was to their culture until we began filming , "" says Craig .
"" They told us that even if the animals disappeared they would still hunt , for it is about them feeling the land , being in nature , divining the weather .
It is a spiritual experience as much as it is to do with finding meat . ""
But how would the film go down at Mahongo ?
There the audience has long since given up hope of being able to hunt again .
We are worried that no one will come , but Meita Gooi 's plea across the airwaves has worked .
As daylight fades , the screen flickers over the captivated faces of at least 2,000 men , women and children sitting in the cooling sand .
They are visibly captivated as they watch !
Nqate Karoha and Xlhoase move through the bush .
They yelp in amazement at the unfurling of a giant centipede and gasp at the footage of cheetahs and snakes and , unused to film editing which compresses cooking time , howl with laughter when the hunters eat their prey .
The young men 's faces glow in some half forgotten recognition when the chasing hunt sequence sees Karoha chasing a kudu to its death .
The audience goes wild in their appreciation .
"" The San is born to be a hunter and yet I have no right to hunt , "" says Peza Dela .
The Great Dance has reminded him of his impotence .
"" If I do not hunt then I am no longer a San , it is in our blood .
I must hunt .
If you take away this right , you are trying to kill me slowly . ""
The next day Peza takes us to his tent , strips to a threadbare thong , grabs a bow and arrow and speeds out into the blinding sun .
Much to the amusement of his wife and their young grandchildren , he runs helter - skelter around the neighbours ' tents before heading for the thorny scrub beyond , bringing the bow to his shoulder and letting an arrow fly in a spinning arc to thud uselessly into the ground a good 100 metres away .
Trotting back to camp , as lithe at 68 as a dancer half his age , Peza grins in delight at his impromptu display .
"" That film woke my spirit up .
It has been a long time since I have been able to hunt .
For years I have been trying to hide from my spirit .
Now I must go back to Namibia and hunt my last eland to make the spirit of my grandfather happy . ""
He may never do it .
Six months after filming ended , all the individual hunting licences of the !
Xo San were removed .
If they are today caught hunting without a permit they risk jail and heavy fines .
Craig is appalled : "" This is devastating for them .
For the San , hunting is as important as breathing - it is a vital part of their culture , linked to story - telling and dancing , their relationship with the animals , the insects , the weather and the land - and their ancestors who have hunted this land for 30,000 years . ""

"A Berlin appeals court has upheld Arnold Schwarzenegger 's 1999 legal victory over a German cardiologist who publicly predicted that the actor would soon die from a heart condition .
A publicist for 53-year - old Schwarzenegger ( pictured ) told Reuters that the ruling , which ordered Dr Willi Heepe to pay him $ 10,300 ( £ 7,058 ) in damages and issue a retraction , had been upheld by the Berlin high court on appeal .
Heepe , who never examined Schwarzenegger , had said during a radio interview that the Austrian - born former body builder was n't likely to live much longer because of a heart condition .
Schwarzenegger had elective surgery in 1997 to repair a defective heart valve .
"" I am delighted that the Berlin high court agreed that it was wrong for Dr Heepe to make false statements about my health , "" said Schwarzenegger in a statement .
"" This reconfirms that the record must be set straight that I am in excellent health as I have been since my elective surgery in 1997 . ""
Schwarzenegger donated his winnings to Special Olympics Germany .
On his official website , he says that the Special Olympics and the Inner City Games are both causes "" very close to my heart . """
"Arnold Schwarzenegger has announced that he is considering quitting the film business and moving into politics in a bid for the governorship of California , according to reports from the BBC today .
Schwarzenegger , a staunch Republican , told the LA Times newspaper that he could run for office in as little as 12 months time .
"" I 've thought about it many times because I love politics , "" he said .
Claiming he would happily give up his film career , he told the newspaper that California was lacking in leadership at the moment .
The current governor Gray Davis has come in for widespread criticism following a state - wide electricity crisis .
"" I saw in the last 10 years that I 'm getting much more pleasure out of ( helping people ) than making money and making movies , "" the Terminator star continued . ""
And it 's increasing my desire to do that .
It can lead , and will lead , probably , to some political office . ""
If Schwarzenegger does secure the governorship he will follow in the footsteps of former actor turned politician , Ronald Reagan , who began his political career in California and eventually became president in 1980 .
The 6th Day star , however , could never hold America 's highest office as he was born in Austria ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger swears by her .
So do Jodie Foster , Cindy Crawford , and Michael J Fox .
They call her "" the baby whisperer "" , and her knack for understanding the babies of the rich and famous is something to behold .
Hand her a wailing infant with a household name , or let that infant wail down the phone , and within seconds she can tell you what he is really saying , and how to calm him down .
A word to the wise , though : if you are thinking of hiring her , your first phone call should probably be to the bank .
Tracy Hogg , Yorkshire - born nanny to the stars , does not come cheap .
Her day rate is £ 700 .
A three - week stay could set you back £ 10,000 .
But now we have read things about Hogg 's past that make you wonder how she could have had the nerve to set herself up as a child expert .
The story comes from her ex - husband , a former miner named Ray Fear , who talked to the tabloids earlier this week , to coincide with - or perhaps sabotage - the publication in Britain of her book , Secrets of the Baby Whisperer .
In it , Hogg claims that she learned most of her magic from her grandmother , and the rest from working as a nurse with disabled children .
However , Fear claims that she did little whispering with her own daughters .
There was , allegedly , no breast - feeding :
Hogg put both girls straight on the bottle and went straight back to work .
Even when they were very small , she left their care to her mother and grandmother .
Then , eight years ago , she and her second husband moved to California , leaving behind her daughters , then seven and 10 .
The latter , Sarah , now lives in Hollywood with her mother .
The younger one , Sophie , will be joining them after her GCSEs .
Hogg insists that leaving them was the right decision , and that she maintained a close relationship with the girls via school holidays and the internet .
But Fear counters that the girls were distraught when their mother moved away . ""
Sophie would say , ' Mummy is in America looking after all these babies and staying with them .
Why is n't she doing it with me ? '
"" It is a question some of her clients may be asking , too .
But is it fair to expect childcare experts to have perfect childcare records themselves ?
Before condemning Hogg , it is worth examining how her predecessors and peers have managed .
Dr Spock , for example , was incapable of the sort of warm and permissive fathering he extolled in his books . ""
He was very Victorian , "" one of his sons recalls .
He was "" never a person who gave a hug .
He could n't kiss me .
He never kissed me .
"" Spock was , at least , aware of his shortcomings ( not just as a parent but as a stepfather ) .
He even admitted them in public .
The same can not be said of the father of all childcare experts , John - Jacques Rousseau .
In Emile , the widest read manual of its time , he wrote passionately against swaddling and eloquently in defence of breastfeeding .
But he left all five of his illegitimate children to the mercy of foundling hospitals where the infant mortality rate was often as high as 100 % .
Measure Hogg against such a standard , and she comes off looking like an earth goddess .
According to Frank Furedi , a sociologist , it would be wrong to scapegoat her .
"" We do n't need to have a go at her for not being a perfect mother , "" says Furedi , author of the forthcoming Paranoid Parenting .
"" This is an impossible burden on anybody . ""
But the world would be a better place , he thinks , if we could give up on the myth of the perfect expert .
In his book , Furedi challenges the idea that anyone "" can have an expertise on a very intimate relationship and generalise from that .
It misses the fact that each relationship is unique "" .
You learn the most as a parent , he says , by spending time with children and the other parents at the school gate .
This sort of learning is best because it is rooted in "" the specificity of experiences , and the tissue of organic relationships "" .
If you take your instruction from childcare experts , "" it short - circuits this process "" .
Sheila Kitzinger , whose name is often twinned with words like expert and guru , could n't agree more .
"" We are sitting ducks .
Sometimes it 's the baby who is telling us we are doing the wrong thing , crying all day long , telling us we 're a bad mother . ""
The real problem , she says , is that "" a lot of women who have babies are socially isolated .
They were working in an office and now they are home .
There is n't anyone they can talk to , and so often because there 's so much competition to have the perfect baby , they ca n't tell anyone .
And then the experts step in . ""
Like Furedi , she does not believe they can presume to know best .
Parents , she says , learn best from each other , by "" sharing what they 've learned through experience and observation "" .
She tries to work within that tradition when she writes her books . ""
What I 'm trying to do is not talk to a woman , "" says Kitzinger , "" but talk with her .
It 's part of a discussion a sharing , an equal relationship , there are some things I know , some things she knows , and some things I 'll never know .
It is n't me dishing out the answers . ""
But according to Deborah Jackson , author of the permissive classic Three in a Bed , many readers do prefer experts who play the part .
She recalls a speech she gave a few years ago to a group of parents who were , in her view , becoming too cultish about the "" continuum concept "" .
( This is the theory that you should hold your child continuously for the first few years of life . )
She knew it was going to be a hostile audience , so she left her children at home .
The group was furious .
"" I got hammered for not bringing the children , for not putting them on view , "" she recalls .
"" They did n't just want me to parent perfectly , but parent perfectly in public . ""
Her new book , Baby Wisdom , looks at the history of of child - rearing across the world .
The idea is not to give advice , but to provide a context so that people can make their own informed and imaginative decisions .
But Jackson has had to work hard to keep the publishers from using the word "" bible "" on the cover .
She understands why it would make sense in marketing terms , and why first - time parents would warm to it .
"" It 's a terrifying experience , "" she agrees , "" and our culture does n't prepare us for it .
To get through it , you do n't need an ordinary book , you need something spiritual .
You need a bible . ""
But how awful to wake up and find out you have been mistaken for a deity .
"" What happens with many experts is that we end up deconstructing ourselves , "" Jackson points out .
"" We stake a position and we end up backing down the rest of our lives , because we see people are leaning too severely on what we have said .
So I say , ' Down with experts . '
Let 's admit there are no answers , and we are just having a discussion .
The more flawed perspectives there are , the better . ""
The trouble is - as Hogg may be learning to her cost - is that flawed perspectives do n't sell books ."
"Also known as : Arnie , Big Arn , Arnholdt , Ah - nuld , The Terminator , Governor Schwarzenegger .
I 'm sorry .
We are talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger , are n't we ?
The very same .
Teutonic star of umpteen high - octane action flicks , former Mr Universe and potential Republican governor of California .
A - ha !
So that 's what you 're on about .
After years of hovering delicately around the subject , the 53-year - old he - man has finally come out and publicly admitted that he could , possibly , at some point , vaguely think about the general idea of just maybe running for office in his adoptedhome state .
"" I 've thought about it many times , "" he recently remarked , "" because I love politics . ""
Right .
So , what 's brought this on then ?
Well , apparently it 's all to do with the electricity crisis in California , where dwindling power supplies have caused headaches across the state .
And Schwarzenegger , who blames California 's Democratic governor Gray Davis , has a plan .
What ?
He 's going to start running on an enormous treadmill with a generator strapped to his back ?
Not quite .
He 's declared that , should the crisis go on much longer
, he will have no option but to take over the reins himself .
Still , at least this way he wo n't be running for president .
Do n't bet against it .
Recently asked whether he could even campaign for the White House as a naturalised US citizen , he blithely replied : "" Well , you 'd have to redo the constitution .
But they 've had so many amendments that it 's not really a problem . ""
Oh dear .
And do we actually know any of his policies ?
Not keen on single parents .
Big on exercise .
OK .
So , next stop the governor 's mansion .
Could be .
Most likely to say : "" I 'll be back - in 2004 ! ""
Also quite likely to say : "" Hasta la vista , Mr Davis . """
"A jury in Ann Arbor , Michigan , yesterday resolved a long - running plagiarism suit by naming Detroit teacher Brian Webster as the bona - fide author of the 1996 Arnold Schwarzenegger film Jingle All the Way .
The film 's backers , Fox , were ordered to pay out a whopping $ 15 m ( £ 10.26 m ) in compensation , plus $ 4 m ( £ 2.73 m ) legal costs .
One would have imagined that few people would want to claim credit for Jingle All the Way , a duff Yuletide tale in which Arnie pants and wheezes his way through town in search of a Christmas gift for his son .
But biology teacher Webster claims that Fox stole his idea for the film after reading the script he sent in .
His lawsuit contended that the film 's credited screenwriter , "" Ed McQueen "" , was actually a pseudonym for Fox script reader Randy Kornfield .
After weighing up the evidence , the jury agreed with him and ruled for the little David instead of the multinational Goliath .
Fox must now pay $ 15 m ( £ 10.26 m ) to Murray Hill Productions , the small independent company which bought the film 's rights from Webster .
It is thought that Webster will walk away with a sizeable portion of that sum .
"" I 'm delighted for Brian Webster , who is the rightful creator of this project , "" Murray Hill president Robert Laurel said yesterday .
"" Hopefully it will send a message that you ca n't take the little guy 's work and pass it off as your own . ""
Fox said that it will appeal against the ruling .
In the meantime , Webster is jingling all the way to the bank ."
"James Cameron 's modern sci - fi classic cost all of $ 6 m in 1984 ( $ 100 m for T2 , and for T3 next year - gawd knows . )

The fantasy of an unstoppable , implacable "" cyborg "" ( Arnold Schwarzenegger ) sent from a repressive post - nuclear future to kill Sarah Connor ( Linda Hamilton ) , the mother of a yet - to - be - born resistance fighter , is deliriously exciting from the first frame .
Cameron 's direction is virile and stylish , and the great Austrian - American himself is magnificent .
That unclothed frame makes you realise that we talk about "" pecs "" far too casually these days .
Now those were pecs .

"Arnie fans who were losing sleep following February 's news that the muscle - bound star was looking to move into the world of politics can sleep easy again .
Arnold Schwarzenegger has announced that he is opting out of the race to become a Republican governor of California in 2002 , saying his film career and family have taken precedence .
With two film projects in the works , Schwarzenegger fears he does not have the time to pursue a political career at the moment .
He will focus instead on finishing a sequel to True Lies , and production will begin later this year on Terminator III .
"" I have to be selfless at this point ... and take care of those things , "" the 53-year - old actor told the Los Angeles Times .
"" The movie projects came together ... I have to keep up my end of the deal . ""
But he is not abandoning the idea of running for office as a Republican , only postponing his plunge into politics until his four children , ages 3 to 11 , are older , he told the Times yesterday .
The Austrian - born former bodybuilder , whose film credits include Pumping Iron and Total Recall as well as the hugely successful Terminator duo , was rumoured to be running for governor back in March after he criticised the current governor for California 's handling of the electricity crisis .
Shortly afterwards , allegations of sexual harassment were levelled at Schwarzenegger , which prompted Sharon Stone , Jamie Lee Curtis and several other of his co - stars to rally to the actor 's defence .
Schwarzenegger has long been a Republican activist despite his marriage to Maria Shriver , a niece of former Democratic president John F. Kennedy .
A move into politics would echo that of another actor - turned politician , ex - president Ronald Reagan ."
"The future of two recently completed big budget Hollywood films are in doubt today after their content was judged to be too close to yesterday 's events in New York and Washington .
The release of Warner 's Collateral Damage , which stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as a man whose family is killed when a city skyscraper is hit by a bomb blast , has been indefinitely postponed .
The film 's title refers to innocent people who lose their lives as the result of being in the wrong place at the wrong time .
Meanwhile , Touchstone Pictures have cancelled this weekend 's press junket for the Barry Sonnenfeld comedy Big Trouble .
The film , which stars Tim Allen and Rene Russo , centres around a mysterious suitcase , which turns out to be a bomb .
Later in the film , the bomb ends up on an airborne jet .
Studio executives for both films will meet today to discuss the future of both projects ."
"Had the events of Tuesday never happened , Arnold Schwarzenegger would have exploded on to movie screens all over America in a Warner Bros film called Collateral Damage on Friday October 5 .
Hollywood never lost money by being tactful but
even the money - men in the studios appreciate that it is possible sometimes to be too topical .
As one of the producers said : "" This picture is so on the money it 's unbelievable .
It 's just too painful for people . ""
In Collateral Damage , the grunting Teuton plays a firefighter , Gordon Brewer , whose wife and young son perish when terrorists blow up a Los Angeles skyscraper .
Graphic visuals , of course , of the building coming down .
In the initial story , the terrorists were Middle - Eastern .
But the director , Andrew Davis , decided , on reflection , to make them Colombian , because , as he blandly observed , "" there are too many pictures showing Arab terrorists "" .
After the skyscraper falls , burying his loved ones in the rubble , Brewer decides to embark on a one - man vengeance raid to Central America .
He ca n't speak Spanish , but - what the hell - everyone understands a karate chop to the throat or a kick in the balls .
The language of violence never fails .
We have seen Arnie do this before , in Commando , for instance .
But Collateral Damage is not , we are led to believe , just another bang - and - blast kind of movie .
It has real depth .
Schwarzenegger ( whose career has been in the doldrums since his heart bypass ) needs to be reinvented as a thinking thug .
As he says in an interview on his website ( www.arnoldfan.com ) : "" It 's a very dramatic movie because there 's always this question that , once Brewer finds the killers , is he adding fuel to the fire ?
Does n't that make them come back and kill more Americans ? ""
Heavy stuff .
After some painful knotting of that cro - magnon brow , the muscled one puts these moral subtleties aside and goes on the customary Terminator - style rampage .
Bullets and body parts fly .
What was it that Reagan said , after watching Rambo -
"" Now I know what to do about Gadafy "" ?
Bush , I suspect , is more the electronic - golf kind of president than a movie buff .
But Collateral Damage echoes , with eerie accuracy , what Mephistophelean advisers are ( for a certainty ) whispering in those jug ears .
And , if he does n't listen to them , the same advice is spewing out of the country 's talk radio channels .
Send the Special Forces into Afghanistan , George .
Look in his eyes and blow the bastard away .
Forget "" justice "" .
This is war .
It wo n't be delayed or altered but it 's a necessary act of good taste to suppress Collateral Damage .
It 's also commercially prudent .
No one in New York is going to pay $ 10 to see computer - generated simulations of skyscrapers being blown up .
At least , not for a month or two .
One suspects , too , that when it does , belatedly , hit the screens some discreet editing will have modified key scenes .
Steven Spielberg 's AI , due for release later this month with its scenes of a flooded Manhattan , may escape modification , but a number of other in - production movies are being tweaked into acceptability .
Ever since the 1976 remake of King Kong , when the great ape transported Jessica Lange to the top of the World Trade Centre , ( and was shot down by F16 fighters ) the twin towers have been a favourite landmark setting for movies .
[ They symbolise the Big Apple , just as the Empire State Building ( where an earlier King Kong took Fay Wray ) was the icon of 1930s Manhattan . ]
The distinctive towers were to have figured as scenery in the movie Spiderman .
They were also scheduled to make a background appearance in the remake of Men in Black ( that tribute to the omnipotence of the super - technological FBI ) .
Most eerily , the pop group Coup planned to feature on the cover of their forthcoming album , Party Music , a pic ture of the Twin Towers on fire and it was about to be released .
If you can get a copy of that cover before they all go into the shredder it will be worth a fortune at Sotheby 's in 10 years ' time .
Andrew Davis 's comment about there being "" too many pictures showing Arab terrorists "" is food for thought .
Suspects ( thought to be members of al - Qaida ) are currently being questioned by the FBI .
I would like to ask them if they saw a 1996 film called Executive Decision and , if so , what they thought of it .
Executive Decision was big for a week or two that summer .
Like Collateral Damage , it was made by Warner Bros.
The cast is led by testosterone - crazy Kurt Russell .
He plays Lt Col Austin Travis , leader of an anti - terrorist operations unit .
Travis is recalled from rest and recuperation in Washington DC .
US intelligence , which never sleeps , has detected that a Muslim fanatic , Nagi Hassan ( played by David Suchet : Englishmen , Arabs ?
What 's the difference ? ) has hijacked a Boeing 747 , en route from Athens to Washington .
Hassan is a new breed of terrorist - a suicide bomber , school of Osama bin Laden .
He plans to crash the plane , loaded with nerve gas on to the Capitol building in Washington DC .
It will be a symbolic strike against the Great Satan .
And , of course , the poison will exterminate most of the population of the eastern seaboard .
"" Allah be praised , "" Suchet is made to declare , in his sinister English accent .
But not so fast , America has a secret weapon .
It 's a super - jet which can attach itself , limpet- like , to the belly of unsuspecting airliners which have been hijacked .
Thence , a squad of highly trained commandos ( led by Steven Seagal ) will take over the plane .
What follows is hokum .
Seagal is killed making the entry ; Russell resourcefully overpowers the Arabs and saves Washington from annihilation .
US technology and heroism is invincible .
If they saw this movie ( and I would bet they did )
the reactions of the September 11 terrorists can be plausibly reconstructed .
They will have been nauseated by ( infidel )
Suchet 's caricature of a true believer .
The harm that movies like Executive Decision and Collateral Damage have done to the American psyche is immeasurable .
They have fed xenophobia and made money .
More insidiously , they fostered a wholly spurious confidence in American omniscience ( those never - sleeping monitors ) and omnipotence .
Little good can have come out of this awful week .
But not being exposed ( at least , for a month or two ) to Collateral Damage and other movies like it may be a tiny consolation as Americans pick up the pieces of their shattered cities ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger has launched a lawsuit against a games company for unauthorised use of his image and voice .
The actor , who played the lead in the two Terminator movies , and may yet appear in a third instalment , is seeking damages in the region of $ 20 m ( £ 13.6 m ) .
International Game Technology Inc manufacture The Terminator games machines , but say they have license to do so .
The company is the USA 's largest slot - machine producer and made more than $ 1b ( £ 680 m ) .
However , Schwarzenegger 's lawyer Marty Singer says that , "" My client never gave those rights that his photos could be used and has never consented to the use of his voice . ""
He added that the $ 20 m is roughly equivalent to what Schwarzenegger could have received if he had actually approved a licensing agreement .
Schwarzengger has never been shy about litigation and has previously won cases against American tabloid paper
The Globe and a German doctor for implying that he suffered from heart problems .
This latest lawsuit comes in the wake of news that his new film , Collateral Damage , has been shelved indefinitely in the aftermath of the recent terrorist attacks on the United States .
In the movie , Schwarzenegger stars as a man whose decides to exact revenge on those responsible after his wife and child die in a terrorist bombing ."
"The third Terminator film will at last start filming next April under the directorial helm of Jonathan Mostow , with Arnold Schwarzenegger again in the lead role of the T-800 cyborg .
Set ten years after T2 :
Judgement Day , the film will find John Connor ( played by Ed Norton ) and his cyborg protector up against a female Terminator , a Terminatrix of sorts , whose powers and morphing abilities outdo anything seen before .
For his role in the film , Schwarzenegger will be paid an estimated $ 30 m ( £ 21.18 m ) .
The Intermedia - financed film will also pay out U-571 director Mostow upward of $ 5 m ) £ 3.53 m ) for stepping into James Cameron 's shoes .
Arnie 's previous highest payout was the $ 25 m ( £ 17.65 m ) he received for Batman and Robin five years ago .
The salary should not be a problem for any studio bidding for the US rights to the film however as the budgetary breakdown will not be revealed although the price stands at $ 50 m ( £ 35.30 m ) against 50 % of gross receipts in exchange for US theatrical , TV , VHS and DVD rights .
The bidding war so far seems to be between Paramount , Disney , Universal and possibly DreamWorks .
Bidders for the film were told the cost of the film would be $ 180 m ( £ 127 m ) , although it seems possible that may be reduced to $ 165 m ( £ 116.5 m ) .
Either figure is still some way ahead of Pearl Harbor 's $ 135 m ( £ 95.3 m ) , currently the most expensive green - lighted project ever .
Terminator 3 has been long in the planning ever since T2 grossed some $ 520 m ( £ 367 m ) worldwide .
Previous director James Cameron sold his rights in the property to the first Terminator 's co - writer and producer Gale Anne Hurd for $ 1 on the condition that T3 would only be made with Mostow at the helm .
Intermedia 's Nigel Sinclair , Guy East and Moritz Borman will executive produce , while Mario Kassar , Andy Vajna and Hal Lieberman will produce the movie .
Director John Mostow brought on long - time collaborators John Brancato and Michael Ferris ( The Game ) to write the script .
Intermedia is also behind K-19 , the upcoming Harrison Ford submarine thriller and Basic , which will reunite Pulp Fiction co - stars John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson ."
"Among the many casualties of September 11 were Hollywood movies .
A week after the attacks , Warner Bros postponed indefinitely the release of Arnold Schwarzenegger 's terrorists - bomb - skyscraper picture Collateral Damage , out of respect for the victims .
It had been scheduled for US release on October 5 .
MGM halted production of Nosebleed , in which Jackie Chan plays a World Trade Centre window cleaner who is embroiled in a terrorist plot to destroy the Statue of Liberty .
But it was US war movies that suffered the biggest backlash in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks .
John Woo 's Windtalkers , an MGM second world war drama about Navajo soldiers who use their native language to convey secret radio messages , was abruptly pulled from release .
Ridley Scott 's Black Hawk
Down , a $ 90 m movie about the disastrous US raid on Somali rebels in Mogadishu in 1993 , produced by Pearl Harbor 's Jerry Bruckheimer , was shifted from November 2 to March 1 .
Behind Enemy Lines , a $ 40 m drama about a US pilot whose plane was downed by Serbian missiles in Bosnia in 1995 , was moved from October to January .
And Hart 's War , a courtroomdrama - cum - POW - movie set during the second world war and starring Bruce Willis , was shifted from a December release to next spring . ""
Immediately afterwards , a lot of people were scared , "" says Randall Wallace , who wrote and directed
We Were Soldiers , the still - unfinished Mel Gibson Vietnam flick . ""
But that period has passed .
I do n't think there 'll be a long drawn - out period of mourning in the movies . ""
The mourning period has indeed passed .
In the wake of the new mood of US patriotism and the speed of victory in Afghanistan , US war films have had their release dates brought forward to capitalise on a rapidly rekindled US fascination with its own military .
Behind Enemy Lines has been particularly quick out of the traps .
It was due to be released in the US early next year but , like rival war movie Black Hawk
Down , is being screened in America over Christmas . ""
With its hip - hip - hooray tone and pumped - up patriotic volume , Behind Enemy Lines may prove to be particularly suited to these increasingly bellicose times , "" said LA Times film critic Kenneth Turan .
And he has been proved right - the film is doing well at the box office .
Even Arnie 's Collateral Damage is shortly to appear in cinemas .
The film , whose release was deemed insensitive in September , has become money - spinningly topical .
Director Andrew Davis originally had Arabs as terrorists , but later decided that the bad guys should be Colombians , "" because there are too many films about Arab terrorists "" .
If only Davis had left the terrorists as Arabs , audiences could have fantasised about Arnie making Bin Laden - like brutes wish they had never been born - which would have reflected the national mood perfectly .
Only a few months ago , Hollywood had a crisis of confidence about war movies : audiences did n't care to see gritty grunt dramas any more , so Hollywood gave them , for good or ill , military movies with a twist .
Pearl Harbor , for example , a film that dealt with one of the key moments in 20th century US history , was reduced to little more than a video game with romantic sub - plot attached .
No matter , because it did good box office - the biggest budget example of what is now called the "" greatest generation "" cycle , which also includes Saving Private Ryan and the TV series Band of Brothers .
On the other hand , the deeply anti - nostalgic Three Kings , set during the Gulf war and starring George Clooney , was forced to disguise its liberal sentiments with a head - pounding action - movie format .
Predictably , perhaps , it fared disappointingly on its release in 1999 .
But the corollary of this trend was that films dealing with the grim realities of the military experience per se could no longer be certain of a market .
"" We were trying to make a military movie at a time when nobody gave a shit about the military , "" says Wyck Godfrey , executive producer of Behind Enemy Lines .
But fortunately for Godfrey , and other film - makers who were working on war movies before the September 11 attacks , things have changed .
So much so , in fact , that Hollywood is planning more military movies .
And bearing in mind that it takes , on average , two years for a film to go from conception to release , this is a tricky judgment call for Hollywood .
Will the gung - ho mood among movie - goers persist until 2003 ?
The US movie industry clearly thinks so , and is sinking millions of dollars and creative intelligence into military film projects right now .
John Sayles and Ron Howard , an unlikely double act , are collaborating on a remake of The Alamo for Disney .
And there 's a US navy movie called Dreadnought in production , together with Fertig , based on the story of US soldiers who retreated into the Philippine jungle during the second world war rather than surrender to the Japanese .
But even though many of the new and looming films resound with pumped - up patriotic volume , most involve US military disasters that may , so the argument goes , give audiences pause for thought .
Early next year the Vietnam epic We Were Soldiers will be released , the story of the US 's humiliation at landing zone X - Ray in Vietnam , when 400 elite US troops were attacked by 2,000 Vietcong at the outset of the conflict in 1965 .
In Black Hawk
Down , a group of Somali rebels parade the corpse of an American serviceman through the streets of Mogadishu .
And everyone knows how the Alamo ended .
Not even John Wayne was getting out of that one alive .
And even Sayles and Howard ca n't overturn that historical reverse - can they ?
US audiences are learning that war is n't just about winning without casualties to their troops .
Superficially , this is a good argument .
But what 's striking about nearly all these films is that they deal only with US military experience , and encourage us to think of America 's enemies as irreducibly evil .
These films do n't encourage us to believe that those enemies have justifiable political goals or even to think of them as human beings .
And they leave Americans worrying about what war involves in terms of the US body - bag factor rather than considering the legitimacy of their military 's enterprises .
The epilogue to Black Hawk
Down , which runs for over two and a half hours , tells us that , following the bungled US raid in Mogadishu , 19 American soldiers lost their lives in the ensuing gun battle in the city 's streets .
At the end of the picture , the names of the US military 's single biggest firefight since Vietnam roll across the screen , in order to honour the dead .
We are also told that more than 1,000 Somalis died in the same battle , but their names and what motivated them to fight remain obscure if we rely on Scott to do our history for us .
So which film - maker will honour them ?
Which one will dare to understand them ?
Does a whole city rise up against US troops simply because its inhabitants are pawns of an evil warlord ?
Do tens of thousands of heavily armed men risk their lives for a cause that amounts to no more than gangsterism , as Scott 's film suggests ?
For the rest of the film , we are expected to be engaged by the US military principle : "" Leave no man behind "" .
And thanks to Scott 's manipulative film - making , we are .
No American will be left with his guts hanging out in some foreign field : it is his right to have his ass hauled back to base .
The fact that this compromises the mission is a question for military ethics , but it 's a principle that we can not but help think shows up the moral inferiority of the US 's enemies .
In short , if the gooks let their wounded die because it would be tactically disastrous to rescue them , then what chance have Americans got when they get into tricky military situations in the field , particularly in a hostile city like Mogadishu ?
The rhetoric implies that Americans can not fight man to man with the barbarians of the third world , to whom life is cheap .
Instead , the US must bomb its foes from a great height .
But worst of all , Black Hawk Down boasts the same grammar as Cy Endfield 's 1964 film Zulu , in which wave after anonymous wave of black men raced towards the heavily outnumbered British troops at Rorke 's Drift .
If we were engaged as viewers , it was by the hope that the British guns and bayonets would silence the dark hordes .
When we see the Somali rebels on rooftops in Black Hawk
Down , we hunger for the deaths of these heavily armed anonymous black men , in order that our heroes , the Americans - white , all bar one of them - can get out alive .
Release comes blissfully : a machine - gun sprays bullets at a remarkable rate from a helicopter , rapidly dispatching the rebels who have been shooting on to the US troops pinned down in the streets below , thus satisfying our need to see the undifferentiated adversary extinguished .
This may not be what you feel , but it 's what the logic of Scott 's film encourages you to want .
Hollywood does not want the voices of the third world to be heard .
In cinema , anyone who fights against US military morality does n't even deserve a back story , let alone to live into the last reel .
What Black Hawk
Down and many of the other recent US war movies encourage Americans to do , though , is to worry about committing US troops on the ground .
After watching the shedding of so much cinematic US blood , American cinema - goers might well be inclined to fantasise about a new world order in which their forces bomb recalcitrant nations with negligible risk to themselves .
After the overthrow of the Taliban , chiefly by means of US bombing and proxy Northern Alliance forces , films such as Black Hawk
Down reinforce the fear- generated strategic belief that in future conflicts the US can and should bomb from 5,000 ft and let others on the ground risk their lives .
Never again will Americans have to suffer the body - bag count of Mogadishu or landing zone X - Ray - by their standards high , but by other countries ' standards negligible .
Hollywood will have played its part in making the US temperamentally incapable of fighting any other kind of war . ·

Collateral Damage is released on March 1 ."
"Rudolph Giuliani , the former mayor of New York , has sparked a row by attending a screening of the Arnold Schwarzenegger film Collateral Damage .
The movie was due to be released around the time of the World Trade Center attacks on September 11 last year but was put back because of its controversial subject matter .
The film stars Schwarzenegger as a fireman who seeks revenge on Colombian terrorists who murdered his family , and Giuliani has angered some people with his presence at the screening .
Concerns were voiced that the former mayor 's attendance could be seen as suggesting a link between the movie and the Twin Towers Fund charity that he set up in the wake of the real life terrorist attacks .
Patrick Lynch , the president of the Patrolmen 's Benevolent Association , said , "" We consider it exploitative and in bad taste to promote the film by linking it with the tragedy of September 11 "" .
But Giuliani responded by saying , "" Let 's see the movie before criticising it "" .
The film 's distributors , Warner Bros , said Giuliani had been invited simply as a guest .
They also pointed out that Schwarzenegger had donated $ 1 m of his own money to help families of those killed in the attacks ."
"Having enjoyed his career heyday under the presidency of George Bush Sr , Arnold Schwarzenegger appears to be enjoying a renaissance under George Bush Jr.
The actor , a prominent Republican , is back at the top of the US box office after his controversial new release Collateral Damage earned a respectable $ 15.1 m on its opening weekend .
The Warner Brothers production stars Arnie as a firefighter who swears revenge on the terrorists who killed his family in an attack on a city skyscraper .
Shot before the attack on the World Trade Centre , the film was pulled from the schedule following September 11 and for a while there was speculation as to whether it would ever be released at all .
But despite damning reviews , the movie has proved that the American public still has an appetite for destruction , and - presumably - for Arnie dishing out the destruction .
The film replaces another action movie , Black Hawk
Down , at the top of the chart .
After three weeks at number one , Ridley Scott 's war flick tumbled to fourth place with $ 8 m over the weekend .
New releases
Big Fat Liar and the Rollerball remake were at numbers two and three respectively .
Collateral Damage is the first number one movie that Arnie has enjoyed since Batman and Robin in 1997 .
That , however , was more of an ensemble production , with Schwarzenegger seizing top billing but essentially having to play second fiddle to co - stars George Clooney and Chris O'Donnell .
His most recent film , the flop thriller The Sixth Day , earned $ 13 m on its opening weekend and eventually bottomed out on a measly $ 35 m .
Schwarzenegger 's 1999 comeback film
End of Days managed a hefty $ 19 m opening but still finished in third place during a crowded Thanksgiving weekend ."
"Poor old Arnold Schwarzenegger :
his career has been yielding diminishing returns these past few years , given the lacklustre receipts posted by Eraser , The Sixth Day and those forgettable others .
His latest effort , Collateral Damage ( directed by The Fugitive 's Andrew Davis ) was originally poised for release last autumn , but was pulled in order to excise images that were all too redolent of recent events , including a terrorist attack that brings down a skyscraper .
Now Collateral Damage is upon us , with massive ad coverage and the media getting the red carpet treatment at screenings , presumably in the hope that they will play down any aspects of the movie that might yet upset audiences .
These things include firefighter funerals , massive explosions , a single terrorist hate - figure , and , in place of the Afghan bombing campaign , its one - man equivalent , Avenging Arnie .
He plays Gordon Brewer , honest firefighter , husband and dad , with an inexplicable Austrian accent that no one ever mentions .
Turning up to collect his wife ( a nurse , just to turn the screws a little tighter on our sympathies ) and son , he arrives in time to see them killed by a bomb intended for Colombian politicians .
As the dust settles , he realises he spoke to the bomber seconds before the explosion , and having seen the face of the man known as "" the Wolf "" , resolves to stop at nothing until he can rip it off his skull .
So it 's off to Colombia for Brewer , who manages to gain access to places and people that the CIA ca n't get near .
Soon enough he is in the HQ of the Wolf ( Cliff Curtis ) , unrecognised despite having had his grieving visage plastered all over CNN after the bombing .
At this point things move away from the standard Ramboisms : having set a bomb to kill the Wolf , Brewer finds he must save a woman and her child , who turn out to be Mrs Wolf and her cub .
The Wolf , it transpires , was once an ordinary husband and father like Arnie , and having lost his first wife and son to US - sponsored violence , he is just a few steps ahead of Arnie on the road of grief and embitterment .
But no matter : he is a terrorist and he has to die .
Arnie spends the rest of the movie foiling a bomb plot against a target in Washington DC and the Ramboisms kick back in sharpish during the headlong finale .
The presence of Davis does n't count for very much , and Collateral Damage marks no discernible improvement on Arnie 's recent outings .
Of Rollerball , the other big new release , little needs to be said .
Norman Jewison 's 1975 original was little more than some excellent production design gussied up with a pretentious script .
John McTiernan 's shoddy remake removes all the original 's political metaphors ( sports as war ) and hankers after the extreme - sports dollar .
A hair 's breadth away from incoherence , Rollerball sees beefcake
Chris Klein relocating to Kazakhstan , where the game is run by businessmen who know that ratings leap with every injury .
The only message is that athletes are less than livestock to their team owners , and if I needed to learn that lesson I could have stayed home and watched North Dallas Forty .
Despairing of seeing a worthwhile movie this weekend , I headed for the lone cinema showing Troma 's Citizen Toxie :
The Toxic Avenger Part 4 , because nothing cheers me up quite like flying guts .
It channels the Zucker brothers and George Romero and forces them to mate furiously for 95 minutes .
Bubble - faced Toxie is back , mysteriously cast into Tromaville 's evil twin town Amortville while his evil doppelganger , Noxie , stalks Tromaville raping , eviscerating and castrating everyone in sight .
Citizen Toxie has something to offend everyone : hacked - up corpses crap themselves after death , good and evil foetuses fight each other in the womb , and everyone - Jews , Catholics , Protestants , blacks , whites , nurses , teachers , whores - gets it in the neck at least once .
It 's profoundly infantile and defiantly cheap , but it maintains a gleeful , unflagging satiric energy , and you 're never far away from a body - parts fight in a cannibal hotdog factory , a bloodsoaked remake of the March of Time sequence from Citizen Kane ( "" Nose - blood ! "" ) , or the next mention of "" toxic testicle nectar "" .
Nauseating , tasteless and offensive - but all in the nicest way ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger has revealed that his arch enemy in the long - awaited Terminator 3 will be a lady .
T3 :
The Rise of the Machines will see the Austrian - born muscleman reprising his role as the cyborg he played as a villain in the original 1984 film and as a hero in James Cameron 's 1991 sequel .
On this occasion , however , Arnie appears to be developing a split personality .
The 55-year - old star said this week this week that his latest enemy will by a renegade lady terminator who uses her powers to control his character , and shift him back and forth between good and evil .
There is no word yet as to who will take the role . ""
She will have control over machines and over anything mechanical , therefore including myself , "" he said .
"" So you will sometimes see me as the villain and sometimes as a Terminator that tried to save the world . ""
Schwarzenegger was upbeat about the prospect of facing an opponent with a difference . ""
The idea of the female terminator is great , "" he reporters .
"" She will have additional powers that Robert Patrick [ his enemy in T2 ] did not have . ""
The new movie will have U-571 director Jonathan Mostow at the helm , while writing duties will be shared between John D Brancato and Michael Ferris III , the team behind David Fincher 's 1997 thriller
The Game .
It 's scheduled for release in 2003 .
The action star appears to be enoying a mini renaissance at present , with his new film , Collateral Damage , currently on top of the US box office .
In the meantime he is preparing to revisit the scenes of his past glories .
As well as T3 , Schwarzenegger is currently considering work on the sequel to True Lies .

"Terminator 3 is causing joy in Hollywood since it was decided to make the entire film in Los Angeles .
At a time when studio execs are crying into their napkins at the number of so - called "" runaway productions "" taking shoots to cheaper locations in Canada , there was relief this week following the announcement that the 100-day shoot for T3 : Rise of the Machines will take place entirely in Los Angeles .
Many thought Arnold Schwarzenegger , director Jonathan Mostow and colleagues would be dividing their time between LA and Vancouver but because of logistical concerns it was decided to do the whole thing in the City of Angels , with interior shots at LA Center Studios .
"" Any time a big production stays in Los Angeles , it 's great for the city , "" gushed Morrie Goldman , spokesman for Los Angeles 's Entertainment Industry Development Corp.
"" Films like these spend a lot of money and use a lot of our vendors .
It 's a big deal , and it 's great for our town . ""
T3 is due to be released in summer 2003 .
Budget estimates range from £ 113 m to £ 124 m , with Arnie said to be pocketing £ 22 m . ""

"This grotesquely dishonest terrorism action pic was completed well before September 11 , held over while the suits considered their position , and is now on general release .
The 55-year - old Arnold Schwarzenegger , looking more plumply raddled and mad - eyed than ever , plays a fire chief whose wife and young son are killed in an anti - American bomb planted by "" The Wolf "" , a terrorist from the far - flung , disreputable land of Colombia .
Rambo - like , Arnie goes out to Colombia to get the killer , and soon finds any number of English - speakers to help him .
But wait ! ""
The Wolf "" has a wife and kid just like Arnie .
This entirely phoney , quasi - liberal nod to the idea that America 's enemies might be human too is raised specifically in order to be cancelled by the discovery that this wife is a terrorist every bit as evil as hubby , even willing to sacrifice her own boy .
The moral ?
The United States need not lose too much sleep about civilian populations on the wrong side .
Pretty queasy stuff , and I have n't even got on to how boring it is .
Arnie 's macho act was looking arthritic enough before September 11 .
Trying to resurrect it at Ground Zero is something we did n't need ."
"The prolific and influential illustrator for Marvel Comics , John Buscema , who has died of cancer aged 74 , drew superheroes .
These included the Silver Surfer , the Mighty Thor , the Fantastic Four , the Avengers , and Conan the Barbarian .
His drawings became the model for the Arnold Schwarzenegger films .
Born and brought up in a rough neighbourhood of Brooklyn , Buscema was inspired by childhood reading of Sunday strips like Prince Valiant and Flash Gordon .
While still at high school , he took drawing classes at the Brooklyn museum art school and , in 1946 , graduated in life drawing and design from the Pratt Institute .
He was influenced by the works of Michelangelo , Leonardo da Vinci , and contemporary American illustrators such as Norman Rockwell and Al Dorne .
Two years after graduating , Buscema was hired to draw crime , western and romance for Timely Comics , Marvel 's forerunner , learning from staff artists Carl Burgos , inventor of the Human Torch , and Syd Shores , artist on Captain America , under the youthful editorship of Stan Lee .
The early 1950s saw a moral panic in America about the horror and crime topics in some comic books , and , to avoid legislation and maintain distribution , publishers adopted a strict code of content .
This , combined with competition from television , led to company closures , and Buscema turned to the wholesome Dell Comics , illustrating the exploits of Roy Rogers and Trigger , adaptations of movies such as Alexander
The Great and The Seventh Voyage Of Sinbad , and television shows like Sir Lancelot .
By 1958 , he had switched to advertising and paperback covers .
Then , in 1966 , Stan Lee asked him to join his expanding Marvel Comics empire .
Marvel 's dynamic visual storytelling had been defined by artist Jack Kirby , co - creator , with Lee , of almost all of Marvel 's founding characters .
Buscema was instructed to incorporate Kirby 's distinctive foreshortening effects and combat choreography into his artwork , but combined them with his own more illustrative facial expressions and accurate musculature .
In 1968 , this resulted in his most memorable collaboration with Lee , on the Silver Surfer .
Kirby had introduced the character in the Fantastic Four comic in 1966 , when he visualised a glistening herald for the planet - devouring Galactus .
The world is spared , thanks in part to the Surfer 's appeals , but his master banishes him to earth , never again to surf the spaceways .
Lee 's grandiloquence , and Buscema 's melodramatic figurework , refined the Silver Surfer in his solo comic , revealing a tragic alien imprisoned on earth , despairing of mankind 's inhumanity in anguished soliloquies and yet struggling on in our defence .
Misunderstood , the noble Surfer articulated many of young America 's feelings of alienation and protest .
After Kirby left Marvel in 1970 , Lee entrusted Buscema with the Fantastic Four and Thor .
Over the years , he drew nearly all of the company 's roster , designing She - Hulk , the green - skinned female version of the Hulk , and , with writer Roy Thomas , updating The Vision as a feeling android .
From 1973 to 1975 , he took over Conan the Barbarian and , at his peak , was pencilling nearly 70 Conan pages every month , as well as , from 1978 , a daily newspaper strip .
Such volume meant that he had to pour out pencil layouts for others to ink , though he always regretted that he could rarely finish his own artwork .
From 1975 to 1978 , Buscema ran a school of comic book artists in Manhattan , and co - wrote , with Stan Lee , the manual How To Draw Comics
The Marvel Way .
Many of today 's most prominent artists cite Buscema as a principal influence .
"" If Michelangelo had elected to draw storyboards with pencil and pen , his style would have been close to that of Big John 's , "" observed Lee .
"" I had only to give him the briefest kernel of a plot , and he would flesh it out with his magnificent illustrations .
"" Buscema retired in 1996 , but was still in demand .
Last year , he and Lee created a radical , one - off reinvention of Superman for DC Comics , one of Marvel 's competitors .
He is survived by his wife Dolores , and a son and daughter . · John Buscema , illustrator , born December 11 1927 ; died January 10 2002"

"The number of ministers promoted as rivals to Gordon Brown 's semi - official position as the Labour party 's crown prince is still rising .
One by one , prominent cabinet members have been presented , however briefly or in some cases outrageously , as competitors to the chancellor .
And one by one they have fallen away , victims of bruising encounters with the Westminster equivalent of Arnold Schwarzenegger 's Terminator .
Mr Brown has defended his position as Tony Blair 's heir apparent during an eight - year reign with all the single - mindedness of Hollywood 's invincible cyborg .
Having extended the Treasury 's tentacles deep into every department , it was Mr Brown rather than the transport secretary , Alistair Darling ( an ally caught by friendly fire ) , who stamped on a strategic rail authority proposal this week to issue bonds to fund rail improvements .
Alan Milburn , the ambitious health secretary touted by No 10 as a politician who would go further , was embarrassingly rolled over by Mr Brown last week in a confrontation over foundation hospitals .
According to Lord Hattersley , a former deputy Labour leader : "" The next leader of the Labour party is Gordon Brown or someone we have not even thought of .
Gordon Brown is simply head and shoulders above the alternatives . ""
That Mr Brown still enjoys such a billing , eight years after he stood aside for Mr Blair to take the Labour crown , underlines how the Downing Street neighbours continue to dominate the party and government .
His success as a chancellor is partly responsible , as is getting the public finances under control and - so far - avoiding a recession .
But his determination to undermine rivals by scoring Whitehall victories has contributed in no small part to his surprisingly durable pre - eminence .
Many Labour MPs believe the confrontation over private borrowing by NHS foundation hospitals with Mr Milburn , a new Labour neighbour of Mr Blair 's in north - east England , was a clash of personalities as well as politics .
Mr Milburn claimed Mr Blair was on his side and the prime minister called both into Downing Street to mediate , yet it was the chancellor who emerged victorious .
His supporters struggle to suppress their glee at the problems besetting David Blunkett , embroiled in rows over wanting immigrants to speak Eng lish in their homes and a Treasury questioning whether he is value for money in terms of public spending .
Attempts to build him up as a counter to Mr Brown did not go unnoticed by the chancellor , who has not been exactly cooperative since .
Likewise , Charles Clarke , made Labour chairman by Mr Blair in a move that should inevitably loosen Mr Brown 's grip on the party machine , has suffered .
Overhyped as a future leader by excitable sections of the media , the euro enthusiast chairman has been forced to backtrack over pro - single currency declarations after complaints from a more cautious chancellor .
Although never likely to suc ceed Mr Blair , Mr Brown 's old foe Peter Mandelson could yet play a role as kingmaker .
Claims that he has been talking up Mr Blunkett and Mr Milburn may have coloured their relations with the chancellor .
The demise of a number of other putative leadership rivals , from Robin Cook and Mo Mowlam to Jack Straw and Stephen Byers , does not lead to Mr Brown 's door , but few MPs believe he lost much sleep as they slipped down , or out of , the pecking order .
Mr Brown has asked his team not to talk about the Labour leadership , aware that it irritates cabinet colleagues as well as Downing Street .
But a Westminster source close to the chancellor conceded that Mr Brown 's succession depends on a crucial factor out of the chancellor 's control - namely , the prime minister 's intentions .
Whatever was agreed at the Granita dinner in 1994 matters less than whether Mr Blair intends to step down during this parliament , the next or even the one after that . ""
If Gordon knows , he 's never let on , "" said the well - placed source .
The longer Mr Blair goes on , the source added , the more likely the prospect grows of the unidentified rival mentioned by Lord Hattersley emerging .
Lord Healey , a political bruiser who served five years as chancellor in the last Labour government , failed to secure the Labour leadership despite being many people 's favourite for several years .
Yet given Mr Brown 's record of terminating opponents , to be named a pretender now for the title of Labour 's crown prince may be a poisoned chalice ."
"In a previous career , the line might have been struck out by a discerning script editor , but this is politics , so anything goes . '
A lot of you know me from the movies , fighting gangsters and the terrorists and even the Devil , ' Arnold Schwarzenegger told a Beverly Hills audience last week . '
But the fight I 'm most proud of is the fight for children .
The children can not fight for themselves . '
For the past two months Schwarzenegger , whose cinematic ' body count ' has been calculated at 275 , has been crisscrossing California and delivering such sugar - coated oratory to adoring fans and political donors .
Ostensibly he is drumming up support for Proposition 49 - a proposal to divert $ 500 million of public money towards after - school activities for children - but most observers believe his sudden interest in child welfare may not be entirely civic - minded . '
Without question , he is trying to establish a bona fides record that he has some civic involvement and civic record , ' says Sherry Jeffe , a political scientist at the University of Southern California . '
There is a very good chance this is an audition for a run for the governorship in four years , ' echoes Professor Jack Pitney of the Claremont McKenna College .
In years past , Schwarzenegger , a self - styled moderate Republican who counts George Bush Snr as a good friend , conceded he had thought about pursuing a career in politics after his acting days were over .
These days , he 's playing coy . '
I do n't want to run for governor , because it 's very complicated just filling out the forms .
Let 's say I put down "" actor "" as a profession - I might get sued for perjury , ' the 55-year - old former Mr Universe told the Beverly Hills crowd . '
This is a decision that I leave to the Almighty ; my wife , Maria Shriver . '
No one believes this , not even Shriver , a television journalist and niece of President John Kennedy , who can read the political runes as well as anybody .
Her husband launched Proposition 49 this year , raising $ 8 m in campaign funds as well as contributing $ 1 m of his own money , and promptly surrounded himself with advisers who worked for former Republican Californian governor Pete Wilson , .
Under Schwarzenegger 's proposal , $ 500 m will be automatically taken from California 's annual budget to pay for after - school activities such as homework clubs and sports teams .
Crucially , Prop 49 rules out raising extra taxes , which means that the money to make it work will have to be diverted from other under - funded programmes - a stipulation that appeals to the state 's small Republican base but has aroused opposition from teachers ' unions , Democrats and most of California 's leading newspapers . '
Combine an apple - pie issue , such as after - school programmes , with the big - screen popularity of an Arnold Schwarzenegger and the resultant ballot measure is hard to beat .
But that does not make it defensible , ' the San Francisco Chronicle said last week . '
Schwarzenegger leaves it up to others to come up with the money .
It 's not a responsible approach to public policy . '
Not so , says the author of The Encyclopedia of Body - Building - the proposal will pay for itself by reducing juvenile crime . '
There are millions of children floating around after school with no place to go and no adult supervision between three o'clock and six o'clock .
This is the danger zone , when children are most vulnerable to teen pregnancies , to commit crime , vandalise and do drugs . '
The campaign has given a boost to Schwarzenegger 's public profile , which has flagged after a succession of cinematic flops .
He is currently filming Terminator 3 , which is seen by most studio chiefs as his last big pay day .
California 's electorate will vote on Proposition 49 early next month .
Polls initially showed it had a clear majority , but in recent months , as it has come under more thorough scrutiny , support has slipped to around 50 per cent .
Defeat would probably end the actor 's political ambitions .
On the other hand , victory would see him crowned as the saviour of the California Republican movement .
After an era that produced two US Presidents , Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan , the party is enduring a terrible slump .
One of George W. Bush 's top advisers last week christened the party 's current gubernatorial campaign to elect an extreme right - wing businessman called Bill Simon as ' the worst in the entire country ' .
There were some moves to have Simon replaced by Schwarzenegger for next month 's ballot , but most Republican analysts believe he will be a stronger and more plausible candidate in 2006 - if he can claim victory in this present political battle .
Many Republicans are quick to make the comparison between their new hero and Reagan .
But there is one difference ; under US electoral rules Schwarzenegger , who was born in Austria , can never run for the White House ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger has taken another step forward in his bid for a political career .
A proposition he supported , committing the state of California to provide educational support for children before and after the school day , has been approved in a referendum .
The proposition , which will cost the state $ 550 m per year , was approved by 55 % of voters .
Never one to resist a catchphrase , Schwarzenegger promised , "" As soon as we start implementing this program , I will say , ' I 'll be back ' "" .
The actor 's interest in gaining political office has long been known , and he is thought to have the backing of the White House .
A staunch Republican , he told NBC , "" I 'm not going to concentrate on running for office or anything like that "" .
Watch this space ."
"Almost a week has passed since the mid - term elections so it is high time to start looking at what may be happening in 2006 .
In California , this means that speculation has already begun that Arnold Schwarzenegger will be running on the Republican ticket for the governor 's job .
California , of course , has a long tradition of actors running for office : Ronald Reagan was the governor here before he became president and Clint Eastwood has managed to combine acting , directing and being mayor of Carmel .
Mickey Mouse was even considered as a possible Republican candidate for governor this time around although the party eventually settled on Goofy , who ran under the name of Bill Simon .
Schwarzenegger has already been positioning himself for a bid , championing a measure that will bring in after - school programmes for children and that won voter approval last week .
He is now described in the media as "" actor and children 's activist "" .
At a rally in Boyle Heights in East Los Angeles after the vote last week , he was promising , "" I 'll be back ! "" just as he does in his Terminator movies .
The 55-year - old Austrian - born actor has already mastered the art of delivering platitudes to camera . ""
Children are our future , "" he told the rally , in case there were those in the audience who believed that children were their past .
But he was coy about whether he will be running for governor , saying that he had been encouraged to stand this time around but had too many commitments to Terminator 3 which will open next summer .
At least Arnie would make the race interesting .
This year 's contest between poor , simple Simon and the winner , Gray Davis , was about as inspiring as a flat tyre on a wet night on the San Diego freeway .
Davis , who once had dreams of running for the White House , only won because the thought of Simon was even less inviting to this Democrat state .
He wo n't be running next time which has already led to thoughts that Rob Reiner , the director and actor , might take on the Schwarzenegger challenge for the Democrats .
Reiner has been a big player in California Democrat politics for years and is a smart and funny speaker .
He is also a liberal so there would be lots of clear blue Pacific Ocean of difference between him and Schwarzenegger .
California voted heavily for Al Gore at the 2000 election and came back with solidly Democrat results this time , too .
But what was interesting about the exit polls was how the state divides politically .
Davis won by the margin of 47 % to 42 % with Green candidate Peter Camejo taking a respectable 5 % with his 346,000 votes .
Men voted for Simon by 47 % to 42 % while women voted for Davis by 52 % to 37 % , which may have something to do with Simon being anti - abortion while Davis is pro - choice .
Whites voted for Simon in preference to Davis , 46 % to 43 % , so the governor was dependent on black ( 79 % of whom backed him ) , Latino ( 65 % ) and Asian ( 54 % ) for his victory .
For film - goers , there was one disappointment in the results last week .
San Fernando Valley , the mighty suburb of LA , was hoping that the electorate would vote to allow them to secede and become an independent city .
They lost the vote by 66 % to 33 % citywide although the voters in the Valley itself were split down the middle .
This is all academic now , but in anticipation of secession , voters had also been asked to choose a name for the potential new city .
Of the five possible names on offer , 62 % voted for it to be called San Fernando Valley while only 8 % chose Camelot .
Shame on the voters .
Now we will never hear newsreaders reporting "" four shot dead in Camelot . """
"A day after announcing her retirement , Delia Smith has done an Arnold Schwarzenegger and declared : "" I 'll be back . ""
The TV chef shocked her millions of fans yesterday when she said she was "" reciped out "" .
She declared she was hanging up her apron to spend more time with her football club , Norwich City .
But Smith said today she had signed a new contract with BBC Books , and did n't rule out the possibility of yet more TV series to come . ""

Interviewed on Radio 4 's Today programme , Smith joked she was "" getting to be a bit like Frank Sinatra with all these farewell comments "" .
The TV chef is closely involved with Norwich City football club , where she is a director , and its push for promotion to the Premiership .
She said the collapse of ITV Digital had been a "" great blow "" to the club . ""
If we 're going to survive we have to have an income , "" she said .

The comic book green mutant , whose image has been closely guarded by the studio , will be witnessed in action for the first time in a tantalising scene that shows him tearing through the streets of San Francisco .
Universal will also show a trailer for the forthcoming Jim Carrey comedy , Bruce Almighty .
Other ads may feature Fox 's comic book adaptation of Daredevil , starring Ben Affleck , Disney 's CIA thriller
The Recruit with Al Pacino and Colin Farrell and Columbia 's Charlie 's Angels :
Full Throttle and Bad Boys 2 , starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence .
While the ads cost on average $ 2.1 m for 30 seconds , studio executives can sniff a profit and obviously believe they are worth every cent .
The game , by the way , will be contested by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Oakland Raiders ."
"In concert with the American war effort , Hollywood has sanctioned the return of its three favourite men of action - Sylvester Stallone , Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis - in a revival of the Rambo , Terminator and Die Hard franchises .
Set for release this year , Rambo IV , T3 : Rise of the Machines and Die Hard 4 : Die Hardest will witness the all - American , grenade - lobbing , albeit ageing heroes , now well into their fifties , save America from al - Qaeda , robots and terrorists .
News of the three films indicates Hollywood 's enthusiasm to assert its masculine identity in the wake of the 11 September 2001 attacks .
In the immediate aftermath , Hollywood studios declared a moratorium on big - budget action movies .
The release of the films will also prompt accusations of an American propaganda machine at work in Hollywood where , in 2001 , Black Hawk Down was heavily criticised for its jingoistic approach to historical events .
Rambo IV , starring Stallone , 55 , will pit the near - pensionable Vietnam veteran against the rigours of Afghanistan and al - Qaeda .
The one - man army will eventually kill Osama bin Laden .
Stallone is said to have a 2003 rush - release in mind .
Rambo IV wo n't be the character 's first journey into Afghanistan .
Rambo enthusiasts might recall 1988 's Rambo III where , equipped with all the firepower of a munitions factory , our hero joined the mujahideen to oust Russian invaders .
The bodycount of Rambo IV will be matched only by the July release of T3 : Rise of the Machines .
Schwarzenegger , now 55 , will deliver his pitch - perfect portrayal of a robot out to save the leader of an underground resistance movement from assassination .
For Schwarzenegger , who is planning a career in politics , T3 marks a desperate bid to regain former glory after a string of blunders .
In an indication of the film 's gore factor , Linda Hamilton , who played the mother of the resistance leader John Connor , has said she will not reprise her role .
Original director James Cameron has also decided to stay away from the production . '
The script just did n't take Sarah Connor anywhere , ' Hamilton said recently . '
It just did n't have the soul that the others did .
Despite all the action of the Terminator movies , they were actually pretty high - minded .
There was really a message there about the human condition , and Terminator 3 had no regard for human life whatsoever . '
Die Hard 4
: Die Hardest will also mark the return of Bruce Willis , now wheezing around the streets of New York at the age of 46 , as the one - man apocalypse Detective John McClane .
The film is tipped to star Britney Spears as his rebellious daughter .
According to one Hollywood insider , Willis is ' tired of running with guns and yelling .
Bruce is keen to concentrate on more intelligent films . '
While the trio of films undoubtedly hint at Hollywood in war - dancing mode , they also indicate a crisis in the identity of the now - ageing , missile - toting , all - American action hero .
In recent years , less orthodox leading men such as Ewan McGregor and Toby McGuire have managed to gain success with their less - than - traditional depiction of the action hero .
Martin Lloyd - Elliott , a psychologist at London 's Eden Medical Centre , said : ' With the prospect of war emerging , the Empire strikes back , as it were .
The moguls are obviously trying to resurrect the myth of the all - American action hero using a formula that has worked previously .
It 's as if Hollywood is trying to stir the "" warrior "" in cinema . '"
"Duncan Fletcher can be a gregarious , effusive fellow , but his relationship with the media is one of scarcely guarded mistrust .
Press conferences are conducted with all the animation of Arnold Schwarzenegger reciting the precepts of Polonius .
Cards are kept so close , there is an imprint of the Queen of Hearts on his chest .
But at St George 's Park yesterday another whither - England question saw him colour and bristle .
"" I just do n't think it should be in this forum to discuss , "" he snapped .
"" We have an important game against Australia so why should we want negative things written ?
I do n't think we should be discussing that right now .
"" If the question touched a nerve then there is little point in pretending that it may not be an issue in the near future .
If England 's match against Australia goes pear - shaped tomorrow , Nasser Hussain 's side almost certainly will be heading home .
And with them , unless all the runes have been misread , will go the Hussain era , at least as far as the one - day side is concerned .
Unlike Test cricket , which despite ICC 's attempts at a championship table lacks a focus beyond individual series , the World Cup provides a natural four - year cycle for one - day cricket .
Teams plan around it , build their squads and their hopes , and then , when it is over , look to the next one .
Hussain 's captaincy of the one - day side began in Bloemfontein on the back of England 's World Cup failure in 1999 , and may well finish in Port Elizabeth .
The indications have been there for some time .
Even before he left for Australia , Hussain had been hinting that the ridiculously punishing schedules imposed on international sides would mean him reconsidering whether he could carry on leading the side in both forms of the game .
There is also the chance that the selectors feel that whatever Hussain 's own wishes , it might be wise to move on both in terms of captaincy and as a front - order batsman .
When Fletcher joined Hussain as a new management team , it offered a clean sheet , a chance to take the longer - term view and allow the team to develop .
Continuity was the watchword .
But that ideal has not come to full fruition : tomorrow 's will be the 70th one - day international played under Fletcher - significantly fewer than any other major team in that time - and the 55th with Hussain as captain .
Forty - two players have taken the field , but 19 have played fewer than 10 matches and only Hussain , Marcus Trescothick and Nick Knight have participated in more than 50 of the games .
Even a month ago , England did not know their best side .
Fletcher added perspective to this yesterday when pointing out that England 's batting danger man Michael Vaughan was actually a 25-match novice in this form of cricket . ""
They talk about this young Indian kid Yuvraj Singh , "" he said , "" this new up - and - coming cricketer , and you find he has played 64 matches in two years , more games than two - thirds of my team . ""
The playing record , too , is open to question .
Of 69 matches , 31 have been won and 36 lost .
Only three of 13 series have been won , two of them against Zimbabwe .
As a result there is a compelling case for tearing up the blueprint now and starting the rebuilding programme before next summer , using the likes of Trescothick , Vaughan , Paul Collingwood , James Anderson and Andy Flintoff as the nucleus .
The future of the captaincy provides its own conundrum .
If Hussain is to continue the Test leadership , which he must , then he has to be relieved of the responsibility not just of captaining the one - day team but also of playing a form of the game at which he does not stand out .
Obvious names will be bandied : Trescothick , who was given the task on one occasion and seemed to be Hussain 's deputy , was eased aside when the captain missed the Namibia game , the role going to Alec Stewart .
Consensus is that the left - hander needs to concentrate on re - establishing his credential as a destructive opener without the distraction of leadership .
Likewise Vaughan .
Collingwood has an instinct for and understanding of the demands of the game : he is a fast learner .
The real answer though could lie in the decision six years ago - innovative by England standards - to appoint Adam Hollioake as the one - day captain .
Immediately he won a series abroad and engendered a ferocious team spirit .
But he was not allowed to see the job through .
This is a genuine leader , still only 31 , and an excellent competitor who has succeeded as a player at international level .
He should have been in the current World Cup squad .
If offered the job , though , he should take it on his terms : a guarantee that he would take the side on to the next World Cup in the Caribbean .
Four ready to fill Hussain 's shoes Michael Vaughan Age :
28 One - day caps : 25 Mentioned as heir apparent for both captaincy jobs and may have the capacity to maintain the development of his world - class batting while learning the trade .
Paul Collingwood Age : 26 Caps : 37 Has established himself as a valued member of the side .
Epitomises the high - octane nature of the game and may have the flair that captaincy demands .
Marcus Trescothick Age : 27 Caps :
60 Has deputised for Hussain and would be favourite to take over , but his form has suffered recently .
The question is if he can react to the one - day tempo ?
Adam Hollioake Age : 31 Caps : 35 Led England in 14 of his 35 matches before a shoulder injury set his career back and England reverted to one captain for both sides .
Is battle - hardened , though , and a proven leader ."
"The first week of Cannes came to an end with Hollywood star - spotters mollified by the appearance of Keanu Reeves , Meg Ryan and Steven Soderbergh for their various press conference chores , and Arnold Schwarzenegger lumbering into town for a colossal party for his third Terminator film .
But as far as the competition films go , this has been a very non - American affair , with strong contenders from France , Iran and an outstanding movie from Turkey - surely a Palme d'Or contender and one of the best films I have seen here .
Samira Makhmalbaf 's At Five in the Afternoon , for all its baffling and disconcerting qualities , really does mark her as a remarkable film - maker .
True , she had the guidance of her distinguished father Mohsen as producer , editor and co - writer , but to have directed such a substantial piece of work shows something that goes beyond mere promise .
The movie is set in post - Taliban Afghanistan , where a 20-year - old woman , Noqreh ( Agheleh Rezaie ) , dreams of being the first woman president of her country .
The first half is a humorous , accessible and stimulatingly optimistic account of Noqreh 's attempts to impress upon her teachers and schoolfriends the seriousness of this ambition .
A young poet ( Razi Mohebi ) nurses a crush on her and helps her with posters , and there are droll asides about western politicians , including an acid assessment of Jacques Chirac .
Makhmalbaf devises touching and funny scenes at the girls ' school Noqreh must attend with much younger scholars , and has gently playful depictions of elderly , pious men muttering prayers at the sight of a woman going about without the burka .
But then Makhmalbaf changes her note to tragic .
Noqreh 's stern father decrees that she and her sister must leave the city with him ; obediently , Noqreh agrees and the story becomes heartbreaking .
Noqreh abandons her political hopes apparently without a qualm , and it is difficult for an audience to know what to make of this sudden , unexplained disappearance - a shift that is managed , like so much in modern Iranian cinema , with a weird impassivity .
Passages of dialogue are managed with such curious tranquil containment that it is sometimes difficult to believe that the principals were in the same room .
But this is confident and beautiful work , with stunning , almost surreal locations in Afghanistan shot in deep focus and sparkling clarity .
Of the two French films on offer , I found Raoul Ruiz 's Ce Jour - Là , or That Day , disappointing .
It is a satirical drama of Swiss bourgeois life with hints of Chabrol and Bunuel - tremendously performed and replete with formal elegance , but bafflingly devoid of any real tension .
Elsa Zylberstein plays Livia , a gentle soul who , through a quirk of fate , finds herself the sole inheritor of the rights to a vastly profitable table sauce that could save her father ( Michel Piccoli ) from ruin .
Bizarre and sinister plotting ensues , choreographed with a panache that does n't conceal its essential silliness and shallowness .
André Téchiné 's Les Egarés , or Strayed , is a period drama set in 1940 , as French civilians form a wretched line of refugees streaming desperately south as the Nazis invade .
To avoid being strafed by the sadistic Stuka pilots , schoolteacher Odile ( Emmanuelle Béart ) hustles her two children away from the road into woodland , where they meet a mysterious teenage boy ( Gaspard Ulliel ) who agrees to help them .
This is a handsomely mounted , sturdily constructed picture , based on Gilles Perrault 's novel Le Garçon aux Yeux Gris ; it has the classic values of old - fashioned storytelling , and a terrifically confident sense of time and place .
For some , this yarn might come a little close to sentimentality , but it is a charming and shrewd story about the adventure of childhood .
Easily the best film in competition so far has been Uzak , or Distant , written and directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan : a profoundly beautiful and moving meditation on loneliness whose essential seriousness does not preclude some tender comic moments .
Muzaffer Ozdemir plays Mahmut , a prosperous and successful photographer in Istanbul .
Now divorced , he has cultivated fastidious bachelor habits that fall apart when his dopey country cousin Yusuf ( Emin Toprak ) comes to stay while looking for work .
Calling Uzak an odd - couple comedy does not quite convey the melancholia that drifts through the movie like a cloud , with unapologetically long single takes and wistful silences .
But it really is funny , with a humour rooted in compassion for unhappiness , absurdity and the encroachment of old age .
There are , hard though it may be to believe , sight gags that are the work of tremendous comic talent .
It is a film of exquisite piquancy : a real masterpiece .
In the Un Certain Regard section , American Splendor was a funny and funkily downbeat docudrama about the underground comic - book writer Harvey Pekar , played by the man himself and also by Paul Giamatti , who has a lock on vulnerable nerd roles in the indie - movie world .
This was a movie in the spririt of Terry Zwigoff 's Crumb - and sure enough , James Urbaniak turns up as Robert Crumb , now nothing less than a tutelary deity to the comic world ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger plans to defy the ageing process and return as The Terminator in at least one more film about the monosyllabic cyborg from the future .
The 56-year - old star , fresh from a successful round of publicity for Terminator 3 : The Rise of the Machines at Cannes , told reporters at a press conference he felt healthier than ever despite the physical demands of filming for the action series .
He said : "" Is this my last Terminator ?
No .
I 've so many more years left .
I 'm totally full of energy and thanks to my weight training and cardio - vascular training
I 'm in great shape .
I consider this the middle term of my career . ""
Schwarzenegger went on to urge fans to see the movie if they wanted to see more films about the Terminator .
He said : "" Go out and see the movie .
The more successful the movie is , the faster we can make Terminator 4 . ""
However the Austrian - born actor , who is regularly reported to be considering a switch from acting to politics , admitted he had faced a punishing schedule to complete some of the stunts for the £ 123 m sci - fi sequel .
He said : "" I 've worked harder on Terminator 3 than on any movie I 've ever done .
It was very hard as far as the stunts were concerned and I got some serious injuries which left me needing surgery . ""
Schwarzenegger , who received a £ 21 m pay cheque for reprising his role as the badass bionic man , must save 18-year - old resistance fighter John Connor from another assassin sent back from the future in the new film .
Terminator 3 is released in the UK in August ."
"Admittedly many of them preferred to arrive on private jets rather than scheduled flights .
But the galaxy of US stars at the Cannes film festival yesterday seemed to undermine the claim of the culture minister , Kim Howells , that Hollywood 's action heroes lacked the "" balls "" to fly to Europe because they feared terrorist attacks .
The action hero Arnold Schwarzenegger made an appearance - and said he felt it was important to visit Europe to promote his work .
The cast of The Matrix Reloaded , including Keanu Reeves , arrived en masse before heading for London for the film 's UK premiere .
Kevin Costner was also there and Clint Eastwood is expected .
Other A - list stars who clearly were not afraid to fly included Nicole Kidman , Meg Ryan and Jackie Chan .
Tom Cruise , who was singled out for special attention by Mr Howells as one of the "" swashbuckling "" heroes more fearful than "" grannies from New York "" was not present but his girlfriend , Penelope Cruz , excused him on the grounds of prior filming commitments .
A festival spokeswoman said : "" I do not know what this man is talking about .
We have many big American stars here . ""
Schwarzenegger , who is in Cannes to promote Terminator 3 : Rise of the Machines , said earlier in the week that it was essential for movie stars to visit Europe .
"" I come from Austria
and I know the world is a big place , "" he said .
"" If you want to be successful , you have to reach out to people all over the world .
"" It is not the first time Mr Howells has caused controversy .
Earlier this year his remarks about the band
So Solid Crew following a shooting in Birmingham were criticised by the music industry and his comment that last year 's Turner Prize entries were "" conceptual bullshit "" made waves in the art community .
Asked if Tony Blair agreed with Mr Howell 's assessment of stars such as Cruise , the prime minister 's official spokesman said : "" You ca n't criticise ministers on the one hand for being programmed automatons and on the other take issue if they say things that perhaps are a little bit more interesting than usual . """
"In the past week , I have been within feet , and in some cases inches , of the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger , Nicole Kidman , Jackie Chan , Helen Mirren , Julie Walters , Steve Coogan , Harvey Weisntein , Stephen Fry , Emily Watson , Emilia Fox ...
darlings , the list simply goes on and on .
Inevitably , every halfway newsworthy quote from these star studded promotional events is beamed back home and published quick - smart .
But some of the out - takes prove to be more telling .
Nicole Kidman , for instance , came across as fantastically articulate and open at the press conference following the screening of Lars von Trier 's Dogville .
Perhaps we were seeing her through rose tinted spectacles after being moved by a film which so breathtakingly expresses the sick realities of human nature , but I do n't think so .
She admitted that , in order to get over their preconceptions about each other , she and Lars spent hours in the woods having a screaming and crying ' heart to heart ' .
Their one moment of tension came when Von Trier was asked why all his films feature women being tortured in the last act .
He began to answer , only to stop dead and say , in the tone of a parent at the end of their tether : "" You promised you would n't do that . ""
A collective sigh of relief was audible only when it became clear that this was directed at Nicole , who had lit a cigarette .
At a press conference to announce an upcoming Peter Sellers biopic , Emily Watson became defensive when a Times journalist referred to Sellers as an "" evil loony "" .
"" You have associated the word loony with evil , "" she complained . ""
But lots of my best friends are loonies , and they are lovely people . ""
Since it is surely a scientific fact that all actors are mad as sticks , one wonders to which "" friends "" Emily is referring .
At a launch for Jackie Chan 's $ 100 m remake of Around the World in 80 Days , the star revealed his less politically correct side when he was asked to comment on co - star Cecile de France . ""
When I first saw Cecille on set , I said : who is she ?
Because without her make - up and everything , she looked like nothing .
But then suddenly on camera , she looks really sexy and great .
""
No doubt Mlle de France appreciated the compliment .
But the piece de resistance of celebrity naffness was the Terminator 3 : Rise of the Machines publicity stunt outside the Carlton hotel .
A bank of photographers and hundreds of fans had gathered expectantly .
"" Lifesize "" robots were jerking a bit in the background while dramatic music wafted over the throng .
In special effects terms , it was on a par with a Hamleys window display .
Eventually an alarm sounded and a robotic voice announced that an intruder was in the area .
With that , the futuristic cardboard doors slid open and out lumbered Arnie , in full make - up , shades , and a light summer suit . ""
Hello Ever - bady , and velcome to our terrific set , "" announced the musclebound one .
"" I love the Cannes film festival and I have been coming here to promote my films since 1977 , for my first film , Pumping Iron .
I come to Cannes because thousands of journalists and photographers from around the world come to Cannes .
So make sure you urge all the fans to see Terminator 3 : Rise of the Machines , in your country , because we have the best stunts , and visual effects that you have never seen before . ""
Then he dutifully posed with the robots for a moment , muttering at the photographers ( "" You 're getting all your shots ?
Very nice , good "" ) .
Some of us were lucky enough to rub shoulders with Mr Schwarzenegger again that night at the T3 party , held at Pierre Cardin 's notorious bubble palace in the hills above Cannes .
Or in my case , I had to hover awkwardly on the red carpet outside for a while , to facilitate his dramatic entrance .
It was a great party though , whose many casualties could be seen lolloping around town the next day .
At a Miramax lunch at the Carlton , I met the features editor of a film magazine , who shall remain nameless .
Still wearing his party ensemble , he told me that he 'd been woken up in the wee hours by a policeman tapping him with his truncheon on a park bench outside the Palais du Festival .
In the meantime a publicist that I met at Harvey Weinstein 's lunch had just spent a rather more civilised evening aboard Aristotle Onassis 's old boat ( the Cristina O ) which one of her clients had hired for the festival .
Inside the pampered guests could recline next to a piano that Sinatra used to play , as well as a stool that Marilyn Monroe used to sit on , complete with a cover made from - of all things - a whale 's foreskin .
Inevitably , the running joke of the evening became : "" I 've sat on Moby Dick 's dick "" ."
"Plans are under way to terminate the reign of the governor of California , Gray Davis .
And the man who could take his place is a former Mr Universe , better known as Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Governor Davis , a Democrat who was re - elected only last November , is facing a bid to recall him , a process that requires nearly 900,000 of the electorate to sign a petition to trigger a recall vote and a new election , possibly this year .
The recall campaign claims that Mr Davis , who is facing a budget crisis , lied about the depth of the deficit to win re - election .
And although no governor has been recalled before , he is seen as vulnerable .
Leading the bid to have him recalled is Darrell Issa , an Arab - American Republican congressman who became a multi - millionaire when he sold his security alarms business and who has gubernatorial ambitions .
He is funding the recall campaign himself .
Yesterday his campaign manager , Scott Taylor , said that they had already got around 287,000 signatures of the 897,000 needed and had no doubt they would reach their target in time to trigger a November vote .
Initially , Mr Davis 's strategy was to downplay the recall efforts , but now the campaign is being taken seriously .
This week his supporters , including union and church leaders , announced the formation of a committee called Taxpayers Against the Recall .
But Democrats admit privately that a recall vote is almost inevitable .
Watching all this is Schwarzenegger , star of the films Total Recall and The Running Man .
He has made no secret of his interest in a political career and last year took soundings to see what his chances were .
It had been assumed that he would run for governor in 2006 , leaving him time to raise funds and carry out his marketing obligations for his new film , Terminator 3 .
But now he could find himself tempted to take on an unloved incumbent .
Yesterday Sean Walsh , one of Schwarzenegger 's political advisers , said no decision had been made .
He referred to a pledge by the actor this week to consult family and friends before deciding .
The star also said that his wife , Maria Shriver , who is President John F Kennedy 's niece and works for NBC , would have to "" give the green light - she moved away from Washington to get away from all that kind of stuff "" .
Schwarzenegger , 55 , became a US citizen in 1983 and was made chairman of the president 's council on physical fitness and sports by George Bush Sr .
He has the ear of the White House .
Mr Issa 's team are well aware Schwarzenegger may run .
"" It 's going to be a heck of a campaign , "" Mr Taylor said .
He added that Mr Issa , a conservative on issues such as abortion and gun control , would stand regardless of Schwarzenegger 's decision .
Commentator and former Democratic party adviser Bill Bradley said yesterday that any recall would be the result of voter dissatisfaction . ""
Californians want to have their cake , ice cream , apple pie and Diet Coke , "" he said .
"" They do n't want to cut any services but they do n't want to raise any taxes other than on cigarettes .
There is an air of unreality . ""
He said Schwarzenegger was more moderate than his screen image led people to believe .
"" He 's pro - choice , pro - gay rights , "" Mr Bradley said .
"" He 's a member of the Kennedy family and some of that , I think , has rubbed off on him . ""
He said Schwarzenegger was "" very meticulous "" and might yet decide that a bid in 2006 would be a safer option .
Bob Mulholland , campaign adviser to the California Democratic party , said most states were in dire financial straits and 46 other governors also had deficit budgets .
The Democrats were getting ready to fight , he said ."
"It threatens to become as much an American political tradition as democracy itself : if you do n't like how the votes stack up , then change the result by other means .
Two - and - a - half years after the Supreme Court invoked legal argument to hand the White House to George Bush , a car alarm salesman from San Diego is using a century - old law to win power for the Republicans .
And the efforts of Darrell Issa could catapult actor Arnold Schwarzenegger into a major political role .
Issa , a Republican congressman , wants to ' recall ' the state 's governor , Gray Davis , saying he misled the voters over the extent of California 's budget deficit in his re - election campaign .
The ' recall ' is an obscure statute , introduced in 1911 to give voters the chance to remove elected officials who they believe have committed ' egregious acts ' . '
This recall is being pushed by people who lost the last election , ' Davis said . '
This is about a bunch of affluent losers who are trying to spend money to throw the state into reverse . '
Issa , who would like to replace Davis , needs to collect 900,000 signatures to spark a new election .
At first , there was scepticism about his prospects .
No longer .
He has already collected 700,000 names , spending $ 800,000 of his own money - much of it on ' signature gatherers ' , who are paid 75 cents per name . '
Welcome to California - the wild , wild west , ' said Philip Muller of the California Voter Project and an opponent of Issa . '
We are talking about an attempted coup d'état by someone who is seeking to become the governor by the back door .
We had an election last year .
Davis won .
Get on with it . '
If the petition attracts the required number of signatures by 4 July , voters will be asked if Davis should be removed , and who should replace him .
However , Issa is not seen as the Republicans ' best chance .
Waiting in the wings is Schwarzenegger , who has never hidden his support for the Republicans or his political ambitions .
The 54-year - old is backing the recall , and has fuelled speculation that he will run for office , given the chance . '
I think the people obviously feel dissatisfied with the way the governor is handling the budget crisis .
I 'll think about [ running ] after I 've promoted my movie [ Terminator 3 ] , ' he said .
A Schwarzenegger bid would probably end Democratic rule in California .
Polls put Davis 's approval rating at just 24 per cent ."
"He 's certainly back .
After an absence of more than a decade , Arnold Schwarzenegger 's Terminator has shot to the top of the US box office over the July 4 holiday weekend . T-3
: Rise of the Machines , which cost an estimated $ 175 m ( £ 105.7 m ) to make , took $ 44 m ( £ 26.6 m ) over the holiday weekend and has made around $ 72.5 m ( £ 43.8 m ) since opening to preview audiences last Tuesday .
It 's also now the second highest R - rated opening of all time ( after The Matrix Reloaded ) and the biggest opening for Schwarzenegger himself .
The film is directed by Jonathan Mostow and received generally good reviews .
It also stars Nick Stahl , Kristanna Loken and Claire Danes .
But it was n't just action at American cinemas and another sequel also put in a fine performance .
Reese Witherspoon 's Legally Blonde 2 : Red , White and Blonde
took second place , with an estimate of $ 22.9 m .
According to its makers MGM , the film 's audience was 70 % women .
The week 's other new film , the animation Sinbad :
Legend of the Seven Seas took a disappointing sixth spot , while last week 's number one , Charlie 's Angels :
Full Throttle dropped to third place , on receipts of $ 14.2 m ."
"Sigourney Weaver has joined the cast of M Night Shyamalan 's new film , The Woods .
She joins Joaquin Phoenix ( who also starred in Shyamalan 's last film , Signs ) , William Hurt and Bryce Dallas Howard , in the film , which is set in 1897 b&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger may be considering a political career , but he obviously has n't yet turned his back on acting .
Variety reports that the star of Terminator 3 is to star in a new comedy , Big Sir , about a step - dad forced to travel across the States with his future step - kids in tow .
At the same time , he 's pursued by various questionable characters from his past .
Director Wim Wenders is said to have won back control of the copyright to his own back catalogue .
Screendaily reports that Wenders , who made films including The American Friend and Paris , Texas , had looked as if he might lose the copyright after financial problems involving the parent company of his old production business ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger was cheered on by around 5,000 people at the London premiere last night of Terminator 3 :
Rise of the Machines .
The Austrian - born actor appeared on the arm of his wife Maria Shriver for the event in Leicester Square , and spent 10 minutes chatting to fans and signing autographs .
In T3 he reprises his role as a friendly cyborg fighting to protect a future human resistance leader from the attentions of a time - travelling killer robot .
Last night he repeated his threat to return for a fourth film if this one does well at the box office .
Co - stars Claire Danes and Kristanna Lokken , who plays the "" terminatrix "" , were also at the opening , along with the usual gaggle of page three girls and other hangers - on ."
"For the first time in its history California is poised to recall its governor , plunging an already embattled state into political limbo .
Waiting in the wings as a prospective candidate to take over the governor 's mansion is Arnold Schwarzenegger , who has just returned home after an international tour promoting his latest film Terminator 3 .
Yesterday was the deadline for counting of signatures of Californian voters who favour recalling the incumbent Democrat , Gray Davis .
His opponents claim that he lied about the parlous state of the budget before his re - election last November and is thus unfit for office .
If the required percentage of the electorate has signed the recall petition , around 900,000 voters , the recall vote is triggered and could take place as early as September .
On the same ballot , voters would choose a new governor on a first - past - the - post basis .
Exactly who will run should become clear by the end of the week but Schwarzenegger supporters have been hinting strongly that he will be in the race .
The latest opinion polls indicate that 51 % of voters favour a recall .
An LA Times survey this week showed that well over the required number of valid signatures had been gathered .
Attention now focuses on Schwarzenegger .
For the past few weeks he has refused to commit himself but has dropped hints , telling troops during a visit to Iraq that California needed a regime change .
Already one Republican , US congressman Darrell Issa , a Lebanese - American from San Diego , has announced that he will stand and is running campaign ads on the radio .
Mr Issa , who made $ 100 m when he sold a car alarm business , has funded the recall campaign .
But the congressman has low poll ratings .
An anti - abortion , pro - gun conservative who had brushes with the police in his youth , Mr Issa is not seen as voter - friendly in a state supportive of Al Gore and where Democrats control the state assembly and the senate .
He was best - known until this year as the target of a bomb plot by the LA - based Jewish Defence League .
This leaves the field open for Schwarzenegger , who is moderate on abortion , gay rights and civil liberties , or Richard Riordan , the former mayor of LA .
The latest polls show Mr Riordan is the most likely winner .
The two are in consultation as to which of them should run .

Whoever inherits the governor 's mansion will find chaos waiting .
Interest on debts are running at $ 30 m a day and the recall vote will cost $ 35 m .
The only previous recall of a state governor was in 1921 in North Dakota ."
"For the first time in its history California is poised to recall its governor , plunging an already embattled state into political limbo .
Waiting in the wings as a prospective candidate to take over the governor 's mansion is film star Arnold Schwarzenegger , who has just returned home after an international tour promoting his latest film Terminator 3 .
Yesterday was the deadline for counting of signatures of Californian voters who favour recalling the incumbent Democrat , Gray Davis .
His opponents claim that he lied about the parlous state of the budget before his re - election last November and is thus unfit for office .
If the required percentage of the electorate has signed the recall petition , around 900,000 voters , the recall vote is triggered and could take place as early as September .
On the same ballot , voters would choose a new governor on a first - past - the - post basis .
Exactly who will run should become clear by the end of the week but Schwarzenegger supporters have been hinting strongly that he will be in the race .
The latest opinion polls indicate that 51 % of voters favour a recall .
An LA Times survey this week showed that well over the required number of valid signatures had been gathered .
Attention now focuses on Schwarzenegger .
For the past few weeks he has refused to commit himself but has dropped hints , telling troops during a visit to Iraq that California needed a regime change .
Already one Republican , US congressman Darrell Issa , a Lebanese - American from San Diego , has announced that he will stand and is running campaign ads on the radio .
Mr Issa , who made $ 100 m when he sold a car alarm business , has funded the recall campaign .
But the congressman has low poll ratings .
An anti - abortion , pro - gun conservative who had brushes with the police in his youth , Mr Issa is not seen as voter - friendly in a state supportive of Al Gore and where Democrats control the state assembly and the senate .
He was best - known until this year as the target of a bomb plot by the LA - based Jewish Defence League .
This leaves the field open for Schwarzenegger , who is moderate on abortion , gay rights and civil liberties , or Richard Riordan , the former mayor of LA .
The latest polls show Mr Riordan is the most likely winner .
The two are in consultation as to which of them should run .
The White House has kept its distance from the fray , unable to decide whether a recall will benefit the Republican party in next year 's presidential elections .
On a fund - raising trip to LA , George Bush made no reference to the issue .

"Arnold Schwarzenegger is likely to pull out of the race for California governor , according to one of his aides .
A famous Republican , the star 's fame should stand him in good stead in the place where Ronald Reagan made his first steps into politics .
But the aide said that "" there are still several things he needs to do to close the book on this , but that 's the direction he is headed in right now . ""
The actor 's reason for not pressing ahead with his campaign , according to the aide , is that his wife Maria Shriver ( a member of the democratic Kennedy family ) does n't suppport it . ""
She has concerns about their young children and the quality of life they would have by a father who would be engaged 20 hours a day in state government , "" the aide said .
Some people have also suggested that any political move on Schwarzenegger 's part would open up his private life to greater scrutiny , where he has already been accused of cheating on Shriver , the sexual harassment of women , and of drug use , in an article in Premiere magazine in 2001 .
Schwarzenegger has yet to make a formal announcement one way or the other , but his decision should come this week ."
"After weeks of speculation over whether Arnold Schwarzenegger will run for California governor , the actor has chosen to announce his decision on a late night talk show next week .
Schwarzenegger , whose latest on - screen romp Terminator 3 :
Rise of the Machines is a worldwide hit and opens here today , will reveal his choice on Jay Leno 's The Tonight Show on NBC on Wednesday .
The 56-year - old actor must choose by August 9 whether to run in October 's election , which was prompted by the recent move to recall the governorship ballot .
It now seems he will not contest the seat with Gray Davis , the state 's Democratic incumbent , for family reasons .
Schwarzenegger is well known for his Republican beliefs , despite being married to Maria Shriver , the niece of John F Kennedy .
It is believed he will throw his considerable weight behind a bid by former Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan , who said he would run if the actor bows out .
The way would then be clear for Schwarzenegger to run in 2006 ."

The week 's three Hollywood movies are unnecessary sequels .
The best of them is Terminator 3 : Rise of the Machines , in which Arnold Schwarzenegger returns from the future once more , this time as the good cyborg he was in the first sequel .
His task is again to rescue John Connor , the designated leader of the freedom fighters who 'll save mankind .
Arnie 's Terminator comes naked into this world , marching into a raunchy hen night at a Los Angeles bar ( the experts on Antiques Roadshow would no doubt identify him as a Chippendale cyborg ) and takes the clothes off the back of a male stripper .
Meanwhile , a bad female cyborg , T - X ( Kristanna Loken ) , turns up , programmed to kill Connor , and she steals the car and natty leather coat of a startled middle - class woman .
There then ensues a rapid succession of violent fights and spectacularly destructive chases that tear up Southern California like an earthquake , with the occasional time out for exposition .
As usual , Arnie gets to deliver some wisdom and deadpan jokes in the vein of his fellow straight - faced alien Mr Spock , eg : '
Levity is good - it reduces tension and the fear of death . '
The first two movies have yielded up allegories of a philosophical and religious nature , and in The Philosopher at the End of the Universe , his book exploring philosophical ideas through SF movies , Mark Rowlands puts Arnie , ' the philosophical giant of Hollywood ' , in the same class as his fellow Austrians Wittgenstein , Freud and Karl Popper .
The most obvious interpretation of the new movie , however , is as a political allegory , the irresistible force , the Terminator , and the immovable object , T - X , representing the fight we all so desired for the governorship of California ( Judgment Day ) between Arnie and an opponent with any even longer name , Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington .
3-D has been available to filmmakers for more than 80 years but only once has stereoscopy been seriously in vogue and that , briefly , in Hollywood between 1952 and 1954 .
So Spy Kids 3-D , Robert Rodriguez 's third movie about Carmen and Juni Cortez , the ingenious children of retired US secret agent Antonio Banderas , is likely to be a one off .
Still , children will certainly enjoy donning the green and red glasses and having things thrown at them .
Much of the action takes place in the cyberspace of a computer game through which the insane Toymaker ( Sylvester Stallone ) seeks to possess the minds of the world 's kids .
To rescue his sister and save his peers , Juni Cortex must enter the game and destroy the Toymaker .
In addition to Stallone playing four characters ( one of them with a marked resemblance to Dick Cheney ) , he 's also impersonated by George Clooney in a guest appearance as the US President .
In Legally Blonde , the bird - brained fashionista from Bel Air Elle Woods ( Reese Witherspoon ) , breezed through Harvard Law School , using her instinctive intelligence to dazzle the legal world .
In the embarrassingly unfunny Legally Blonde 2 , she goes to Washington with her chihuahua to demand legislation to prevent dogs being used for testing cosmetics .
In a series of bland , sentimental scenes , everyone on Capitol Hill is won over by her innocent charm , and the producers have the nerve to show a clip from Mr Smith Goes to Washington , though they lack the gall to invoke Born Yesterday .
For seekers after needles in haystacks , one passable joke occurs when Elle examines a succession of dresses , remarking : ' Too Nancy ... too Hillary ... too Monica ... too perfect for words . '
After this unenterprising trio , it would be pleasing to give a warm welcome to David Gordon Green 's All the Real Girls , a low - budget independent movie that like his promising debut , George Washington , is set in a run - down North Carolina mill town .
The characters are sad , drifting twentysomethings and the central relationship is between a womaniser trying to reform , and his best friend 's sister , a virgin who 's returned from boarding school to this hopeless dead - end world .
Sadly , the movie , for all its palpable sincerity and honesty , is all fumbling , lethargic naturalism in the Cassavetes manner , a bit like an improvised version of Marty .
Maybe you have to be in the right mood for it , or of the same age and background as the characters .
Much preferable is the sweet - natured Kirikou and the Sorceress , a French animated movie drawing on a West African tale that has an authenticity The Lion King lacks .
The diminutive , preternaturally wise hero talks in his mother 's womb , cuts his own umbilical cord and proceeds to save the village from an oppressive sorceress .
The two - dimensional drawings with the characters usually in profile look like folk art and have the feel of a children 's book .
The attractive score is by the Senegalese musician Youssou N'Dour .
Finally , some revivals .
Yasujiro Ozu directed more than 50 feature films between 1927 and his death in 1963 , and his 1959 masterwork , Floating Weeds , is made in his usual austere style .
Each carefully composed set - up is seen from a fixed position of about 3 ft above the ground and there are no camera movements .
But this is a vibrant movie , one of his few in colour , and touches on universal themes through the story of a middle - aged actor and his young mistress coming with a second - rate kabuki company to a small coastal town where his former mistress lives with their teenage son .
It will be followed next week by his penultimate movie ,
The End of Summer .
Also back in distribution is Peter Greenaway 's first narrative feature , The Draughtsman 's Contract ( 1982 ) .
This remarkable Restoration country - house thriller is like a cross between George Farquhar 's The Beaux ' Stratagem and Hitchcock 's Rear Window .
It 's in what we now identify as his characteristically ludic manner and features the score that established Michael Nyman 's international reputation as one of the finest composers for the screen ."
"Actor Arnold Schwarzenegger and columnist Arianna Huffington both announced that they would be running for the governorship of California yesterday .
The actor 's decision , reveal - ed on Jay Leno 's television chat show , Tonight , came as a surprise because associates have been hinting that he had decided against a bid .
Schwarzenegger , a Republican , is tipped as a possible winner now that another Republican , former LA mayor Richard Riordan and a friend of the actor , is likely to pull out .
Democrat senator Dianne Fe instein also ruled herself out yesterday .
Huffington - flanked by supporters including Mothers Against Violence , an anti - gang violence group - announced her candidacy in South Central LA to the cheers of supporters and the strains of Bruce Springsteen 's The Rising .
She is one of more than 500 potential candidates who could be on the ballot by the time nominations close on Saturday .
The election is on October 7 .
The syndicated columnist will stand as an independent and promised to run a campaign without attack ads or polls .
Asked about her lack of po litical experience , she retorted : "" Are n't you glad I have never held political office ? ""
She pledged to put more money into schools and less into prisons .
"" I 'll close the loopholes that allow corporations to avoid paying their fair share of taxes by hiding their profits in tax shelters , "" she said ."
"What a difference a couple of years make .
In March 2001 , Hollywood was agog at a sensational article about Arnold Schwarzenegger in Premiere magazine .
It was entitled "" Arnold The Barbarian "" , and Arnie was accused of harassing , groping and fondling female reporters in his trailer - one came in to find the great man engaged in a certain sex act with another woman which he later reportedly laughed off with the deathless phrase : "" Eating is n't cheating . ""
And Arnie 's ticker , as well as his pecker , was supposed to be leading him into trouble : his heart was weak , following surgery in 1997 , said the magazine , and he is hardly in tip - top physical condition .
Yet two years on , and Arnie is still with us
; he 's back with a third Terminator movie
and he 's finally decided to run for governor of California - as a Republican , despite the Democrat sympathies of his wife , Maria Shriver , niece of John F Kennedy .
Schwarzenegger , of course , follows in the footsteps of that other eminent movie - star - turned - politician Ronald Reagan , although Austrian - born Schwarzenegger is not eligible for the White House .
Should Arnie run ?
Should any actor run ?
When Oscar - winning actress Glenda Jackson became a Labour MP in the 90s , it was assumed she was going to bring some prototypical New Labour glitz to Westminster .
Yet she became one of the most disappointing non - events in the party - not a careerist , not a policy wonk , not a parliamentary performer , not a luvvie .
It was as if she was resting .
The late Andrew Faulds , actor - turned - MP , also found that a theatrical larger - than - life personality does n't necessarily work on a political stage .
Clint Eastwood got bored of being mayor of Carmel pretty quickly .
If Schwarzenegger already was a politician , or in the midst of a campaign , then those 2001 allegations in Premiere would have been quite a blow .
But strangely , this might be a way of drawing a line under them : a second act in Arnie 's quasi - American life .
For obvious reasons , becoming a politician is an attractive new career move for an actor of a certain age .
In this televisual era , politics is even more about showbiz than ever , and successful actors are accustomed to canvassing for votes , overtly and covertly , in the months before the Oscars - although Arnie himself has not been within shouting distance of a statuette .
So if politics is showbiz for ugly people , are n't pretty people in a position to clean up ?
The example of Reagan could be an inspiring one for Arnie .
Reagan was no intellectual ; he turned to politics when his B - movie career was on the wane and he was starting to get offered bad - guy roles .
( Gore Vidal , however , refused to consider him for the role of the president in his 1959 play The Best Man , because "" he would hardly be convincing "" . )
Does n't Arnie need only to be an attractive , plausible figurehead for ideas developed by his political producers and scriptwriters ?
Possibly .
Yet Reagan was a shrewd political operator : a two - term president who won the cold war .
It 's not easy to see if Schwarzenegger , or any modern movie star , has the aptitude for political candidature : an existence that is less protected than the life of the Hollywood A - lister .
And politics is different from showbiz in one important respect : the past matters .
In Hollywood , if you do a terrible movie that bombs at the box office , it need n't matter - if you follow it up with a smash , then all is forgiven .
But in politics , you can make a mistake that comes back to haunt you even after your poll numbers have come back up .
One of the strangest sights in Reagan 's career was his testimony at the Iran - Contra hearings that he "" could n't remember "" the details put to him .
A political denial , yes , or maybe even the tragic beginnings of Alzheimer 's .
But I think it was also the stunned , plaintive bafflement of an actor and showbiz king , who was saying : "" But I 've been popular since then ; you 've liked me since then . ""
Even if the voters of the sunshine state ignore the racy rumours about Arnie , there is still his family past to consider .
His policeman father was a member of the Nazi party in Austria in 1938 ; Schwarzenegger will find that this will be publicised and investigated as it has never been before .
Will he have to apologise ?
Repudiate his father 's past ?
Visit the Holocaust exhibition ?
None of this is particularly good political PR .
Above all else , Schwarzenegger will have to have a pretty clear idea what he wants to do in office , should that ever become a reality .
Or he might become like Grace Kelly , who at the very height of her Hollywood fame became Princess Grace of Monaco - a sort of political position - and walled herself up in a Ruritanian mausoleum : what many suspected was a living death of boredom .
Arnie might find the political frustrations and compromises of a scrutinised life in the governor 's mansion very similar .
And if he gets sick of it after his term is up and wants once again to hop aboard the glittering carousal of Hollywood - well , he could find all the good scripts are going out to Vin Diesel .
Movies , like politics , are a cruel business .

"It is possible that a robot could do a better job as governor of California than the present Democrat incumbent , Gray Davis .
But even if this were the case , it is not the choice facing the state 's voters in a special election due in October .
The actor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , who has launched a bid to unseat Mr Davis , made his name playing a humanoid killer machine in a series of hugely violent , hugely successful films .
Before that , the Austrian - born immigrant achieved a sort of fame as a body - builder of painful proportions clad in a tight pair of briefs .
Arnie , as he is known to his fans , now possesses one of the most potent Hollywood images , instantly recognisable all around the world .
But Californians will not be voting for an image or a fantasy figure , for Conan the Barbarian , the Kindergarten Cop or indeed the Terminator .
They will be trying to find a politician who has the skill and ideas to rescue their state from a $ 38bn budget deficit , an energy crisis and myriad intractable woes for which Mr Davis , unfairly or not , is blamed .
It is important that they can see the difference .
It is unclear at this early stage whether they do .
At the same time , it is important not to be too pompous about Mr Schwarzenegger 's ambition for public office , as Democrats like senator Dianne Feinstein ( who has decided not to run ) and Mr Davis 's campaign aides are in danger of being .
The movie star 's candidacy brings with it the sort of excitement and glamour - and sex appeal - that is routinely lacking in US ( and British ) politics .
If Mr Schwarzenegger encourages voters actually to get out and vote , in a country where less than 50 % normally do , then his efforts will not have been in vain .
As the political base of Ronald Reagan , another actor turned governor , of Sonny Bono , the late congressman - cum - crooner , and of Clint Eastwood , spaghetti westerner and Carmel mayor , California has often aimed for the stars .
If Mr Davis 's last - gasp legal appeals fail and the so - called recall election to terminate his term goes ahead , the challenge posed by the hero of the aptly named Total Recall and Running Man will make for an action - packed contest .
There could be a movie in it .
Dabbling in politics by millionaire celebrities for reasons of self - promotion and personal vanity should obviously not be encouraged .
American democracy has long been overly vulnerable to the big name with the big money and the big mouth .
While Mr Schwarzenegger insists he is a serious candidate , he admits to weakness by other , present - day measures of political viability .
Past allegations of sexual abuse , dope - smoking and anti - semitism are certain to be recycled .
Opponents also point out that detailed Schwarzenegger policies on race relations , water supply , traffic congestion , smog and taxes have yet to be elucidated .
It can be assumed that his attitude to terrorism is fairly straightforward .
Yet the idea of Mr Schwarzenegger as total political novice is also wrong .
The actor has been closely involved with community and state educational projects .
His moderate Republican positions on abortion and gay rights will appeal to the centrist voters who are now deserting Mr Davis .
His self - portrayal as an American immigrant success story will play well with California 's Latinos .
He has handy personal connections with the Bush and Kennedy clans ; and unbeatable name recognition .
The dramatic way he exploded on to political centre - stage this week , after weeks of masking his intentions , suggests not a little guile .
Mr Schwarzenegger is ambitious , determined and tough .
As the bad guys will testify , it is unwise to underestimate him ."
"The actor Arnold Schwarzenegger said that deciding to run for governor of California was the most difficult decision he had made since 1978 when he decided to have a bikini wax .
The decision , announced on a television chat show , has plunged the political process in the state into further confusion and sent a warning message to career politicians across the country .
The race for governor has now become a comedy drama with new twists and characters emerging by the day .
But Schwarzenegger , whose chest measurement is the same as his age , 56 , insisted that he was serious in his candidacy because "" there is a total disconnect between the people of California and the politicians of California "" .
After weeks of hinting that he might stand , then apparently backing off , the Austrian - born Republican actor surprised even his close supporters when he told the show 's host , Jay Leno , that he was running in the October 7 election because the politicians were "" fiddling , fumbling and failing "" .
He said that he knew that his candidacy would provoke smears that he had no experience and was a womaniser , but he was ready for them .
The star of the Terminator films yesterday warned all politicians nationally , Republican and Democrat , that his candidacy was a "" wake - up call "" that they were out of touch with the people , who were trying to tell them "" I 'm mad as hell
and I 'm not going to take it any more ! ""
- a line from the 1976 film Network .
He also made much use of his own film catchphrase , "" Hasta la vista ! ""
A team of around 30 experienced political advisers , many associated with the last Republican governor , Pete Wilson , has already assembled around Schwarzenegger .
He starts the race today as a favourite in a state which has in the past elected one actor , Ronald Reagan , as governor , and another , the tap - dancing George Murphy , as senator .
Schwarzenegger said that he had only decided to run in the past two weeks after completing his publicity commitments for his latest film , Terminator 3 , which has done adequately if unspectacularly at the box office , taking $ 137 m ( £ 85 m ) in the US so far .
"" I have plenty of money , "" he said , "" and no one can pay me off . ""
His wife , Maria Shriver , a Democrat , member of the Kennedy family and television presenter , would be voting Republican for the first time , he said .
The actor 's bid comes as a result of a recall process through which the incumbent , Democrat Gray Davis , faces removal .
If a majority vote to recall him the electorate will simultaneously choose a replacement from a ballot that could contain hundreds of names .
The deadline for nominations is tomorrow and more than 500 potential candidates have already thrown their hats - and other items of clothing - into the ring .
Larry Flynt , publisher of the men 's magazine Hustler , is running , as are models , comedians and a punk rocker .
The field may thin out now that such a high profile figure has entered .
The former Mr Universe , who entered films after a career as a body - builder , has been vague on policies , promising to act on behalf of children and old people and to tackle career politicians .
If elected he would face a state budget deficit of $ 38bn and chaos in the education system .
His candidacy appears to rule out a bid by his friend , former mayor of Los Angeles Richard Riordan , who had been expected to run and leads in the latest opinion polls .
His supporters said yesterday that he was surprised by the announcement .
There are , however , other senior Republicans running , further complicating the process .
Leading Democrats , includ ing the state 's lieutenant governor , Cruz Bustamante , have also entered the race , breaking a fragile alliance around Davis .
Columnist Arianna Huffington is running as an Independent , and Green Party veteran Peter Camejo has filed papers .
President George Bush has kept out of the furore , saying the recall and the candidates were a matter for Californians .
Schwarzenegger will hit the road next week , when he may discover that running a political race can be even more painful than a bikini wax ."
"Doug Gamble Los Angeles Times , August 8 "" Arnold Schwarzenegger has to be credited with pulling off one of the biggest surprises in state political history by throwing his headband into the ring ...
Making his announcement on Jay Leno 's The Tonight Show rather than a legitimate news venue was an insult to everyone who takes politics and California 's problems seriously ...
"" If [ Governor Gray ]
Davis is recalled and the choice of an alternative is determined by name recognition alone , Schwarzenegger would win .
But if Californians recognise the need for deft leadership by an experienced politician who can navigate the mazes of government , there are enough viable alternatives to prevent the actor who debuted in Hercules in New York from appearing in a new production called Neophyte in Sacramento . ""
Lexington Economist , August 9 "" The most populous state in the country and the world 's fifth - biggest economy is in a desperate mess , with a gigantic deficit , a crumbling infrastructure and a weak economy .

The big surprise about the Terminator 's candidacy is that it is deadly serious .
Schwarzenegger , a long - standing Republican , has a better chance than anybody else in his party of unseating the Democratic governor , Mr Davis .
His entry into the race not only turns him , at once , into the frontrunner .
It hugely increases his chances of saying , ' Hasta la vista , baby , ' to Mr Davis .
The actor boasts not only star power and name recognition ...
he is also a liberal Republican :

Given his enormous celebrity , Schwarzenegger immediately becomes a favourite ...
So far , the recall campaign has been a vehicle for the expression of public dissatisfaction with Mr Davis ...
We have always thought that the idea of tossing Mr Davis out of office on the grounds of general irritation was a terrible idea .
But now that the recall is under way , it seems counterproductive for other California Democrats to stay out of the race .
"" It is possible to oppose the recall but still make sure that , if Mr Davis goes , there is a good alternative on the ballot , stuck in there amid the pornographers and exhibitionists and Terminators . ""
Washington Post Editorial , August 8 "" No one who cares about American democracy can welcome this spectacle ... ' People are sick and tired of politicians , ' Schwarzenegger said on Wednesday .
No doubt many are .
But the skilful conduct of politics - the art of compromise and negotiation among competing interests - will ultimately be needed to solve California 's problems .
"" American voters rightly have tended to be wary of wealthy would - be saviours who claim to be above the fray , who disdain party but represent ' all the people ' , who tout their independence because they can pay for their own campaigns .
But it can take time and exposure for the appeal of such candidates to wane .
In a campaign this short and unusual , no one can predict what Californians may saddle themselves with . ""
Christoph Winder Der Standard , Austria , August 8 ""
A Terminator with an old man 's face and suffering from gout is difficult to imagine ...
That is why it is clever if Arnie goes after a career in which you can theoretically work until past your 70th birthday ...
The US media , from the New York Times to the Washington Post , might turn their noses up at him because he has absolutely no political experience .
But as the incarnation of a wide cinematic appeal he is unbeatable ...
We wish Arnie all the best for success in the election .
But as objective political observers we would add : the task which he would have to face up to is as tough as steel . ""
Andreas Unterberger Die Presse , Austria , August 8 "" Schwarzenegger is nice and successful ...
He is modest in spite of all his success and is committed to helping the disabled ...
It 's not just professors who are entitled to become politicians ...
But does he have the knowledge to put things right ?
For the moment we have only heard pure populism from him ...
He will need muscle power above his neck , too , if he is to grasp that every politician faces the same problem .
There are n't just ' people ' but many individuals who have special interests .
These must be balanced out by politics . ""

"There 's a fabulous scene in the sci - fi thriller Total Recall where Arnold Schwarzenegger visits a sinister travel company called Rekall .
Thanks to state - of - the - art technology , Rekall can implant artificial memories of exotic vacations in people 's brains - a visit to the Red Planet , maybe , or an overnighter in Honolulu .
The hook is : you 'll remember whatever you want without actually having to experience it .
That 's it , I shrieked ; after seeing the film , I never have to go abroad again .
Thanks to virtual travel , I can experience all the hedonism of Ayia Napa without having to leave my sitting - room .

Am I the only person who loathes holidays ?
What to wear ?
Who to take ?
Who to avoid ?
It 's a social minefield .
Relationships with friends and lovers are strained to near breaking point .
According to a recent ' holiday compatability ' survey , two - thirds of respondents said their companions were inconsiderate , while half rated them boring .
And yet people live for their holidays , they really do .
Normal , sensible adults do a job they hate all year , just for the pleasure of spending a week in a Tibetan foot spa .
And , dear God , holiday anxiety starts early .
Around February , you 'll find your hairdresser asking confidentially : ' Doing anything special this year ? '
Suddenly , colleagues are mysteriously incommunicado as they pore over ' Affordable Portuguese Palace Hotels ' .
If you have n't got anything booked by August , you 're a pariah .
Try to buy sandals or a bikini and shop assistants gasp in horror . '
Much too late , ' they trill . '
Have you thought about skiing ? '
Meanwhile , back in the office , Competitive Summer Reading is in full swing . '
I 'm taking the Irvine , ' booms a department head . '
I hear the new Amis is no good . ' '
I thought I might be less commercial , ' another proffers , ' so I 'm packing the Koran . '
So imagine my delight to read about Imaginary Holiday Syndrome .
Some three million Italians actually go to the trouble of faking their holidays .
According to research by Help Me , a voluntary organisation founded by Italian psychologists to identify and assess those in need of help , 19 per cent of their countrymen are not planning to take a holiday this year , but almost a third of them intend to pretend that they are .
Some holiday refuseniks were ready to go to quite extraordinary lengths to keep up the pretence .
Two - thirds said they would make sure they informed themselves about the resort they were pretending to visit ; 24 per cent were planning to buy an ultraviolet lamp to get a fake tan ; and 19 per cent intended taking their plants to a neighbour .
Peer - group pressure makes liars of us all , apparently .
According to Italian psychologist Massimo Lattanzi : ' A lot of interpersonal relationships are fake or superficial .
People go to their address books and find they do n't have a friend with whom to go on holiday .
In the end , they stay put , as if paralysed in the presence of a huge inner emptiness . '
Once upon a time , holidays were simple things ; you spent a week in a caravan in Wales , where it rained every day , and , if you were lucky , you added a new costume doll to your collection .
Now , holidays have become lifestyle fascism .
You 're nobody if you have n't booked a party for 10 in a tiny , unspoilt Provençal village .
Faced with such madness , faking a holiday could be seen as the ultimate art form .
Several years ago , students at Leeds University fooled the pompous art fraternity by creating a fake holiday to Spain for their end - of - year show , claiming that they had spent more than £ 1,800 of sponsorship on the ' sun - and - sangria ' trip .
Later , they admitted their tans came courtesy of an ultraviolet sunbed , while the arty beach photos were actually taken on the Costa del Scarborough .
Insisting their holiday installation ' challenged perceptions of art ' , the ' Leeds 13 ' were awarded first - class degrees .
Quite right , too .
This year , I shall be taking a balcony holiday ( fashionable parlance for staying at home in August ) .
Door locked , I 'll waft around the flat in a grass skirt , cocktail in hand , exchanging pleasantries with the cat .
Strategically arranged postcards will arrive on friends ' mats .
I may even risk a few boastful emails alluding to a ' holiday romance ' .
Only the newsagent will be in on the ruse , as under cover of darkness , I swoop out for a daily fix of the newspapers and Heat .
Returning to work , permatanned , clanking with duty free , I shall remain suitably enigmatic .
If you even think of asking me where I went , my eyes will roll back in their sockets , Arnie style , and I 'll answer : ' Mars - we got an upgrade . '"
"Hasta la vista to the political honeymoon .
Four days after after his gubernatorial campaign in California opened to better reviews than any of his films ever did , Arnold Schwarzenegger yesterday came face to face with political reality when he was attacked from the left for being too naive and from the right for being too liberal .
The 56-year - old actor embarked on a quick - fire round of TV interviews aimed at capitalising on his already stratospheric ratings in the campaign to take the most powerful office in the nation 's biggest state - Governor of California .
But instead of momentum the appearances produced a succession of awkward moments as he was asked to explain his political views .
Pressed on a range of issue that are certain to feature prominently in the run - up to the vote on 7 October - gay marriage , health services , the fiscal crisis facing California - Schwarzenegger was forced to deny a policy statement attributed to his staff or revert to the time - honoured formula of the candidate under pressure : ' I do n't want to go into that right now . '
Asked by one interviewer if he would publish his tax returns - as is expected of any candidate for public office - Schwarzenegger suddenly discovered his earpiece was not working and said he did not hear the question . '
Pretending he ca n't hear the questions might work in Hollywood , but it does n't cut it for the voters of California , ' said a spokesman for the Democratic Party , who urged the media to scrutinise Schwarzenegger 's political record more closely .
The media took his advice and within a couple of hours turned up the embarrassing allegation that the actor had voted in only two of the last eight statewide elections .
Attacks from the opposite side of the political divide are to be expected but more surprising , and more damaging to his hopes of becoming , in the words of his supporters , ' the new Ronald Reagan ' , is the lukewarm reception his entrance into the race has received in some Republican circles . '
All these Republican orgasms over Arnold Schwarzenegger are fake , ' declared Rush Limbaugh , the popular political radio talk - show host and the spiritual leader of America 's right - wing . '
In his own words he [ Schwarzenegger ] has proved he is not a conservative .
To the extent that he said anything , he has sounded not like a fiscal conservative but a moderate Democrat . '
He has told the press he is "" very liberal "" about social programmes , supports abortion and homosexual adoption , and advocates gun controls .
And he expressed disgust with the Republicans who impeached Clinton .
Does this sound like the next Reagan , as some people are calling Arnold ?
Hardly .
This guy may be the next actor elected Governor of California , but that 's where the similarity between him and Ronald Reagan ends . '
Schwarzenegger 's hope of a smooth passage to the governor 's chair received a further blow with the news that another prominent party figure , Bill Simon , who narrowly failed to unseat the incumbent Democrat Gray Davis last November , will also contest October 's election .
Davis faces being voted out of office under an obscure clause in California 's electoral law that allows officials to be ' recalled ' if enough voters sign a petition accusing them of an ' egregious ' act .
With California facing a $ 38 billion ( £ 23.5bn ) deficit , more than 1.3 million voters signed such a petition - thus triggering an election .
So far more than 500 candidates , most of them frivolous , have declared they will run .
With vast amounts of money at their disposal , political campaigns in California are notoriously dirty , with the private lives of candidates being trawled through for embarrassing revelations .
It is thought that Schwarzenegger could be vulnerable to such attacks .
Indeed , he admitted as much during one interview , conceding that his opponents would try to label him as a ' womaniser ' .
He is married to Maria Schriver , a member of the Kennedy clan and a high - profile TV journalist who this weekend announced she would take leave from her presenting post on the NBC network to back her husband 's campaign .
The polls suggest the actor 's name recognition will carry him to victory but most observers believe the gap will narrow as voters begin to focus on policy .
One bright spot was the news that President Bush - until now noticeably silent on Arnie 's candidacy - had expressed confidence that he would make a ' good governor ' if elected , although the President 's confidence did not extend to committing to campaign on Schwarzenegger 's behalf ."
"In addition to those persons named in our earlier mailing , the following are now registered as candidates for the upcoming California gubernatorial election in October .
Arnold Schwarzenator ,
Mr :
A professional Arnold Schwarzenegger - lookalike from Venice Beach
, Mr Schwarzenator changed his name from Gary Dobbs by deed poll in 1997 .
The basis of his campaign seems to be that if elected he will do exactly what fellow candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger would have done , but for one tenth of the money .
Buckles ,
Mr :
A San Diego resident , Mr Buckles is viewed as a political outsider untarnished by recent governmental scandals , largely because he 's a chimpanzee .
Political scientists have long accepted that if 100 monkeys with 100 typewriters were locked in a room for a million years one would eventually succeed in registering its candidacy for governor , but few thought it would happen before October 's vote .
Mr Buckle 's policies are unknown and it is widely believed that he is running because someone promised him a banana .
Florence Hobart , deceased :
The dead lobby has always been the key to success in California politics , where more dead people are registered to vote than in any other state .
This is the first time , however , that a deceased candidate has run for office on a platform directly addressing the concerns of the departed .
Having been cremated in 1989 , Ms Hobart , a former resident of Yorba Linda , faces an uphill battle in persuading the dead who voted for Governor Gray Davis to transfer their loyalties .
Ozzy Osbourne , Mr : Osbourne claims to have no memory of registering and says he will not serve if elected .
There also seems to be some confusion over whether this is an actual campaign or a pilot for a television series .
Brandi Alexander , Ms : Internal politics have split the Topless party in the past , accounting for its failure to gain any council seats despite obvious popular appeal .
Ms Alexander , a native of Calabasas , is to be credited with uniting the disparate elements to form a strong coalition dedicated to toplessness in government .
Whether the seven million hits on the party 's official website last week will translate into votes remains to be seen .
Spider - Man ,
Mr :
The webbed wonder has entered the race with a basic anti - crime platform .
Rivals have objected to a fictional person being allowed on the ballot , but legislation denying cartoon characters the right to seek office , aimed at preventing Daffy Duck from running for mayor of Palm Springs , is still pending .
Lawyers for the Republican party are seeking to revoke his candidacy on the grounds that as a non - existent person he can not be a resident of the state , but he is currently fifth in most opinion polls , just behind OJ Simpson ."
"America 's hottest new reality show got under way at the weekend as 158 candidates , including an action hero , a former child actor , a billboard pin - up and a sumo wrestler , filed to run for the job as governor of California .
The star names , led by Arnold Schwarzenegger , ensured that county election offices were swamped by cameras , giving candidates a chance to offer a sound bite and a glimpse into their policies .
Some had clearly given it more thought than others .
Commentators have denounced the election as a "" spectacle bordering on farce "" that could have dangerous implications for both the state and the future of national politics .
Perched in her pink Corvette , the busty billboard star Angelyne gave her assessment of what to do about the state 's deep financial crisis : "" You get the taxes , you pay the bills and you 're done , "" she said .
The comic value of the election , which has reinforced America 's view of California as a curious place to live , belies the serious nature of the issues facing the country 's most populous state , such as a $ 38bn deficit and a big shortfall of money for public services .
The October 7 election has two stages .
Residents first choose whether to keep the recalled governor , Gray Davis , a Democrat , just eight months into his second term .
They then choose whom they would like as a replacement if he is ousted .
Opponents of Mr Davis , frustrated at his handling of the state 's finances and energy crisis , gathered 1.6 m signatures to get him recalled .
According to a poll by Time magazine and CNN , Mr Schwarzenegger , a liberal Republican , would have a comfortable lead if Mr Davis were to be kicked out , with 25 % of the vote , followed by California 's lieutenant governor , the Democrat Cruz Bustamante , with 15 % .
Others in the running include the Hustler porn magnate Larry Flynt , porn actor Mary Carey , columnist Arianna Huffington and Gary Coleman , who starred in the television comedy Different Strokes .
Mr Davis was yesterday dismissive of his chief rival : "" Recycling old lines from old movies only gets you so far . ""
Mr Schwarzenegger has so far dodged pointed questions on issues such as gay marriages or tax , as he begins the talk show rounds .
Asked about the environment , he said people have "" nothing to worry about "" - he would fight for the environment .
But the former Mr Universe has a lot going for him in a state that is home to Hollywood and disillusioned with professional politicians .
Many see his rags to riches immigrant background as a powerful draw .
He has also amassed a fortune - he reportedly earned $ 30 m from Terminator 3 - to fund his campaign .
Maria Shriver , his wife and the niece of John F Kennedy , has lent the lustre of America 's favourite political dynasty . ""
He will represent Democrats , independents and Republicans , men and women , all across this state , "" she told reporters .
John Garamendi , the state insurance commissioner , dropped out of the race under pressure from fellow Democrats and was scathing about the election . ""
This recall has become a circus , "" he said .
"" Every day we move toward more chaos and further from serious contemplation of the fundamental reforms necessary to restore our governmental systems and the reputation of California . """
"Arnold Schwarzenegger today enjoyed an early boost in his bid to become the governor of California by winning the backing of Warren Buffett , one of the world 's canniest investors .
By naming Mr Buffett as his economic adviser , Mr Schwarzenegger , the Terminator star , has won instant credibility in a political contest that is half celebrity circus .
"" Warren is helping me bring together a world - class team to assist me in addressing the problems and challenges facing businesses , investors and job creators in California , "" Mr Schwarzenegger said in a statement .
"" Warren has a common sense approach to business issues and an integrity that is unmatched .
That 's the same way I want to approach governing . ""
Mr Buffett , nicknamed the sage of Omaha for his investment wizardry , was equally gushing about Mr Schwarzenegger , easily the most recognisable candidate in a field of 135 candidate to unseat the Democratic governor , Gray Davis , whose popularity has plummeted along with the sinking fortunes of the state 's economy .
"" I have known Arnold for years and know he 'll be a great governor , "" said Mr Buffett , the world 's second richest man after Microsoft 's Bill Gates .
"" It is critical to the rest of the nation that California 's economic crisis be solved , and I think Arnold will get that job done . ""
Mr Davis faces the first "" recall "" vote against a California governor in the state 's history .
Should voters recall Mr Davis , Mr Schwarzenegger - already ahead in polls among the challengers - could take over America 's richest state .
Mr Schwarzenegger met Mr Buffett seven years ago at a lecture the investor gave in Los Angeles and their paths crossed again when Berkshire Hathaway , the investment company owned by Mr Buffett , bought NetJets , a corporate firm in which the actor owns a stake .
Last year , the two attended an economic conference in London at the British estate of Lord Rothschild .
Mr Buffett , whose prestige is all the higher for having sidestepped the dotcom craze , is not in the habit of openly supporting political candidates .
His political donations are small beer , never more than $ 1,000 , and usually for Democrats , including Hillary Clinton , the New York senator .
Only one moderate Republican has received a contribution from Mr Buffett .
So Mr Buffett 's high - profile declaration of support for Mr Schwarzenegger , who is running as a Republican , marks a considerable coup for the film muscle man turned politician .
Mr Buffett 's support will also burnish Mr Schwarzenegger 's liberal credentials in a largely liberal state .
Mr Buffett has lambasted President George Bush 's tax cuts , arguing that they benefited the rich rather than the poor , while doing little for the economy .
Mr Buffett recently wrote that the tax cuts had lowered his effective tax rate to 3 % while leaving his receptionist paying 30 % of her income in taxes .
In a recent article for the Washington Post , Mr Buffett wrote : "" Supporters of making [ share ] dividends tax - free like to paint critics as promoters of class warfare .
The fact is , however , that their proposal promotes class welfare .
For my class . ""
In winning the endorsement of Mr Buffett , the Terminator can only put more distance between himself and the other hopefuls .
They include Larry Flynt , publisher of Hustler , and a porn actress who is pledging to wire every room of the governor 's mansion with live Web cams ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger 's decision to join the California governor race could be having immediate benefits for the people of his home state .
California 's TV networks confirmed yesterday that they would be screening no - repeat , no - Arnie films for the duration of the contest .
The decision is in accordance with regulations set down by the Federal Communications Commission 's equal time provision , which prohibits the airing of any films , TV shows or commercials that could be construed as having a propaganda value for the candidate .
Another prospective candidate who has effectively been bumped from the airwaves is former child star Gary Coleman ( catchphrase : "" Watchu talking about , Mr Drummond ? "" ) .
Networks are banned from showing any reruns of his cheesy 80s sitcom , Diff'rent Strokes .
All told , it seems that TV in California just got a whole lot better .
Alec Baldwin is being sued by his former business partner , who claims that the actor owes her a $ 125,000 share from a TV movie he starred in .
In papers filed at LA 's supreme court this week , Corrinne Mann claims that she helped develop the TV movie Second Nature and is entitled to a 50 % cut of the $ 250,000 fee that the actor allegedly pocketed for the role .
Mann and Baldwin formed the production company El Dorado Pictures in 1995 .
They terminated their business relationship in 1998 ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger , the former Mr Universe and front - runner for the job of California governor , has added some financial muscle to his campaign by hiring the billionaire investor Warren Buffett .
The appointment will add some credibility to Mr Schwarzenegger 's campaign , which , critics complain , has so far been more about snappy one - liners than solutions to California 's parlous financial state .
It teams the Hollywood star with a Democrat - leaning Wall Street legend .
Mr Buffett , chairman of Berkshire Hathaway , will be the actor 's senior economic adviser , helping him to put together a team that can deal with the state 's $ 38bn ( £ 25 m ) deficit .
"" I have known Arnold for years and know he will be a great governor , "" said Mr Buffett .
"" It is critical to the rest of the nation that California 's economic crisis is solved , and I think Arnold will get the job done . ""
Mr Schwarzenegger is one of a field narrowed by state election officials to 135 on Wednesday .
The ballot on October 7 will be a two - stage vote - asking residents first if they want the incumbent governor Gray Davis kicked out of office , and then who they would want to replace him .
Despite pundits questioning the lack of substance to Mr Schwarzenegger 's campaign , his star power has ensured that he is currently leading the polls .
A CNN / Time magazine poll released at the weekend gave him 25 % of the vote .
Mr Buffett , 72 , known as the "" Sage of Omaha "" , has developed a cult - like following among investors .
Thousands make the annual pilgrimage to Omaha , Nebraska , for Berkshire Hathaway 's annual meeting to listen to his homespun wisdom on a wide range of topics .
His investment strategy is based on common sense principles : to buy shares in companies that he understands and to hang on to them for the long term .
In a prepared statement , Mr Schwarzenegger described Mr Bufett as his role model , "" the greatest investor ever , my mentor , and my hero "" .
Mr Buffett has in the past been identified with Democratic causes and has loudly denounced President George Bush 's tax cut plans as a social injustice .
He has also given campaign contributions to New York senator Hillary Clinton .
Mr Schwarzenegger , 56 , is a moderate Republican , and enlisting Mr Buffett could help him win over some Democratic voters .
The star of the Terminator films also has the backing of his wife Maria Shriver , a member of the Kennedy - clan , and a lifelong Democratic supporter .
Many observers have denounced the election as a circus , which could have damaging implications for national politics .
Others jostling for the job include the Hustler porn magnate , Larry Flynt , the former child actor Gary Coleman , and Angelyne , who drives a pink Corvette and is known for nothing more than buying billboards to plaster her image on ."
"At a time when British politics has seldom appeared to be more serious , here in America the California gubernatorial recall race has pitted a troubled one - time child actor against a bodybuilder turned superstar and a new advertising icon .
The trouble is that in a wildly eccentric field of 200 , it is next to impossible to tell who exactly is Madison Avenue 's fictional cartoon character .
Is Arnold Schwarzenegger real ?
Is Gary Coleman , once Arnold on the Diff'rent Strokes sitcom , who is on the ballot courtesy of a sponsorship by the East Bay Express newspaper ?
How about the comedians Leo Gallagher and Don Novello , or the model Angelyne , who has been peering down from Los Angeles billboards for years ?
Is the commentator Arianna Huffington a more serious candidate than others she has mocked ?
Oh , and then of course there is the incumbent governor , Gray Davis , currently languishing with a mere 21 % approval rating .
Conan O'Brien , the late night talk show host , put it succinctly and expressed what many in the rest of the United States have suspected for years : "" California has gone insane ; the whole state has lost its mind . ""
In such company , who is to know that Lester Terry Tate Speight , the official "" Speight as Tate "" candidate , is the cartoon character created by Madison Avenue ?
Terry Tate , more alert readers may recall , is the name of the tough tackling fictional office linebacker character dreamed up by Reebok 's ad agency , the Arnell Group .
Actor Lester Speight first appeared as Terry Tate in a commercial during this year 's Super Bowl , slamming inefficient office workers to the ground with vicious tackles .
Is Tate 's "" Playing hurt ?
Baby that do n't faze me "" slogan any more ridiculous than Arnie 's
"" Hasta la vista baby "" or Coleman 's "" Whatchu talkin ' ' bout ? "" .
Is it any more surreal than Davis governing through electricity shortages and blackouts in Los Angeles , a myriad of corruption stories and a budget deficit greater than $ 35bn ?
Put like that , the Arnell Group 's plan to keep Tate on the ballot for as long as he can milk the hype - before publicly withdrawing to reap yet more publicity - seems to be a pretty sound one from Reebok .
All it needed to do was cough up the $ 3,500 entry fee and then find the 65 signatures prepared to sign the ballot petition .
That was n't too difficult amid an angry population that has come up with over 1 million signatures ( admittedly egged on by the opposition Republican Party ) proposing recall for the governor .
It 's an extremely unusual motion , best compared to a motion of no confidence in Britain , but one issued by the electorate that actually directly leads to a new election .
Inevitably , it is now a 10 week media circus to be matched only by the rape trial of LA Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant .
The only snag on the horizon for Reebok is that the candidate might become too popular .
Despite the pledge to withdraw the candidature at some stage during the race , it is unlikely to stop some Californians voting for him on October 7 , and thereby spoiling their ballots .
Reebok could possibly be then accused - as it already has been - of disrespecting the democratic process .
But it is difficult to see how anything it does is more ridiculous than some of the bizarre developments we have already witnessed from some of the so - called "" real "" candidates .
Since Schwarzenegger declared his hand on the "" Tonight Show with Jay Leno "" ( of course ) last week , Coleman has declared that he will remain on the ballot , but will not campaign and will himself vote for Arnie .
With over 700,000 people going to the Reebok website to sign up voluntarily for Terry Tate e - mails , it seems increasingly likely that the popular ad character will attract exactly the attention that Reebok wants , making the sneaker manufacturer merely the most upfront of all the self - publicists in the contest .
What the whole thing really says about the Reebok product and its brand attributes is a more difficult thing to fathom .
But then , perhaps we should n't think too hard about a contest in which the Terminator looks set to win by a landslide ! ·

"What Arnold Schwarzenegger says in his first commercial of the Californian gubernatorial election is of course irrelevant .
Just like in his movies , it is difficult to even understand a word .
It is how he looks saying it that matters .
Arnie is , after all , an anti - taxation Republican running in a debt - laden state on a platform of fiscal responsibility .
He is someone who calls for a constitutional cap on spending , cheaper energy prices and reform of the workers ' compensation system in California , but who provides no details at all about these proposals - let alone how they will be paid for .
Arnie is promising to reform the political process while simultaneously attempting to capitalise on a shameful abuse of that same political process : the technically legal but cynically arcane recall campaign against the elected Democratic governor , Gray Davis .
But now the will - it - happen - won't - it - happen debate is over , with the deeply unpopular Governor looking dead in the water , bar some kind of unlikely righteous uprising by pro - democracy Democrats .
Now , with decision day - October 7 - looming ever nearer , the real battle starts : the television campaigns .
This , of course , means weeks of sound bites on the news programs ( the "" unpaid "" media ) , and an avalanche of advertising ( paid media ) .
And , of course , funding the campaign is the least of Schwarzenegger 's problems .
So how does he look and sound ?
The answer is pretty damn plausible .
This is n't a UK party political broadcast , remember .
Arnie has 60 seconds to say nothing much at all , but to say it with much conviction .
He can possibly look stiff , but not shifty ; sensitive , but not weak .
There is no real limit to how toothy the smile .
Actually the Austrian - born former bodybuilder looks every bit the charismatic superstar in the spot ( go to joinarnold.com to see for yourself ) .
He does not look as stiff as he does in some of his movies , and unsurprisingly comes across as more relaxed than most of his rivals in front of a camera .
Wearing a crisp , white , open - necked shirt and smile , Arnie moves around a rather formal looking office , designed to suggest the Governor 's mansion ( you see , you can picture him there now ! ) , and give him a little gravitas .
Gone are the jokes that marked his first weeks of full campaigning since declaring his hand on Jay Leno 's talk show .
Instead he portrays himself earnestly as "" the people 's governor "" , telling Californians that we have the right "" to demand more of our elected officials than just showing up . ""
"" There is an enormous disconnect between the people of California and the politicians of California , "" he continues engagingly .
"" We dah people are doing our job - working hard , paying our taxes and raising our families .
But the politicians are not doing deir job .
We can do better than that .
After all , we are California , always at the forefront of innovation .
Our farm products feed the world and our technology is second to none .
It is time to return California to der people . ""
He then says he wants to rebuild the state 's "" economic engine "" - only it comes out as "" injun "" , and Arnie briefly sounds horribly incorrect .
It is one of those moments where reality re - imposes itself on our willing suspension of disbelief .
Yes , this really is an Austrian former body - builder turned superstar who is running for governor of one of the most powerful states in America .
But overall , the ad is pretty spot on most of the time .
And he has a really good chance of winning .
In a field that appears to be settled at 135 candidates , Arnold leads the polls with some 23 % , safely ahead of Lt Governor Cruz Bustamante with 18 % .
No other candidates has more than 4 % .
With 58 % of voters saying they will vote for Davis ' recall , it really does look as if Arnie will indeed "" be back "" - in the Governor 's mansion .
That 's because he bringing a little desperately marketable glamour to this embarrassing charade - even if he utters some of the same platitudes as many other commentators , and avoids any details like the plague .
He just has to rouse and remotivate the state 's electorate .
There is little doubt Schwarzenegger , with his Kennedy wife , movie star looks and fortune , will be the candidate to beat . · Stefano Hatfield is contributing editor to Advertising Age and Creativity"
"Discreet efforts are being made to give Arnold Schwarzenegger a clear run as the Republican candidate for governor of California , as the latest opinion poll shows the Austrian - born actor trailing the leading Democrat in the race by 13 points .
With only six weeks to go until the vote on whether to replace the Democrat governor Gray Davis with one of 135 candidates , the field is already starting to thin .
Senior Republicans , however , would like to see it thin further .
Elsewhere in the US , the effect of the state 's recall campaign is already being felt .
In Nevada , a campaign was launched this week to recall the incumbent governor , Kenny Guinn , a Republican , who was elected last year and who has just raised state taxes .
The Bush administration had feared the California recall could make Republicans vulnerable in other states .
According to a weekend LA Times poll , 50 % of California voters now favour recalling and replacing Mr Davis , with 45 % against .
If he were recalled , 35 % say they would vote for his current deputy , Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante , ahead of Mr Schwarzenegger , on 22 % .
As for the two other Republicans , the conservative Tom McClintock is on 12 % , and the man who ran the 1984 LA Olympics , Peter Ueberroth , is on 7 % .
The polls are volatile , however : only a week ago they showed Mr Schwarzenegger well ahead of Mr Bustamante .
Mr Bustamante is coming under scrutiny for his membership of a radical student organisation , MECHA , which has campaigned for the return of the seven south - western states to Mexico .
A fourth leading Republican , Bill Simon -
last year 's unsuccessful Republican candidate - withdrew at the weekend .
He denied having been leant on by the White House .
The Republicans fear that while the Democrats are gradually lining up behind Mr Bustamante , their vote could be split three ways .
Yesterday , Mr Ueberroth bullishly told CNN that he was staying for the duration .
But no one would be surprised if both Mr McLintock and Mr Ueberroth withdrew as polling day approached .
Mr Simon and the Republican congressman
Darrell Issa had insisted they were in the race , spent hundreds of thousands on adverts , and then meekly withdrew .
One of the Republican party 's problems is that its conservative wing is unhappy that Mr Schwarzenegger is moderate on social issues .
Yesterday the actor told the rightwing talk show host Sean Hannity that he was in favour of abortion rights ; against gay marriage but favoured "" domestic partnerships "" ; against legalisation of drugs but favoured medical marijuana ; and supported some measures of gun control .
He avoided questions on affirmative action , another conservative litmus test .
The embattled Mr Davis received some consolation this week when labour leaders threw their organising weight and funding behind him .
Bill Clinton is also due in the state next month to campaign for him .
A poll has found 53 % of Californians believe that the campaign process has been "" a circus "" .
Only 42 % see it as "" democracy working "" ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger 's political bid to be all things to all right - thinking Californians hit the rails yesterday as a decades - old interview resurfaced in which he bragged of taking part in an orgy .
The 56-year - old gubernatorial candidate was forced to back - peddle after American news stations ran excerpts from an interview that detailed a hands - on encounter the aspiring politician would now rather forget .
The controversy centres on remarks Schwarzenegger made to French magazine Oui when he was 29 , in which he described group sex with a woman and several other bodybuilders at a gym .
"" I have n't lived my life to be a politician , "" he said at the time , explaining how "" everybody jumped on "" the woman , who was taken upstairs where the orgy promptly began .
"" I get laid on purpose , "" he said at the time .
"" I ca n't sleep before a competition and I 'm up all night anyway , so instead of staring at the ceiling I figure I might as well find somebody and fuck . ""
Schwarzenegger attempted to defuse the situation yesterday , saying that he was concerned with "" other things than politics "" back then .
These days the Austrian - born actor concerns himself with little else , and will need to work hard to claw back the confidence of the Republican party in the race to replace governor Gray Davis ."
"Taking drugs , having orgies and using homophobic language is n't behaviour that wins elections , not even in California , so it was no surprise when Arnold Schwarzenegger said last week that he ' could n't remember ' a 26-year - old magazine interview detailing his youthful behaviour .
But it was too late .
While Arnie feigned amnesia , the text of the embarrassing interview - published in 1977 by the now defunct porn magazine , Oui - was available on The Smoking Gun , a New York - based website which specialises in tracking down and publishing original documents , many of them embarrassing to the rich and famous . '
We had over 700,000 people visit the site within 24 hours of putting up the Arnie material , which is four times the normal traffic , ' The Smoking Gun 's founder and editor , William Bastone , said yesterday . '
It probably helped that he tried to lie his way out of it by pretending it did n't exist . '
Among the interested web visitors were the editors of the major American newspapers , all of which followed up The Smoking Gun 's scoop on the aspirant Californian governor and splashed it across their front pages .
The actor 's advisers accused his political opponents of dirty tricks , but the truth is that Schwarzenegger was just the latest high - profile victim of the website 's brand of gumshoe journalism .
Since it was founded in 1997 by Bastone , a former Village Voice reporter , and his colleague Daniel Green , The Smoking Gun has unearthed a stream of documents - official and unofficial - which have proved embarrassing to America 's great and good .
Earlier this year it posted the never - before - published witness statement which led to the conviction of film director Roman Polanski for rape .
Other recent victims include Tom Cruise , whose strict ' confidentiality ' agreement with potential employees was made public on The Smoking Gun , and Michael Jackson , who settled out of court with a teenage boy who had accused the singer of sexual assault .
The boy 's original police statement was first made public on the website , which also boasts the country 's most extensive collection of celebrity mug - shots - photographs of stars under arrest taken by police officers , as well as a hilarious assortment of backstage ' riders ' detailing the dressing room demands of the famous .
For instance , Christina Aguilera not only wanted a police escort to her concerts , she also wanted soy cheese and Flintstone sweets before she performed .
Jennifer Lopez demanded a room entirely decked out in white , from the couches to the candles and flowers , while U2 insisted on bottled Guinness rather than draught . '
We only have four people working on the site , so there are limits to what we can do and what we do best is to find interesting documents , ' says Bastone , adding that many of his tip - offs come from the police and lawyers . '
The fact that everything we publish is backed up by an authentic document means people have no room for complaint . '
The success of the website led to it being bought by the cable television network Court TV , which recently started The Smoking Gun TV .
The takeover allowed Bastone and Green to leave their jobs and work full - time on the website , as well as expand the staff to four .
Contrary to claims from the Schwarzenegger camp , his political opponents were not responsible for unearthing the Oui interview . '
In fact , this was just plain , old - fashioned journalism , ' Bastone says .
' We got a tip - off about the interview 's existence , that it contained some outrageous comments by Schwarzenegger and that someone was selling a copy of the magazine on eBay . '
We then set about getting our hands on a copy and managed that within a couple of hours .
This was n't dirty tricks .
We 're not in the business of taking handouts from Arnold Schwarzenegger 's political opponents . '
In the interview , the bodybuilder turned politician talked candidly about smoking pot and joining other men in what was described as a ' gang bang ' .
He also refers to gays as ' fags ' - language described by gay activists as homophobic .
The revelations could not have come at a worse time for Schwarzenegger , assumed to be the favourite to become governor of California in the 7 October election .
However , recent polls have placed him behind his main Democratic opponent , Cruz Bustamante ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger came under fire yesterday for refusing to debate with other candidates for governor of California on television last night .
The actor , who is running as a Republican candidate in the recall election on October 7 , will take part in only one of the three debates .
The first , billed to take place in Walnut Creek , in the north of the state , was due to feature the incumbent governor , Gray Davis , who is out to persuade voters not to recall him , and five rivals : Tom McClintock , a conservative Republican state senator ; Cruz Bustamante , the Democrat lieutenant - governor ; Peter Ueberroth , a moderate Republican businessman ; Arianna Huffington , an independent columnist and Peter Camejo of the Green party .
Schwarnezegger , who is being advised by former aides to the last Republican governor , Pete Wilson , said he would only take part in the September 17 debate if all questions were available in advance .
He said the voters would have ample chance to hear his message at rallies and on radio and television .
Mr Ueberroth said : "" The voters deserve to hear all of us .
Being part of this debate shows respect for the voters and the process .
"" When he launched his campaign on the Tonight Show , Schwarzenegger said he would not take money from "" special interests "" because he had enough of his own funds .
Since then he has accepted large corporate donations , brushing aside questions about whether they constitute "" special interests "" .
He has also been criticised for refusing to say how he would solve the state 's financial crisis without raising taxes ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger was quite literally left with egg on his face yesterday during a campaign rally in California .
The high - profile gubernatorial candidate was due to give a speech in Long Beach when he came under fire from students and landed an egg on his neck .
The 56-year - old superstar would have made his Terminator on - screen persona proud as he battled on bravely , wiping off the albumen and launching into an opportune soundbite . ""
This is all part of free speech , "" he reportedly told the rally at California State University .
"" I think it 's great .
Imagine if you were living in some communist state , you could n't do that .
I love this country . ""
The egg - hurler remains at large ."
"Spin doctors behind Arnold Schwarzenegger 's campaign to be Governor of California have come under fire in Russia over a film that shows them as the architects who propelled Boris Yeltsin to victory in the 1996 Russian presidential election .
Spinning Boris , starring Jeff Goldblum , will be shown in the US next year but has just been released on video in Russia .
It claims to tell the ' true ' story of how three American political consultants - including Schwarzenegger 's current campaign manager George Gorton - were secretly hired by Yeltsin and turned him from an election no - hoper with 6 per cent support to the victor within six months .
Directed by Roger Spottiswoode , who made Bond movie Tomorrow Never Dies and Arnie vehicle
The Sixth Day , the film shows the three plunging into the dangerous political world of mid - Nineties Russia .
With the help of Yeltsin 's daughter , Tatyana Dyachenko , they bring American ways to the naive East and stop Communists returning to power .
Insiders who were in the Yeltsin campaign admit the three were hired but are furious at the claim they spun Russian affairs . '
It 's bullshit , ' said Sergei Filatov , Yeltsin 's former head of staff .
' I never saw them .
They were n't needed at all .
But as they had been paid we decided to let them sit quietly in the President Hotel and not interfere . ' '
This film is just gibberish , ' said Yeltsin 's former bodyguard , Alexander Korzhakov . '
The Americans had nothing to do with Yeltsin 's victory . '
Gorton , with Richard Dresner , who once advised the Conservative Party , and Joe Shumate , who are also part of Schwarzenegger 's team , were hired for $ 250,000 .
In the film they tell Yeltsin 's daughter she should make sure he is sober when he makes a speech . '
Best to do it in the morning , ' she replies .
The Americans are credited with introducing the perception analyser , a room wired with dials so a focus group can show approval or disapproval . '
We used the perception analyser before they arrived , ' said Alexander Olson , director of the Public Opinion foundation , which worked with the consultants .
The film - makers say they expected a row .
Few Russian politicians would like to credit America for victory over the Communists .
Spinning Boris is not about Americans saving Russia , said Spottiswoode , but a look at Russian and American political life .
The Americans bring negative campaigning , walkabouts with rehearsed spectators and false campaign promises ."
"The race for governor in California has taken on a Latino accent .
With four weeks remaining until the October 7 vote , moves were being made yesterday to win over the state 's increasingly powerful Latino community .
Arnold Schwarzenegger had been hoping to act as grand marshall at the Mexican independence day parade yesterday in Los Angeles , a perfect chance to campaign among the city 's large Mexican - American community .
But organisers said that an unauthorised volunteer had offered him the role and said the actor would not be heading the parade .
"" I was looking forward to being with so many of my friends in the Mexican - American community to celebrate Mexico and its culture , "" said Mr Schwarzenegger in a statement .
"" Unfortunately , it seems that the politicians have gotten involved and I have been uninvited . ""
In what was widely seen as an attempt to win over the state 's Mexican - American community , Governor Gray Davis has signed a bill allowing illegal immigrants to hold driving licences .
Before the recall election was called , Mr Davis had been opposed to the bill which he signed into law on Friday .
Opponents have accused him of cynically seeking the Latino vote .
Mr Schwarzenegger , alongside some fellow Republicans , have opposed the move .
Mr Davis is fighting to hold on to his job .
Although the latest polls show that 50 % favour a recall , an increasing proportion ( 45 % ) oppose such a move .
Should the governor lose the recall vote , the frontrunner to replace him is his current deputy , Lieutenant - Governor Cruz Bustamante , whose one - time activities with a radical Latino organisation have been coming under scrutiny .
Mr Bustamante was a member of the Chicano Student Movement of Aztlan , known as Mecha , which has been accused by Republicans of being separatists with the stated aim of returning to Mexico the south - western states of the US - Nevada , Texas , California , New Mexico Utah , and Arizona .
While Mr Bustamante 's supporters have portrayed his involvement as a student rite of passage , one of his gubernatorial rivals , the Republican state senator , Tom McClintock , has claimed Mecha stands for militant racism and has sought to link Mr Bustamante to it .
Yesterday the Los Angeles Times columnist Frank del Olmo , himself a former Mecha member , came to Mr Bustamante 's defence , saying "" if the normally diligent senator [ McClintock ] had done better homework , he 'd have found that Mecha is no more militant and racist than the Republican clubs on many campuses . ""
Del Olmo encouraged the deputy governor not to disown the group .
Despite pressure from Mr Schwarzenegger 's supporters to drop out of the race , Mr McClintock is staking a powerful claim to the Republican right .
As an anti - abortion , anti - gay marriage , and pro - gun conservative , Mr McClintock claims to represent the true Republican view while Mr Schwarzenegger - pro - abortion rights , pro - gay partnerships and pro - gun control - is being portrayed as a moderate who is out of tune with the state 's Republican heartlands .
Mr Schwarzenegger 's team is increasingly concerned that McClintock will split the vote and accord Mr Bustamante victory .
Mr Bustamante , 50 , spent yesterday in Fresno talking to agricultural workers , who represent part of his core constituency .
Increasingly , his candidacy is being depicted as a chance for Latinos to take California 's most powerful political prize .
When elected deputy in 1998 , he became the first Latino to hold state office in 127 years .
His supporters now see the recall election as a perfect opportunity for him to replace Mr Davis , with whom he has a frosty relationship ."
"I 'd hate to be Arnold Schwarzenegger at the moment .
Not for the usual reasons of not having any of the right size clothes in the wardrobe and having to dream in German , or even being expected to expose my bum on film at the age of 56 .
No , it 's all this stuff about him having once called homosexuals ' fags ' and taking part in a ' gang bang ' earlier in the last century ( when quite understandably there were n't enough loose women to go round ) , neither of which indiscretions I would have thought was exceptional for a strapping young ex - bodybuilder with Nazis in the family , even less surprising in the light of his more recent hankerings to kick ass on the meathead side of American politics .
It 's funny how we did n't mind having Arnie as a role model for our dysfunctional teenagers during his Terminator period , but suddenly start demanding moral probity when it comes to the rather more straightforward job of executing real people , which of course is one of the perks of being a Republican state governor .
Even so , I do find myself yawning slightly when the papers get themselves into a sanctimonious froth with their insistence on unearthing hoary old crimes the minute someone gets a new job .
OK , I think they probably had a point when Mrs Hodge was given the ministership for family outings or whatever it was after having failed to notice all the paedophiles queuing up for work in children 's homes when she was eagle - eyed boss of Islington council .
But who in their right mind , for example , cares that the new Director of Public Prosecutions was once fined for speeding and sent his friend ( whom I believe is now a bus driver ) a speck of cannabis back in the days of untamed beards , nude ice - skating and concept albums ?
Not me .
Surely it 's better to get your motoring offences and drug - running career out of the way while you 're still a dopey student and not yet intelligent enough to see that one day you 'll be responsible for an entire country behaving itself , not least its bus drivers .
And what purpose does it serve ?
Splashing an important person 's youthful transgressions across the media may contribute to our communal entertainment but it hardly ever results in anyone being thrown from the window of high office , whether they inhaled or not .
For all his subsequent shenanigans , Jeffrey Archer cheerfully survived the disinterring of all those exaggerated stories about his academic and sporting accomplishments , not to mention the hilarious adventure of the two suits that he once wandered out of a shop with , thinking the till was on the other side of the road .
And judging by those revelations that never surface until the protagonists are safely dead or at least living in Huntingdon you do have to wonder what difference it makes .
It seems inconceivable that John Major could have run the country any less interestingly as a result of being secretly pleasured by Mrs Currie during those seemingly prelapsarian years when his cringeworthiest disclosures were still confined to associations with garden gnomes , circuses and his grinning brother Terry .
And did President Kennedy allow the presence of Marilyn Monroe under his duvet to get in the way of his standing up to the Russians even though - as it also turned out - he suffered for years with a bad back ?
No , we ca n't be fully culpable for what we did as ill - formed earlier versions of ourselves
and I 'm not only saying that because of the packet of blackcurrant Spangles I stuck in my pocket while innocently waiting for a loaf of bread in 1968 .
As Marlowe 's Jew of Malta famously pointed out when not wishing to have a previous offence taken into account ( though not so famously that I can remember what it was ) : ' That was in another country and , besides , the wench is dead . '
And if your past is another country ( which puts the moment of my own foolish adolescence somewhere around Tibet ) you have to assume that a life 's journey from there to here gives you a chance to change your mind about a few things .
Even Arnie probably has a steady girlfriend by now .
And , who knows , maybe some of his best friends are gay ."
"' I play the Terminator , but you guys are the real terminators . ""
So said Arnold Schwarzenegger to an audience of US marines during a recent morale - boosting visit to Iraq .
Now , say what you like about Arnold
but you ca n't fault the man 's honesty .
How many other people would be bold enough to stand in front of thousands of heavily armed American troops and liken them to evil killer robots sent from the future to kill women , children and , ultimately , the whole of humanity ?
Not that many .
Perhaps George W Bush might - but only if you spelt it out for him phonetically and projected it on to a really big screen with a little red bouncy ball to show him the way .
And yet Arnie said it , bold as brass .
And the gun - toting pseudo - cyborgs cheered and whooped at him like only trained killers who do n't realise the implications of an ill - conceived movie reference can .
But as Arnie discovered a few weeks later , honesty is not always the best policy , especially when you 're hoping to become the next governor of California .
At the end of last month , his carefully stage - managed election campaign was thrown completely off course by the appearance on the web of an interview he did with Oui magazine in the 1970s .
In the interview Schwarzenegger confessed to taking part in orgies and to taking drugs at parties ( "" I do what I feel like doing "" ) - which is fine for a bodybuilder turned film star but not so good for an aspiring politician chasing conservative votes .
The emergence of the long - forgotten interview on thesmokinggun.com drives home the fact that , thanks to the internet , it 's becoming increasingly difficult to escape from your past .
In pre - web times , even if someone had a copy of Oui still hidden under their bed after three decades , it was unlikely that they 'd go to all the trouble of telling the press about it .
But now the distance between Joe Public and Joe Media has been virtually erased ; everyone and their dog has a weblog , and sites such as the Smoking Gun are just an email away - so it takes almost no effort to publish embarrassing information .
After that any newspaper journalist capable of typing the words Arnold Schwarzenegger into a search engine is just minutes away from a "" Shock over Arnie orgy boasts "" front - page splash .
Actually , Arnold was unlucky - it took someone with an old copy of Oui and the address of thesmokinggun.com to stitch him up .
But for the new generation of internet - era Arnies , shooting oneself in the foot will be much , much easier .
Thanks to archive sites such as The Wayback Machine ( archive.org ) , it does not matter whether you 're a professional web journalist , a full - time blogger , an amateur diarist or just a casual newsgroup poster - every word you spit out on to the web will remain accessible for years and years to come .
If any of today 's bloggers decide to stop banging on about their hilarious supermarket / college / dating experiences for five minutes and try their hand at politics or showbusiness , it wo n't take a muck - raking journalist more than 30 seconds to get access to every word they 've ever written .
And when you consider that the average blogger churns out slightly over 4bn words a day , it 's almost inevitable that there 'll be at least something embarrassing to find .
It 's starting to happen already ; just days after the Arnie revelations , the Smoking Gun notched up another scoop - this time involving two of the "" stars "" of the latest US series of the TV show Survivor .
It seems that two college students matching the descriptions ( and email addresses ) of contestants Christa Hastie and Ryan Shoulders spent the best part of 1998 and 1999 posting messages on drug - related newsgroups asking for advice on procuring and distributing all manner of artificial stimulants .
The unfortunate pair assumed that the messages were lost for ever - but that was before Google launched its Google Groups service - a searchable archive of newsgroup posts stretching back to the early 1980s .
Suddenly decades of dirty washing was re - exposed to public gaze and two would - be celebrities found themselves having to answer lots of very awkward questions about their extra - curricular activities .
So , what can online journalists and webloggers with ambitions of celebrity do to avoid suffering the same fate as Arnold , Christa and Ryan ?
Not much .
After all , none of us knows what our future holds - and the only way to ensure that nothing we write online can possibly come back to haunt us is not to write anything at all .
Hardly practical .
But personally , the next time I 'm tempted to mouth off in an online discussion forum or attempt to procure illegal drugs in a newsgroup , I 'll certainly be that little bit more cautious .
After all , for all my gloating at how the web managed to floor Mr Universe , I 'm acutely aware of one thing : there but for the grace of Google go I. · Paul Carr is editor of The Friday Thing ( thefridaything.co.uk ) .

"Ever since Arnold Schwarzenegger announced he was running to be TNGOTGSOC (
The Next Governor of the Great State of California ) , I have been fascinated by whether or not things were so bad there that people would elect Arnie to save them .
The announcement itself was something .
He went on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno and everyone , including the host , expected him to say he 'd withdraw from the race he had n't yet entered .
But Arnie said "" Ahrberanickfrguuvernar "" .
Everyone in the room threw themselves to the ground , because when Arnie says that in his movies it 's normally a precursor to a massacre .
But it turns out it was a declaration of intent , and at that moment I knew I would have to be in California to cover part of this race , though I did n't know its climax was about to be significantly delayed .
As I detailed last week , I successfully got my visa , despite a skirmish with a complete stranger on whom I declared a Death Wish .
But that 's not one of Arnie 's back catalogue , so let 's move on .
On Broadcasting House , we decided to try to give our listeners some insight into how the race was progressing .
Of the 250 or so people who said they would stand , only about 130 were able to fill in the application form .
We toyed with following some of the marginal candidates who had gained early currency : the former TV star , the porn star etc .
But instead we called up Brian Tracy .
He is the antithesis of Arnie .
And each week we call him .
He earnestly describes how he 's sending out tapes to opinion - formers detailing his platform .
Arnie makes speeches which repeat old lines from his movies ( he really does ) and gets cheers .
Brian goes on radio shows to talk about policies .
Arnie does n't really do interviews and when he does he repeats old lines from his movies .
Compare their websites .
Brian 's shows a white - haired man with a ton of policies and a pledge to be independent .
There 's a nice picture of some giant redwoods .
Arnie 's site shows one giant redwood ( Arnie ) and in the bit which compares him to his nearest rival , the opponent is trashed as a Career Politician while Arnie is - wait for it - a Public Servant .
The climax of our trailing of Mr Tracy was to have been a trip to CA the week before the election .
We would finally meet him in person , and use his final week of campaigning to act as a prism through which BH listeners could enjoy the hustings .
On Friday we called Brian to tell him the thrilling news that we 'd be coming to visit .
He intoned , impassively , that during the final week of campaigning to be TNGOTGSOC he would be in Dubai .

they decide to hold the election .

"There 's never a dull moment .
On the Carpinteria Bluffs last Sunday afternoon , Arnold Schwarzenegger , brought his Hummer , one of the largest and least fuel - efficient vehicles in the history of transport to the United States , in search of the green vote .
The reason for this sudden appeal to environmentalists was that he now plans to ask the car manufacturers of Detroit to transform his Hummer so that it can run on environmentally friendly hydrogen instead of petrol .
Why , he was asked , had he waited all this time until he was running for governor before he had this change of heart and realised how much pollution a Hummer caused ?
"" Good question , "" replied Schwarzenegger , who said that he had learned much in the few weeks since he had started running for governor .
His environmental advisers had turned him on to hydrogen and now he was going to get the manufacturers to help him .
"" I do n't take no for an answer , "" he said .
It must be encouraging for environmentalists that Schwarzenegger is now rethinking the Hummer , although there remains the question of the vehicle 's size , which makes it impossible to see past while driving , or park beside when stationary , thus causing accidents and making other motorists so mad that they go out and crash into other people .
But maybe this will be something that his advisers will draw to his attention , too .
There were a couple of hundred supporters along with a large contingent of the media on hand on this rather foggy afternoon , and there was a group of protesters carrying placards with messages like "" a Hummer is not green "" and "" Hasta la vista , Arnold . ""
One of the protesters , a woman with a loud - hailer , poured scorn over his claims as he started to speak .
When one of Schwarzenegger 's more active supporters , a smartly dressed young man , tried to wrestle the loud - hailer away from the protester , she firmly resisted and the police plunged into action .
Suddenly there was a scuffle on the Bluffs , and eventually the Schwarzenegger supporter was marched off wearing a puzzled expression that seemed to say to the police : "" Are n't you meant to grab the protesters , not the Republicans ? ""
A few days earlier , a debate had been organised at the LA film school on Sunset Boulevard between the four other leading candidates : the Democrat lieutenant governor , Cruz Bustamante ; the Republican state senator , Tom McClintock ; the Green party 's Peter Camejo and the independent , Arianna Huffington .
This , too , was a lively affair with supporters of all the candidates in the auditorium , albeit better behaved than the young man on the Bluffs .
There was much serious debate on the economy , education and the like , but what stuck in the mind was the rapid - fire session in which all the candidates were asked the following questions : Did they own a gun ?
What was their favourite film ?
What had been their most influential book ( apart from the Bible ) ?
And where did they take their last holiday ?
McClintock had a gun "" to protect his family from predators , "" Bustamante had a hunting rifle but could n't remember when he last went hunting and the other two were armless , as it were .
Huffington 's most influential book was Plato 's Republic and she was clearly the only woman in the room to have read it in the original Greek , while her favourite film was Legally Blonde 2 .
McClintock 's favourite film was Seabiscuit .
Only Huffington , a good European could remember her last vacation - Americans think holidays are for sissies - in Ireland .
Camejo and Bustamante eventually recalled going to Hawaii although I do n't think together .
Schwarzenegger 's advisers had steered him away altogether from an event at which candidates did not have prior knowledge of the questions .
This week , though , all five leading candidates come together in Sacramento to debate questions they will be given in advance .
The other candidates always accuse Schwarzenegger of having his lines scripted for him , and if that 's the case , I wonder if one of his writers will get him to repeat that old line of David Frost 's , circa 1962 :
"" Thank you for your support , I will always wear it . ""
It somehow seems just right ."
"No candidate came out a clear winner in a Californian recall election debate in Sacramento notable for a heated exchange between Arnold Schwarzenegger and the independent candidate Arianna Huffington .
Sparks flew when Schwarzenegger kept interrupting her .
She said : "" This is the way you treat women , we know that "" - a reference to magazine allegations .
He responded : "" I just realised that I have a perfect part for you in Terminator 4 . ""
She claimed he was referring to a scene in Terminator 3 where a female robot has her head thrust into a toilet bowl .
The LA Times , which opposes the recall of the governor , Gray Davis , said the debate "" fell somewhere between a World Wrestling Federation event and a pie fight .
"" It was the only one Schwarzenegger had joined in , and the only one in which candidates had been given the questions in advance ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger 's campaign to become governor of California made more waves yesterday following a spat with a rival during a televised debate .
The muscle - bound film star distinguished what will be his only debating appearance by bickering with Arianna Huffington , the Greek - born socialite and broadcaster who is running as an independent .
As the five - person battle got underway the pair did n't waste time locking horns over such issues as driving licences for illegal immigrants and after - school programmes .
Then the tone became personal .
An interruption from Mr Schwarzenegger prompted Ms Huffington to snap , "" This is the way you treat women , we know that . ""
Her comment referred to recent reports that the actor is disrespectful of women .
"" I just realised I have the perfect part for you in Terminator 4 , "" Mr Schwarzenegger replied , before the moderator reminded both participants that they were not on Comedy Central .
The actor has snubbed the recall election 's two previous debates and endured a battering from his fellow contenders , who claimed he lacked political experience and had a slender grasp of the issues .
Mr Schwarzenegger wo n't be too worried just yet .
He is roughly neck - and - neck in the lead with Democrat Cruz Bustamante in the race to replace the incumbent Gray Davis if he fails a recall vote on October 7 ."
"If the producers ( aka the US Supreme Court ) will permit , Arnold Schwarzenegger would really like to shoot his latest movie up and down California , with a cast of thousands .
Working title : Arnie 's Big Adventure .
Subtitle :
The Man Who Would Be Governor .
The plot ?
Putting an action - movie star in charge of solving a fiscal crisis in the world 's fifth - largest economy .
There 's only one problem .
Some of the studio 's executives , committed Democrats , are determined to halt production , and send the star into ' turnaround ' .
As a result , no one 's quite sure if it 's going to be a political thriller or a screwball comedy , or a bit of both .
And absolutely no one knows how it will play on the previously scheduled opening night : election day , 7 October .
At the time of writing , indeed , no one has any idea if the show will open at all .
This is a shame , because , until the lawyers got involved , Arnie 's Big Adventure was shaping up to be first - class entertainment for most of the family .
On Labor Day at the Sacramento State Fair , a crowd of gawkers and thrill - seekers has joined the world 's press in a huddle beneath the fairground 's Sky Coaster .
It 's swelteringly hot .
Campaign rock is thumping in the background .
The smell of pizza and the warm cardboard aroma of popcorn drift across from a bank of fast - food trailers .
Overhead , the daredevils on the Sky Coaster swoop and dive like action - movie extras .
The Terminator himself , narrowly the frontrunner in an unprecedented gubernatorial race which has brought a simmering Republican - Democrat conflict to the boil once more , is punching out his message to the cameras : ' Ve haf to stob dis government from overzpending , overdaxing und over - regu - lading ... '
It 's Arnie 's unique medium as much as his message that has inspired the late - night comedians to propose ' Four More Vowels ' as his campaign slogan .
In California , stars are royalty and most of the crowd that 's crammed against the crash barriers have been compelled by Schwarzenegger 's star power as much as his ill - defined Republican politics . '
Why am I here ? ' yells Dana Steinberg , a middle - aged sales clerk from nearby Vacaville , above the cacophony . '
Because it 's Arnold . '
She breaks off to scream , ' Ahhnold !
Go , Arnold ! '
as the star 's head bobs past among a phalanx of minders .
' I 've seen all his movies , ' she shouts , returning to the big issue . '
Doncha love Twins ? '
Will she vote for him ? '
Aw , I guess so .
But I 'm not registered , honey .
In our family , it 's my husband Bill who does the voting .
Ahhnold !
Ahhnold ! '
Whatever Schwarzenegger 's regal advantages , this is America : there 's no divine right to govern .
So the Terminator must go on the stump like any candidate , even if his campaign will be unlike any campaign California has ever seen before .
Part location - shoot , part publicity - tour , part revivalist rally , the hustings are sweaty , rough and unscripted .
To a celebrity used to the hushed concentration of the sound stage and the nodding deference of studio executives , the campaign trail is an unfamiliar place of fear and loathing , fraught with peril .
Perhaps this is why , today , the star of Terminator 3 and would - be California governor seems so mechanical .
It 's not just his voice , the awful , robotic collision of Austro - German and American English , or the perfectly trimmed and tinted orange - chestnut coiffure , or the chiselled angles of his jutting features , or the candidate 's mesmerising stare .
More than all this , there is something wooden about Arnie , wooden skin , wooden gestures , wooden ideas and clunky wooden phrases .
Plainly , the ' Join Arnold ' campaign has yet to get into its stride and connect with the voters .
At the moment , the fans are wearing the bemused expressions of people saying to themselves , ' Can this really be the star of Twins , Conan the Barbarian and True Lies ? '
And then there 's the larger question with which the hacks are just beginning to get to grips : is this chaotic roadshow the beginning of the latest phase in the re - modelling of Arnold Schwarzenegger , the son of an obscure ex - Nazi official from Graz ?
It 's been a long journey .
As long ago as 1977 , the candidate was simply a champion bodybuilder , the self - styled ' Austrian Oak ' , a Mr Universe who first found himself at home in front of the cameras starring in the documentary Pumping Iron , then developed a taste for country music and began to grasp the potential of the American Dream , acquiring an eclectic set of broadly Republican values , leavened with a pinch or two of old - fashioned Hollywood liberalism .
By 1981 he had discovered the role that suited both his muscles and his accent in Conan the Barbarian , a script co - written by Oliver Stone , based on the swords - and - sorcery yarns of Robert Howard .
A surprise hit , the film put the Austrian Oak alongside names such as James Earl Jones and Max von Sydow .
Schwarzenegger then consolidated his role as an action hero in The Terminator , James Cameron 's cult 1984 movie about an emotionless killer robot .
This was followed by Commando , Predator , The Running Man and Terminator 2 , which placed him among Hollywood 's elite .
Having become an improbably huge star , Schwarzenegger now set about developing some modest credibility as an actor , taking roles in films such as Twins and Kindergarten Cop , movies that brought him new fans among soccer moms and teenagers , and broadened his appeal .
At the same time , after years of knocking about the sleazy world of Hollywood starlets and acquiring a reputation as a womaniser and chauvinist , allegedly nicknamed ' The Octopus ' , he took on a new role as a family man , marrying the niece of John F Kennedy , Maria Shriver , and becoming part of another kind of American royalty .
Schwarzenegger , 56 , has put the promiscuity and pumping iron behind him , and now summarises his early years with , ' In the beginning I was selfish .
It was all about : "" How do I build Arnold ?
How can I get into movies ? ""
As I grew up , got older , maybe wiser , I think your life is judged not by how much you have taken , but by how much you give back . '
He remains a liberal Republican , with distinctly green environmental policies , and despite the connection with the Kennedys , has always been used by the GOP ( Grand Old Party ) as a poster boy for some of its less neanderthal initiatives .
In 1990 , President George Bush named Schwarzenegger chairman of the President 's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports .
Schwarzenegger found himself drawn into grassroots Republican party activism , although his social policies hardly fit the profile of strict Republicanism : in 2002 , for example , he successfully sponsored a state bill to provide afterschool care for children .
Unconventional and hard to classify , he has nonetheless managed to mobilise on his behalf a formidable Republican brains trust - former California governor Pete Wilson , economist Milton Friedman , former secretary of state George Schultz , and billionaire Warren Buffett .
In this , observers say , Schwarzenegger is following a technique perfected in his movies , which is to surround himself with the best technicians he can find , master his lines and deliver a performance carefully tailored to appeal to his audience .
Indeed , a close study of his films reveals that his roles , though always decisive , with great lines like ' Hasta la vista , baby , ' are often modest in terms of screen time and screen presence .
In the modesty of his talent - and only in this sense - you could argue that he resembles that other Republican movie star who wanted to be governor : Ronald Reagan .
But the political movie Arnie is shooting this month is not a remake of Ronnie 's classic three - reeler .
Though roughly the same age at the moment they decided to enter the fray , Reagan and Schwarzenegger are utterly different .
When Reagan , who would eventually serve two terms , first ran for governor in 1966 , he was 54 and his campaign was the climax to more than a decade of dogged political activity .
In California , he was the state 's best - known Republican .
He did not spontaneously announce his campaign ( as Schwarzenegger did ) on a late - night TV show , but was badgered into it by friends .
As controversial as corned - beef hash , he was a popular candidate from the first , with a high profile as a clean - cut Republican who could deliver a scripted speech with an easy charm that said , ' These may not be my lines , but I believe every word that 's in front of me . '
Reagan was popular , he was polished , and his Republican principles could be expressed , without difficulty or contradiction , on the back of an envelope .
The transition from the greasepaint of the star 's trailer to the greasy pole of elected office was the logical culmination to a lifetime of activism .
And another thing : Reagan threw his hat into the ring as part of the political cycle , challenging Pat Brown , the popular incumbent , as part of the regular democratic process .
Schwarzenegger , by contrast , finds himself putting together a campaign team on the hoof , from a standing start , and as a result of a political earthquake : the California Recall , a nasty , visceral campaign directed against a man , Governor Gray Davis , whose popularity hovers near the Richard Nixon mark on the psephological Richter scale .
The movement to recall ( ie sack )
Gray Davis has now become bogged down in vicious Republican and Democrat legal infighting about "" hanging chads "" and those election punch - card machines made famous by Florida in 2000 , but Californian voters on both sides can unite in their loathing of a Democratic - machine politician with a meaningless smile and the charisma of a cockroach .
The campaign to replace the governor has been described by the media as historic and unprecedented , but in many ways it is just the latest in a succession of electoral revolts typical of California and its people .
As the Terminator rehearses for his assault on the Sacramento Capitol , it 's worth remembering that the state 's origins lie in a madcap assertion of independence and a wilful quest for overnight solutions : the California Gold Rush .
Since 1849 , the state , which takes its name from a Spanish word meaning ' earthly paradise ' , has settled down to enjoy an enviable lifestyle , fuelled by enviable riches , but from time to time its citizens rediscover their ancestors ' antic gene and explode in revolt , collecting signatures in what sober political commentators call ' a voter initiative ' , but which the outside world sees as the maddest and merriest democratic carnival .
Ever since the tumultuous passing of Proposition 13 ( a property tax - cutting measure ) in 1978 , the last seismic shudder to rattle the windows here , Californian voters have filed literally scores of initiatives , many of which garnered enough signatures to find a place on the ballot .
The recall vote , then , is typical in its contrarian spontaneity , typical in its wackiness and above all typical in its eccentric internal contradictions .
If the vote goes ahead on 7 October , for example , registered voters will be asked two questions on the same ballot : first , should Governor Davis be recalled and , second , who should take his place ?
If the recall vote is not carried , the second question becomes redundant , which is why the Democratic Party establishment , led by Bill Clinton , is campaigning hard on ' No to the Recall ' .
Bizarrely , since the beleaguered governor needs a simple 51 per cent majority to stay in office , it is entirely possible that , having scored ( say ) 45 per cent of the vote , he could be replaced by a candidate who has polled perhaps less than 20 per cent of the vote .
If the operation and the outcome of the recall vote is calculated to drive professional pollsters mad with the mysteries of popular democracy , its origins are equally mysterious .
The story probably starts during the 2000 presidential election .
In the electoral college , California counts for a juicy 54 votes , and George Bush campaigned hard here , convinced he could overwhelm Al Gore in a blizzard of brutal TV ads .
In the event , it was Gore 's crushing victory over the Republicans that made the subsequent post - election battle for Florida so bitter .
At state and national level , there were plenty of Republicans who , in the triumphalist mood that characterises the Bush presidency , would like to make California Republican again .
And it so happened that there was plenty of anti - Democrat hostility to exploit .
Gore 's local victory was followed in 2002 by the re - election , in a regular gubernatorial campaign , of incumbent Democrat governor Gray Davis , a colourless technician in a suit who fought a dirty campaign and , fatally , concealed from the voters the economic crisis facing the state in the aftermath of Enron , Worldcom and the bursting of the dotcom bubble , which saw 200,000 jobs lost in Silicon Valley alone .
A mirror to the American economy as a whole , California was deeply in deficit .
Within weeks of re - election , Davis was forced to start closing down education programmes , laying off staff and slashing the state budget for health , education , law enforcement and transport .
Some say that the recall election began as a Republican plot to unseat Governor Davis , to ' steal the state ' ; others that maverick legislators , goaded by incensed constituents , launched yet another ' voter initiative ' .
Whoever you believe , one thing is certain : both the Democratic and the Republican political establishments were at first lukewarm about the recall initiative until Darrell Issa , a little - known Republican congressman from San Diego , devoted several million dollars of his personal fortune to mobilise the necessary army of petition - gatherers to scare up the signatures needed to get the recall measure on the ballot .
It would be wrong to get too indignant or cynical about the process .
At first , Issa was simply riding a wave of popular protest , typical of America 's wider disaffection with the electoral process .
The voters of California were mad as hell with Davis and the Democrats and the sign that they were n't going to take it any more was the simple fact that the recall petition was oversubscribed by several hundred thousand .
Shortly after the recall initiative got on to the ballot , a remarkable cross section of Californians decided that - hell !
- they could do a better job than Gray Davis .
In fact , 135 of them - ranging from Arnold Schwarzenegger to Larry Flynt , the founder of Hustler , who would run on the slogan ' A smut peddler who cares ' - quickly announced their candidature .
One later dropped out after police revealed he was the leading suspect in a murder case .
Among those who would soon be fighting for top billing in media coverage of the recall election were Peter V Ueberroth , the troubleshooting businessman and former sports tsar whose lacklustre campaign quickly faltered ; state senator Tom McClintock , a rightwing Republican with a solid conservative base ;
Gray Davis 's deputy Cruz Bustamante ; the green party candidate Peter Camejo , and Arianna Huffington née Stassinopoulos , best known in Britain as the author of a biography of Greek diva Maria Callas .
Ms Huffington , ' the most upwardly mobile Greek since Icarus ' and ' the face that lunched a thousand shits ' , is now the celebrated ex - wife of the Texas oil billionaire Michael Huffington - a confused playboy who blew a cool $ 28 m not getting elected to the senate in 1994 , subsequently divorced his wife and then announced he was gay to widespread hilarity .
Before the recall election was slated , Ms Huffington had publicly renounced her Republican views , and began promoting a baffling menu of lost causes .
Huffington claimed to be running on behalf of the mothers of California .
Scarcely had she formulated her platform than both her children fled the nest in protest against her candidacy .
Her presence on the ballot has been widely interpreted as a ploy to promote her profile as a broadcaster and columnist .
Huffington 's witty , maverick campaign soon attracted the bemused but fascinated attention of the media , though she was too exotic , even for Californians , to attract more than three or four per cent of the vote .
The revelation that Ms Huffington had paid only $ 771 in IRS taxes in the previous two years and that she had written off nearly $ 10 K to hair and make - up , did not exactly recommend her to the hard - pressed electorate .
In Arnie 's Big Adventure , these players were essentially walk - on parts , minor stars .
Schwarzenegger 's only serious rival was Governor Davis 's deputy , Cruz Bustamante .
Described by Jay Leno as ' sounding like a push - up bra for Spanish women ' , Bustamante is essentially Governor Davis Mark Two .
Confusingly , Bustamante is a Democrat candidate who must both oppose the recall of governor Davis and somehow simultaneously suggest that , in the highly regrettable circumstances his boss should lose his job , he , Cruz Bustamante , would be the ideal replacement .
This is not as improbable as it sounds .
In a state where more than 30 per cent of the population is Hispanic , Bustamante has one priceless asset : he comes from a working - class Hispanic family from Fresno and is the first Latino politician to reach the dizzy heights of lieutenant governor .
More than that , Bustamante has , controversially , made himself the champion of the Californian Native American community .
A smart move in the snakes - and - ladders of California 's ethnic politics , this proved a fundraising masterstroke .
Ever since the Native American community was licensed to operate casinos on its reservations , the gaming lobby has become an increasingly powerful player in state politics .
Bustamante 's campaign has already received more than $ 2 m from the gaming connections and in the looming TV ' air war ' with Schwarzenegger that will unquestionably be the climax to the recall election , this money could prove indispensable .
Not for the first time in the history of the West will a lean - jawed cowboy find his position threatened by well - organised Red Indian tribes .
So that was the line - up .
Among the late - night comedians such as Jay Leno , Conan O'Brien , David Letterman and Bill Maher there was a feeding frenzy .
The Golden State had just delivered a motherlode of gags ...
Jay Leno : ' It 's been reported that some of Arnold Schwarzenegger 's opponents have been circulating naked pictures of Arnold on the internet .
In a related story , Arnold is leading other candidates by 4 in . '
Bill Maher : ' Bush is supporting Arnold , but a lot of Republicans are not , because he is actually quite liberal .
Karl Rove [ Bush 's strategist ] said if his father was n't a Nazi , he would n't have any credibility with conservatives at all . '
David Letterman : ' President Bush has been silent on Schwarzenegger .
Of course , he ca n't pronounce Schwarzenegger . '
Conan O'Brien : ' Apparently Arnold was inspired by President Bush , who proved you can be a successful politician in this country even if English is your second language . '
The comedians also fastened on to Mary Carey , the bazooka - breasted ex - porn star ( ' I will show you how much fun I would be as governor - by jumping up and down ' ) who supports the legalising of ferrets and whose solution to the state deficit included a tax on breast implants ; the former child actor Gary Coleman of TV sitcom Diff'rent Strokes ; Bryan Quinn , a college student who says that running for office is ' a great way to get girls ' ; artist Trek Thunder Kelly , dressed exclusively in blue , who is campaigning as ' an elaborate performance - art piece ' ; David ' Uncle ' Sams , an independent producer who habitually campaigns in a ' Stars and Stripes ' Halloween party costume , and Ronald Palmieri , a gay celebrity lawyer who meets the voters from the back of a stretch limousine and who has challenged Schwarzenegger to ' come out of the closet ' and debate the issues of gay rights on local television .
Palmieri has added to the surreal quality of the recall election by campaigning on the slogan : ' No to the Recall .
Do n't Vote for Me . '
Among the more sober parts of America , especially the East Coast , which takes its democracy seriously , this wacky gabfest is an embarrassment with troubling implications .
Among American voters generally , the ballot box is not a toy , but a sacred instrument that should certainly not be used to register what conservative commentator George Will has dubbed ' buyer 's remorse ' .
Several other commentators echoed this thought with the sentiment that Californians seemed to be proposing a kind of Far West Maoism : a permanent democratic revolution in which no elected official would ever have a secure mandate to govern and would never be safe from the threat of retrospective censure by the voters .
If you applied Californian democracy to the US as a whole , observers noted , you would easily get 12 per cent of the people who voted in the last election to sign a petition to recall the president .
Now Thomas Jefferson , it is true , once wrote that it was a good idea to have a revolution every three years ' to water the tree of liberty ' , but what , some wondered , would the Founding Fathers make of California 's antics ?"
"Arnold Schwarzenegger has streaked ahead of his rivals in the campaign to become governor of California , according to the latest opinion polls .
They show that the actor and bodybuilder is running well ahead of the field in advance of next Tuesday 's recall vote .
In the final week of the campaign , the main players were crisscrossing the state and spending millions on television and radio advertisements to influence waverers .
The impetus seems to be with Mr Schwarzenegger , who is seen by the Republicans as the man to help them re - establish the party in a state that has been predominantly Democratic in recent years .
The latest CNN / USA Today poll suggests that 63 % of the electorate will vote to recall the Democrat governor , Gray Davis , with only 35 % opposing the recall .
The same poll suggests that Mr Schwarzenegger is the choice of 40 % to replace Mr Davis , with the Democrat lieutenant governor , Cruz Bustamante , on 25 % , and the conservative Republican Tom McClintock on 18 % .
The other two main contestants , the Green party 's Peter Camejo and the columnist Arianna Huffington , were stuck in the low single figures .
A spokesman for Mr Davis described the poll as "" a joke "" yesterday , citing other polls that have showed Mr Davis 's support increasing to 47 % .
In previous polls , Mr Bustamante had been just ahead of Mr Schwarzenegger .
While the Republican hierarchy has been pressing Mr McClintock , a state senator , to leave the race so that the field would be open for the actor , Mr McClintock yesterday reiterated his determination not to quit , although his campaign team is conceding that he may have to settle for second place .
Mr McClintock is the only one of the main candidates who has promised not to raise taxes and has a conservative position on abortion , guns , immigration and gay rights .
One of the reasons for the wildly fluctuating polls is that there has never been a recall election for governor in the state .
Voters are normally faced with a simple choice between two official candidates from the two main parties , rather than a field of 135 as in the current election .
What is unclear is whether Mr McClintock 's supporters will shift their votes to Mr Schwarzenegger as polling day approaches or whether Democrats will cross party lines to vote for the actor .
However , 900,000 have already cast absentee ballots .
The Green party candidate , Peter Camejo , who has performed well in the televised debates , was acknowledging yesterday that some of his supporters might shift their votes to Mr Bustamante to thwart Mr Schwarzenegger .
Meanwhile , Ms Huffington was in San Francisco promoting her environmental agenda . ""
This is now hand - to - hand combat , "" said Mr Schwarzenegger at a campaign appearance in Redding , in the north of the state .
"" We are not in the trenches .
This is war . ""
His strategy , devised by former aides to the last Republican governor of the state , Pete Wilson , has been to reach the voters through TV commercials and on chat shows rather than in direct confrontation with his competitors .
So far , the strategy , backed by the biggest budget of any candidate , appears to be paying off .
Mr Davis received some consolation in winning the endorsement of some of the state 's most powerful newspapers .
The Los Angeles Times , the San Jose Mercury News , the Sacramento Bee and the Oakland Tribune all urged a "" no "" vote on the recall , albeit with little enthusiasm for the governor himself ."
"Television has been playing a vital part in the Californian gubernatorial recall election .
Every time you turn on a network channel , there is a commercial showing either Arnold Schwarzenegger promising leadership values or Cruz Bustamante ( and family ) promising to look after students or Tom McClintock promising not to raise taxes or Gray Davis promising that he has really been doing his best .
Last Wednesday , we had the televised debate between the five leading candidates in Sacramento , which could have been interesting but was poorly handled by a moderator who was so out of his depth and apparently anxious to please Arnold Schwarzenegger that he even addressed him as "" Governor Schwarzenegger "" on one occasion .
Then there have been the rolling news reports of the campaign , a welcome intrusion on the standard local news fare of crime , premieres and weather .
So it seemed like an opportune time to hear about the medium at an open air talk in Santa Monica given by Nancy Snow , who teaches communications at California State University , Fullerton and the Annenberg School for Communication .
Snow 's thesis was that television has become a drug , much like alcohol , on which society has become dependant .
If my notes , scrawled on my knee in the backyard of the Warszawa restaurant where this event took place , are correct , the average American 18-year - old has spent longer in front of the television than in school , and television is on in the average home
- not necessarily being watched - for between seven and eight hours a day .
( I mention all these figures as a non - recovering addict . )
One figure Snow mentioned was that crime , either in news reports or in dramas , features 10 times more frequently on television than in real life .
There are sound commercial reasons for this because , as Snow put it , "" violence needs little translation "" .
But the constant repetition of violence on screen helps to create what she called the "" mean world "" syndrome in which every stranger is viewed as a potential predator and every crime must have a punishment .
Which brings us back to the election race .
At the debate between candidates in LA the week before last , the Republican state senator , Tom McClintock , said that he owned a gun "" to protect his family from predators "" .
When I asked him afterwards about California 's "" three strikes "" law , which currently jails hundreds of non - violent offenders , mainly people with drug problems , for periods of 25 years , he said that the three strikes law only affected violent criminals .
I asked Cruz Bustamante the same question , referring to the case of Leandro Andrade , who had been jailed for 50 years for shoplifting videos .
Bustamante , the lieutenant governor , said that he believed the law was indeed intended for use against violent offenders .
So why did the state 's attorney general appeal to the supreme court after the ninth circuit court had ruled that 50 years was cruel and unusual punishment ? ""
Ask the attorney general , "" was his reply .
Peter Camejo , the Green party candidate , has referred to the criminal justice system in the state as a campaign issue but otherwise it has been largely lacking .
In the 90 minutes of debate at Sacramento the topic was not even raised .
Yet since 1984 , the state has built 21 prisons but only one college , and since 1980 the prison population has grown from 23,000 to 160,000 and each of those "" three strikers "" in jail costs $ 27,000 ( £ 16,000 ) a year in taxes to lock away .
Few politicians want to address the issue and thus run the risk of being called soft on crime and so the spiral continues .
Perhaps as the campaign enters its last week , one of the main candidates will address this .
But perhaps not ."
"The Greek - born columnist and writer Arianna Huffington has withdrawn from the California gubernatorial race and urged her supporters to vote against the recall of the Democratic governor Gray Davis to prevent the actor Arnold Schwarzenegger winning for the Republicans .
A new Los Angeles Times poll confirms that the vote is likely to go against Mr Davis , with 56 % favouring his recall , and Mr Schwarzenegger is the favourite to replace him , with 42 % of the vote .
Cruz Bustamante , the lieutenant governor , is second favourite with 32 % .
Ms Huffington has been stuck on about 3 % , equalling the Green party 's Peter Camejo , whose team yesterday said he would remain in the race but accepted that some of his supporters might want to vote for the "" least - worst "" Mr Bustamante to keep a Republican out .
Ms Huffington , a former conservative Republican who shifted left in the 90s and has established herself as an iconoclastic syndicated columnist , has not endorsed another candidate ."
"In one respect , at least , the culture and politics of the United States have achieved a perfect yin - yang balance .
At a time when Arnold Schwarzenegger is trying to break into west - coast politics , politicians on the other side of the country are climbing over each other for bit parts in a new TV drama .
Stranger still , this is not your average , predictable , feelgood , prime - time show .
It is a peculiar , unscripted experiment in which well - known senators and even a presidential candidate improvise unpredictable scenes with paid actors in front of wobbly handheld cameras .
The show 's makers , HBO , claim that K Street portrays politics "" from the inside out "" .
It follows a semi - fictional firm of DC lobbyists ( a sub - species that dominates K Street , a concrete - and - glass boulevard dissecting the city centre ) .
You see deals being done and politicians being primed and prepped before going into battle . ""
The word we keep using is ' process ' , "" says one of the show 's producers , Henry Bean , who directed the 2001 film , The Believer .
"" The show is really about showing the process .
How the deals are done , how provisions are put into bills . ""
So why should politicians with enough savvy to get themselves elected in the first place make themselves such hostages to fortune ?
The answer comes in two words now sending a thrill through the nation 's capital : George Clooney .
Hollywood 's hottest star is not only co - producing the show alongside his favourite director , Steven Soderbergh , he is wandering the streets of Washington and wielding a camera himself , in pursuit of inner political truths .
"" Everybody in town is buzzing about it , "" says Howard Kurtz , the Washington Post 's media correspondent who was recruited for a brief K Street cameo performance last week .
"" But also wondering whether anyone in the other 50 states could care less . ""
That is the dilemma now facing Clooney , Soderbergh and HBO as K Street enters its third week .
The Hollywood - Washington love affair is a tale of mutual fascination , dating back to the days of JFK .
The only people who really impress successful movie stars are powerful politicians , and politicians with the fate of nations in their hands still covet the near - hysterical worship that only show business celebrity can inspire .
"" People love these guys around town , "" says Ronald Brownstein , chief political correspondent of the Los Angeles Times , and the author of The Power and the Glitter : The Hollywood - Washington Connection .
"" People love the fact that what they are doing is glamorous and sexy enough that George Clooney should be there in a $ 2,000 suit filming it . ""
"" I think he does open a lot of doors , "" says producer Henry Bean .
"" But George is also extremely knowledgeable and sharp .
He wears his fame very lightly .
Every Monday morning we sit in a room and we generally have a few ideas and we pick one to be the topic of that week 's show .
There are maybe a dozen people there , and George is one of them . ""
K Street 's launch party at the Palm Restaurant was packed with Washington power - brokers .
And the list of participants is fast becoming a Who 's
Who of national politics .
Hillary Clinton appeared in the pilot episode .
Howard Dean , the Democratic presidential contender from Vermont , was in the first screened episode , being briefed before a debate .
Even K Street 's stars are real people , or at least they used to be real people .
They are Michael Deaver , a former Reagan aide and Washington 's extremely odd couple , James Carville and Mary Matalin .
Carville is the cantankerous "" Rajin ' Cajun "" from Louisiana who orchestrated Bill Clinton 's electoral triumphs .
His wife , Matalin , is a rightwing Republican who was , until recently , Dick Cheney 's press advisor .
Now they both play loose approximations of themselves , running the consulting firm at the heart of K Street 's action .
Swapping lines with the professional actors who play their employees , Carville and Matalin even give a good impression of their testy marriage .
After an onscreen row , Matalin tells someone looking for her husband : "" James Carville is not here , And he may never be here again . ""
"" That is exactly how they really talk about each other .
I 've heard them , "" marvelled an acquaintance .
This is what Clooney and Soderbergh - who directed Sex , Lies and Videotape , Erin Brockovich , and Traffic - are aiming for : fiction improvised by real people so that it edges into the realm of docudrama until the viewer starts to question what is fact and what is fiction .
After the Monday morning meeting to discuss the theme of the week , the writers put together a loose structure and some dialogue for the actors , and the next two - and - a - half days are spent shooting mostly improvised scenes .
The results are edited almost up until the last minute before the Sunday night screening .
Kurtz was called up at short notice to play himself , as the doyen of Washington 's media journalists , in a testy Starbucks encounter with a lobbyist trying to place a story about music piracy favourable to the industry .
"" It was a gas , "" he admits .
"" The show is much more seat of the pants than I expected .
I got a call the day before saying would I like to play a scene .
Steve Soderbergh told me he likes to do everything in one take .
So I got one shot at this .
They said I could have played it any way I wanted .
I could say yes to the pitch or no , or tell him to get lost . ""
On this occasion , Kurtz tells the lobbyist , played by a professional actor - also improvising - to get lost , and walks out , dignity intact , with the classic Washington sod - off line : "" It 's great to run into you - let 's do it again
real soon .
"" Not everyone in Washington has been prepared to play along .
Congress got Clooney and the K Street crew locked out of the Capitol , on the grounds that they were pursuing a commercial venture .
However , the stream of willing politicians has continued to flow .
Two well - known senators , Charles Schumer and Chuck Hagel , appear in this week 's episode .
It is without doubt Washington 's favourite parlour game this autumn .
The question mark remains , however , over whether it is of much interest to the rest of the country .
The first of the 10 episodes in the series were savaged by the critics .
The review in the middlebrow national paper , USA Today , was fairly typical .
"" Not quite fact , not quite fiction , and not at all entertaining , "" it sneered , describing K Street as "" a pointlessly rambling inside look at Washington 's spindocracy - a self - contained , self - satisfied group of political hangers - on who are fascinating to each other and of no interest to anyone else . ""
The improvised scenes are indeed often jerky , disjointed and hard to follow .
These problems are easy to overlook in fly - on - the - wall documentaries , but they are harder to ignore when you know the action is being guided by unseen hands .
Bean concedes that K Street is still trying to feel its way to a new genre as it goes along , and that the producers are now struggling to redress the balance between realism and plot .
But even if it can be turned into compelling drama , what will it do for US politics ?
Not much , Ron Brownstein fears .
The LA Times journalist believes it will serve only to deepen the national cynicism about politics .
"" It 's not a great idea for politicians when people do n't believe a word they say to start blurring the lines between politics and Hollywood .
You 're asking for trouble , "" he says .
There have been other attempts to mingle political fact and fiction , such as Tanner ' 88 , co - produced by the cartoonist , Garry Trudeau , which followed the campaign of an imaginary candidate against the backdrop of the actual 1988 presidential contest .
But Brownstein argues that K Street has gone much further to blur the lines , and he points to an extraordinary incident in the first episode , in which Howard Dean , the former Vermont governor , is fed a jokey line about politics and race by one of the K Street "" consultants "" , which he then used in a real debate in the Democratic primary contest , scoring points with the audience .
"" It was incredible .
It was like The Matrix , when the agent comes out of the matrix into the real world , "" says Brownstein .
"" I do n't want to overestimate the risk to democracy , but we have to be careful not to give the impression that politics is this cool political game where everybody knows everybody , and they 're all in it together . ""
Bean acknowledges the problem , and insists that K Street is working on it .
"" I actually think Ron 's put his finger on something that is a real danger for the show .
One of the things that are wrong with American politics is that so many people are doing it for money , "" he says .
"" We have to show that people are into it for other things .
There are very idealistic and ideological people , and it is extremely important that we convey the depths of passion there .
That is something we are in danger of missing . ""
The sincerity behind this star - studded effort to lift the lid off the political machine is obvious , sometimes painfully so , from the quirks and wobbles of the first few episodes .
But the producers , under intense suspicion from the Bush administration for being west - coast liberals , have been careful to remain controversial rather than explosive .
There has been nothing so far hinting at the corporate interests at play behind the scenes in the "" war on terror "" , for example .
But there are seven more shows to come .
The problem facing Bean , Clooney and Soderbergh , is that by the time they get this risky formula right , there may no longer be anyone outside Washington still watching ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger admitted yesterday he had "" behaved badly "" as he tried to shake off damaging allegations on the eve of California 's race for governor that he used his celebrity to humiliate women sexually .
Claims that he was a groper who had sexually humiliated women for three decades were made as the actor set off on a four - day tour aimed an ensuring his victory at the polls on October 7 .
After denials by his campaign , the actor acknowledged that he had sometimes "" behaved badly "" on film sets .
"" It is true that I was on rowdy movie sets and I have done things that were not right which I thought then was playful , "" he said .
"" But now I recognise that I offended people .
Those people that I have offended , I want to say to them I am deeply sorry about that
and I apologise because that 's not what I 'm trying to do .
""
The actor said "" a lot of the stuff in the story is not true ... but I have to say that where there 's smoke there 's fire "" .
To cheers from a crowd of around 1,500 supporters , he promised to be "" champion of women "" if elected .
Six women who had met Mr Schwarzenegger on film sets , in studio offices and elsewhere since the 1970s and most recently in 2000 have made the allegations .
Two agreed to be named in the report , which was published yesterday by the Los Angeles Times .
One of them was the British television presenter , Anna Richardson .
Three women described their dismay when Mr Schwarzenegger allegedly grabbed their breasts .
A fourth claimed he had reached under her skirt and gripped her buttocks .
Another has alleged he tried to take her swimsuit off in a hotel elevator and a sixth woman said the actor had grabbed her , pulled her on to his lap and asked her "" whether a certain sexual act had ever been performed on her "" .
Three of the women who work in the film business told the LA Times that they could not be named because it would affect their careers . ""
What could you do ?
"" one woman is quoted as saying .
"" He was the highest - paid actor in the world .
I was a peon .
"" None of the women has ever brought civil actions against the actor .
One of the alleged incidents occurred in the 70s , two in the 80s , two in the 90s and one in 2000 .
Mr Schwarzenegger has dismissed previous allegations about his treatment of women by saying the incidents took place a long time ago , before he was married - and "" a lot of crazy things happened in the 70s "" .
Rumours about the investigation in the LA Times have been circulating for two weeks .
The paper , which is opposed to the recall of Democratic governor , Gray Davis , said none of the allegations had been drawn to its attention by Mr Schwarzenegger 's rivals .
Friends of the women who made the claims said the women had confided in them about the actor long before his run for governor . ""
Did he rape me ?
No , "" said one woman , who claimed that the actor had touched her breast in 1980 .
"" Did he humiliate me ?
You bet he did . ""
"" We believe Democrats and others are using this to try to hurt Arnold Schwarzenegger 's campaign , "" said Sean Walsh , the actor 's spokesman .
"" We believe that this is coming so close before the election , something that discourages good , hard - working , decent people from running for office . ""
One of the women said that in 1975 while her husband , a professional bodybuilder , was working out at a gym in California , Mr Schwarzenegger had walked up behind her , reached under her T - shirt and touched her bare breast .
In an incident in 1980 , a former professional beach volleyball player said the actor had "" grabbed and squeezed "" her breast after she turned down requests to come to his apartment .
"" If I was a man , "" she said she told him , "" I would bust your jaw . ""
The British television presenter , Anna Richardson , spoke to the LA Times about an incident in December 2000 when the actor was promoting The Sixth Day at the Dorchester hotel in London .
"" I went to shake his hand and he grabbed me on to his knee and he said , ' Before you go , I want to know if your breasts are real ' ...
At that point , he circled my left nipple with his finger and he said , ' Yes , they are real . '
""
The Schwarzenegger campaign denied Richardson 's account .
What effect the allegations will have on the campaign is unclear , with the actor running well ahead in the polls .
Initially , his team said he would make no comment but the actor clearly decided that an apology was the best way to deal with the claims .
His supporters , who had been queuing up outside the convention centre in San Diego since before dawn for yesterday 's rally , said they would make no difference .
"" We do n't believe it , "" said Susie Hopper , 53 , who works for a supermarket .
"" He 's not that stupid ...
He lives the American dream . ""
Her daughter Alexis , 18 , said : "" I 've heard worse things about the 70s .
If he did it 30 years ago , get over it .
He 's trying to make California a better place . ""
Joni Weber , 48 , a database designer , said : "" He 's an actor - women will come out of the woodwork .
Davis is known for his negative campaigning .
It would bother me if it was true
but I do n't believe what I read in the papers ."
"ITV 's decision finally to end the ' New at When ' saga was thrown into relief last night when the broadcaster 's night - time news bulletin was beaten by a 17-year - old movie on Channel Five .
Just 3.1 million people watched the 10 pm news programme , which has been steadily losing viewers since ITV decided to axe News at Ten five years ago .
This was 2 million fewer than watched BBC1 's 10 pm news and 200,000 fewer than Five 's Commando , a 1985 action movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a special forces colonel who goes back to active service after his daughter is kidnapped .
The Independent Television Commission yesterday acceded to ITV 's request to move its main evening news bulletin to a fixed 10.30pm slot five nights a week after admitting the compromise brokered three years ago with ITV had been a disaster for viewers and advertisers because the news was never on at a fixed time .
ITV continued to struggle against Five later on in the evening as action movie fans stayed tuned for a second helping in martial arts movie The Base .
Just over a million viewers watched The Base , a 13 % share of the viewing , leaving ITV 's documentary Ann Summers Uncovered trailing with 800,000 .
Elsewhere Channel 4 's documentary on the case of Nathalie Evans , who yesterday lost a legal battle with her former fiance to prevent the destruction of the couple 's fertilised eggs , failed to inspire viewers despite the story 's high profile .
Just 1.1 million viewers tuned in to Cutting Edge : Battle for a Baby , which examined the moral arguments in the case , less than a third of the audience for BBC2 's drama - documentary Seven Wonders of the Industrial World , on at the same time .
The hour - long programme , which last night focused on the creation of London 's sewerage system , attracted 3.7 million viewers - just a million fewer than hospital drama Sweet Medicine on ITV - on a good night for BBC2 .
QI , the channel 's comedy quiz show hosted by Stephen Fry , also continues to perform well with 2.6 million viewers and a 13 % share .
BBC1 's highly praised series of modern - day adaptations of the Canterbury Tales continues to perform well although viewing numbers have dropped steadily since the first hour - long drama , which starred Billie Piper as a small - town Karaoke singer with delusions of grandeur .
Nearly 6 million viewers watched last night 's drama , based on the Sea Captain 's Tale and featuring Om Puri as an Asian mobster with a philandering wife .
ITV 's Sweet Medicine continues to struggle against the Canterbury Tales , pulling in 4.8 million viewers last night .

"Arnold Schwarzenegger 's bid to become governor of the world 's fifth largest economy , California , hit another snag today as newspaper and television reports alleged he had expressed admiration for Hitler in the past .
The story broke as Mr Schwarzenegger apologised for his past behaviour toward women , after six women claimed the actor had sexually harassed and groped them in separate incidents between 1975 and 2000 .
The allegations of his admiration for Hitler surfaced in a book proposal that contained the transcript of an interview with Mr Schwarzenegger conducted during the filming of Pumping Iron in 1975 .
ABC News and the New York Times carried extracts of the book proposal , which quotes Mr Schwarzenegger as saying in response to a question about who he admired most : "" I admired Hitler , for instance , because he came from being a little man with almost no formal education , up to power .
I admire him for being such a good public speaker and for what he did with it . ""
He is also quoted as having said he would like to feel what is was like for "" Hitler in the Nuremberg stadium .
And have all those people scream at you and just being total agreement whatever you say .
"" The author of the book proposal is George Butler , the director of Pumping Iron .
He told ABC News that the actor never made any anti - Semitic comments .
Last night Mr Schwarzenegger last night said he did not recall making the remarks .
"" I do n't remember any of those comments because I always despise everything that Hitler stood for , "" he said .
He called the Nazi leader a "" disgusting villain "" .
Mr Butler told the New York Times that another transcript of the interview rendered Mr Schwarzenegger 's comments on Hitler as : "" I admire him for being such a good public speaker and for his way of getting to the people and so on .
But I did n't admire him for what he did with it .
It 's very hard to say who I admire , who are my heroes . ""
However the paper also reported that in the book proposal , Mr Butler says that at the time of the filming he considered Mr Schwarzenegger to be a "" flagrant , outspoken admirer of Hitler "" .
Mr Schwarzenegger grew up in Austria , where his father was a member of the Nazi party .
He has faced charges of Nazi sympathising before but has worked hard to refute them , and he has donated to the Simon Wiesenthal Centre , an international Jewish human rights organisation .
Mr Schwarzenegger 's campaign has already been bogged down with allegations in the Los Angeles Times of his treatment of women .
The women - including British television presenter Anna Richardson - described for the paper how Mr Schwarzenegger had grabbed their breasts or reached under skirts . ""
Yes , it is true that I was on rowdy movie sets
and I have done things that were not right , which I thought then was playful
but now I recognise that I offended people , "" Mr Schwarzenegger said yesterday .
"" Those people that I have offended , I want to say to them I am deeply sorry . ""
Mr Schwarzenegger 's fellow Hollywood celebrities also struck today , taking out a full page advertisement in the trade newspaper Variety to denounce the recall vote .
Dozens of actors , producers , writers and studio chiefs urged those in the industry to support the sitting Democratic governor , Gray Davis , in next week 's vote .
Californians will make two choices on their ballots : first a yes or no to recall Mr Davis , and then a choice of a successor should Mr Davis lose the recall vote .
But although the newspapers were unfavourable , the voters seemed taken with the actor .
A poll released today - and conducted before these allegations surfaced - found Mr Schwarzenegger leading the hefty pack of gubernatorial candidates by 10 percentage points over his nearest rival , Democrat Cruz Bustamante .
The Field Research poll showed 57 % of voters in favour of recalling Mr Davis , while 39 % wanted to see him stay in office .
Mr Schwarzenegger led Mr Bustamante 36 % to 26 % , pollsters found ."
"San Diego Union - Tribune Editorial , October 3 "" Allegations of a decades - long pattern of sexual abuse and harassment by the gubernatorial candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger raise serious questions that have not been fully answered by his acknowledgment of bad behaviour and his apology ... "" Will Californians on Tuesday be as understanding and as forgiving ?
Does what we now know about him override the strengths we see in him , the hope we think he represents ... ?
We would like to hear more from the reformed Mr Schwarzenegger . ""
Los Angeles Times Editorial , October 3 ""
These accounts of public groping ... in restaurants and offices as well as on movie sets , are more about being top dog than about sex ...
Maybe that 's what voters want this time : to have the class bully on their side ...
Perhaps they think muscle and meanness is what it takes to wring gambling money out of federally protected [ Native Americans ] , arm - wrestle employee unions into giving back benefits they 've been promised and undo unpopular taxes .
Problem is , a man who describes humiliating waitresses , secretaries and stuntwomen as ' playful ' seems an unlikely champion of the little people , including those who would vote him into office . ""
Susan Estrich Los Angeles Times , October 3 ""
As a professor of sex discrimination law for two decades and an expert on sexual harassment , I certainly do n't condone the unwanted touching of women that was apparently involved here .
But these acts [ as documented by the Los Angeles Times ] do not appear to constitute any crime , such as rape or sodomy or even assault or battery ...
None of these women , as the Times emphasises , ever came forward to complain ... ""
This attack , coming as late as it does , from a newspaper that has been acting more like a cheerleader for [ the incumbent governor ]
Gray Davis than an objective source of information , will be dismissed by most people as more Davis - like dirty politics ...
To his credit , Mr Schwarzenegger apologised for ' behaving badly ' .
So should the Los Angeles Times . ""
San Jose Mercury News Editorial , October 3 ""
While Mr Schwarzenegger 's candour was refreshing , should we believe that he will change a lifetime of behaviour ? ...
It 's unclear whether these revelations will change any minds , or votes .
Stories of Mr Schwarzenegger 's sexual exploits have circulated for a long time .
He 's largely been given a pass by the public .
It 's Hollywood , after all , and we like to watch ...
Now , as he tries to advance his career as a politician , he says he will be a champion for women .
Yet he has not stressed women 's issues in his campaign ...
His commitment to women makes a good sound bite , but again , Californians are being asked to take a leap of faith . ""
San Francisco Chronicle Editorial , October 2 ""
Mr Schwarzenegger , the Republican frontrunner , has tried to skate through much of the campaign on image , generalities and pithy one - liners ...
[ His ] calculated avoidance of most debates and in - depth interviews did not suggest the confidence of a leader with substance and mettle .
California 's problems are too serious - and the stakes too high - to take a chance on a neophyte ...
The reality is , most Californians will choose among these flawed candidates on the basis of partisan allegiance or philosophy .
But none is qualified to be governor . """
"The Arnold Schwarzenegger team had nicknamed the press buses on this final statewide campaign tour as Predators One , Two and Three .
It was meant to be a reference to one of his best known Hollywood films , not a reminder of his behaviour off screen .
But as the district attorney in Los Angeles was asked yesterday to investigate the claims of six women who alleged that they had been groped by the gentleman in the Running Man bus , fresh allegations about another Austrian who came from nowhere to power were made .
It emerged that film producer George Butler , who worked with Schwarzenegger in the 1970s , had said in a book proposal that the then bodybuilder liked to play Nazi marching songs and spoke admiringly of Hitler . ""
I admired Hitler ... because he came from being a little man with almost no formal education up to power and I admire him for being such a good public speaker , "" Schwarzenegger is alleged to have said .
"" I do n't remember any of those comments , "" the actor said yesterday as the campaign buses headed north on a tour that will finish symbolically in Sacramento , the state capital , tomorrow .
"" I despise everything he stood for .
I think he was a disgusting villain , a dictator . ""
The California Comeback tour , which set off from San Diego on Thursday and is due to hit Fresno and Modesto today , was meant to be a lap of honour , with Schwarzenegger leading in the polls to replace Governor Gray Davis on Tuesday .
Instead , it has attracted attention and demonstrators because of claims that it is Groping Man who could end up in the governor 's mansion next week .
It was at the first stop in Orange County that things started to go pear - shaped .
A big group of supporters had turned out at the Fairground in Costa Mesa .
They included a man carrying a large iguana called Iggy who , he claimed , was a firm Schwarzenegger supporter , even if he did not , as yet , have the vote .
There was also a man dressed in a chicken suit , carrying a placard suggesting that "" Arnold Is a Debate Chicken "" , because he has declined to take part in all but one of the debates with other candidates .
With a blazing sun at his back , the candidate , who has apologised to any women he has offended by his activities in the past , moved on to attacking the car tax in California , which has just been tripled by Democrat governor Davis .
"" It 's not going to hurt me , this car tax , "" he said .
"" It 's going to hurt low income people ...
I played a character in films and when I did n't like something , I destroyed it ! ""
At which point a massive crane dropped a 3,600 wrecking ball from 50 feet on top of an unoffending Oldsmobile on which has been inscribed "" Davis Car Tax "" .
But then came the first signs of trouble .
A group of young women arrived carrying placards which read "" No Groper for Governor "" and "" Women Demand Respect "" .
The women had read the claims in the Los Angeles Times that the actor was a serial groper .
"" I do n't think it 's right to have a groper for governor , "" said Estrella Renteria , 17 .
"" If he 's governor , he 's going to think he can get away with anything .
He should stay in Hollywood . ""
A young man arrived on the scene carrying a sign which read : "" Reach out and cop a feel for Arnold . ""
A waitress from Santa Monica called Gail Escobar emerged , with her own story about the actor .
It went back 25 years to when she was at Santa Monica high school and was working in a coffee bar .
She said that Schwarzenegger and some of his body - building friends had come into the coffee bar and afterwards one of them had dragged her outside , claiming Schwarzenegger wanted to see her .
She said that the actor , sitting in the passenger seat of a car , had threatened to rape her .
The Schwarzenegger team immediately denied the claims .
Furious Schwarzenegger supporters rounded on the women .
Some spat at them , others claimed that they were just resentful that the actor had not groped them .
Supporters who could not reach the women vented their anger on the press approaching anyone with a notebook in hand .
But there was little sign that any of the allegations were denting support amongst fans who see the furore as a last desperate throw by Davis supporters to trip up the Running Man .
"" Women do n't care , "" said Janis Schonfield , 52 , who said she was supporting Schwarzenegger , "" because Governor Davis taxes us to death .
"" At the next stop in San Bernardino , most of the crowd were supporters although one young Latino man shouted "" do n't vote for him - he wo n't let my grandma come in the country "" , a reference to Schwarzenegger 's views on tight immigration controls .
James Tate , who described himself as a "" black Republican "" , said that he was backing the actor because "" it 's all about winning
and I think Arnold has the ability to bring in the cross - over vote "" .
As for the groping allegations , Mr Tate , 49 , said : "" When we were young , everyone had a little fun in college . ""
The tour moved on once more as the most professional of all the campaigns , coordinated by former Republican governor Pete Wilson 's former aides , headed on to what everyone now assumes must be victory .
Inside a school , the actor was again asked about the groping allegations , some of which he said were not true , but "" other things may be true "" .
Schwarzenegger also said : "" It 's very interesting that since I 'm ahead in the campaign all the things are coming out .
I 'm
very pro - women , I 'm very much into equality .
Those things are not coming out .
"" None of the other candidates are mounting such huge campaigns , not least because they do not have the $ 20 m ( £ 12 m ) war chest that Schwarzenegger has amassed .
This week , his contributors came under scrutiny , not least because the actor had said he was wealthy enough not to have to take money from anyone but has now done so from real estate developers , businesses and construction interests .
Developer Tim Blixseth , who made his fortune in the timber trade and whose firm faces fines for illegal dumping , this week contributed $ 100,000 .
The elections are on Tuesday , by which time the campaign 's theme tune of We 're Not Going to Take It by Twisted Sister will have been played a few more dozen times .
There are likely , too , to be more women protesting .
For the record , the song played before the actor came on stage for the first rally of the tour , down in San Diego , was Bob Marley 's No Woman , No Cry ."
"grope vb . to feel or search about uncertainly ( for something ) with the hands .
There is little uncertainty about Arnold Schwarzenegger 's enthusiastic attentions to women .
Indeed , unrestrained directness appears to be the hallmark of the would - be governor of California .
Yet at least seven women have accused Arnie of groping - in lifts , on sets , at gyms and most recently on live television in the Big Breakfast 's big bed .
Some are taking legal advice .
One victim explained : ' The first time , you 're like , "" Oh my God !
I was groped by Arnold Schwarzenegger ! ""
- the second time it 's disgusting ! '
( Easy to see how a man of large ego might get that wrong . )
But though Arnie may claim presidential precedence for his unannounced lunging , it is not dignified .
If he hopes for a political career in California , he may need lessons in manners .
On the brighter side , he could teach many politicians a lesson in how to apologise which he does with the same directness : ' I have done things that were not right .
Those people that I have offended , I want to say to them I am deeply sorry about that . '
Top marks , Arnie , but do n't overdo it .
The first time you 're like ' Oh my God , Arnold Schwarzenegger apologised ... '"
"Indestructible on the cinema screen and seemingly indestructible on the campaign trail , Arnold Schwarzenegger appeared on course this weekend to achieve his ambition of becoming governor of California .
A week that began with the Hollywood actor turned Republican candidate increasing his lead in the polls over his rivals ended with yet more allegations of sexual harassment .
Three more women came forward yester day to claim Schwarzenegger had grabbed or groped them .
One of the women , Linnea Harwell , an assistant director on his 1988 film Twins , said he had pulled her down on a bed while he was wearing only underwear .
Carla Baron , who was working on the same movie set , said the actor had sandwiched her between himself and a crew member and forced his tongue into her mouth , while Collette Brooks , who met Schwarzenegger in the early 1980s when she was working as a journalist in Los Angeles , said he had grabbed her buttocks and told her she had a ' nice ass ' .
All three women spoke to the Los Angeles Times yesterday , bringing the number of alleged victims of sexual harassment by Schwarzenegger between 1975 and 2000 to 11 .
A spokesman for the actor 's campaign said last night that two of the alleged incidents on the set of Twins ' had never occurred ' .
He had no comment to make on Ms Baron 's allegations .
These new revelations came as Schwarzenegger 's rivals in the race to become leader of the world 's fifth biggest economy sought to take advantage of the reports about behaviour towards women , as well as claims that the Austrian - born actor had made admiring remarks about Hitler in 1975 .
Democratic governor Gray Davis , who will lose his job to Schwarzenegger if Tuesday 's vote reflects the opinion polls , said the actor was unfit to hold public office . '
If true , his personal behaviour was disturbing and unacceptable and his professed admiration for Adolf Hitler unconscionable , ' said Davis .
Schwarzenegger 's fellow Republican , Tom McLintock , who is also seeking to replace Davis , said : ' If these allegations are true , I believe he is morally unfit to hold office . '
With only two days of campaigning left , there are rumours that there is at least one more revelation to come about Schwarzenegger 's private life , although it appears that nothing can dent his growing popularity with California 's voters .
Political analysts judged his response to the sexual harassment allegations - a swift apology for inappropriate behaviour , followed by a supportive statement from his wife , Maria Shriver - to have been a qualified success in that it took the sting out of a story which threatened to dominate the last phase of the campaign .
The actor will spend the last days travelling around the state on a ' California Comeback Express ' bus tour , where he will attempt to shift the campaign back towards the issues on which he has made gains over the past few weeks , such as tax and the public 's antipathy towards career politicians in general and Gray Davis in particular . '
They try to tear your character down and everything you stand for .
And let me tell you something : they have already begun , but I will stay focused .
I will always stay focused , because the fight continues , ' Schwarzenegger told a rally of 1,000 supporters in the Californian town of Bakersfield .
Many of those there seemed in denial over the sexual harassment allegations made against their hero , despite his own apology . '
Do we have all the facts straight ?
I 'm not sure .
I just know that he 'll make a great governor
and I 'm voting for him , ' said Wendi Biagi , who had turned out for the rally in a homemade T - shirt bearing the slogan ' He 's the cutest one ' . '
Everyone makes mistakes , and I feel whatever he 's done is in the past , and I think he 's wanting to make changes .
Who knows what some of the other candidates might have done in their past ? '"
"Just over 150 years ago , the California legislature enacted a bounty of $ 50 for a Native American man 's scalp , $ 25 for a woman 's and $ 10 for a child 's .
Now the tribes that faced extermination have become the biggest political players in the state on the eve of the gubernatorial recall election .
With voters going to the polls tomorrow , Arnold Schwarzenegger 's team fought back over the weekend against claims that its candidate was a serial groper of women .
But even with a total of 15 women making claims and the Oakland Tribune withdrawing its endorsement , polls over the weekend showed the anti - recall campaign catching up with Mr Schwarzenegger , but still behind .
There are some three million Native Americans in the US - less than 1 % of the population .
Yet in the final moments of the campaign , the tribes which were once impoverished and ignored are spending millions of dollars to fight the recall of the governor , Gray Davis , and to support their favoured candidates .
In response , Mr Schwarzenegger has launched a savage attack on the state 's Native American casinos , an offensive which the tribes liken to a charge by the US cavalry .
California , with the largest number of tribes , was the state where the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act - letting tribes set up gambling operations as a means to economic independence - had the greatest impact .
Casinos , many highly profitable , mushroomed .
Last year , Native American casinos nationally took an estimated $ 13bn ( £ 7.8bn ) in revenue .
With that money has come power .
As the tribal casinos have sought to expand , challenging the previous hegemony of the gambling state of Nevada , politicians have courted them .
Since 1998 , the tribes in California have made political donations of around $ 120 m .
Mr Davis and his deputy , Cruz Bustamante , have benefited from the casinos ' largesse .
The two have defended their role on the grounds that they are helping the tribes to achieve economic independence , but they have been attacked from across the political spectrum for taking the money .
Mr Schwarzenegger has begun running ads attacking the infuence of tribal "" special interests "" and saying he will change their status if he is elected .
"" Their casinos make billions , yet they pay no taxes and virtually nothing to the state , "" he said .
"" All the other major candidates take their money and pander to them .
I do n't play that game . ""
Sitting in front of a Blackfoot feathered headdress in his office in Palm Springs is Richard Milanovich , the tribal chairman of the Agua Caliente band of the Cahuilla Indians since 1984 .
It is the hard hat perched beside the headdress that is perhaps more relevant .
As the chairman of one of the wealthiest of California 's 109 tribes , Mr Milanovich is overseeing the development of a $ 90 m casino which is due to open in Palm Springs in the next few weeks , alongside the tribe 's existing Spa resort .
"" This was tribal land going back thousands of years , "" said Mr Milanovich , whose mother was a tribe member , and father a Yugoslavian immigrant .
"" We know from our oral history , our birdsong , that we as a tribe have been here for 500 years . ""
The peace treaties made in 1848 , when the scalp bounty was enacted , granted the tribes 60 % of the state 's land , he said , but were never recognised by the state government and had only recently been re - examined .
But the financial muscle gained through gaming revenues had finally changed how the tribes were regarded . ""
Before that , we were tolerated , not accepted , "" said Mr Milanovich .
"" In 1993 , a survey found that half our members were living below the poverty level , the majority in substandard housing . ""
The Spa casino and hotel on the Agua Caliente land opened in 1995 and now has 2,400 employees .
The revenue has meant that every tribal member can afford to go to college and receives free healthcare , said Mr Milanovich .
He denied Mr Schwarzenegger 's claims that the tribes did not hand over enough of their revenue , saying that the casino paid nearly $ 9 m last year to the state as part of the "" compact "" : money that goes to tribes that do not have casinos , and to a fund for the treatment of compulsive gamblers .
The tribe 's charitable donations amounted to more than $ 6 m last year , he added , but on the casino 's turnover , he was coy :
"" Let 's just say we can pay our electricity bills and have a bit left over . ""
"" The politicians are now willing to hear what we have to say , whereas before ... we were never heard .
It was ugly before , it was very rare that we got in to see anyone .
"" We do n't mind paying our fair share .
but it should n't be done on the threat of your economic downfall .
The reservation economy is very fragile . ""
Mr Schwarzenegger 's mention of "" special interest "" groups annoys him .
"" How much influence does General Motors have , or Westinghouse , or Ford , or some construction companies ?
There 's a special interest which Mr Schwarzenegger seems to have his hand out for . ""
Mr Milanovich said that many tribes still lived in poverty and deprivation .
"" There are still big problems , but it has gotten better for more tribal people than ever before , and that is due to tribal gaming , "" he said .
Another tribal chairman , Mark Macarro , of the Pechanga Band of Luiseno Indians , said yesterday that he was "" astounded by Arnold Schwarzenegger 's ignorance "" . ""
In 1875 , we were forcibly evicted from our land because it had water running through it , "" he said .
In the eight years that his tribe had operated a casino , it had been able to do more in the way of healthcare and education "" than the federal government did in 200 years , "" he added .
But since the actor 's attack ads were aired , he had received hate mail .
Ernie Stevens , the chairman of the National Indian Gaming Association , said that the ads "" perpetuate the myth that Indians do n't pay taxes and that Indian gaming is not contributing to the state of California ...
Indian gaming has created over 40,000 jobs in California while the rest of the state economy is declining "" .
Tribal employees had paid over $ 280 m a year in federal income and payroll tax , in addition to the $ 100 m paid to California each year through the gaming compacts , he said .
With many of the state 's agreements with the tribes still having years to run - up to 16 - what Mr Schwarzenegger can do if elected may be limited .
"" We are a patient people , "" Mr Milanovich said ."
"The accusations of sexual adventurism - on film sets etc - laid against Arnold Schwarzenegger in the California governorship race come from the political party that was happy to stand loyally by such notorious serial gropers as Presidents Kennedy , Johnson and Clinton .
I 'm no admirer of Schwarzenegger as an actor , a man or a politician .
But if this is all the Democrats feel they can come up with , all I can say is : they deserve to lose today .

"Californians head to the polls today in a unique and much - mocked recall election that , despite its circus atmosphere , will determine the next leader of the world 's fifth largest economy .
So does the current Democratic governor , Gray Davis , stand a chance against the Republican frontrunner , Terminator star Arnold Schwarzenegger ?
Washington Post correspondent Terry Neal , at a Davis rally in Los Angeles , reported this back - handed compliment from the governor 's wife , Sharon , meant to highlight allegations of sexual misconduct by Schwarzenegger . ""
My husband has never been accused of anything worse than being dull , "" she helpfully claimed .
Actually , her husband has been accused of financially mismanaging the state to the point that polls show the Republican - funded and highly suspect recall campaign will be successful in booting Davis out of office .
The state 's $ 40bn ( £ 24bn ) budget deficit must be on the mind of Sacramento Bee columnist Daniel Weintraub , who defends the recall - which pits Davis against 135 candidates of widely variable quality - on the grounds that even if Davis wins , he will be more likely to tackle the serious problems facing California .
"" If he wins , he will probably be a better governor for having had the experience .
If the recall prevails , California will have new leadership , a fresh start and some incredible momentum for dramatic change in the way the state does business , "" Weintraub argues .
The virulently anti - recall Los Angeles Times once again pleaded with voters to reject the whole fiasco .
Though entirely underwhelmed by Davis ( "" He 's not an inspiring leader , to say the least "" ) , the paper fears : "" A successor could be elected with far fewer votes than Davis got when he was reelected last year .
Just as important , the alternatives are not superior to Davis and are potentially worse . ""
The San Francisco Chronicle nods in agreement : "" The recall process is seriously flawed , and this political ambush of Gov Gray Davis is unfair and unwise . ""
Republican frontrunner Arnold Schwarzenegger comes in for particular criticism in the LA Times , the paper that first carried the allegations of groping and sexual harassment by the actor . ""
He has fed voters predictable lines from his movies and no detailed ideas ...
The pattern of sexual groping that Schwarzenegger acknowledged last week raises additional , disturbing questions , "" the paper claims .
New York Times commentator Bob Herbert is no Schwarzenegger fan , either . ""
Mr. Schwarzenegger is the favourite in California because , incredibly , he 's perceived as a strong leader by many voters .
In reality , he seems little more than an ageing but still frisky goof - artist , a fun - loving egomaniac with a winning smile and very little understanding of what is appropriate behaviour .
But he 's played spectacularly strong leaders in one cartoonish movie after another .
As scary as it seems , for a lot of voters in California , that 's reason enough to hand him the reins of their government , "" he writes .
The Fresno Bee 's Jim Boren raises the tantalising possibility that today 's voting will not be the end of the matter .
"" A close election could be challenged in court by lawyers already licking their chops over the possibility .
But then a drawn - out legal battle over the governorship would n't be a surprising twist in this campaign of oddities .
"" It 's no wonder that the rest of the nation thinks we 're driven by narcissism and nuttiness , "" Boren sighs .
One possibility , however , the papers can not bring themselves to raise : if the Terminator wins the day , his own total recall is just 900,000 signatures away ..."
"Besides all of the attention given to Arnold Schwarzenegger and his four closest rivals , a further 130 candidates are running in the California gubernatorial election .
Each had to pay $ 3,500 ( £ 2,100 ) and collect 65 signatures for the privilege , so has it been worth it ?
Gene Forte is in no doubt that it has .
In the final days of the campaign , Mr Forte decided that , if the publicity was not going to come to him , he would go to the publicity - driving behind Mr Schwarzenegger 's campaign tour .
Running as a corruption - buster , he claims he will expose the "" good old boys "" who make up the state 's judges and attorneys . ""
Yes , it has been absolutely worth it , "" he said .
Those fringe candidates who have gained most coverage tend to be those in porn or entertainment : Hustler publisher Larry Flynt , porn star Mary Carey , child actor Gary Coleman , and billboard poster model Angelyne .
But most are serious souls - engineers , teachers , lawyers , business people .
One is Cheryl Bly - Chester , a single mother from Sacramento ; she said the first positive result had been that her three children had cleaned up the house .
In all her campaign would cost her $ 6,000 , but it had been "" absolutely "" worth running .
James Vandenventer is a young Republican from LA whose platform includes "" preserving a woman 's right to choose , stopping offshore drilling , and ensuring gay rights "" .
His campaign had been an enlightening experience , he claimed - showing how entrenched power and money went hand in hand .
Jon Zellhoefer , another Republican , describes himself as "" the intelligent alternative "" in his campaign literature .
A lawyer and engineer , he was glad he had run . ""
Oh , yes .
We 'd still be part of England if we did n't have attitude .
"" There were other pitches . ""
Please vote for me , thus breaking the seventh seal and incurring armageddon , "" was the electoral pledge of Trek Thunder Kelly , 33 , a performance artist from Venice .
"" I will legalise drugs , gambling , and prostitution so that they may be taxed and regulated , "" he said .
Some were promoting a single issue .
Warren Farrell wanted "" equal father and mother involvement , especially if there is a divorce "" , and the race gave him a wonderful opportunity to get his views heard .
"" Running has been the second best experience of my life , "" said the holder of a PhD in political science .
"" But I 'm not delusional like some of the others who think they 're going to win .
Anyone who thinks so should be disqualified . ""

To encourage entrepreneurship , he promised , he was giving away $ 100 at an end - of - campaign rally .
Had it been worth it ? ""
A tree falls in the middle of the forest , did it make a sound ? "" he said .
"" It was a wonderful , healthy tree but no one noticed . """
"Walking along Main Street recently , as California 's voters decided whether or not to exchange their old governor for a shiny new European model , I came across a man defacing a poster with an aerosol can of white paint .
The poster was of Arnold Schwarzenegger , although , as it contained the word "" achtung "" somewhere near the top , it did not seem to be part of any official campaign .
The man spraying over its rude message was a middle - aged , neatly turned - out Schwarzenegger supporter .
"" Do n't you believe in free speech ? "" asked a young man who was observing the spraying . ""
This is my free speech , "" the man replied as he covered the poster : an interesting philosophical point with which to round off the campaign .
Certainly , Schwarzenegger 's supporters have been the most passionate backers of their man .
At the first rally after allegations of groping had been made against him , the LA Times , which had published the allegations , became a major hate symbol .
By association , anyone with a notebook became a figure of suspicion : I have n't had so many angry men shouting in my direction since I was covering the World Cup in Italy 13 years ago .
This seems like a good time to turn to Arthur Miller and his recent small volume , On Politics and the Art of Acting .
The book was written , in part , in response to the 2000 presidential election , but it seems even more appropriate for the Californian poll . ""
When one is surrounded by such a roiling mass of consciously contrived performances , it gets harder and harder for a lot of people to locate reality any more , "" Miller writes . ""
Admittedly , we live in an age of entertainment - but is it a good thing that our political life , for one , be so profoundly governed by the modes of theatre , from tragedy to vaudeville to farce ?
Political leaders everywhere have come to understand that to govern , they must learn how to act . ""
The recent California campaign has had , as its two main contestants , a professional actor ( Schwarzenegger ) and a governor who could not have understudied the part of the ghost of Hamlet 's father in a school play ( Gray Davis ) .
There is no question about who ran the better campaign - the one that influenced the media the most - which brings us to the second of Miller 's points . ""
The American press is made up of disguised theatre critics : substance counts for next to nothing compared with style and inventive characterisation , "" he says .
"" The question is whether the guy is persuasive , not what he is persuading us of . "" Politics is a humiliating business .
Governor Davis could face humiliation at the polls .
Schwarzenegger has , to a certain extent , been humiliated by claims from women that he had sexually harassed them .
Here we are on election day , not so much slouching towards Bethlehem as groping towards Sacramento .
But then life is a humiliating business .
I have just returning from cycling along the Pacific shore to try and work up the psychic energy to write this despatch .
I cycled past MSNBC setting up the stage for an election special on the beach : a surreal , and possibly symbolic , spectacle of bright lights and an empty stage .
Then I found myself being overtaken on the home stretch , not by another cyclist but a man on rollerblades , who was wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words "" the Dog 's Bollocks "" .
How humiliating is that ?"
"California 's governor , Gray Davis , said yesterday that the recall race was now "" a dead heat "" and that voters had been leaving Arnold Schwarzenegger 's camp as allegations of sexual harassment continued .
The latest polls , on the eve of the election , showed the race tightening .
But they still indicated that Mr Davis would be recalled and replaced by Mr Schwarzenegger when voters go to the polls today .
Mr Schwarzenegger is now accused of groping 15 women .
But his team remained confident and accused Mr Davis of coordinating a last - minute dirty - tricks campaign . ""
Davis always knows how to run a dirty campaign but he does n't know how to run California , "" said Mr Schwarzenegger , who was shuttling between San Jose , near San Francisco , and Huntington Beach , near Los Angeles , for rallies yesterday .
While denying most of the allegations of groping he acknowledged that "" some of the things sound like me "" .
He apologised again if his behaviour had offended people .
Most of the accusations were from women who said that the actor had grabbed their breasts or put his hand up their skirts .
Mr Schwarzenegger was questioned about the claims during television interviews .
He told Peter Jennings of ABC News : "" It does n't make any sense to go through details here with you ...
Is n't it odd that in the last three days and four days before the campaign all of these women suddenly want to have an apology ? ""
He also again dismissed suggestions that he had once expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler .
He said he "" despised anything that Hitler stood for and what the Nazis stood for "" .
Mr Davis has denied that any of his supporters encouraged women to come forward with claims .
"" The allegations , if true , are very disturbing , "" he said yesterday .
Some of the claims , if true , would indicate that a crime had been committed , he added .
Both sides agreed that the allegations had had an effect .
One paper , the Oakland Tribune , has withdrawn its endorsement from Mr Schwarzenegger .
The two main newspapers in the state , the LA Times and the San Francisco Chronicle , were already urging a no vote on the recall .
Mr Schwarzenegger 's team remained confident that its campaign was too far ahead to be caught .
More than a million voters had already cast absentee ballots before the stories of groping broke .
The campaign of lieutenant governor Cruz Bustamante appeared to have stalled over the past week but he has used the sexual harassment allegations to attack Mr Schwarzenegger . ""
First there were three , then five , then six , then nine , then 11 and now 15 , "" he said of the allegations at a rally in Gardena , near Los Angeles . ""
After a while these start to sort of depersonalise , start to sound like numbers .
These are women , women who were harassed in the workplace . ""
In the latest polls , Mr Schwarzenegger led Mr Bustamante by 36 % to 29 % .
The same poll showed 54 % favouring recall and 41 % against .
Mr Davis brought in the big guns from the Democratic party , including Senator Dianne Feinstein and Jesse Jackson , at anti - recall events .
"" People are beginning to see how unfair it is and how harmful it is to California 's economy , "" said Ms Feinstein .
During the campaign , every Democratic presidential candidate , as well as Bill Clinton and Al Gore , have visited the state to offer support .
Mr Davis still seemed unable to energise the blue collar vote which is vital to his survival .
Tom McClintock , a conservative Republican , who has been running third in the polls , was calling on voters to stick with him .
He may pick up some conservative voters unhappy about the groping claims .
A record number of voters , 15.4 million , have registered and much depends on how many turn out .
There is also a possibility of legal challenges if the vote is close because the antiquated system that caused confusion in Florida in the 2000 presidential election is being used in many areas ."

A fantastic job they 've done .
Working around the clock , all of them on my behalf .
I would n't be standing up here today if it was n't for you all .
I want to thank all the volunteers , all of you for the great work .
I want to also thank the people of California .
From the time I came over to this country , you opened your arms to me , you received me , you 've given me opportunities , endless amounts of opportunities .
Everything that I have is because of California .

And today California has given me the greatest gift of all .
You 've given me your trust by voting for me .
Thank you very much to all the people of California for giving me their great trust .
And let me tell you something .
I will do everything I can to live up to that trust .
I will not fail you .
I will not disappoint you .
And I will not let you down .
For two months , I 've been speaking out about the need of bringing back fiscal responsibility to this state , bringing back a positive business atmosphere , bringing back businesses , bringing back jobs , bringing back our education .
It 's very important that we need to bring back trust in the government itself .
For two months , I went up and down the state and listened to the people .
I met good , honest , hardworking people .
People who just want to raise their families here .
People who want to do business here , or their jobs here or to educate their kids here .
People that want to enjoy the clean air and the clean water .
And I have heard your voice .
I heard your voice loud and clear .
We have tough choices ahead .
The first choice that we must make is the one that will determine our success .
Shall we rebuild our state together or shall we fight amongst ourselves , create even deeper divisions and fail the people of California ?
Well let me tell you something , the answer is clear .
For the people to win , politics as usual must lose .
I will reach out to Republicans , to Democrats , independents .
To those who supported the recall and those who did not .
Those who supported me and those who did not .
I want to reach out to everybody , the young or old , rich or poor , people of all religion , all colours and all nationalities .
I want to be the governor for the people .
I want to represent everybody .
I just received a gracious phone call from Governor Davis .
Yes , a very gracious phone call from Governor Davis , who promised me that he would ... work hard to make this transition smooth
and I really appreciate that phone call , yes .
I believe very strongly that a smooth transition is very important for the people of California .
And this is why I instructed my transition team to treat their counterparts with the utmost respect .
I will call all the leaders of the legislature , both Democrats and Republicans , and I will let them know that my door will always be open .
That I want to work with them together for the good of California .
The same goes to the members of the legislature , it does n't matter if they 're to the left , to the right or to the centre .
I extend my hand to them .
I want to work with you .
I need your help .
And to the other candidates for governor , I want to extend to you the olive branch of political reconciliation so that we can move California forward .
Tonight we are all here celebrating , and we have reasons to celebrate , but tomorrow the hard work will begin .
Oh yes .
And in closing , I want to say something to you that I 've been saying for the last two months travelling up and down the state .
I want to be the people 's governor .
I want to represent everybody .
I believe in the people of California and I know that together , we can do great things .
I know that together , we can make this again the greatest state of the greatest country in the world .
Thank you .
And god bless all of you .
Thank you ."
"California 's voters have put their faith in Arnold Schwarzenegger , who has made the transition from Hollywood star to politician with Terminator - like speed , as the state 's new governor .
Mr Schwarzenegger , a 56-year - old Austrian immigrant and the husband of television journalist and Kennedy relative Maria Shriver , gave few details about how he planned to heal California 's malaise during his campaign .
Instead , he preferred to rely on a can - do persona burnished by his action man film roles .
What he did promise was to repeal California 's car tax as soon as he took office , but that will mean piling on another $ 4.2bn ( £ 2.5bn ) on top of a projected budget deficit of $ 8bn for the year beginning July 1 .
Mr Schwarzenegger has also vowed to cut spending - but that is an easy promise to make on the stump , and far harder to accomplish once in office .
For a start , referendums dictate that the governor can not cut 70 % of the $ 70bn budget , $ 35bn of which goes on education .
If he cuts health and welfare , he would lose matching funds from the federal government .
In order to balance the books this year , the previous governor , Gray Davis , had to resort to public spending cuts and the sale of $ 18bn in bonds to close a $ 38bn deficit .
Those bonds come due in two years , right in the middle of Mr Schwarzenegger 's term .
His economic challenge will come early , as he and his team will have to draw up a budget that balances the books as mandated by law .
By far the most economically sensible thing to do would be to raise property taxes , which were frozen by Proposition 13 , a landmark 1978 ballot which saw voters pass a measure to lower property taxes by 60 % , and strictly limited property tax increases .
The tax revolt embodied in Proposition 13 has left California dependent on volatile taxes , particularly income taxes .
Very sensibly , Warren Buffett , Mr Schwarzenegger 's much - hyped investment guru , suggested that the crazy cap on property taxes should be lifted .
That idea , however , was promptly consigned to the dustbin because voters consider Proposition 13 to be sacrosanct , whatever state law says about balancing budgets .
That leaves Mr Schwarzenegger with few options , so do not be surprised if he ditches his campaign promise not to raise taxes .
The fact of the matter is that his margin for manoeuvre is extremely limited .
California very much depends on the national economy .
If the US recovery takes hold after a cocktail of tax cuts and massive public spending - what the IMF has referred to as "" the best recovery money can buy "" - California , along with the rest of the country , will benefit .
True , the state has its own economic characteristics .
Home to many hi - tech firms , particularly in Silicon Valley , the state took a hit when the hi - tech bubble burst .
However , its plight is not wildly out of kilter with that of the rest of the country .
California lost 275,000 jobs , a 1.9 % decline , from January 2001 through to August this year .
Over the same period , 2.6 million jobs were lost nationally , a 2 % fall .
In fact , this recession is nowhere as bad as the one that struck California in the early 90s , when the jobless rate soared to 9.3 % as deep cuts in defence spending devastated the state""s aerospace industry .
In the present downturn , unemployment is running at 6.6 % , compared to the national rate of 6.1 % . ""
The real tragedy of the recall debate is that it is distracting attention from the real serious national job problem , "" Stephen Levy , director of the Centre for Continuing Study of the California Economy , said .
"" High productivity growth and outsourcing and national trends represent difficult national challenges . ""
Mr Schwarzenegger cashed in on a campaign that whipped up discontent with an economy that is ailing , but is far from the basket case that Mr Davis 's critics have depicted .
"" I will not fail you , I will not disappoint you , and I will not let you down , "" the victorious Mr Schwarzenegger said today .
But the Terminator will find it difficult to fulfil expectations in the real world , where there are few Hollywood happy endings ."
"Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger has been elected as governor of California , with the state 's voters banishing the Democratic incumbent , Gray Davis , only 11 months into his second term of office .
Republican Mr Schwarzenegger , who has never previously run for political office , told cheering supporters that he would repay their faith in him after ousting Mr Davis .
"" I will not fail you , I will not disappoint you , and I will not let you down , "" he said following the declaration of the result .
He made his victory speech in the same Los Angeles ballroom in which Ronald Reagan , who also served as governor of California , learned that he had become the US president in 1980 .
Mr Davis became the first California governor to be removed from office in mid - term , and only the second in the nation 's history to be recalled .
With more than half the votes counted , Mr Schwarzenegger had secured almost 50 % .
Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante was his closest rival , with a little more than 30 % .
The film star pledged to be "" the governor of the people "" , saying : "" I know that , together , we can make this the greatest state in the greatest country in the world .
For people to win , politics , as usual , must lose .
"" We have tough choices ahead .
Shall we rebuild our state together , or shall we fight among ourselves ?
I will reach out to Republicans and Democrats and independents : to those who supported the recall , and to those who did not . ""
Republican activists sparked the recall vote amid growing concern over California 's $ 8bn ( £ 4.8bn ) budget deficit , growing unemployment figures and struggling education system .
In conceding defeat , Mr Davis said that he "" accepted the voters ' judgement "" , adding : "" I 'm calling on everyone to put the chaos and division of the recall behind us and do what 's right for this great state of California . ""
I told my mother and my wife before we came out here that this is a no - crying zone on this stage .
We can cry later tonight .
"" Voters at the polls faced two questions : whether they wanted to recall Mr Davis , and who they favoured among the candidates to replace him if he was removed .
Austrian - born Mr Schwarzenegger , star of the Terminator films , told voters : "" Everything I have is because of California .
I came here with absolutely nothing , and California has given me absolutely everything . ""
And today California has given me the greatest gift of all : you have given me your trust by voting for me . ""
Mr Schwarzenegger , who is married to television journalist Maria Shriver , the niece of Senator Edward M Kennedy , will take office as soon as the results are certified , which will be no later than November 15 .
Exit polls had shown that seven in 10 voters disapproved of how Mr Davis was doing his job , with the same number backing Mr Schwarzenegger to be his replacement .
Election officials reported long queues and a shortage of parking spaces near polling stations as California 's voters turned out in large numbers .
In the build - up to the election , Mr Schwarzenegger had faced allegations that he had sexually harassed women .
The Los Angeles times last week reported that at least six women had made allegations against him .
He faced further pre - election scrutiny over claims that he had once praised Adolf Hitler .
Despite high - profile backing for Mr Davis from senior Democrats including Bill Clinton and Al Gore , Mr Schwarzenegger secured a victory which has created headlines around the world .
The French interior minister , Nicolas Sarkozy , said : "" Someone who is a foreigner in his country , who has an unpronounceable name and can become governor of the biggest American state - that 's not nothing . ""
In Styria , Mr Schwarzenegger 's Austrian home province , governor Waltraud Klasnic said : "" He 's one of us .
Many people in the world - and in America - now know where Styria is . """

"Throughout the Californian election campaign , Arnold Schwarzenegger repeated some choice quotes from his most popular movies , the Terminator series .
"" I 'll be back , "" he told cheering crowds .
The man has never been elected before , he has promised to give up acting , and he 's hardly going to go back to bodybuilding now .
In what sense did he mean he would be back ?
Did he mean that he would repeat the same nonsensical incantation every night of the campaign ?
If so , that is what came to pass .
With "" hasta la vista , baby "" , he is on firmer ground .
This little nugget is presumably aimed at capturing California 's increasingly influential Spanish - speaking community , with the reference to childcare tagged on to the end as a bonus .
Still , anybody who has seen him in Kindergarten Cop could have cause to worry about his views on firearms in nursery schools .
Only his stated ambition to "" terminate Gray Davis "" had the ring of political truth to it .
For all his cuddly , Guardian - friendly policies , Mr Davis has the glazed look and monotonous speech of one you suspect might not really be human - who might , in fact , be an android .
Even this seems to be a blatant case of pot and kettle , though .
Why Arnie would want to draw attention to his own charisma deficit is anyone 's guess .
Revealingly , however , California 's new governor neglected to use some other , startlingly appropriate , quotations from his back catalogue .
Try this for size : when asked "" what is good ? "" in the film Conan the Barbarian , Arnie pronounces : "" To crush your enemies , see them driven before you , and to hear the lamentation of the women ! ""
In one sentence , we find Schwarzenegger 's views on foreign policy ( go Dubya ) , on transport ( everyone in their car ) , and on sexual harassment ( although he now says he 's sorry if he ever caused any lamentation ) .
Conan is also fertile quote material for its "" the riddle of steel "" line .
Using the rise and fall experience of cities such as Pittsburgh , Conan wisely opines that industrial diversification is a pre - requisite of sustainable development .
Understandably , Arnie also neglected to use any quotes from Red Heat , in which he is cast against type as a neanderthal Moscow policeman .
In the film , he boldly proclaims that the "" Soviet method is more economical "" , an alarming thought to any Republican .
In context , he is referring to the use of torture to extract information from a suspect - so any contemporary relevance is absent .
At the opposite end of the political spectrum , his character in True Lies echoes Margaret Thatcher 's famous neo - conservative soundbite that "" there is no such thing as society "" when he tells his wife
"" there is no ' us ' , you psychotic bitch "" .
More evidence , perhaps , of the soul of rightwing politics .
And if you think that the jokey tone of this piece means I 'm relaxed about the prospect of the biggest US biggest state being in the hands of the Republican Barbarian in the highly delicate current international situation , I 'm not .
But , as Arnie 's character in the most recent Terminator film points out : "" Levity is good : it relieves tension and the fear of death . """

Schwarzenegger wins California governorship FOOTBALL
TAKES
A DRUBBING
It 's a hard task , juggling all today 's stories about the parlous state of our national game , although the Times headline , "" England strike caps day of football shame "" , perhaps does it most succinctly .
The events , briefly summarised , are as follows :
Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has been dropped from the England squad for failing to take a drugs test , leading his club and his fellow players to complain , the players apparently threatening to stay away from Saturday 's crucial European Championship qualifier with Turkey ; an unnamed Leeds United player has been arrested in connection with an alleged sexual assault on a woman , an assault separate to that which made the headlines last week , while another player is helping police with their enquiries .
Then there was the £ 750 fine given to Newcastle striker Craig Bellamy by Cardiff magistrates court for drunken and abusive behaviour at a nightclub this summer , and the small matter of £ 60 m of shares being traded in Man Utd , bringing two Irish racing magnates closer to owning the club and a head - on confrontation with Sir Alex Ferguson , now a bitter rival thanks to a dispute over a racing horse and its stud rights .
While the tabloids choose to concentrate on the Leeds rape claims , the broadsheets get to grips with Rio Ferdinand .
"" Why did it take 44 hours for Britain 's costliest footballer to take a drugs test ? "" asks the Independent .
The answer , it appears , was a combination of forgetfulness on the part of Ferdinand - walking out of training and into Harvey Nichols an hour after he had been asked to provide a urine sample - and a reluctance to wait for the defender on the part of testers .
This resulted in a week of dispute between club and country , the Independent reports , a dispute that looks unlikely to go away any time soon .
The Times offers more on the possible strike , claiming eight players , led by the captain David Beckham , remonstrated with the head of the FA , Mark Palios , claiming they would not play if their colleague was dropped without being charged with any offence .
The FA are unlikely to back down , however , especially as Ferdinand - who insists he has never used drugs - is likely to be charged next Monday .
The Guardian registers its support with the actions of the FA . ""
Rarely has masochism seemed so noble "" , writes Kevin McCarra , while the Times 's Martin Samuel believes "" there were so many rich , powerful and self - interested men lined up against Palios last night , he just had to be right "" .
Samuel even goes so far as to suggest that yesterday 's events are a cause for national pride .
On that note , and with the interests of non - football fans in mind , it is time to move on .
* I 've never used drugs - Ferdinand * Independent : Drugs , sexual assault , and a £ 60 m deal : just another day in our national game BLACK CLOUDS IN BLACKPOOL "" Bring back birching for young tearaways ... castrate paedophiles ... bring back hanging "" .
That 's the view from the podium at the Conservative party conference , as extracted on the front page of the Guardian .
Yet the opinions are not those of a retired major , but an upwardly mobile IT consultant , Tim Metcalfe .
Is the modern face of the Tory party ?
And if so , will Iain Duncan Smith be around to lead it ?
The Guardian reports , alongside pictures of Mr Metcalfe , that "" dissident Tories "" are confident of collecting the names of 25 MPs necessary to trigger a vote of confidence in the party leader .
According to the paper , as many as 13 MPs may have put their names to such a motion already .
The third leadership contest in barely six years could be in the offing , and all before the leader has given his speech to conference .
While some more reserved Tories suggest that a vote is unlikely to happen unless party members request it , the media is certainly making sure that the Tories under IDS look like a dead electoral duck .
Several papers run a photograph of the Tory leader on walkabout in a deserted Poulton - le - Fylde yesterday with locals registering no interest whatsoever as he wanders past the Poulton Pork Shop .
""
One local - told [ IDS ] was coming - said ' I 'm not sure I 'd recognise him ' , "" the Sun reports .
Elsewhere at conference , the shadow home secretary put forward his proposals on reforming law and order .
Allowing local communities to elect their own police boards , mayors or sheriffs would in Mr Letwin 's opinion
"" ensure that they carried out the wishes of their communities "" , the Telegraph reports .
Tories would also increase the number of police by 40,000 , while saving up to a billion pounds by reforming the asylum system ( including the "" offshore processing of all claims "" ) .
According to the Telegraph 's sketchwriter Andrew Gimson , Mr Letwin 's plans are crazy .
Fortunately he means this with tongue firmly in cheek . ""
[ Mr Letwin ] was actually asserting , not merely that democracy might in theory be a desirable way of ordering our affairs , but that it would actually work in practice ! ""
Unusual indeed .

Top Tories ' Trojan Horse plot to remove their leader exposed TURKISH TROOPS COULD HEAD TO IRAQ
The International Herald Tribune reports a potential boon for President George Bush in Iraq , or maybe another headache , after the Turkish parliament voted to send peacekeeping troops to the country .
In a clear 358 - 183 majority the parliament reversed a position taken before the war on Iraq , which forbade US forces from using Turkish bases as the starting point for an attack .
The American administration is pleased , hoping the decision could lead to a speedy internationalisation of troops - and particularly among Muslim nations .
However , Iraqi officials are believed to be opposed the decision , rejecting the involvement of any foreign troops .
The Financial Times carries an interview with Donald Rumsfeld , in which the US defence secretary admits he was not consulted on the creation of a new "" Iraq stabilisation group "" to be run by the head of the national security council , Condoleezza Rice .
Claiming that the new group was no different to the existing policy structure , he questioned why Ms Rice had chosen to send a memorandum to cabinet colleagues about the organisation .
According to the FT , Mr Rumsfeld "" declined to comment on the perception that the move was an attempt by the White House to strip control of the rebuilding from the tight grip of the Pentagon "" .

COX REMOVED IN BREAKFAST COUP ""
Is this the end of the ladettes ? "" asks the Independent , after Sara Cox lost her job as the presenter of Radio 1 's flagship breakfast show .
The programme had lost 500,000 listeners in three months , with Cox 's style , deemed "" coarse and unpleasant "" by the estimable Noel Edmonds , often held to blame .
"" It was cool at the time to be one of the lads and a bit lary "" , the acting deputy editor of Company magazine , Lindsay Frankel , tells the Independent , "" but now that 's seen as a bit Faliraki and our readers aspire to be Carrie Bradshaw from Sex and the City . ""
If that perceived shift in taste is true , why the BBC has decided to replace Cox with Chris Moyles is a mystery .
"" I could absolutely kick anybody 's [ word deleted for email filter sensibilities ] on breakfast , ever "" , is one of Moyles ' more restrained statements about the job , he also sees himself as "" the saviour of Radio 1 "" .
Radio 1 's controller , Andy Parfitt , seems to agree : "" He was my first and only choice , "" he said , although whether that is a measure of confidence or desperation remains to be seen .

The merger of Granada and Carlton was yesterday approved by the government , allowing the two biggest ITV companies to compete against the BBC and BskyB.
Either that or fatten themselves up for a foreign takeover , reports the FT , claiming that both Viacom - the world 's largest media company - and the investment group Saban Capital have expressed a tentative interest .
The Guardian reports that negotiations are n't over yet , as a proviso in agreeing the merger was that both companies must reform the way sell advertising slots .
The Guardian reports that the companies will be expected to continue with current deals held with advertisers for several years , a move designed to prevent the new company from ramping up their rates .
* End of an era for Granada THE BOY WHO MUST EAT CHIPS
The Mirror reports a rare medical condition that could leave long - distance lorry drivers abandoning the Atkins diet ( if , indeed , they ever took it up ) .
According to the paper , thin as a rake student Ashley Clarke , suffers from having arteries that are too wide and blood pressure that is too low .
The solution : to eat as much fatty food and drink as many pints as he can .
"" It sounds daft , but because I was so super - healthy it made me ill , "" Ashley tells the paper in a quote that will surely be pinned up in greasy spoons around the country .
He was later diagnosed with vasovagal syncope syndrome and put on his special diet .
"" I was so overwhelmed someone had found this cause , I burst into tears . ""

"JM Coetzee 's winning the Nobel prize for literature was announced on Friday October 3 .
By coincidence , that was the day the media blitzkrieg on Arnold Schwarzenegger as a world - class harasser of women was launched by the Los Angeles Times .
It provoked the front - running candidate 's carefully crafted public statement : "" Yes , I have behaved badly sometimes .
Yes , it is true that I was on rowdy movie sets , and I have done things that were not right , which I thought then was playful "" .
A qualified apology was issued , with muscular fingers firmly crossed behind the back .
Fifteen cases were cited by the newspaper .
The pattern was the same throughout .
It was not Clintonian carnal "" weakness "" but calculated power play that Arnold indulged when he ( reportedly ) felt women 's breasts or stuck his ( muscular ) hand up their skirts .
Arnold was groping to win , to conquer , to kick ( or failing that , fondle ) ass : he was Conan the Vulgarian ; the Gropinator .
He had used his pre - potent position as megastar on the film set and as Mr Universe in the gym to dominate and humiliate .
That 's what "" winning "" was .
He would , one apprehended , use his gubernatorial pre - eminence the same way .
Did California want a man or a mouse as governor - and , ex officio , head of the Regents of the University of California ?
One incident , reported by Carla Baron , a stand - in for the female lead on Twins , is typical .
Baron was standing at the food service table with Schwarzenegger when the star "" playfully "" suggested to his own bulky stand - in that they "" make a Carla sandwich "" ... "" With Schwarzenegger facing her and the stand - in behind , they squeezed her between them .
After they separated , Schwarzenegger who had just been smoking a cigar , bent her over and pushed his tongue in her mouth . '
There was this tongue lunging down my throat .
It was worse than licking an ashtray .
It was like an ashtray of human flesh . '
"" The profiles of Coetzee on October 3 highlighted his book , Disgrace , as his breakthrough work .
It won the Booker prize ( his second ) in 1999 , when I was on the judging panel .
In addition to the literary merits , Disgrace had a particular interest .
I 'm a university professor of literature .
Coetzee is ( among his other parts ) a university professor of literature .
What is the book about ?
The newspaper profilers tended to agree ( as Robert McCrum put it in the Los Angeles Times ) that it "" asked awkward questions about the relations of blacks and whites and men and women "" .
Those in the profession and the academic workplace view Disgrace in a more parochial light .
I recall a notice , shortly after the novel was published in America , posted for an on - campus women 's discussion group .
"" Come and Talk About Disgrace "" , it said , without any mincing of words , "" The Story of a Professor who Sexually Harasses one of his Women Students and is Fired "" .
Crudely , that is indeed what the first half of Disgrace is about .
The hero , David Lurie , is 52 ( the age Arnold was , when he made his Carla sandwich ) and a middlingly successful professor of communications in a South African university .
He is twice separated , maritally , and has recently found sexual relations with prostitutes unsatisfactorily discontinuous .
He embarks on an intense affair with one of his 20-year - old students .
Scandal ensues .
Lurie declines the weasel 's way out - public confession , apology , and a rigorous course of "" Sensitivity Training "" .
Believing he has done nothing wrong , he chooses disgrace instead .
He is duly fired .
The reasons for Lurie 's stiff - neckedness ( why does n't he just swim with the politically correct tide ? ) are never clearly articulated in the novel - other than as a brooding suspicion that sensitivity training courses , codes of conduct , and sexual - harassment tribunals are not the way to solve the deep - rooted , intractable ( perhaps insoluble ) problems at issue .
I suppose most literate adults run a private poll in their head as to who they want to win the Nobel .
My vote that year would have gone to Philip Roth ( too raunchy , I suspect , for the grey men of Stockholm ) .
Roth 's major recent effort is - by general acclaim - a novel of a year later , The Human Stain ( 2000 ) .
That book 's currency will be boosted , this winter , by the release of the movie , starring Anthony Hopkins as the "" lily white "" African American professor of classics at Athena College , Coleman Silk .
Roth satirises American doublethink and moral timidity about race while taking sideswipes against the modern , morally policed campus and its totalitarian sexual - political correctness .
The novel opens with a vehement defence of Clinton 's "" inappropriate "" ( a word Roth loathes ) behaviour with ( not "" against "" ) Monica Lewinsky .
Bill should have put a huge poster outside the White House , Roth suggests , with the slogan "" A Human Being Lives Here "" .
Human beings , Roth argues , also live in American universities .
The environment is increasingly hostile to them .
The truly depressing feature of the Schwarzenegger allegations ( as reported ) is not their sophomoric crassness .
That 's bad ; but what depresses most is the intellectual and moral poverty of the response among the various involved interest groups and opinion - forming journals .
On one side ( Arnold 's ) the line was : "" high jinks "" ; harmless "" rowdiness "" ; big boys will be boys .
Only puritans and blue noses could object .
On the other side , women 's groups ( and nakedly opportunistic political opponents ) elevated Schwarzenegger 's groping to the level of assault , battery and pseudo - rape .
The bum 's a criminal and should go to jail - do not pass through Sensitivity Training , do not collect $ 200 .
Above all , do not become governor of California .
Both sides are entrenched :
neither talk through the issues any more than do the pro - life and pro - choice lobbies .
It 's war .
Last one standing wins .
It 's not a war whose theatre is merely , or even primarily , political .
The regulation of sexual conduct ; workable controls on abuse of power in relationships ; issues of privacy , equality and liberty ( even the liberty to do the wrong thing ) are - if anything - more acute in universities and colleges than anywhere else in our society .
They are such hot - button issues that , I suspect , only fiction can deal with their full human complexity .
You want the low - down on these issues ?
Ignore those unreadably legalistic statutes ; ignore the polemics ; ignore the locker - room boorishness .
Read , instead , a good campus novel - and if you 've already read Coetzee and Roth , try Blue Angel ( 2000 ) , by Francine Prose .
Believe me , the novelists know best .
The best novelists , that is ."
"On his first full day as governor - elect , Arnold Schwarzenegger pledged to cut wasteful state spending , and to refrain from making movies during his time in office .
In a news conference at a Los Angeles hotel yesterday , Mr Schwarzenegger repeated many themes from the campaign trail , including a pledge to repeal the recent tripling of the car tax and a call to "" open up the books "" in search of a solution to the state 's gaping deficit .
He also promised again not to raise taxes .
"" What we have to do is , open up the books ... do the audit and find what the waste is , "" the action hero - turned - politician said .
"" The legislators up there have gotten this message last night , that the people of California want change . ""
Mr Schwarzenegger said he had spoken with an array of leaders , including former South African president Nelson Mandela and the US president George Bush , who had promised to do "" whatever is possible to help California . ""
"" I 'm looking forward to working with him and asking him for a lot , a lot of favours , "" Mr Schwarzenegger said , adding that he hoped to meet the president when he is in the state next week on a fund - raisering visit .
Mr Schwarzenegger said he would make sure the federal government helps California with problems such as energy and water .
The "" Terminator "" star said his focus will be on the problems facing California , not Hollywood .
"" I will work as much as I can , even if it is around the clock , "" he said .
"" There will be no time for movies or anything else .
I will pay full attention to this job . ""
The Republican actor will be sworn into office by mid - November , and become California 's 38th governor .
Mr Schwarzenegger 's proposals will have to go through a legislature controlled by Democrats angry over what some of them consider a hostile takeover of the state 's top political job .
"" The last 60 days has been pretty difficult as well , but I would say there 's probably never been a governor elect who 's stepped into a situation with the challenges he 'll be confronting here in California .
But that 's why he wanted the job , "" spokesman Rob Stutzman said .
Mr Schwarzenegger takes office as the Republican party 's lone officeholder in California , a state where the congressional delegation and both houses of the legislature are solidly Democrat .
Even the voters who gave Mr Schwarzenegger a resounding victory lean towards the Democrats too , by 44 % to 35 % Republican .
"" I think he 's in for a rude awakening to the fact that he wo n't be able to get done all the things he has said because politics just does n't work that way , "" said 71-year - old Fresno resident Don Lesher , a registered Democrat who voted yes on the recall and then for Republican Tom McClintock .
"" Unfortunately , everybody is voting along party lines , rather than what 's best for the state . ""
Cruz Bustamante , Mr Schwarzenegger 's only major Democratic opponent on the recall ballot , and other Democratic officeholders were quick to say they would work with the new governor .
But they also said he needed to get to work on his plans . ""
With the campaign now behind him , governor - elect Schwarzenegger has the obligation and responsibility to lay out how he will put our fiscal house in order and repair the economy , and it 's going to be a tall order , "" said the state treasurer , Phil Angelides , while pledging to do his "" level best "" to work with the Hollywood star .
But even if lawmakers and voters grant him a honeymoon period , Mr Schwarzenegger 's toughest challenges may loom in the form of his own campaign promises .
In glowing stump speeches that often recalled his film roles , Mr Schwarzenegger told voters fed up with years of energy crises , budget deficits , rising fees and partisan gridlock that he would clean up Sacramento , bring back jobs and restore luster to the state capital .
Mr Schwarzenegger 's toughest and first challenge will be the towering $ 8bn ( £ 4.8bn ) deficit .
It will grow by a further $ 4bn if the governor - elect makes good on his promise to immediately repeal this year 's tripling of the car tax ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger 's victory in the California governor race looks set to spell the end of his Hollywood day job , at least for the length of his term in office .
But American film - goers will have to wait a little longer before they see the back of Arnie .
At present the Austrian - born muscle man still appears in a state of transition .
As he takes up residence in the governor 's mansion in Sacramento , Schwarzenegger is simultaneously playing in about 3000 cinemas across the US .
He features in a wry cameo opposite The Rock in the action blockbuster The Rundown , which is currently number one at the American box office .
Still to come is a role alongside Jackie Chan in an adaptation of Jules Verne 's Around the World in 80 Days .
Schwarzenegger plays the role of a Turkish prince and the film is set for release sometime next year .
It remains to be seen if the Chan film will be Schwarzenegger 's acting swansong .
He is still tentatively attached to both a proposed remake of the sci - fi thriller Westworld and a new Conan the Barbarian picture , though is now thought likely to bow out of both movies .
In the meantime , Schwarzenegger has been wished luck by a fellow actor turned California politician .
Speaking to journalists in London , Clint Eastwood said that Arnold "" might be great "" for California but added a note of caution .
"" It 's going to be interesting now that he 's got what he wants , "" Eastwood said .
"" Now the nightmare begins .
"" It is to be understood that the nightmare is Schwarzenegger 's , not California 's .
Eastwood famously took a brief break from movies in the 1980s to serve as mayor of the town of Carmel , so has experience of the strains of public office .
Hailing the governor 's victory yesterday , talk show host Jay Leno joked that Schwarzenegger appeared to have finally gained recognition as an actor . ""
The critics said , ' oh well , Arnold ca n't be governor , he 's an actor ' .
And of course Arnold was thrilled .
For the first time in his career , the critics are calling him an actor . """
"Clint Eastwood , famous for not saying much in his films , is tonight speaking at the historic Oxford Union debating society .
The 73-year - old Holywood legend is being interviewed by TV film critic Barry Norman .
The star of Dirty Harry and The Good , the Bad and the Ugly , who went on to have a brief career in local Californian politics , today sent a grim and characteristically terse message of congratulations to his fellow movie star - politician Arnold Schwarzenegger - "" now the nightmare begins "" .
Tonight he is due to talk about a career going back to the TV series Rawhide in the 1950s and his forthcoming film Mystic River .
Oxford Union president Marcus Walker said all 470 tickets for the members - only event sold out in minutes yesterday .
He said he was delighted Eastwood had agreed to address the society , adding : "" He is n't just going to make my day , he will make my term . ""
Eastwood 's appearance follows others by Michael Jackson , the Dalai Lama , US presidents Nixon , Carter and Reagan , and Kermit the Frog .
Other speakers at the union this term include Colonel Tim Collins , the British officer lauded by the media for his leadership in Iraq and since cleared of maltreating prisoners , farmer Tony Martin who was jailed for killing a teenage burglar and singer Charlotte Church .
Born on May 31 , 1930 , the son of a San Francisco steelworker , Eastwood began his acting career after he dropped out of a business degree to work in a variety of B - movies .
He was nominated for a best actor Oscar for 1992 's Unforgiven , and won the best director Oscar for the same film .
In 1986 he was elected as mayor of Carmel - by - the - Sea , California ."
"The Terminator became the "" governator "" in the ballroom of a hotel on the Avenue of the Stars with red , white and blue balloons cascading over an audience of ecstatic followers , bemused journalists from across the world , hot dog stands and a jazz band trying to play On the Sunny Side of the Street .
In winning the governership by a wide margin , Arnold Schwarzenegger has participated in the political equivalent of a Californian earthquake and the state was still recovering yesterday from the aftershock .
Two months ago , the man who came to fame in the 1960s as Mr Universe announced his candidacy on the late night chatshow hosted by the comedian Jay Leno .
It was Leno again who introduced the winning candidate at the Century Plaza Hotel not long after the polls had closed , showing that Governor Gray Davis had been recalled by a margin of 55 % to 45 % . ""
For the first time in his career , critics are calling him an actor , "" joked Leno , as he referred to the press coverage that had pondered how an actor who had never run for public office could morph from bodybuilder to action star to part of the body politic .
"" Everything that I have is because of California , "" the Republican told the cheering crowds . ""
Today California has given me the greatest gift of all ...
I will not fail you ,
I will not disappoint you and I will not let you down . ""
The last - minute allegations made by 16 women that the Mr Schwarzenegger had groped and harassed them and that California was about to have a new kind of "" hands - on "" governor appeared to have made little difference .
His platform was full of cheering women , not least among them his loyal wife , the television journalist Maria Shriver , and his mother - in - law , the sister of the late President Kennedy , Eunice Shriver .
Mr Schwarzenegger , who spent around $ 18mon his campaign , topped the poll to replace Mr Davis by a handsome margin .
With votes still being counted , he had around 48 % , well ahead of the Democrat lieutenant governor , Cruz Bustamante on 32 % .
The conservative Republican state senator Tom McClintock took 13 % .
Around 42 % of women backed Mr Schwarzenegger .
Of the other 132 candidates , only the Green party 's Peter Camejo made much of an impression , with 3 % of the vote .
Columnist Arianna Huffington , who withdrew from the race last week to urge a no vote on the recall , took 1 % .
Porn star Mary Carey Cook , who certainly wore the night 's most spectacular outfit , came 11th in the poll and took more than 10,000 votes , slightly fewer than porn magnate Larry Flynt who came seventh .
The former child actor Gary Coleman finished ninth .
Most of the other candidates barely registered but had none the less sent out invitations for parties at locations from Beverly Hills to San Jose .
The night was a disaster for a grey - faced Mr Davis whose once impressive political career must now be at an end .
He declared his platform at the downtown Biltmore Hotel to be a "" no cry zone "" but even this , as so much of the last months of his governorship , he could not organise successfully : his wife , Sharon , spent most of the evening in tears , being comforted by a succession of Davis supporters .
The 60-year - old Mr Davis made a gracious concession speech , pledging to assist the new man into office . ""
Let us put the chaos of the recall behind us , "" he said , retaining the same enigmatic and chilly demeanour that had been part of the reason for his downfall and mentioning wistfully his supposed accomplishment of bringing 900,000 new jobs to the state .
Mr Schwarzengger accepted the concession and chided supporters who booed mention of Mr Davis 's name .
Gone was the macho "" hasta la vista , baby "" rhetoric of the campaign and in its place was the standard promise to govern for everyone .
"" I want to be a governor for the people , "" he said while warning : "" for the people to win , politics as usual must lose . ""
Mr Bustamante , who had briefly led in the polls , has seen his bubble burst as swiftly as one of the red balloons being trampled on by Mr Schwarzenegger 's supporters on their way up the hotel escalator in the early hours of yesterday .
He made a jokey concession speech in Sacramento , telling his new boss to feel free to carry on his film career and take as much time away as possible to do so .
The star of Predator , Running Man , Red Sonja and True Lies , however , appears to have found the role he has always wanted .
How long he will be playing it , is another matter .
Before the confetti had been swept away at the Century Plaza and the tears and Merlot stains wiped clean at the Biltmore , there were mutterings about plans to get a "" recall Arnold "" movement under way .
But for the time being anyway , the Republicans and the man they have found to bring them in from the Californian political desert are on the sunny side of the street .
Recall vote
In favour : 4,217,411 ( 54.8 % ) Against : 3,488,465 ( 45.2 % )
Governor vote ( top candidates )
Arnold Schwarzenegger ( Republican ) : 3,577,278 ( 48.2 % )
Cruz Bustamante ( Democrat ) : 2,388,314 ( 32.2 % )
Tom McClintock ( Republican ) : 985,394 ( 13.3 % )
Peter Camejo ( Green Party ) : 207,845 ( 2.8 % ) (
Figures after 98.8 % of votes counted )"
"In politics , as in life , it is far easier to destroy than to create .
Destruction is a central theme in Arnold Schwarzenegger 's fantasy films .
Now , in what passes for the real world in California , the Austrian - born bodybuilder has destroyed the governorship of Gray Davis .
Characters portrayed by Mr Schwarzenegger always know who their enemies are .
But the cause for which they fight , beyond some vague notion of the greater good , is less defined .
Such is the case as this unlikely neophyte prepares for prime - time power .
California 's recall election provided a great spectacle , a Roman circus that gave the thumbs - down to the old order and raised a new champion .
It is suggested that , had they been given the chance , voters would have put the entire Sacramento legislature to the sword .
This retributive , "" throw - the - bums - out "" mood is a recurring US phenomenon .
It rarely lasts ; for who now remembers the Perotistas of 1992 ?
But it is hardly sound democratic practice to sack a man for spite , so soon after re - electing him .
As the ballroom balloons pop , the pragmatic question is whether Mr Schwarzenegger can make any difference ; or will in time become the next victim of public spleen .
Despite the clear - cut result , myth and reality may continue to collide .
For some , Mr Schwarzenegger was a classic out sider , an immigrant - made - good , an heir to the American dream .
But in truth he needed the Republican party , big business backing and $ 21 m to beat Mr Davis .
These debts will be called in in the normal way .
He promised to represent all Californians .
But the bulk of his support appears to be white and middle - class in a state where Hispanics and others are the majority .
Mr Schwarzenegger claims to respect women .
That feeling may not be entirely reciprocated .
He will have to watch his step and his hands .
Perhaps the greatest paradox is the blaming of Mr Davis alone for the state 's economic woes .
In the wake of the dotcom implosion , California is running a near 10 % deficit , its schools and public services are in decline and 6.6 % of the workforce is unemployed .
Yet the scope for any governor to turn this around by cutting spending or raising taxes is severely circumscribed by previous voter initiatives and propositions .
Among a people whose myths insist they all have a right to be rich and who live beyond their collective means , few want to face the hard and responsible choices .
In that sense , the recall was mass escapism .
Putting Arnie in charge of the world 's fifth largest economy is like making Benny Hill chancellor of the exchequer : quirky but unreal - and not very funny ."
"Three days before the story broke detailing Arnold Schwarzenegger 's alleged groping of six women , a friend who works in the movie industry asked me : "" Why does n't anyone care about Arnold 's reputation for sexual harassment ? ""
She was puzzled .
"" Everybody in the business knows about it , "" she said , noting the several cases that she was privy to , "" but it does n't seem to register .
"" Once it had made the press , did it matter ?
No .
As predicted , Schwarzenegger has been elected governor of California .
So late in the game , the revelations were easily dismissed as last - minute dirty politics , in much the same way that the eleventh - hour report of George Bush 's drunk - driving arrest never got any traction .
And with the hours running down on the pre - election clock , Schwarzenegger was quick to acknowledge that he had "" behaved badly sometimes "" and to say that what "" I thought then was playful "" he now recognised had "" offended people "" .
But who are these people ?
Who - besides the specific women who had to endure an unwelcome paw up their shirts and under their skirts - is offended ?
And why are so many not offended ?
Even before the Los Angeles Times piece , which made the allegations public , Schwarzenegger 's bad behaviour towards women had done the rounds .
Premiere magazine offered chapter and verse on his molesting tendencies two years ago , and the Oui interview , in which he bragged about nailing that babe in a gang bang , has been endlessly recycled .
None of it seems to have had any effect on the very constituency that expressed disgust over reports of Bill Clinton 's philandering : American men .
Tarred with the same sexual - harassment brush , Schwarzenegger and Clinton emerged with mirror - opposite gender gaps .
Clinton rode an ever - larger female gender advantage to election in both campaigns , while Schwarzenegger owes his lead to a lopsidedly male following .
Why the difference between the two politicians with the wandering eyes ?
Given that the former bodybuilder owes his fame to Hollywood , maybe it 's only fitting to find the answer on the silver screen , in Neil LaBute 's acute dissection of American gender pathologies ,
In the Company of Men .
The 1997 movie told the story of Chad , the gotta - be - on - top corporate striver , and the pact he coercively forges with his more sensitive and flabby co - worker , Howard , to compete for the honour of seducing , and then humiliating , a deaf woman .
Howard identifies with the woman 's plight and falls for her ; Chad , meanwhile , goes in for the kill , humiliating both the woman and Howard . ""
Never lose control , "" Chad tells him .
"" That is the total key to the universe . "" Clinton was perceived by men as having lost this control , and worse , lost it to a series of women .
He may have been the aggressor , but as a seducer he really meant to seduce , thus exposing an almost feminine sort of desire and vulnerability .
For this , he was humiliated , held up like Howard for ridicule in male eyes .
No wonder that so many women empathised with Clinton : he was essentially shamed like a fallen woman .
Schwarzenegger , on the other hand , is Chad the "" playful "" cad , going after women , sniggering frat - boy style , for the score .
Sex is n't even the prime object here : the women were manhandled , not seduced .
There is no warning , no courtship ( unless you count such come - ons as "" I 'd love to work you out "" ) ; the hand darts into their underclothes like a bolt from the blue , a pre - emptive strike . ""
Did he rape me ?
No , "" one woman said , recalling the time Schwarzenegger allegedly grabbed her breast . ""
Did he humiliate me ?
You bet he did . ""
Humiliation so often seems to be the theme in these tales of the actor 's conquests , humiliation not just of women but - perhaps more notably - of the men these women "" belong "" to .
One woman said she was groped by him when she went to the gym to watch her husband - Schwarzenegger 's bodybuilding rival - the former Mr Universe Robby Robinson .
"" What he did was uncalled for , but I could n't say nothing , "" Robinson said ; fear of exile from the bodybuilding business kept him quiet .
A similar dynamic was at work in an earlier story told in the Los Angeles Times , when the actor was said to have used the wife of Don Peters , another bodybuilding competitor , to shame her - and him .
According to the article , after the actor had bedded the woman , he picked up a phone and , claiming he was dialling his lawyer to reschedule an appointment , asked her to take the receiver .
It turned out the number he dialled was her husband 's , and while she held the phone , he yelled into it these words ( cleaned up by the newspaper 's censors ) : "" I just [ made love to ] her !
I just [ made love to ] her ! ""
As Tina Turner would say , what 's love got to do with it ?
A spokesman for the new California governor said the episode with Peters and his wife was just "" locker room humour "" .
Which explains a good deal of his appeal to male voters .
He comes out of the testosterone - ruled world of weight rooms and action movies , where women are observers and adorners , and where men find their place in the wolf pack through a well - established ordeal of humiliation .
The men who do n't make it to the top in that world still have the compensation of identifying with the one man who does , as long as they do n't identify with any of the women , as long as they do n't "" say nothing "" .
They still belong to the pack , by virtue of being male .
No matter how much sand gets kicked in their face , they can still fantasise that one day they , too , will do enough leg - lifts to rise in the ranks .
At a time of deep economic and international insecurity , the easy power of the bully boy is a siren call to the American male populace , as evidenced by Bush 's continuing allure to the very men whose interests are least served by his policies .
The locker - room game works as long as only men get to play , and only as long as they agree to play by certain rules .
One rule is that sensuality is verboten , but aggressive jocularity is not .
Humiliating women in a "" playful "" way can signal a rejection of "" the feminine "" and a reinforcement of male bonding .
That rejection of the feminine explains why , in the gubernatorial debate , the governor seemed fixated on shutting down Arianna Huffington .
When haranguing did n't work , he resorted to a veiled threat of physical humiliation , implied in the remark : "" I have a perfect part for you in Terminator 4 . ""
As much as he denied it later , it 's hard to imagine what part he had in mind except the one assigned the female robot in Terminator 3 , whose face he buried in the toilet .
Funny , right ?
Not to Huffington .
"" It 's a continuum of a lack of respect , "" she remarked to me a few days after the debate , "" from not putting a single woman on your economic team , to bullying a woman at a debate , to treating women in such a humiliating way in the course of your daily life .
"" Women 's anger about rape and harassment is exacerbated by the knowledge that their attackers are after power , not sex .
In US politics , it 's the opposite .
Harassment is deemed more acceptable if it 's not about sex but is part of a power dynamic between the boys .
The gender gap is really between those afraid of bullying and those afraid of intimacy .
Women will forgive a politician 's lapse if it at least seems motivated by a susceptibility to desire or emotion .
Men afraid of sensuality will forgive the same act ( and actor ) as long as the behaviour can be laughed off as winner - takes - all sport . ·

"Movie legend Clint Eastwood used his first visit to the Oxford Union to say Arnold Schwarzenegger would make a good governor of California .
The Dirty Harry star , received a standing ovation last night from the 600 students in the historic society 's debating chamber where he was interviewed by film critic Barry Norman .
Eastwood , 73 , was meant to be promoting his new film , the thriller Mystic River , and talking about his six - decade career as an actor and director .
But when asked about The Terminator star 's chances in his new job , he replied : "" I think Arnold Schwarzenegger is going to make a good governor . ""
He has good people around him , he had big business people giving him advice .
Maybe he will make the right decisions , and if he progresses forward I wish him the best of luck . ""
God knows California needs right now a fiscal , responsible citizen .
It ca n't get any lower . ""
Eastwood , wearing a grey suit and tie and chocolate - brown sneakers , raised laughs by repeatedly asking Mr Norman to act as his "" interpreter "" as he could not understand British accents .
There was more mirth when a student asked him if he was as good a shot with a .44 Magnum as his Dirty Harry character .
The actor replied that he could probably hit members of the press at the back of the hall .
Oxford Union president Marcus Walker said students were "" surprised "" at the actor 's support for Schwarzenegger .
He added : "" It was great .
He got a standing ovation when he arrived and when he got up to go .
The best thing was meeting the great man himself .
"" We 're all feeling very lucky . ""
Previous guests at the union include Michael Jackson , the Dalai Lama , US presidents Richard Nixon , Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan , and Kermit the Frog .
Speakers expected later this term include the hip hop artist Wyclef John and , more controversially , Tony Martin , the farmer who was jailed for shooting an intruder ."
"Australian Editorial , October 9 ""
Now we will learn if Arnold Schwarzenegger really is a man of steel , because a politician who is tough - if not necessarily stainless - is exactly what California needs ...
Governor Schwarzenegger , just like Governor Gray Davis before him , will have little political room to move as he tries to balance the books and kick - start the Californian economy ...
But , unlike Mr Davis , it looks like he might be up for the fight ...
"" Whatever he is , Mr Schwarzenegger is much more than a B - grade muscle - man actor .
While many too readily scoff at his broken English , he is a well - educated and highly successful business entrepreneur .
His political complexion - fiscally conservative but socially liberal - fits California 's fundamentally libertarian outlook .
At the least , he could be a shock to the political system that this most enterprising of states surely needs . ""
Toronto Star Editorial , October 9 "" The west coast beach party is over ...
Now comes the hangover .
Can Iron Arnie morph into Conan the Auditor , and wrestle down California 's huge gap between expected revenues and projected spending ?
Can he do it in a legislature thick with Democrats ?
In a dysfunctional state where the voters direct 80 % of taxing and spending through populist ' direct democracy ' initiatives that cut legislators out of the budget process ?
That 's the $ 38bn [ £ 23bn ] deficit question that has dogged this election . ""
Irish Independent Editorial , October 9 ""
Was the recall simply a cry for attention ?
Or was it , perhaps , that the state 's ego simply could n't take the shame of its ... budget deficit ... and had to open a trap door for Mr Davis in a squealing , foot stomping , narcissistic fit of rage ?
If so , California got what it wanted : unprecedented global media attention and the ultimate Hollywood climax of a ' thrill kill ' ...
"" California 's other psychological traits may also have contributed to Mr Schwarzenegger 's victory .
On the west coast , reinvention is part of the culture ...
Californians applaud Mr Schwarzenegger for reinventing himself because it gives them hope that they , too , can reinvent themselves ...
Californians have only ever seen him succeed , because they have only ever seen him shooting androids or aliens on a cinema screen .
Mr Davis , in contrast , has been seen to fail ...
And narcissists can not stand failure .
It gives then a nauseating whiff of their biggest fear : shame . ""
Michael Barone Daily Telegraph , October 9 "" Have Californians taken leave of their senses ?
Not at all ...
The 55 % to 45 % vote to recall Mr Davis ... was a repudiation of leftwing Democratic governance .
It shows what can happen when a leader elected for competence shows incompetence and when a leader elected as a centrist veers to the left .
There is probably a lesson there for Tony Blair and Gordon Brown . ""
There may be a lesson for Conservatives as well .
Mr Schwarzenegger is hardly a typical California Republican .
He supports abortion rights , civil unions for gays and gun control ...
Where he makes common cause with more conservative Republicans is on taxes : he more or less pledged no tax increase . ""
Alfred Gerstl and Albert Kaufmann Wall Street Journal Europe , October 9 "" Those of us from his hometown ... never had any doubt that he could win ...
First , America is the land of immigrants : where else ... could an immigrant , a former bodybuilder turned Hollywood star , become governor ?
Second ...
the word that defines Arnold is ' discipline ' ; what he sets his mind to he gets .
He would not be derailed by the lies that were told about him or by those dismissive of his abilities ...
We Austrians are not just very fond of America , we admire it , too ...
So in Graz we 're raising a toast to Arnold , our hometown boy , who now leads one of the most powerful states in our most important ally , the US . ""
Anneliese Rohrer Die Presse , Austria , October 9 ""
Mr Schwarzenegger 's election ... really is n't so unusual .
In Minnesota four years ago ... [ Jesse Ventura ] - a bodybuilder with no concrete political proposals - was carried to the governor 's office on a wave of popular support ...
"" It could be that Mr Schwarzenegger calls his friend Mr Ventura and asks for a remedy against political failure ...
[ He ] could also seek advice from another friend , George Bush Sr .
He , too , won an election with ' Read my lips , no new taxes ' - then , after a series of tax increases , lost his voters .
If both men coach Mr Schwarzenegger correctly , Californians will perhaps find that they have jumped into bed with an action - hero and woken up with a governor . ""
Washington Post Editorial , October 9 ""
While we 're on the subject , there is one problem facing the Schwarzenegger administration that might be beyond solving : the man 's name wo n't fit in newspaper headlines ...
The modern American practice has been to reduce our presidents to their initials or a very short nickname : JFK , FDR , Ike ..
Mr Schwarzenegger and his handlers unfortunately have only a brief window for producing a saleable headline persona of their own before some desperate copy editor does it for them .
We 'd suggest that they avoid movie titles and anything involving an umlaut . """
"The governor - elect of California , Arnold Schwarzenegger , is to ask President Bush for financial assistance to deal with the state 's budget crisis .
It is the first indication of how the actor 's election could have a part to play in next year 's presidential election . ""
He [ Mr Bush ] promised me that he will do everything possible to help California , so I 'm looking forward to working with him and asking for a lot - a lot - of favours , "" said Mr Schwarzenegger at a press conference held in the LA hotel where he had celebrated his victory the previous night .
Referring to the money paid by Californian voters to the US treasury , Mr Schwarzenegger added : "" They say that for every dollar we pay in tax , we get only 77 cents back , so there 's a lot of money we can get from the federal government , and also a lot of other help . ""
The Bush administration had always been resistant to pleas for help from the recalled governor , Gray Davis , but would clearly be more sympathetic to requests from a fellow Republican .
It opens up the possibility that the Bush administration will give financial concessions to the state in a bid to win it back from the Democrats at the presidential elections .
Mr Bush will visit California next week on a fundraising expedition .
He did not campaign for Mr Schwarzenegger , partly because a conservative Republican , state senator Tom McClintock , was also running .
Mr Schwarzenegger remained vague about how he would deal with a budget deficit estimated at between $ 8bn and $ 20bn ( £ 5 - 12bn ) .
He promised that there would be no increase in taxes , although he acknowledged that there would be problems in rescinding a recent car tax increase .
The levy on an average car recently rose from $ 70 to $ 210 a year , an increase triggered by a mechanism set up by the last Republican governor , Pete Wilson , but blamed by most voters on Mr Davis .
The first day since the election which saw Mr Davis recalled by 55 % of the electorate was a mixture of the sublime and the ridiculous .

He has not yet decided whether he will move to the state capital of Sacramento , although he said that he would spend much of his time there .

"Less than a week after Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected governor of California , the state has become engulfed in strike action .
Although the strikes are the result of disputes that long predated last week 's election , they are a sign of the different political forces at work in what has traditionally been one of the most radical states in the country .
Hundreds of thousands of commuters in the Los Angeles region were without their regular modes of public transport yesterday morning after mechanics from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority went on strike over health insurance .
Other unions refused to cross their picket lines , closing down bus lines , undergrounds and light rail transport .
In a separate dispute , thousands of supermarket workers have also gone on strike , setting up picket lines around more than 800 stores across the state .
They , too , are complaining about health insurance , increasingly the trigger for strikes in the state .
While Los Angeles is very much a city where people drive themselves to work , about 400,000 people use the public transport system .
Many of them come from the lowest income groups and do much of the work that keeps the city functioning .
The county supervisor , Zev Yaroslavsky , criticised the strikers , saying : "" This is a tragedy for the people of Los Angeles .
People who depend on the transit system to get to work , to get to school , will be held hostage to a series of demands that are unreasonable and unmanageable . ""
Mechanics represented by the Amalgamated Transit Union have sought a higher contribution to their health insurance scheme from their employers , arguing that the costs of healthcare have risen steeply .
The transport authority claims that it offered an increase in the employers ' contribution and agreed a pay increase of 5 % over four years .
Supermarkets , including such major stores as Albertsons , Vons , Ralphs and Pavilions , have also been affected by a big strike and lockout , the first such stoppage in 25 years .
The dispute affects 859 supermarkets and around 70,000 workers .
The United Food and Commercial Workers union said yesterday that the strike was still strong as it entered its third day .
Many of the supermarkets have hired alternative staff , but have cut the opening hours of many stores .
Drivers from the Teamsters union have refused to cross picket lines to deliver to the supermarkets and there were a series of accidents when managers tried to drive the vehicles into the loading bays .
One picket was injured when a non - union driver ran him over .
The dispute arose when the supermarket chains decided to freeze wages and cut back on pension and health benefits .
The lowest paid workers , the baggers , get about $ 7.40 ( £ 4.43 ) an hour , while the highest - paid employees , the meat - cutters , get just over $ 19 an hour .
The supermarkets say they have been affected by non - unionised chains undercutting them ."
"Where there 's smoke , there 's fire , said California 's new governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , in the final days of his campaign in response to allegations of his harassing women .
At the time , it seemed as though he was speaking metaphorically but , in retrospect , maybe he was pondering on the issue of what Californians smoke and where and what should be done about it .
This week comes news of the latest extension of the various bans on smoking in the state .
California has one of the strictest no - smoking policies in the world : no cigarettes in bars , restaurants , public buildings and some public parks .
Now a Los Angeles city council member , Jack Weiss , wants to extend the ban to LA 's beaches .
A small town , Solana Beach , down the coast near San Diego , has just voted for such a ban .
LA may follow suit .
Venice Beach , the city 's premier seaside area , remains one of the bastions of free expression in California .
It is one of the first places I take visitors to the city and indeed , if an alien were to arrive from outer space and I only had 20 minutes to show him / her / it what the world was like , I would take him / her / it for a stroll down Venice boardwalk on a weekend .
All human life is there .
Every age , race , colour , creed , religion , gender and mode of dress and transport are there .
There are also many smokers puffing away on everything that there is to be smoked .
This would be the first place to be affected by a ban .
Now on a recent visit to Palm Springs - the only place in the country where the average age of inhabitants is the same as the average Fahrenheit temperature ( 80 ) - I visited the local casino run by the Agua Caliente band of the Cahuilla Indians .
The tribal chairman , Richard Milanovich , took us on a tour of the Spa Resort Casino and one of the most striking things about it was that all the gamblers wrestling with the one - armed bandits - mainly middle - aged women - seemed to be smoking .
How could this be ?
Smokers in a public building in California ?
The casino is built on an Indian reservation and thus is sovereign territory .
The casino reckons that if people want to indulge one vice , they might as well indulge another .
Venice Beach is not , however , built on sovereign territory , so when the ban comes , smokers will either have to head out into the Pacific or quit .
In fact , this has been a big week for local smokers of all varieties .
First , we now have a cigar - smoking governor .
But could this lead to the thawing of relations with Cuba ?
Amazingly , it is still illegal to bring a Cuban cigar into the United States .
Second , we have the proposed ban on smoking on the beaches of LA .
And third , the supreme court has rebuffed the Bush administration by ruling that doctors in California and six other western states are free to recommend marijuana to their patients .
The supreme court ruling was in response to an appeal by the Bush administration against a regional court decision to uphold a doctor 's right to recommend marijuana .
This does not mean medical marijuana is legal , but offers some protection to doctors who might suggest its benefits to a patient .
President Bush flashed through the state this week to raise $ 1.8 m ( £ 1.08 m ) for his re - election campaign and to gladhand the new governor .
The non - smoking president is against medical marijuana , the new cigar - smoking governor is in favour of it .
Perhaps the solution is for the tribal areas in the state , which have come under attack from Mr Schwarzenegger for their financial donations to the Democrats , to assert their sovereign status and allow the sale of Cuban cigars and the use of medical marijuana on their land .
And then the governor could tell the president to put that in his pipe and smoke it ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger aside , opinionated Democrat Larry Flynt was probably the most colourful of the many candidates campaigning for the governorship of California .
However , not only did his official slogan , ' The smut peddler who cares ' , fail to win over the voters , it also failed to reflect his business thinking .
This is because the larger - than - life founder of the Hustler empire , which comprises more than 30 top - shelf magazines , video companies and websites , has actually been marshalling his business activities away from hardcore porn - and , more recently , towards Europe .
Flynt is preparing a lapdancing emporium in central London as part of what will eventually be a ' classy ' $ 100 million European chain of ' Larry Flynt 's Hustler Clubs ' as well as plotting an international chain of shops selling own - label clothing and lingerie .
There is also talk of casinos , record labels and television projects .
The Hustler Clubs are a joint venture between Larry Flynt Publishing Inc and entrepreneur Harry Mohney , who operates more than 60 low - rent lapdancing clubs on the outskirts of US cities under the name Déjà Vu .
According to Jimmy Flynt , Larry 's nephew , and the man spearheading the international expansion , the European clubs will be more satin than sawdust .
As in the plush £ 5 m prototype off the Champs Elysées , which opened last October , expense - account holders will be encouraged to sup pricey drinks in the company of 50 Hustler Honeys , ' girl - next - door types ' who , the company promises , will be hand - picked for their conversational skills as well as their athleticism .
Once London premises ( and licences ) are secured , other venues will follow in cities including Dublin , Berlin , Prague , Madrid and Moscow .
Launching simultaneously will be a Europe - wide chain of shops that will stock clothing , lingerie and merchandising emblazoned with the brand ' Hustler Logo Wear - Hardcore
Since ' 74 ' .
The first store is being earmarked for London and should be open within months . '
The clubs will be a lot of fun but really they will just be a way of promoting the Hustler brand outside the US , ' explains Jimmy Flynt . '
The stores will be a huge business .
We 're doing the merchandising with the company that launched Adidas .
Clothing , leather goods , colognes - the sky is the limit when you think how valuable our name is .
We are a lot hipper than Playboy . '
Not that lapdancing clubs are small beer ( see Spearmint Rhino piece above ) .
Jimmy Flynt says that the European Hustler Clubs will be similar in ambience to the Parisian one , which holds 350 people and is the largest topless bar in France , dwarfing the Paris club of Peter Stringfellow , Flynt 's other London rival .
Dimly lit and with a jazz lounge feel , the Paris venue has two bars and two dancing stages .
The dancers , who are predominantly American and British , perform on stage and mingle with customers six nights a week . '
We get many female customers in Paris .
It is certainly not sleazy .
The girls never remove their g - strings and there is no touching allowed , ' says Flynt . '
We 've been delighted with the success of that venture , which is why we 're so keen to get London up and running .
The format will vary country to country .
I imagine Berlin may be very different to Dublin , for example .
Finding suitable premises in London is proving to be the hardest part . '
Larry Flynt is convinced that the iconic Playboy , which closed most of its clubs in the early 1980s to concentrate on the cable television and home video market , sold itself short by experimenting with variety acts and ambitious cuisine .
The Hustler Clubs will stick to Flynt 's tried formula of showcasing the charms of the ' girl - next - door ' rather than what he calls the airbrushed , surgically enhanced Playboy image .
He has already opened three Hustler Clubs in the US since 2001 , in New Orleans , St Louis and San Francisco , with the latter raking in $ 3 m in its first year . '
We are not necessarily catering to a local working guy , ' Flynt admitted on the opening of his San Francisco club . '
We are primarily catering to travellers on a business account - people with money to spend .
We want to get this business out of the gutter , so to speak .
It is not about how much you can take off .
It 's how much you can bring to the entertainment . '
Jimmy Flynt refutes the suggestion that the company 's international burst is an attempt to bolster flagging revenues from the company 's stable of hardcore magazines .
In 2001 , the last year for which figures were available , Larry Flynt Publications reported sales of $ 150 m , but industry analysts suggest they could now have fallen by 20 percent .
Hustler has already begun to diversify at home .
Flynt has opened a Hustler Casino in Los Angeles and a handful of Hustler boutiques .
Jimmy Flynt says that the company is exploring the possibility of opening casinos in some European cities , including London .
Hustler has also entered the music arena , producing videos for rapper Snoop Dogg , and it has just struck a series of deals with rap artists , a sector traditionally marginalised by the mainstream music business .
Jimmy Flynt says that the company is poised to launch its own record and music video label and is developing several mainstream television projects . '
Europe , the clubs and the merchandising has nothing to do with our business needs , ' he insists . '
We just think it is important for our company to be on the world stage .
We have never done anything outside America until now
but we believe the time is right .
The name is the big draw .
It 's not only the Hustler Club , it 's the Larry Flynt Hustler Club , and there are two strong trade names there . '
He points out that Flynt 's fame exploded internationally following Milos Forman 's 1996 film The People vs Larry Flynt , which chronicled the pornographer 's First Amendment court battles and the assassination attempt that left him partially paralysed more than 20 years ago .
Jimmy Flynt says his uncle is driven in his commitment to exploit his brand and will , in his signature gold - plated wheelchair , attend the opening of every venue with his name above the door .
Which is a feat not even Schwarzenegger manages ."
"It has become the story after the story .
Two weeks after Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California , a political battle is now raging over publication of allegations that the actor had sexually harassed women over a period of 20 years .
The Los Angeles Times , the state 's most influential and biggest - selling newspaper , stands accused of ' smear tactics ' and trying to subvert the democratic process over a series of articles detailing claims from 15 women that Schwarzenegger had groped or fondled them .
The articles first appeared on 2 October - five days before voters in California went to the polls .
It was initially thought they could derail the actor 's candidacy , but in the end the claims had little impact .
Some voters viewed the stories as a politically motivated attack on his character by the man he replaces ousted Governor Gray Davis . '
This is a Davis ploy - he 's the king of dirty tricks , ' one Schwarzenegger voter said , adding : ' If anything , it made me want to vote for Arnold more . '
Schwarzenegger himself accused the Times of ' puke politics ' , even though he issued an apology for what he described as inappropriate behaviour towards some of the women quoted by the paper .
Since polling day , 1,000 readers have reportedly cancelled subscriptions to the Times and at least one advertiser is said to have pulled an ad campaign in protest at the coverage of Schwarzenegger 's behaviour .
Meanwhile , right - wing media pundits across the US have bitterly attacked the paper , variously accusing its journalists of doing the Democratic party 's dirty work , of shoddy journalism and double standards .
For the last two weeks , the many right - wing radio talkshows have been dominated by anti - Times tirades .
Rush Limbaugh , the country 's most popular radio host , told his 20 million listeners : ' They are dastardly political assassins who use ink instead of bullets to hit candidates under the cover of objective journalism . '
The Rupert Murdoch - owned Fox News - itself hardly a bastion of objectivity - has also been at the forefront of attack , accusing the Times of undermining the public 's trust in the mainstream media . '
Here 's a newspaper that pretty much does n't like Arnold Schwarzenegger , so they put this on page one five days before the election .
The reason people have less and less faith in big - time media is because they do stuff like this , ' said Bernard Goldberg , media pundit and regular guest on the station .
Hugh Hewitt , a columnist with the right - wing magazine , the Weekly Standard , accused the paper of ' agenda journalism ' .
He contrasted its pursuit of the Schwarzenegger allegations with its supposedly lukewarm approach to the allegations of sexual misconduct against former President Bill Clinton . '
The core problem is that within the elite media there is an overwhelming bias towards the Democratic party , ' he said .
This constant stream of criticism prompted the editor of the Times , John Carroll , to publish a 1,800-word article last week , headlined ' The Story Behind the Story ' , defending the paper 's coverage .
In his piece Carroll said none of the articles had been produced with the help of the Davis camp , but had been put together by a team of Times journalists , including a Pulitzer Prize winner .
The stories were newsworthy and ' solidly investigated ' , he wrote . '
Are the stories significant ?
Some think they starkly illuminate the character of a man who has been elected to the highest office in California .
Some do n't .
Our role is to serve citizens of varying views by examining the behaviour and the policies of political leaders and publishing our findings . '
One of the allegations against the Times - aired on Fox News , and repeated endlessly on talk radio and the burgeoning right - wing internet blog community - was that the paper had sat on the story for weeks , preferring to publish it in the week before the election as a ' last - minute bomb ... an October surprise ' .
Carroll dismissed this claim .
The Times story and the timing of its publication have received almost universal backing from newspaper editors . '
The timing was tough because it was so close to the election .
But you ca n't hold off on that because you would , in effect , be squelching the story , ' said Anders Gyllenhaal , editor of the Star Tribune in Minneapolis , echoing the sentiments of many newspaper executives across the US .
With the 2004 presidential election approaching , the internet is becoming ever more influential in shaping political debate in the United States , both as a means for candidates to raise money and to bypass the traditional media in order to get their message to the public . '
The electronic revolution has brought us many blessings , but it has also blind - sided us with a tidal wave of pornography . '
In a similar fashion , we are now getting a faceful of rotten journalism - journalistic pornography , actually - in which ratings are everything and truth is nothing , ' Carroll said . '
Better , I say , to be surprised by your newspaper in October than to learn in November that your newspaper has betrayed you by withholding the truth .
Regrets ?
Not one . '"
"When the Los Angeles Times published a front - page story five days before the California gubernatorial election about six women who claimed that they had been groped by Arnold Schwarzenegger , it caused outrage .
However , the outrage was directed not at the governor - to - be for his treatment of women but at the newspaper for daring to print the allegations , even though Schwarzenegger has acknowledged that some of the incidents took place and has apologised for them .
More than 1,000 people have cancelled their subscriptions to the state 's bestselling daily newspaper and commentators have lined up to berate it for running the story so close to the election .
Such has been the level of attacks on the paper that its editor , John Carroll , has gone into print to defend the decision to run the revelations .
For people not familiar with the LA Times , which has always been overshadowed by its eastern rivals , the New York Times and the Washington Post , it is a far from sensationalist paper and its stories are presented in what , by British standards , is a fairly low - key fashion .
In its politics , the paper reflects the state as centrist Democrat - although its cartoonist , Michael Ramirez , is relentlessly right - wing .
Editorially , the paper was strongly opposed to the recall of Governor Gray Davis from the start , arguing that it made a mockery of the electoral process .
There had been rumours for around two weeks that the LA Times was planning a big hit on Schwarzenegger .
When it surfaced , with six women alleging that the actor had groped them in incidents starting in the 70s and continuing to 2000 , the effect was immediate .
Initially , Schwarzenegger 's team denied the claims and said that their candidate would have no comment .
However , the actor decided to deal with them by saying that , while most of the claims were not true , there was "" no smoke without fire "" .
He had done things in the past that he had thought were "" playful "" and that he now realised were wrong , he said , and he wanted to apologise .
Over the next few days , more women , 16 in total , came forward with similar claims , many of them agreeing to be named .
I was at three Schwarzenegger rallies in different parts of the state on the day that the story broke .
The LA Times was attacked by speaker after speaker from the platform and there was fury that the story had appeared at all .
Rumours began : that the LA Times had been fed the story by Davis campaign members , that it had deliberately sat on the story until the last minute , that it had suppressed equally damaging material about Davis and how he treated his office staff .
These rumours were soon the currency of talk shows and television news discussions , so the story became whether the LA Times should have run the stories at all .
To British readers , much of this must seem odd .
The idea that it is somehow untoward to publish unflattering material - provided it is true - about a candidate because it might affect his chances of being elected seems perverse .
John Carroll claims that his paper , not Schwarzenegger , is the victim of smear tactics , and says that the rumours about the paper 's sources and motives had been spun on the internet and by television and radio talk - show hosts .
"" We are now getting a faceful of rotten journalism - journalistic pornography , actually - in which ratings are everything and truth is nothing . ""
He explained that interviewing the many women who had made allegations , and corroborating their stories , had taken all the time up to publication date and the paper had not sat on the story to place a bomb under Schwarzenegger .
Carroll says that the claims made about Davis and his staff had been investigated and did not stand up .
In fact , Scwhwarzenegger was given an easy time by almost all of the media .
He announced his bid initially on NBC 's Tonight Show to the chat - show host Jay Leno , and it was Leno who introduced the new governor at his victory rally .
Schwarzenegger and his wife , Maria Shriver , who also works for NBC , were given an hour of soft questioning by Oprah Winfrey , in which the actor was able to tell the mainly female viewers that he brings his wife her morning coffee in bed .
Even though he was the biggest campaign spender , with $ 18 m ( £ 11 m ) raised for a two - month campaign , he could not have bought that sort of publicity .
The stories that appeared in the British tabloid press about alleged love - children barely surfaced in the US .
A report suggesting that he had had a meeting with Enron during the state 's past energy crisis also received little play in California .
Almost every major daily paper in the state , including the LA Times , San Francisco Chronicle , Sacramento Bee and Oakland Tribune , urged a vote against the recall .
Their advice was ignored by a majority of the electorate , who instead followed the lead of the television and radio talk - show hosts .
It has not only been the Democrats who have learned a painful lesson during the election ."
"What is one to make of Arnold Schwarzenegger 's great triumph in California ?
It is , I think , the clinching evidence that ( in the US , at any rate ) fame has become much the most important of assets in all areas , even in the area of politics .
For Arnie 's celebrity is so great that , in his race for the governorship of America 's largest and richest state , it outweighed what might have been seen as crippling disadvantages for anyone seeking election to such a major political office .
Not only did Arnie have no political experience to speak of , but he was saddled with a reputation for Nazi sympathies and a crude , barrack - room attitude to women .
In interviews with the Los Angeles Times published a few days before the gubernatorial election , six women said they had been sexually groped and humiliated by him .
Yet he won the election by so big a margin that these things can hardly have counted against him , if indeed they counted against him at all .
The voters do n't seem to care how many breasts he may have fondled or buttocks he may have grasped .
They do n't even seem to care that he ca n't act , or that , in the words of Robin Williams , he has "" acted in plenty of movies , but spoken less dialogue than any actor , except maybe Lassie "" .
They are just held in thrall by his enormous fame .
Eight years ago , Bob Packwood , a Republican senator from Oregon , was forced to resign his seat over accusations of sexual misconduct against a large number of women .
The accusations against him were n't any worse than those levelled against Schwarzenegger , but they resulted in a major campaign to unseat him by the National Organisation for Women .
The alleged victims formed themselves into the self - important "" Packwood 29 "" and held formal dinners in Washington to raise money for their campaign against him .
In the end , the Senate Ethics Committee recommended Packwood 's expulsion from the Senate for "" a habitual pattern of aggressive , blatantly sexual advances "" .
I felt rather sorry for Packwood at the time .
He clearly suffered from a compulsion to make advances to any woman who crossed his path , but , even according to his accusers , he seems to have accepted rejection with reasonably good grace .
He made the mistake , however , of trying to undermine the Ethics Committee 's investigation by allegedly altering his diaries retrospectively .
In one disputed entry , he referred to "" 22 staff members I 'd made love to and probably 75 others I 've had passionate relationships with "" .
He told the committee that his diaries were n't to be trusted because he often lied to them and that he could n't remember most of the incidents of which he was accused because he was usually drunk at the time .
Senator Packwood , already in his 60s at the time of his resignation , is still earning a good living in Washington as a political lobbyist .
But five years ago he seriously contemplated running for office again .
He was encouraged to do so by the example of Bill Clinton , who , as president , was surviving an avalanche of sex accusations .
( That was before the Monica Lewinsky scandal , but eventually Clinton survived even that . )
The former senator wondered publicly if the political climate had changed enough for him to have a realistic chance of returning to politics .
In the end , he gave up on the idea without putting the question to the test .
So does Schwarzenegger 's success show that Americans are now more tolerant of the sexual shenanigans of their politicians ?
No .
I think it shows that behaviour
they find unacceptable in a white - haired old goat of a senator from Oregon
they consider absolutely fine - not to say quite normal - in a showbiz celebrity such as Schwarzenegger .
Admittedly , Arnie dealt with the charges against him rather more skilfully than Packwood did .
He did n't lie , and he even went so far as to admit in general terms to sexual misbehaviour by saying that "" where there is smoke , there 's fire "" , and that "" I have done things that were not right , which I thought then were playful "" .
But even if Packwood had talked in the same way , he would n't have got away with it .
He would have been punished all the same for being a boring old lech .
Arnie , on the other hand , is sprinkled with stardust .
The normal rules do not apply to him .
There is almost nothing of which he and others like him would not be excused ."
"Holes ( 117 mins , PG ) Directed by Andrew Davis ; starring Shia LaBeouf , Jon Voight , Sigourney Weaver , Tim Blake Nelson Andrew Davis is best known as a director of hard - nosed action movies starring Chuck Norris and Arnold Schwarzenegger , though he has also been associated with more fastidious material in the same area , such as A Perfect Murder , the undervalued remake of Dial M
For Murder .
He has now turned his attention to family entertainment with Holes , a move that is not as odd as it seems .
Some of the best films aimed at children have been made by tough guys , like Victor Fleming ( The Wizard of Oz ) or filmmakers with a taste for the bizarre like Nicolas Roeg ( Witches ) .
Holes is adapted by Louis Sachar from his bestselling children 's novel and resembles I Am A Fugitive From a Chain Gang written by an American descendant of the Brothers Grimm , with nods in the direction of Charles Dickens and Mark Twain .
It is a funny , occasionally scary movie about family , friendship , fate , courage and redemption with some good stories to tell and several clever twists .
The central character is the teenage Stanley Yelnats ( Shia LaBeouf ) who is wrongly accused of stealing a special pair of trainers donated to a charity sale by a black superstar in Texas .
When the police see that the family 's beat - up apartment is cluttered with old trainers , they are convinced he is a big - time thief , though , in fact , his eccentric father ( Henry Winkler ) is attempting to invent a substance that will remove the smell from sports shoes .
Given the choice between jail and Camp Green Lake , Stanley chooses the latter , only to discover it is a brutal work camp for male delinquents in the middle of a desert that , 100 years before , was the biggest lake in the state .
It transpires that the prosperous local town was cursed and the lake dried up .
In turn , Stanley 's family had a curse imposed on them by a clairvoyant , Madame Zeroni ( Eartha Kitt ) , in nineteenth - century Latvia .
The family name , the eastern European sounding Yelnats , is Stanley backwards and a male in every generation is called Stanley .
The principal occupation of Camp Green Lake is the digging of holes in parched territory menaced by rattlesnakes and the even more hideous yellow - spotted lizards , one bite from which is instantly fatal .
This seemingly pointless activity is designed to build character and turn bad boys into good boys and it is supervised by the brutal Mr Sir ( Jon Voight ) , the dim , dishonestly solicitous Dr Pendanski ( Tim Blake Nelson ) and the Warden ( Sigourney Weaver ) , the ultimate in evil stepmothers who has her own secret agenda about the hole - digging .
They are a splendidly villainous trio with Voight so far over the top that he resembles an Olympic pole - vaulter jumping a suburban hedge .
The young inmates are neatly characterised and Stanley forms a friend ship with the diminutive Zero , a silent , persecuted orphan , echoing the relationship between Smike and Nicholas Nickleby .
Together , they make a brief escape that transforms their lives and helps bring together in a magical way the three strands of the story .
The movie has a light , stylised tone that still admits of real feeling and the desert landscape and surrounding mountains are handsomely photographed by Stephen St John , a camera operator of great experience ( his work ranges from Out of Africa to Unforgiven ) who is given his first credit here as director of photography ."
"For reasons I am unable to fathom , Britain has seen a real increase in anti - American feeling of late .
Quite how anyone can harbour ill - will towards a country that votes George W Bush and Arnold Schwarzenegger into two of its most powerful elected positions and that insists on pronouncing herbs as "" erbs "" is beyond me .
One might as well be anti - Disneyland .
America is also home to one of the finest pieces of legislation ever drafted : The Freedom of Information Act .
Under the Act - which makes Britain 's equivalent look like a statutory practical joke - citizens are entitled to request copies of a vast array of government and legal documents including police reports , bankruptcy petitions , mugshots and minutes of meetings between politicians .
Just for the hell of it .
It 's fascinating and just as democracy should be : open , accountable and really , really good fun .
There 's just one problem : it 's also very addictive .
Prying into goings - on across the pond can very quickly take over your life , cost a small fortune in stamps and leave you with no time to pry into the affairs of your friends , family and other people you actually know .
Which is exactly why I love TheSmokingGun.com .
Established in 1997 , the site pores over new documents as they become available and puts scans of the most interesting ( read : titillating ) online .
Recent favourite finds include Mike Tyson 's bankruptcy filing ( he still spends $ 18,680 a month on clothes ) ; a blotchy mugshot of Noelle , niece of George W Bush ( prescription fraud no less ) and details of the FBI 's 1953 investigation into whether Groucho Marx was a Groucho Marxist ( he was n't ) .
The site also boasts all manner of other documents that the great and the good would rather keep under wraps - including , most recently , the misguidedly candid 1970s interview that nearly ended Arnie 's election hopes .
Only in America ."
"Announcing his candidacy for the governorship of California in a heavy Austrian accent , Arnold Schwarzenegger described how he had lived the American dream : ' I came here as an immigrant , and what gave me the opportunities , what made me to be here today are the open arms of Americans .
I have been received ; I have been adopted by America . '
In his autobiography and countless speeches , Colin Powell has told the heart - warming story of how he had been born the son of Jamaican immigrants in the New York slums , but climbed to high office .
He had n't forgotten others like him .
In a speech to the 1996 Republican National Convention he said : ' A nation as great and diverse as America deserves leadership that opens its arms not only to those who have already reaped the rewards of the American dream , but to those who strive and struggle each day often against daunting odds to make that dream come true .
The Hispanic immigrant who became a citizen yesterday must be as precious to us as a Mayflower descendant . '
Schwarzenegger became governor of California .
Powell might have been President , but settled for being Bush 's Secretary of State .
Whatever you think of them , they proved that it is n't a handicap to conservative American politicians to be an immigrant or the child of an immigrant .
It 's almost an advantage : proof that you have fought your way to the top ; a declaration that you know the sufferings of the masses .
If British Tories wanted to emulate the success of the American Right , then Michael Howard would have said last week : ' My father found sanctuary in Britain 60 years ago .
He was saved from the gas chambers and welcomed with opened arms .
The Kurd who is granted leave to remain must be as precious to us as the Queen ( more precious , if Mr Burrell is to be believed ) .
The Tory party will soon boast that it is living the British dream .
In Michael Howard it will have its first Prime Minister who is the son of an asylum - seeker . '
If you are holding your breath until Howard acknowledges that his very existence depends on the right to asylum , I must warn you of the dangers of suffocation .
It 's a fantasy to imagine that a politician might praise refugees and point out that he is a walking advertisement for successful assimilation .
Until the mid-1990s , Howard was very wary about discussing his roots .
A profile in the Guardian to mark his arrival as Home Secretary in May 1993 was typical of dozens of revealingly misleading pieces . '
I think he was a bit taken aback when I asked him about his family history , ' the interviewer wrote . '
Yes , ' he quoted Howard as saying , ' it was true his grandfather came from Romania .
( Pause . )
Yes , his father 's family had settled in Wales . '
And on his mother 's side ?
Howard said her family was ' also from Eastern Europe ' .
He may have made a mistake , of course , and Jewish politicians need to be alert to the danger of encouraging anti - Semitism .
For whatever reason , the mistaken line held until 1995 when a brown envelope stuffed with birth , marriage and naturalisation certificates arrived on my desk .
I guessed they had been dug up by one of Howard 's many enemies , but never discovered which one .
There was no arguing with the documents , however .
Michael Howard 's family had n't moved to Britain in his grandfather 's time .
His paternal grandfather had lived and died in Romania , where Howard 's father , Bernat Hecht , was born and raised .
He found asylum in Britain just before the Second World War .
If Bernat had stayed in Romania , there were good odds that he would have joined the 300,000 Romanian Jews who were murdered by the Nazis and local fascists .
He was lucky and so was his son by extension .
Bernat had benefited from a small relaxation of the British immigration laws .
As persecution in Europe grew in the 1930s , the Government agreed to accept asylum - seekers if they could find British citizens willing to feed and employ them .
The Landys , a prominent Jewish family in South Wales , agreed to sponsor Bernat .
In 1940 , the penniless 23-year - old married Hilda Kershion , a cousin of the Landys .
The couple had a quiet life by the brutal standards of the 1940s .
Bernat went into the Landy drapery business , and in 1941 he was blessed with a son , Michael Hecht .
In January 1948 , Bernat took the Oath of Allegiance , and changed his name from Bernat Hecht to Bernard Howard .
At a stroke of a bureaucrat 's pen Michael Hecht became Michael Howard .
Ever since the war , historians have lashed the British and other governments for imposing immigration controls which were to be death sentences for people less fortunate than Bernat Hecht .
MI5 officers had warned that Hitler was trying to boost British fascism by creating a ' Jewish problem ' in Britain .
The politicians of the day believed them .
Fear of a backlash impelled them to regulate .
It was n't all bad .
In her history of the period , Whitehall and the Jews , Louise London records small acts of kindness which saved the British Government from disgrace .
Sir Ernest Holderness , Assistant Secretary at the Aliens Department of the Home Office , ruled that refugees in Britain should not be repatriated to Germany .
Sir Samuel Hoare , Home Secretary in Neville Chamberlain 's Government , wrung his hands when he imposed controls . '
I feel a great reluctance in putting another obstacle in the way of these unfortunate people , ' he told the Cabinet .
No such delicate feelings affected Michael Howard when he was Home Secretary .
The nearest Europe came to the crimes of Nazism and communism in the 1990s were the crimes of Milosevic and Tudjman .
Howard imposed visa restrictions on Bosnians fleeing their death squads which made the finding of sanctuary in Britain legally impossible .
As the unteachable Conservative Party hauls the old beast from his cave and makes him its fifth right - wing leader on the run , these and many other memories come flooding back .
Howard was as tough on crime and civil liberties as asylum - seekers , and crammed the prisons as he played the race card .
Stephen Tumim , the Chief Inspector of Prisons in the 1990s , remembered last week that when he counselled moderation
Howard would reply ' no votes in that ' .
Derek Lewis , the Director General of the Prison Service Howard fired , caught his essence well .
Howard has ' the substance of the Cheshire Cat , the menace of Uriah Heep and the sincerity of Bob Monkhouse , ' he said .
The Tories ' opponents are rejoicing that they have been given a hate figure they can hate with a vengeance .
But the joke is as much on liberals as conservatives .
They wilfully forget that Tony Blair 's move to reactionary politics played as great a part in the creation of Michael Howard as Bernat Hecht 's decision to change the family name .
When Howard took over as Home Secretary in 1993 , Blair was already attacking the Tories from the Right on crime .
The Conservatives had to protect their right flank by moving to the extreme .
Last week Tory spin doctors acknowledged a hard truth many well - meaning Labour supporters still ca n't face when they told the Times that Howard ' may have been criticised [ in the 1990s ] for a hard line on crime and immigration , but Jack Straw and David Blunkett have not only adopted his agenda but gone further ' .
A glance at the prison population makes the point .
In 1993 it stood at 41,000 ; when Labour came to power in 1997 it was 60,000 ; last week it was 74,000 and rising .
When Tory MPs objected to the Blair Government penalising asylum - seekers with a greater viciousness than Howard had ever proposed , New Labour warned them that they were providing ' clear evidence that the Conservative Party is trying to wreck the Government 's attempts to clamp down on illegal immigration ' .
In other words , back off
or we 'll accuse you of being soft on the wogs .
The Tories duly responded by moving further to the Right .
Such has been the pattern of the last decade .
New Labour steals Tory policies ; the Tories shift to the extreme ; Blair whips his supporters into line by warning them that they risk letting in a hard - Right Conservative government if they stop voting Labour .
When Howard and Blair began their macabre contest in 1993 , I used to wonder who was the worse man : the ingrate or the opportunist .
But as the years have gone by I 've learned not to bother with trifles and found comfort in Dr Johnson 's advice that ' there is no settling the point of precedency between a louse and a flea ' ."
"The story of Arnold Schwarzenegger 's race to become governor of California is to be turned into a porn movie starring one of his fellow candidates . ""
Adult entertainment "" veteran Ron Jeremy is to star in the X - rated feature as Spooge Cruztamante - believed to be based on current deputy governor Cruz Bustamante - while muscular adult actor Lee Stone takes on the role of the suspiciously - monikered Ernie Gropenegger .
Porn star Mary Carey , who stood against Schwarzenegger in the contest to replace incumbent Gray Davis , will play herself in the film , which is being produced by Kickass pictures .
Company president Mark Kulkis said : "" It 's kind of like satirical .
Our attorney told us to use different names from those of the real candidates , but I guess it 's pretty obvious .
I think that Mr Bustamante and Mr Schwarzenegger will take it in the fun spirit in which it 's intended because we 're not being mean - spirited at all with this . ""
Schwarzenegger himself has taken a back seat from the movie business after securing the governorship last month ."
"In America , Emma Thompson has a profile very different from the one familiar to Britons .
She showed up one day out of nowhere , won an armful of Oscar nominations within a couple of years and established herself as a household name .
She even found time to play leading lady to one Arnold Schwarzenegger in Junior , still perhaps the oddest entry on her resumé .
Although her glory days as a leading lady are probably waning , she has firmly established a reputation in Hollywood as one of the great living British actresses .
Back here it 's different : she 's taken for granted now .
Perhaps it 's the inevitable result of having been around for two decades , of having belonged to a particular generation of early-1980s performers now deemed part of the entertainment establishment , and thus worthy of overthrow .
The old Young Ones/ Comic Strip / Kenneth Branagh / Fry and Laurie comedy - drama axis is well dispersed now , toiling in other fields and losing it somewhat , as one can judge from the likes of Maybe Baby and Love
Actually .
And for Thompson in particular , early successes like Tutti Frutti , which truly endeared her to British audiences , now seem lost in the past , replaced by her long and tedious association with the Branagh Shakespeare Project .
American audiences never had to suffer through her TV show Thompson , and got to know her when her full maturity and range as an actress were finally evident .
They ca n't see all the baggage - they like that faintly Thatcherite screech at the edge of her voice .
So let me for once agree with the cousins : Emma Thompson may be irritating and schoolmarmish to many Brits , but she 's still a marvellous actress , especially in a repressed register , when all the emotions are roiling her face rather than emerging from her mouth .
She does the dull ache of unexpressed feeling better than almost anyone , and in the only moving moment in Love Actually , as a wife realising her husband 's cheating on her , she does it again , in silence and in a single scene , with a beautifully judged economy of gesture the film scarcely deserves .
Send her victorious - but please , no more Peter 's Friends .
Please .
Career high
The Remains Of The Day and the unforgettable Tutti - Frutti .
Career low
How could such a smart lady ever end up in the likes of Dead Again , The Winter Guest or Junior ?
Need to know No daughter of the man who did the voices on The Magic Roundabout can be all bad .
The last word After turning down Basic Instinct : "" As far as I can see , from Sharon Stone 's love scene ... they moulded her body out of tough Plasticine .
She was shagging Michael Douglas like a donkey , and not an inch moved .
If that had been me , there would have been things flying around hitting me in the eye . """
"California will witness the conclusion of one unpredictable election campaign today - as another one gets under way .
While Arnold Schwarzenegger is installed as governor in the state capital , Sacramento , campaigning for the other big prize California has to offer - the Oscars - has started in earnest , with pundits tipping epic dramas as likely winners .
Although the results will not be announced until next year , studios are already spending and lobbying hard .
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has introduced stricter rules to limit campaigning but most studios are adept at finding ways round them .
This year 's race has been clouded by the row over who will see "" screeners "" , the videos and DVDs of contenders traditionally sent to academy members .
A compromise has been reached allowing members to receive videos as long as they do not lend them even to family members on the pain of expulsion .
The studios had aimed not to send out any screeners , citing piracy fears , but relented after claims this would damage the chances of small , independent films .
Contenders and long shots have already emerged , with Patrick Goldstein , the LA Times film critic , publishing his own odds .
He places the drama Mystic River , directed by Clint Eastwood , as favourite for best picture ( 6 - 1 ) , and the last of the Lord of the Rings trilogy , The Return of the King , at 8 - 1 .
His third is Anthony Minghella 's Cold Mountain , a £ 59 m American civil war epic with Nicole Kidman , Jude Law and Renee Zellweger .
Goldstein 's other contenders , with odds ranging from 14 - 1 to 22 - 1 , are the animated film Finding Nemo ; The House of Sand and Fog , a modern drama starring Ben Kingsley and Jennifer Connelly ; Master and Commander , a Peter Weir film with Russell Crowe based on Patrick O'Brian 's novels ; and Ed Zwick 's The Last Samurai , starring Tom Cruise .
"" It 's going to be harder this year for smaller movies , "" said Goldstein , suggesting there was a large , older constituency among the academy 's 5,816 voters who might favour traditional historical dramas .
Emmanuel Levy , the author of Oscar Fever , a history of the awards , said this year 's output represented a return of the traditional Hollywood epic . ""
Mainstream Hollywood is staging a big comeback , with high - profile , big - budget films , "" he said .
"" We are going to see the return of the epic . ""
His tips as nominees were : Master and Commander , Lord of the Rings and Mystic River .
Outside bets , said Levy , were Seabiscuit , the story of the racehorse starring Jeff Bridges ; Lost in Translation , directed by Sofia Coppola and starring Bill Murray ; and In America , the Jim Sheridan film about a family arriving in the US .
Big Fish ( Ewan MacGregor , Albert Finney ) , was also a possible , he said .
Levy suggested Peter Weir , Peter Jackson ( Lord of the Rings ) and Clint Eastwood as nominees for best director .
Bill Murray , best known for his comedy work , was a likely nominee for best actor in his role as a weary film star making a commercial in Tokyo in Lost
In Translation .
Levy said Murray would be joined by Tom Cruise , as a favourite son who had yet to win , Russell Crowe and Sean Penn , who has the lead role in Mystic River but who may scare off conservative voters with his outspoken anti - war views - some members were unhappy when Michael Moore delivered an anti - Bush speech at this year 's ceremony .
Johnny Depp ( Pirates of the Caribbean ) also has supporters .
In this category , too , Paul Giamatti has been mentioned by many critics and members as a long shot for his role as real - life comics writer , Harvey Pekar , in American Splendour .
However , the fact this is a small , low - budget film may count against him .
Michael Caine ( The Statement ) is another potential nominee .
Naomi Watts is Levy 's choice for best actress for her part in 21 Grams - in a year where there has been a shortage , again , of good lead roles for women .
Gwyneth Paltrow as Sylvia Plath in Sylvia was another possibility .
Others include Charlotte Rampling for The Swimming Pool , Helen Mirren for Calendar Girls and Diane Keaton for the still - to - be released
Something 's Got ta Give , in which she stars with Jack Nicholson and Keanu Reeves .
Charlize Theron has also been suggested for her role as serial killer Eileen Wuornos in Monster .
Peter Rainer , a critic at New York magazine and chairman of the National Society of Film Critics , said smaller films such as American Splendour might suffer from the decision by some groups of critics not to award prizes as a protest against the row over screeners .
Rainer tipped Cold Mountain , Master and Commander , Seabiscuit , and Lord of the Rings .
He said Cate Blanchett could feature as best actress for playing the murdered Irish journalist , Veronica Guerin .
Variety , which has published its own 27 contenders , concluded that "" this year , more than ever , it 's anyone 's guess "" ."
"There were all kinds of exotic vehicles whizzing through Sacramento , the state capital of California , as Arnold Schwarzenegger was installed as governor at yesterday 's ceremony .
All those white stretch limos and black Hummers and police motorcycle outriders made it clear that this was a special day in the history of the city .
One that caught the eye was a seven - metre ( 22-ft ) long moving billboard that kept circulating through the main streets as guests of the governor emerged from the various post - ceremony events with their goodie bags ( quite modest gifts - a memorial glass and a wee souvenir flag ) .
On the side of this vehicle was a Webster 's dictionary definition of "" special interest "" which was defined as "" n. a person or group seeking to influence legislative or government policy to further often narrowly defined interests ; especially lobby "" .
Arnold Schwarzenegger came to power pledged to challenge the "" special interests "" that he claimed , with some justification , had too much influence in the state .
His particular targets were the unions and the Indian gaming casinos .
His defeated Democrat predecessor , Gray Davis , who could just be spotted on the platform silently gritting his teeth , was a particular beneficiary of the prison guards ' union and the casinos .
The billboard was the baby of a group called the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights ( FTCR ) which has launched its own web site , ArnoldWatch.org , to monitor how the governor behaves politically .
The group even has a tip line for reporting special interest sightings . ""
Schwarzenegger has claimed that special interests include only labour unions and native American tribes , not large corporations and other business interests that have been his biggest boosters , "" said Carmen Balber of FTCR .
"" This governor must recognise that big business is the ultimate special interest group and Californians elected him to protect the public interest , not large corporations . ""
At the start of his campaign this summer , Schwarzenegger announced that he would be free from reliance on special interests as "" I do n't have to take money from anybody .
I have plenty of money myself .
"" As it transpired , he ended up accepting donations for a war chest that eventually reached $ 18 m ( £ 11 m ) .
His biggest donors were financial companies , real estate businesses and developers , agricultural interests , the car industry and construction companies .
What ArnoldWatch.org aspires to do is see what sorts of breaks those businesses now get .
As for tackling the special interests of the prison unions , his latest appointment to head the prison system , Roderick Hickman , was an official with the Correctional Peace Officers Association so the chances of a reduction in the prison population , currently the highest per capita outside China , seem slim .
The new site notes that the inaugural lunch was paid for by the chamber of commerce and Mr Schwarzenegger was the first candidate it had endorsed for constitutional office for more than 100 years .
This lunch , as has been noted elsewhere , contained a special selection of Austrian delicatessen meat items .
So it can be said that , for Californian Republicans , this is indeed the best of times and the wurst of times ."
"Likening himself to the new California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger recently , George Bush chose not to dwell on their shared interpretation of the Aristotelian dialectic , but joked that they had both "" married well "" .
Putting to one side the obvious notion that coupling with Esther Rantzen and Big Mo from EastEnders would have been a step up for these two , the Bush state visit throws into sharp relief what ought to be the bizarrely anachronistic concept of the political consort .
Having been obliged to give a bewilderingly pointless interview to Trevor McDonald before she set out , Laura Bush has dutifully accompanied her husband on his round of state - sponsored tedium and attended all sorts of specially planned diversions with her "" opposite number "" , Cherie Blair .
Yesterday morning she had to hurry down her breakfast and get dolled up in a power suit in order to accompany the PM 's wife to watch some schoolchildren get up a bit of Shakespeare .
To update the observation of another political spouse , Denis Thatcher : "" My dear , it 's never too early for a Xanax . ""
Write me off as a mad progressive , then , but why on earth is such emphasis still placed on the business of being a consort ?
In a genuinely modern world , Mrs Bush ( whose husband spends very few nights away from their various residences in any given year ) should be allowed to stay home , use antisocial products such as Immac , throw caution to the wind and leave a few pretzels lying about - whatever she feels like , really .
Instead , this daughter of Texas must spend today chirping in wonderment at the sweeping plains of Sedgefield .
The people are evidently held in such contempt by the world 's spin doctors that their approval is perceived to be something that can be courted by parading a wife who can smile and cock her head just so .
No sooner had Michael Howard been crowned Tory leader than a slew of comment pieces emerged , twittering that Sandra Howard would win out against Cherie Blair , apparently on the basis that she is less clever , more charming , and basically prettier .
Well , so what - bar the obvious hole that applying such commonsense nonchalance would leave in the Daily Mail 's feature pages ?
While at a certain lofty level in politics and business , a charming yet demure wife is deemed to be every season 's must - have accessory , everyone else knows that work events are more amusing when people do n't bring their partners .
The majority of the electorate do not go about the business of their daily lives insisting their partner is there for that most pathetic of weirdo - bourgeois reasons : "" appearances "" .
( "" Love , I will need you for my annual appraisal on Friday .
Going alone is just going to look wrong . "" )
Sobering as it is to find myself sympathising with Cherie Blair and Victoria Beckham in the same column , the latter barely ever attends her husband 's football matches and is amusedly proud of her total lack of interest in understanding the offside rule .
Overheard talking to David on her mobile when her husband was sent off against Argentina in the 1998 World Cup , Posh commiserated with him thus : "" I thought your hair looked nice though , babes . ""
Splendid work .
It was n't her beeswax to discuss Simeone 's tactics any more than it should be Laura Bush 's to act out the stupidly dull pageant of Helpmeet on Tour .
Perhaps the most agonising thing about playing the consort is the manner in which it requires one 's taste and judgment to be held endlessly up to scrutiny .
Each time Bush drops the dog on its head , or forgets where Spain is , or talks like a drunken Yoda , Laura can only grit her teeth and attempt to beam out telepathic waves along the time - honoured lines of "" honestly , he 's completely different when we 're on our own "" .
The only role of the wife in this situation is to humanise the politician - sort of : ""
Look - he 's normal !
He pulled - and she has stuck around .
"" We do n't even need to debunk this by bringing up Primrose Shipman to work out that no one genuinely buys this stuff .
In fact , surely we should be more alarmed that the leader of the free world needs his wife to hold his hand on a four - day business trip , and that Mrs Blair feels obligated to join in the fun as though world politics were the Basingstoke Licensed Victuallers Ball ?"
"Programmes for poor , disabled and elderly people will be the first victims of budget cuts made by Arnold Schwarzenegger as he seeks to balance the California state budget .
Proposals due to be introduced yesterday by the new governor would scale back home care for pensioners and therapy programmes for mentally and physically disabled people , and reduce the number of people entitled to food stamps .
Substantial job losses were also expected .
Mr Schwarzenegger 's repeal of the state car tax , which had trebled licence fees , was introduced as soon as he took office last week and was warmly welcomed by drivers and the car industry alike .
But it meant that a further $ 4bn ( £ 2.35bn ) had to be cut from the state 's budget , which already had a $ 10bn deficit .
The reductions now proposed are the first sign of how the governor aims to close the gap .
One cut of $ 385 m would end home cleaning , care and transport for around 75,000 elderly and disabled people , according to the draft proposal published yesterday in the LA Times .
A further $ 282 m would be saved by cutting art , music and camping trip programmes for around 626,000 Californians with mental or physical disabilities .
Another $ 200 m would be removed from recruitment programmes run by the University of California and California State University , requiring the institutions to make other unspecified cuts .
A potential $ 77 m would be saved by freezing admission to a project called Healthy Families aimed at the working poor .
Money would also be saved by reducing the number of people eligible for food stamps , which are aimed at the state 's poorest families .
Cuts would be made in the public transportation budget and another $ 19 m would be found by ending the tax benefit given to people who agree to preserve their land from development .
Some mayors have already expressed concern that the repeal of the car tax would mean that money they had sought to pay for improved police services would not be forthcoming .
"" It 's almost like a necessary pain that we have to go through , "" Kevin McCarthy , the new Republican assembly leader , told the LA Times .
"" We have had a cancer growing on our budget and to cure this we are going to have to go through the chemo . ""
Democrat assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg attacked the proposals , calling them a "" radical right "" view of the world .
The governor had promised a centrist , bipartisan approach , and has appointed a number of Democrats and independents to his team .
Mr Schwarzenegger , with the support of the state senate , has also moved to repeal a controversial law signed by the outgoing governor , Gray Davis , which allowed illegal immigrants to obtain driving licences .
He had promised to overturn the measure , which had been attacked by conservatives but welcomed by many Latino groups , and threatened to take the issue to the electorate next March if the legislature did not back him .
On the penal front , Mr Schwarzenegger has so far proved himself to be to the left of his predecessor .
He has granted parole to a murderer , something Mr Davis rarely did , and agreed to a more liberal interpretation of the parole rules .
This means fewer jail terms for non - violent offenders in technical breach of parole requirements .
The new governor has enjoyed a honeymoon with the electorate in the wake of his election - with his car tax promise seen as one of the keys to his success at the polls .

The US defence secretary scooped the Plain English Campaign 's premier Foot
In Mouth trophy for his 62-word attempt to clarify a point to a defence department meeting : "" Reports that say that something has n't happened are always interesting to me , because as we know , there are known knowns ; there are things we know we know .
We also know there are known unknowns ; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know .

One of this year 's Golden Bull awards for unclear English has uncovered a man who is an unrepentant master of mixed metaphors .
Yousef El - Deiry , UK airports manager for the charter airline JMC , writing in the airline magazine , noted that late summer was "" historically characterised by pre - maturity , both in terms of psychological wind - down and shedding of temporary staff . ""
The irony is that it is in the latter stages of a race or championship that fortunes are made or lost , and where heroes are born or die , and we should be in no doubt that ' it ai n't over until the fat lady sings ' "" , he went on . ""
The approach , which I wish to advocate to all our ground team , is to look at the last third of the season as a ' light at the end of the tunnel ' , the long sought - after jewel in the crown , remaining resolute to sprint to victory . ""
News that he had won a Golden Bull award prompted Mr El - Deiry to even fuller - throated eloquence : "" I was told the cliches in my article were as plain as the nose on my face , but it all looked like Queen 's English to me . ""
Besides , what 's a little cliche amongst colleagues?There is truth in every cliche : worse things happen at sea , when it rains it pours - and even a blind squirrel finds an acorn once in a while . """
"Millions of Latinos in California are being asked not to work , shop or attend school next Friday in protest at the new governor Arnold Schwarzenegger 's repeal this week of a bill that would have allowed illegal immigrants to obtain driving licenses .
Latino organisations are calling for support for the strike , and are warning of more to come .
In September the former governor Gray Davis hurriedly signed a bill that would have allowed illegal immigrants to get driving licences .
The move was seen as an attempt by him to win votes in his unsuccessful poll battle last month .
The vast majority of the state 's illegal immigrants are from Mexico and Central America .
Schwarzenegger campaigned strongly against the bill , which had angered conservative voters because it seemed to endorse illegal immigration .
One of his first acts after taking office was to repeal it , and he received cross - party support for the move .
Latinos account for 45 % of California 's workforce .
Many service industries are almost entirely reliant on their labour and much of the agricultural industry is also dependent on them .
The Mexican American Political Association has backed next Friday 's economic boycott .
Nativo Lopez , president of the association , said : "" This strike will be the first of many in the next few months . """
"Desperate Democrats , stunned by their recent loss of the California governorship to Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger , are now fighting a Green challenge from the left to keep the mayoralty of San Francisco .
The unexpected threat has shown up Democrats ' vulnerability from radicals as well as the moderate right , as they face next year 's presidential campaign .
Recent polls show that on Tuesday city voters may elect as mayor Matt Gonzalez , a 38-year - old city council chairman who left the Democrats for the Green party in 2000 over disgust at its centrism .
Opposing him is wealthy businessman Gavin Newsom , 36 , a city councillor and stalwart Democrat , who in this left - liberal city may look too conservative .
Democrats have been mayors of the Bay city for 30 years , but Gonzalez now leads by about seven points with 52 per cent support .
A graduate of Columbia University and Stanford University law school , Gonzalez is a former criminal court public defender .
Victory would make him the Greens ' top US office holder .
In an odd mutation of party roles , the handsome Newsom is backed by his friend , resident oil billionaire Gordon Getty , and a coalition of property owners , developers and big unions .
He has spent more than £ 1.8 million on his campaign .
Gonzalez , who does n't own a car and wears rumpled suits , favours the environment , the working poor , and regulation of developers to slow the city 's rampant gentrification .
He has spent only £ 180,000 and even uses the phrase ' working class ' - little heard in conservative America .
Paradoxically , Newsom 's glossy professionalism , pragmatism and , above all , his campaign money , are what hurt him .
After eight years of crony Democrat politics practised by mayor Willie Brown , many San Franciscans have tired of the party they loyally embraced for decades .
New arrivals to the city over the past 60 years , including gays and dotcom technocrats , often seemed to overwhelm the residual working class .
With the dotcom bust in 2000 Frisco has undergone another shift .
Whether it is enough to make Gonzalez mayor - and deliver another blow to Democratic centrism - remains to be seen ."
"The governor of California , Arnold Schwarzenegger , is being sued for libel by a stuntwoman who alleges that he groped her on a film set .
The news of the libel suit came on the same day that Mr Schwarzenegger announced he had decided not to carry out a promised investigation into the groping allegations made by 15 women in the final days of the gubernatorial election in October .
Rhonda Miller , 53 , an LA - based stuntwoman , had claimed the actor had lifted up her shirt , taken a photograph of her breasts and groped her when the two were working on Terminator 2 in 1991 .
She claimed she was groped again on the set of True Lies in 1994 .
Her claim , made in the presence of a civil rights lawyer , Gloria Allred , was one of many made in the final days of the campaign .
Shortly after the allegations were made to the media , reporters received an email from the Schwarzenegger campaign .
The email directed the media to a criminal court website and suggested they tap in the name Rhonda Miller .
The website indicated a Rhonda Miller had a criminal record for offences which included prostitution , forgery and drug dealing .
"" We have to believe that , as a lawyer , Gloria would have checked the facts and background of the individual she presented at a news conference today , "" the email said .
However , the Rhonda Miller with the record was a different person .
The stuntwoman has no criminal record , her legal team said yesterday .
Some news organisations reported that the woman making the claims had a criminal record . ""
Since this happened , I have n't been able to get a job in the entertainment industry , despite my best efforts , "" Ms Miller told a press conference .
She has been a stuntwoman for some 13 years .
The governor 's legal team dismissed the libel action as "" without merit "" .
Libel is harder to prove in the US than in the UK because even if the information is clearly false , malice or negligence must be proved .
The governor yesterday announced he had decided not to hire a private investigator to investigate the groping allegations as he had said he would .
In the closing days of the campaign , he had said he would have the claims examined , and after his election said he would hire an investigator to look into the allegations .
The state attorney general , Bill Lockyer , had briefly suggested that a phone line be set up for women to call with claims .
A spokesman said there would be no such inquiry , as "" the time has come to move on "" ."
"As political honeymoons go , it was shorter than the average Hollywood blockbuster , and twice as bloody .
Arnold Schwarzenegger , who ascended to the governorship of California last month on a wave of celebrity worship after vowing to ' terminate ' the state 's catastrophic budget problems , has faced a series of embarrassing setbacks in the past week , both political and personal .
In the law courts , the new Republican governor faces a million - dollar lawsuit from a 53-year - old woman who accused him of sexual harassment in the run - up to his election and who claims she was libelled by his campaign aides in return .
On the streets , thousands of Hispanic workers have been protesting at policies they claim will hit hard the poorer sections of society .
And finally , in the the political arena he was forced into a humiliating retreat in his first brush with the reality of life in one of America 's most liberal states . '
So much for The Terminator .
Governor Schwarzenegger will have to realise the only way he 'll get any business done in this state is to be The Conciliator , ' said one Democratic aide yesterday .
Of the three , a defeat over proposals to tackle California 's $ 38 billion budget deficit was perhaps the most damaging to Schwarzenegger 's hitherto invincible political aura .
After accusing his Democratic party opponents of being ' tax and spend addicts ' and claiming he could count on public support for his political and economic agenda , the new Governor had last week to abandon his plans to make huge cuts in public spending and accept a new budget which found favour with those he had previously decried . '
In my swearing - in speech , I called upon the legislators to put aside politics as usual and deliver a miracle for the people .
I am pleased and grateful they were able to do so , ' Schwarzenegger said yesterday , trying to put a positive spin on a deal which found little favour with his Republican allies in the state 's legislature , the majority of whom voted against the man they described less than six weeks ago as their political saviour .
Schwarzenegger pushed through the deal - which will stave off the threat of bankruptcy facing the world 's fifth largest economy - only with the help of California 's Democrats . '
Schwarzenegger may have thought he could overcome his foes by sheer force of will , wielding his personality , his celebrity and popularity with voters as powerful weapons , ' said one political analyst last night . '
He found himself in a jungle full of political forces that are largely immune to the weapons he carried . '
The budget deal was made against a backdrop of widespread public protests , not just at Schwarzenegger 's stated intention to cut back social welfare and education spending , but also against his decision to repeal a recently - passed law which would have granted driving licences to California 's illegal immigrants - a policy which had widespread support among the state 's Hispanic population .
It was not only California 's political forces that appeared immune to the new governor 's powers .
A former Hollywood stuntwoman alleged she had been slandered by the Governor 's campaign team in the run - up to last month 's vote .
Rhonda Miller was one of 16 women who came forward just days before the gubernatorial election , claiming the then candidate had sexually harassed her on a film set .
Within hours of her allegations being made public , reporters covering the election received an email from Schwarzenegger 's aides claiming that Miller had a criminal record for prostitution , forgery and drug dealing .
It turned out that the Rhonda Miller with the criminal background was not Rhonda Miller the stuntwoman . '
Since this happened I have n't been able to get a job in the entertainment industry , ' said Miller , who is seeking seven - figure damages .
The governor 's legal team dismissed the action as ' without merit ' .
Her lawsuit was made public on the same day that Schwarzenegger reneged on his pre - election promise to appoint a private investigator to look into the harassment allegations .
During the campaign Schwarzenegger acknowledged some of the claims were true and apologised for his behaviour .
Now , says a spokesman , it is time to move on ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger says he will have to put his movie career on hold while he runs the state of California .
But there may be hope .
It is still possible that he could juggle the removal of driving licences from illegal immigrants with the demands of filming Jingle All the Way 2 ; and if it 's possible , it 's surely desirable .
For those of you have n't seen 1996 's original Jingle , please allow us to explain .
Arnold plays Howard Langston , which is the kind of all - American name that does n't lose anything when pronounced in a heavy Germanic accent .
Howard Langston is all - American in other ways too : he works too hard and pulls funny faces in an attempt to amuse .
He also believes material goods to be a substitute for real love , though this is not uniquely American .
The plot of the film sees Howie ( pronounced - "" Howwwwi "" ) jump through a remarkable number of action hoops in order to give his son the one thing he wants for Christmas : a Turbo Man doll .
With a thrilling climax that involves him fighting a child inside the biggest shopping mall in the world ( Minneapolis 's Mall of America ) , Howard finally gets his Turbo Man and gives it to his kid .
His kid is overjoyed , his love is assured and , in turn , Howie 's wife avoids sleeping with the neighbourhood lecher .
If you feel bemused by the unfettered commercialism seemingly at work in this picture , then you should see the reviews on the Christian Answers site .
Yet , let 's be honest , as a depiction of gift - giving , it fits with the Hollywood model .
After all , there 's nothing more the producers of Jingle would have liked than for punters to emerge blinking from the cinema and stumble in a stupor to the nearest Turbo Man tie - in store .
For movies to use the device of gift giving as anything other than product placement is naturally a surprise , but it does happen .
Troy will probably be one of the biggest blockbusters of 2004 , and at its heart is the painstaking recreation of the Greeks ' gift to the Trojans .
Yet , as far as can currently be ascertained , there is no plan to package huge raffia - work horses with every Happy Meal .
In The Godfather , the monetary value of presents is n't as important as , say , the message behind them .
Like when a butcher offers a young Vito his choice from the meat counter , he 's not really adding up the total , rather hoping that the more meat taken , the less likely a midnight defenestration .
And when the older Vito puts a horse 's head in the bed of a Hollywood producer , he 's not really bothered about what the producer might do with it afterwards .
The use of a gift in the service of an ulterior motive is something we can probably all recognise .
Although few will have tried to appease a loved one through equine decapitation .
Indeed there is always the risk that a present will take on an unintended meaning far more potent than foreseen .
( A man might , for instance , intend the gift of an exercise bike as an opportunity for his partner to unwind , but it certainly wo n't be taken that way ) .
As a movie metaphor for such behaviour , Joe Dante 's Gremlins is seminal .
In fact it is also seminal in being the only movie with evil three - feet - high creatures who manage to invent their own wardrobe .
Where do their clothes suddenly come from ?
Does Spike , the gremlin figurehead , spend his spare seconds - when not arbitrarily destroying things - camped behind a sewing machine ?
In a premise that presumably inspired Arnold a dozen years later , Gremlins begins when stressed businessman father Randy Peltzer struggles to find his son , Billy , a gift to make up for all the hours he spends away on business .
But instead of simply buying the most heavily promoted item on TV , he thinks creatively and heads for Chinatown , where he buys a cute pet which must not be fed or watered after midnight nor , indeed , exposed to bright light .
Of course , over the length of the movie Billy does all three things , resulting in chaos , destruction and the grizzly interaction of gremlins and food blenders .
What , you ask , is the significance of this ?
Does it tell viewers that giving the gift of Gizmo but not the presence of a parent will lead to delinquency and bad mohican haircuts ?
Or is it rather that , when it comes to buying presents , thinking out of the box only leads to disaster ?
Far better to buy the Turbo Man tracksuit and pen presentation pack instead ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger , the new governor of California , last night declared a fiscal crisis and invoked emergency powers for unilateral spending cuts .
"" I was elected by the people of this state to lead .
Since the legislative leadership refuses to act , I will act without them , "" the actor - turned - politician said at a news conference .
The $ 150 m ( £ 84.7 m ) in cuts , largely in social services , will free up money for city and county governments that have lost more than $ 300 m since the Republican governor reversed an unpopular increase of the state 's car tax .
The cuts include a 0.5 % decrease in funding for the University of California and California State University systems , closing a migrant farmworker housing centre , less money for the department of motor vehicles and a $ 91 m reduction in programmes to help people on benefits to return to work .
Although some Democrats questioned the legality of Mr Schwarzenegger 's move , the Democratic state controller , Steve Westly , supported the idea .
"" Our police officers and firefighters must not be held hostage , "" Mr Westly said .
"" This is an appropriate but temporary solution .
The governor and the legislature now have six months to cut waste and solve California 's fiscal crisis .
"" Many mayors , dependent on the state money , also back the move .
Jerry Brown , the mayor of Oakland and a former Democratic presidential candidate , was one of them .
"" The legislature gave the governor the power to make the cuts and he made the move , "" Mr Brown said .
"" The risk to police and fire is not a joke , it is deadly serious . ""
The crisis was self - inflicted as one of Mr Schwarzenegger 's first moves since becoming governor was to fulfil a campaign pledge to repeal a tripling of vehicle license fees .
The increase in car tax was introduced by Mr Schwarzenegger 's unpopular Democratic predecessor , Gray Davis , who was thrown out in a recall election largely on charges of economic incompetence .
But in repealing the car tax increase , Mr Schwarzenegger has to make up for some $ 4bn in revenues the tax would have generated to pay for services such as fire and police departments and parks .
Mr Schwarzenegger has proposed that the money be made up by combining some of the $ 1.9bn in midyear cuts he has already requested with a windfall of $ 1.8bn in revenue that the state expects to receive by June as a result of the improving economy .
California 's economic woes deepened yesterday when another credit agency lowered the state 's bond rating - already the lowest of the 50 states - to just above junk bond status .
The latest downgrading will immediately add $ 55 m to the price of short - term loans the state secured to remain solvent through June .
California , which has the equivalent of the world 's eighth largest economy , faces a deficit of between $ 12bn and $ 24bn by the middle of 2005 unless the state reins in spending .
The state 's total budget for this fiscal year is $ 99bn ."
"Since his election as California 's governor in October , Arnold Schwarzenegger and his family have received gifts from a constellation of celebrities including an orchid plant from NBC News anchorman Tom Brokaw and champagne from former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura , who co - starred with Mr Schwarzenegger in the movie Predator .
Brokaw , a network news associate of Mr Schwarzenegger 's wife , Maria Shriver , received the only prime - time interview with the candidate days before the election .
The former Cheers star Rhea Perlman and her husband , Danny DeVito , who starred with Mr Schwarzenegger in the movie Twins , sent a floral bouquet , according to financial statements released this week .
More flowers came from rock singer Jon Bon Jovi , actress Tia Carrere and bodybuilding magnate Joe Weider .
Wine came from Hollywood producer Jerry Bruckheimer , Las Vegas showmen Siegfried and Roy , and Terminator 3 producers Andy Vajna and Mario Kassar .
The Tonight Show with Jay Leno , where Mr Schwarzenegger announced his intention to run , kicked in a bottle of champagne ."
"There is a story told about Hermann Maier and Arnold Schwarzenegger sitting down one night to share a bottle of schnapps .
It culminates in the skier defeating the one - time world 's strongest man in an arm wrestle .
Only those who do not know Maier or his sport find the outcome of the contest remarkable .
To everybody else the result seemed obvious .
The new governor of California merely played "" The Terminator "" in movies .
His compatriot is called "" The Hermannator "" because of stuff he has actually done on the slopes .
As Maier exits the lift and walks through the lobby of the Park Hyatt hotel in Beaver Creek , Colorado , he appears smaller than the imposing figure he cuts on skis .
In one of those plush establishments that cater to a guest 's every whim , the Austrian is , nevertheless , carrying an unwieldy gallon of isotonic drink .
From the bar recreational skiers crane their necks as word filters through of his presence .
They knew this man as the greatest racer of his generation and were in his thrall .
Now , improbably , he is in the process of becoming something much bigger than that .
The fans are marvelling anew because they know what Maier has been through to get back here .
On August 24 , 2001 , cruising home from training on his custom - made Easy Rider motorcycle , he was hit by a car .
Austrian television broke into regularly scheduled programming to break the news , and the skiing world held its breath .
On impact his right leg had almost been severed and , for a time , doctors feared they would have to amputate below the knee .
After they had picked paint chips from his wound , the surgeons eventually spent seven hours rebuilding the leg with titanium pins .
The hope was he would walk again . ""
Before the accident I was physically perfect , "" says the 31-year - old in the non - plussed tone from which he rarely deviates .
"" Now I just have a little bit of a handicap .
Sometimes it 's hard to feel properly with my leg .
The gliding sections are now particularly difficult .
"" There is no apparent limp when Maier walks but the nerves in the limb are so damaged that he can no longer tell whether his right ski is flat or on its edge as he hurtles down a mountain .
It is something akin to an athlete sprinting the 100 m with one foot numb .
And yet , in the space of eight days earlier this month , Maier won two World Cup races and finished second in another .
Those victories - a super - G at Lake Louise and a downhill at Beaver Creek - were enough to move him atop the points list for the first time in three seasons and confirm that he was finally back . ""
For me it is still not easy to discuss the accident .
In Lake Louise I was on the chair - lift going up to compete .
It was 10 minutes to the start of a race and there was a man sitting across from me .
Suddenly he asks me [ Maier adopts the animated voice of the prurient spectator ] : ' So how was it with the accident ?
How is it with the leg ?
How do you actually ski with a leg like that ? '
I had 10 minutes to the start of a race and he was asking me this .
Every time it 's the same . ""
Even though he professes not to remember anything about the crash , the arduous nature of his comeback lends itself to that kind of obsessive public interest .
Befitting somebody who recovered from a terrifying downhill spill at the Nagano Olympics to win gold in both super - G and giant slalom , Maier was back on the exercise bike within five weeks of the accident and talking about making it to the Salt Lake games .
Almost as soon as he was upright , he insisted his friends help him - leg still throbbing with pain - clamber aboard one of his fleet of motorcycles .
But what else would one expect from a man whose day job involves navigating ski runs at more than 70 mph ? ""
The first time I skied after the accident was OK , "" Maier says .
"" I did n't have so much fear because what happened to me on the street is much different from what I do on the slopes .
I did have fear about leaning back too much into the turns , though , that was a little bit of a problem for me at the start .
But I 've tried and tested it a lot since and it 's getting better and better . ""
Maier ended up watching last year 's Winter Olympics on television while scuba - diving in the Bahamas .
Even 12 months ago , when the World Cup circus last pulled into Beaver Creek , he was sitting in a friend 's bar in the alpine resort of Obertauern , cradling beers , glancing at the coverage and doubting whether he would ever ski competitively on the circuit again . ""
Last year at this time I had a lot of problems .
The right leg was still very painful and , for sure , there were a lot of times when I came very close to not making this comeback .
I started skiing around Christmas last year and , though it was a little painful , it became possible to increase training and improve my shape .
A few weeks later I started my first race in Adelboden but it was Wengen that proved something to me .
The second day there I was seventh in the downhill
and I knew then it was possible for me to ski again on a good level . ""
His third time out last January Maier won the super - G , his specialist discipline , at Kitzbuhel .
Amid the celebrations his agent 's phone rang .
It was Schwarzenegger on the line .
Like every other Austrian around the world the actor had spent the previous 18 months monitoring Maier 's rehabilitation , hoping he could come back and defy the odds .
The admiration is mutual .
"" I followed Schwarzenegger 's election campaign this year very closely .
It was very emotional for us because he is a great man and hugely popular in Austria .
He 's trying to achieve a lot
but he knows how to build a team and that is so important in what he is doing .
I would guess that 's the most important thing .
He knows a lot of people and that makes this job easier .
He was nobody when he came here to America .
He did his best and worked very , very hard to make it to this level .
I like that . ""
That Maier would admire his friend 's work ethic goes without saying because his own route to the top has been convoluted .
His parents ran a ski school in Flachau near Salzburg , where he began dabbling in the sport at the age of three .
By 14 he was enrolled in Austria 's special academy for its most promising skiers and apparently destined for great things .
One year in he was diagnosed with Osgood - Schlatter Syndrome , a knee condition common to sporty teenage boys .
The doctors recommended putting away his skis completely until his body had finished developing ; his place on the fast track was gone .
Soon he was combining a career as a bricklayer with work as an instructor .
"" I have experienced a lot of different lifestyles .
I worked hard before I had all this fun with skiing .
I know exactly how it is to work a full day and how hard it is to be a bricklayer .
Now I am my own boss and , for sure , it can be hard work to get to the podium
but it 's a very different kind of work .
I learned that lesson before and this is why I 'm trying again to get back to the podium .
I only had a few seasons because I came late to the sport and that 's really not enough . ""
Although he had always trained with the goal of skiing competitively in mind , Maier was 24 , long past the point anybody would have thought him capable of making it , when he landed a spot as a forerunner in a World Cup giant slalom held in his home town .
Wearing a borrowed snowboarder 's suit , he clocked unofficial times that would have placed him seventh and 11th in the event .
Within months he had earned a place on the World Cup circuit and in four full seasons an explosive and sometimes reckless style garnered him a host of nicknames ( Das Monster , the Racin ' Mason , the Alien , Sup - Hermann ) and enough titles to catapult him into the top five of all time victors .
Even before the accident Maier had fused his natural aggression with a more patient approach to become the most rounded competitor in the sport .
Stunning though his recent downhill victory was ( previously this had been his weakest event ) , the most remarkable thing about his comeback is that it was prefaced with yet more injuries .
Following his return to competition last winter he required further knee surgery , and then his pre - season training was interrupted by a rib problem that forced him to sit out five weeks .
Yet his physical conditioning - hours upon hours are spent on the exercise bike - is so legendary that there is already speculation that he will be a serious competitor up to and beyond the next Winter Olympics in 2006 .
"" I do n't know about that , "" Maier says .
"" First I have to have fun with skiing , that 's very important to me .
Then I will see how long I can go on .
Before I wanted everything done nearly like a machine .
I wanted to be like a machine .
Then I had this accident , this thing that made me more human .
I had a lot of success before but what has changed since the accident is that I feel no pressure at all now .
I feel no pressure because I know it 's nearly impossible to make a comeback from an accident like that .
It really is nearly impossible . ""
The important word there is nearly ."
"If he can persuade the cinema - going public to buy tickets to Red Sonja , a much - mocked action film he made in 1985 , then he can sell anything .
Today Arnold Schwarzenegger faces an even harder test : selling his first budget .
Thousands of state employees are likely to lose their jobs in the wake of predicted deep cuts in the public services .
College fees are expected to rise by between 10 % and 40 % , welfare services to the elderly to be cut and an attempt made to extract $ 1bn ( £ 550 m ) from the native American gaming casinos .
At the heart of the budget is a proposal to borrow $ 15bn in bonds , a measure that has cross - party backing .
However , this still leaves a further $ 10bn to be found and Mr Schwarzenegger has pledged no tax increases .
Last month the governor rescinded the state car tax increase as pledged in his election campaign , thus removing $ 4 bn in revenue from the state .
Mr Schwarzenegger has indicated that he will be seeking extra revenue from a number of sources .
These include the federal government from which he is seeking to recover a greater proportion of federal taxes than the state currently receives .
Leaks about the budget suggest that an increase of 10 % in fees for all college students and up to 40 % for graduate students will be sought .
A lowering of the ceiling for those eligible for financial support is likely .
Mr Schwarzenegger will spell out details of how he intends to extract more money from the native American casinos .
This week he appointed Daniel Kolkey , a former official from the last Republican administration as negotiator to try to renegotiate the amount of money paid by the casinos .
He is likely to seek around 25 % of their revenue , around $ 1bn .
Currently , casinos on sovereign native American land do not have to pay the taxes they would if they were operating in the rest of the state .
The native American casino operators - major financial backers of the defeated governor , Gray Davis - oppose the move , arguing that their status is in compensation for centuries of exploitation .
Already the governor has indicated that he will seek new revenue through a heavy increase in fees to enter and stay in state parks .
He is also increasing the cost of hunting and fishing permits but these measures will only provide a tiny proportion of the money needed .
One of the likeliest cuts is from the Healthy Families programme which gives healthcare insurance to 700,000 children of low - income workers .
It is understood that the new budget will make access to this programme more difficult .
Mr Schwarzenegger is gambling that a pro - business strategy will woo back companies that have left the state .
Some business people have claimed that the unions in California are too strong and payments such as workers ' compensation - for injured or sick employees - were too high and favoured the employee against the employer .
His plans to end the existing arrangement is a key part of the strategy .
The governor is also likely to seek to cut the state 's massive prison budget .
California has the highest per - capita prison population outside China , with 162,000 inmates costing $ 28,500 per head annually .
Already Mr Schwarzenegger has authorised a less strict parole policy so that non - violent parolees are not automatically reimprisoned for technical parole violations .
Much of the budget has been driven by the new finance director , Donna Arduin , a hardliner who has a reputation for imposing deep cuts in public services in Republican controlled states .
The governor has had to retreat on some of his spending proposals .
In December , he announced that he would be making a series of cuts in programmes used by people with mental and physical disabilities .
This led to a protest by wheelchair - users outside the state capitol in Sacramento and a subsequent reversal of the plans when the governor announced that the cuts would not be "" consistent with my record as an advocate for the developmentally disabled "" .
The California Chamber of Commerce has thrown its weight behind Mr Schwarzenegger .
Democrats have voiced doubts .
John Burton , the pro - tem president of the state , said that the only way to address the budget deficit was by taxing the very wealthy .
"" We have to make sure that poor women and children are not thrown deeper into poverty , "" he said ."
"It is time to pity ambitious over - achievers who have everything , Arena ( February ) advised .

"Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger 's approach to funding the state of California 's public universities shows all the hallmarks of Terminator .
As part of his attempt to tackle the state 's budget deficit of $ 14bn ( £ 7.8bn ) , Schwarzenegger wants to cut state funding to the University of California and California State University by at least 8 % , at the same time raising tuition fees for the state 's residents by 10 % for the next academic year [ 2004 - 05 ] .
And that 's on top of the whopping 30 % hike students have received this year .
California 's tuition hikes are unusually steep , but there are cries right across America that the funding of public universities is in crisis .
Student numbers entering higher education in the US have risen steadily since the second world war despite year - on - year increases in tuition fees - suggesting rising costs have not been deterring families from fulfilling what 's regarded as an essential part of the American dream .
But severe hikes in fees at state universities throughout the country this year have resulted in moves by some Republican congressmen to penalise those universities which keep implementing the most dramatic fee increases .
"" This is a raging debate right now in the US , "" says Jamie Merisotis , president of the Institute for Higher Education Policy , a Washington - based thinktank .
He believes more states will take Schwarzenegger 's approach to university funding . ""
He really is trying to put forth a budget balancing proposal , "" says Merisotis .
"" As we see in a lot of other states , higher education is just too tempting because you can use extra tuition to help balance the books . ""
In the current atmosphere , concerns are growing that this expensive educational marketplace is failing on access .
"" There 's real concern that we 've had tuition increasing higher than inflation for 20 years , "" says Merisotis , who cites a federal report out last year that revealed the first signs of a drop in enrolment among low - income students .
"" The average increase across the country is four times the rate of inflation . ""
The cause of the steep rises is largely down to cuts in education spending by individual states , the main sources of funding for public universities .
In fact , states have been cutting their spend on higher education for years - the inevitable outcome of decades of low taxes and a general reduction in public services , says David Ward , president of the American Council on Education , an industry group .
John Vu , aged 21 , is a fourth - year economics student at the University of California .
Describing himself as from a lower middle - class background , he receives need - based financial aid from the federal government in the form of grants , subsidised loans and a work / study placement - a job on campus that 's exempt from income tax .
"" My dad recently retired , "" says Vu .
"" He was the breadwinner because my mom did n't work .
I would n't want any parental support because my dad 's living off his pension , but I had to take out private loans because of the fee increase . ""
Vu 's smorgasbord of funding sources is not unusual ; the system of financial aid for students is complex and bureaucratic , arguably a barrier to access in itself .
"" If there is a weakness in the US system that needs fixing it is that we need a one - stop shop for financial aid , "" says Ward , who believes that , even after the current rises , tuition levels in America 's public universities are relatively low - the average being $ 4,694 .
"" You could argue that if tuition is very low and taxes are low , both lower and middle - to - upper income brackets are being subsidised . "" Rather than pushing for a reduction in fees for all , the council wants to see financial aid for low - income groups enhanced , says Ward :
"" The middle classes are the main beneficiaries of the tax system and they should just accept tuition that is moderate rather than low .
"" There 's plenty of blame going around in the current debate , and universities - specifically how their finances are managed - have not escaped criticism .
Republican Congressman Howard "" Buck "" McKeon introduced legislation last year that would penalise institutions that raised their fees by twice the rate of inflation or more , for more than two years .
The bill has not garnered much support in Congress and has been overshadowed by the focus on Iraq and the terrorist threat .
It 's being seen as an attempt to distract the funding debate away from federal spending on grants for poor students while the Bush administration prepares to renew the Higher Education Act , a process which occurs every four years .
The act expires this September , but some are predicting it will simply be extended until next year , as the presidential election campaign gets into swing and dominates the Washington agenda in the coming months .
Lyndon Johnson launched the act in the 60s to increase access for low - income students , and its cornerstone is the programme of need - based Pell grants .
In a vivid illustration of the impact of rising education costs on access , the purchasing power of Pell grants has nearly halved in the last 20 years .
Patrick Callan , president of the National Centre of Public Policy and Higher Education , says : "" In the early 80s , the Pell grant fund was $ 3bn ( £ 1.6bn ) and that would cover about 98 % of recipients ' costs .
By 2002 it had about $ 12bn ( £ 6.6bn ) and paid about 50 % of their costs . ""
Callan argues there is scope for institutions to "" tighten their belts "" and states should be pressing them to do so .
He describes higher education in the US as a "" seller 's market "" in which high quality is equated with high prices .
But Charles Reed , president of California State University , says that when faced with the "" tidal wave of students who want to go to college "" and a massive state budget deficit , raising fees was "" the only thing that we could do "" .
CSU currently has 420,000 students and it 's expecting 15,000 to 20,000 new students every year until at least 2010 , according to Reed .
CSU 's fees went up 30 % this academic year to $ 2,500 ( £ 1,400 ) a year - the first rise in a decade ; in fact , fees had gone down 10 % in 1999/2000 .
Now Reed agrees steady but gradual increases are preferable , along with more investment in access by the state .
CSU already puts a third of its fees into need - based grants and scholarships - a trend many educationalists want to expand but which Schwarzenegger plans to reduce to 20 % to make up for his cuts .
It may be ironic given the current round of fee hikes , but the most rapidly growing component of college budgets is scholarships and fellowships . ""
In public colleges where the average stu dent gets $ 2,400 in grants , about a quarter of that comes from colleges themselves , "" says Sandy Baum , a consultant to the College Board , which holds statistics on all aspects of higher education in the US .
Currently the aid is allocated mostly according to need , but Baum says awarding scholarships on the basis of merit is "" getting to be a problem and diverting the resources from the issue of access "" .
With the US Senate having passed over $ 87bn ( £ 48bn ) in emergency funding for Iraq and Afghanistan last autumn , states and universities are not anticipating new money with next year 's reauthorisation of the Higher Education Act .
No one expects it , but everyone believes it 's essential if access is to be maintained , much less improved .
Dr Carlton Brown , president of Georgia 's Savannah State University , the student population of which is 90 % African American , says : "" If this nation intends to continue to put itself forward as diverse and egalitarian then it needs to solve the problem of differential race and class access to the primary goods in society , and that starts with education . ""
Keeping Hope alive in Georgia
Even those states that were creative in their attempts to offset the rising cost of a college degree in the US are now feeling the pinch .
Ten years ago , Georgia became the first state to use lottery revenue to fund students in higher education .
Now the programme of Hope ( Helping outstanding pupils educationally ) scholarships is under threat as lottery proceeds can not keep up with the escalating cost of university and number of students entering the system .
Georgia awards Hope scholarships - worth some $ 4,000 ( £ 2,200 ) a year to cover the cost of tuition and additional university fees - to students having at least a B average when they enter university .
Funding continues as long as recipients maintain their good grades .
The scholarships were originally available only to Georgia 's students with family incomes less than $ 60,000 ( £ 33,000 ) , but the need - based element was subsequently dropped - a sticking point for some who argue that the main beneficiaries of Hope are those who can most afford college in the first place .
An annual $ 300 ( £ 160 ) book allowance for Hope recipients was cut last November , and lawmakers are now pondering how to keep Hope afloat .
Louise McBee is a Democrat representative in Georgia 's legislature , former administrator at the University of Georgia and co - chair of the committee exploring modifications to Hope to ensure its future .
She 's well aware of the criticism but feels a solely merit - based approach is an incentive to Georgia 's most talented students to do degrees in their home state - the result being the quality of universities is raised and local economies boosted by a higher - calibre pool of graduates . ""
Now 76 % of our top students stay in Georgia .
Before it was only 26 % , "" says McBee .
""
[ More affluent ] parents are saying to their children , you get the Hope and we 'll get you a car , or an apartment
or you can go to Europe next summer .
It 's a reward for hard work . ""
Despite complaints by its critics , Hope does appear to have gone some way to improving access .
State statistics show that the number of black students in the Georgia university system has increased from just under 40,000 to nearly 53,000 in the 10 years Hope has been in place .
For many African - American students , the actual possibility of going to university did not really exist before , according to Carlton Brown , president of Savannah State University , a college of 3,000 students , 90 % of whom are African - Americans .
Rueful over the lack of "" political will "" at bringing back a need - based element , Brown points to his own circumstances to illustrate his point .
"" I 'm a college president .
My total income is in excess of $ 150,000 ( £ 83,000 ) a year
so I know I can afford to send my children wherever they want to go .
My question would be : why is there a Hope scholarship for my kid if he makes a B ? """
"Boeing 's new Dominator looks more like a model aircraft than Arnold Schwarzenegger in the movie Terminator , but it is a step towards independent robots that can seek out and destroy targets on their own .
Swarms of Dominators will be released from strike aircraft .
They will drop to low level and patrol a defined kill zone for up to 48 hours .
When it identifies a target , Dominator asks its human supervisor for clearance to attack .
According to Carl Avila , director of advanced tactical missile systems , at Boeing 's Phantom Works , this go / no - go decision is the only human involvement .
The rest is automated .
Dominator is being developed under a five - year air force contract : Phantom Works is developing the concept and building the airframe , while the Air Force Research Laboratory ( AFRL ) at Eglin , Florida , is working on sensors and target recognition .
Boeing has already flown a prototype , which weighs less than 50 kg .
The operational version will have wings that unfold after launching to a 3.7m/12 ft span .
Instead of conventional controls , Dominator steers by flexing and warping its wings , an unusual arrangement but one successfully used by the Wright Flyer in 1903 .
Dominator will cruise at 120 - 150 mph at just a few thousand feet , relying on stealth for survival .
It carries three warheads , two for bombing attacks and the third for a suicide dive .
The warheads will initially be a modified version of the Skeet anti - tank weapon , which explodes and fires a slug of metal at high velocity .
There may later be a mix of warheads for different targets .
Dominators will be released in groups of three or four at high altitude by the stealthy F-22 Raptor , merging into swarms of up to 24 vehicles .
These could patrol a wide area , or a specific location such as a road or a bridge .
The swarm will be coordinated by a network gateway vehicle circling at higher altitude , probably communicating using a system like the existing Link 16 system .
This is a secure tactical radio operating at 54 Kbps , which switches randomly across more than 50 different radio frequencies .
It is hard to jam or intercept , but Link 16 is limited to line - of - sight operation , so the network gateway vehicle has to stay in visual contact .
The network gateway provides communication between the individual Dominators and also connects to the human supervisor , possibly via a satellite relay .
The swarm will act as a coordinated team instead of a group of individuals .
Other "" smart "" weapons can waste effort by attacking the same target .
In one United States Air Force test , 40 smart warheads launched at an array of target vehicles scored a total of 13 hits - spread among four vehicles .
The Dominator network will use enough warheads to engage all the targets located by the swarm , while ensuring that no two attack the same target .
The AFRL needs to meet the chal lenge of automatic sensing and target identification .
Dominator will probably have a sensor known as a Ladar or laser - based radar , using a beam of light instead of radio waves .
The shorter wavelength of light compared with radio gives much better resolution , revealing details on a scale of centimetres rather than metres .
Instead of being a featureless blob , a target vehicle can be seen in high resolution , so cars and trucks can easily be distinguished from tanks and Scud launchers .
Ladar can also measure range and build up a three - dimensional image to determine the exact size and shape of the target .
Unlike visual systems , Ladar works in complete darkness : depending on the frequency of light used , it can see through rain , fog and cloud .
Dominator will have a hierarchy of targets .
Mobile missile launchers are likely to top the list , followed by command vehicles , anti - aircraft systems , tanks and personnel carriers , with jeeps and trucks ranked lowest .
The recognition algorithms are a sensitive area , and details are scant .
A previous Boeing system used templates , which were effective but depended on seeing the target from the right angle .
The AFRL is known to be looking at "" biologically inspired algorithms "" , which use generalised rules to identify objects of interest in a cluttered scene .
Whether Dominator ever goes into service will depend on the answers to some key questions .
One is whether it will be able to survive on the modern battlefield ; another is how well Dominator can find and accurately identify targets .
At one point , insiders suggested that Dominator might work without human oversight , but Avila is emphatic that human supervision is part of the plan for the foreseeable future .
Similarly , an autonomous missile under development by Lockheed had human oversight added as a requirement after the Iraq war , possibly as a result of friendly fire incidents .
Clearly , giving the kill decision will always be a serious matter .
The supervisor will have to decide whether a targeted truck is full of soldiers or schoolchildren , or whether what looks like a command vehicle might have a red cross painted on the side .
Dominator might have the ability to find and destroy targets all on its own , but we still ca n't trust the machines for that final decision ."

"A convicted murderer awaiting execution was granted a last minute reprieve yesterday in a case that has pit California 's governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , against his celebrity friends and supporters .
The execution of Kevin Cooper , who was convicted of the 1983 murder of a family of four in California , was stayed by the US supreme court to allow DNA testing of evidence found at the crime scene .
The reprieve could hardly have come any later for Cooper .
The 46-year - old was sitting with a spiritual adviser in a room next to the execution chamber when news of the stay came through .
His arm had already been prepared for the lethal injection .
The news was announced to 300 supporters of Cooper gathered outside the gates of San Quentin state prison . ""
Thank you for letting the governor know he was wrong , "" an anti - death penalty activist , Mike Farrell , told the crowd .
But it is the presence of Cooper 's more high - profile backers that has raised the profile of his case .
The actors Sean Penn , Richard Dreyfuss and Denzel Washington have all drawn attention to Cooper 's case , and the Rev Jesse Jackson has campaigned vigorously on the issue .
"" This is part of a struggle across a nation to remove a system with flaws , "" Mr Jackson told supporters at the prison .
Earlier in the day , he had met Cooper .
But others have questioned the strategy adopted by Cooper 's defence team .
"" Cooper is different from those who 've been executed before him in this state , "" Lieut Vernell Crittenden , who supervises San Quentin 's cells and has met Cooper several times in the last week , told the Los Angeles Times . ""
Others use legal counsel to sway the judicial system .
He has actively solicited public support to do it . ""
Should Cooper be executed , it would be the 11th execution since California reinstituted the death penalty in 1978 , and the first since Governor Schwarzenegger came to office .
The state has the highest prison population in the US , and while Mr Schwarzenegger has suggested that he will investigate corruption in the prison system , it is thought that the film star - turned - Republican politician will be hardline on the death penalty .
He released a statement yesterday extending condolences to the family of the victims : "" To the survivor and families of the victims in this case , I share your frustration that closure to this chapter of your lives has been delayed .
"" The mother of one of the victims , 11-year - old Christopher Hughes , said Cooper "" knows now what it feels like to come within four hours of being executed .
Now he can sit in his cell and think about it for another 40 days "" .
The boy 's father said : "" This is like a prize fight .
We 've been knocked down but we 're not out and we 'll win eventually .
"" Cooper was convicted in 1985 of the murders of Douglas and Peggy Ryen , both 41 , their 10-year - old daughter , Jessica , and Christopher Hughes .
The Ryens ' son , Joshua , then 8 , survived a slit throat .
When the murders were committed , Cooper was on the run after escaping from prison , where he had been serving a four year sentence for burglary .
Cooper 's defence argues that the killings were committed by three murderers , and says that forensic evidence was planted by police .
The stay of execution will allow authorities to run tests on a bloody T - shirt found at the scene of the crime and a hair found in the hand of one of the victims .
Although the T - shirt has Cooper 's blood on it , his defence argues it was planted by police .
Testing will show whether a chemical used by police to preserve blood evidence is on the shirt .
If it is , argues Cooper 's legal team , it will show that the blood was placed on the T - shirt by the police after the murders .
But prosecutors are convinced they have the right man .
"" We are confident the results of future tests will not cast doubt about Cooper 's guilt , "" said a spokeswoman for the attorney general .
The supreme court judges behind the 9 - 2 decision to order a stay of execution were more outspoken .
"" Cooper is either guilty as sin or he was framed by the police , "" wrote Judge Barry Silverman .
"" There is no middle ground . """
"The California governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , has surprised political allies and foes by insisting he is not opposed to gay marriages .
Mr Schwarzenegger chose the Jay Leno television show to reveal the apparent change of heart that makes him the first major US political figure to come out in favour of gay marriages .
Under persistent questioning , he said it would be "" fine with me "" if California law was changed to permit same - sex marriages .
"" I think those issues should be left to the state , so I have no use for a constitutional amendment or change . ""
Those remarks are a pointed rebuff to George Bush 's suggestion last week that he would endorse a constitutional amendment defining marriage solely as a union between a man and a woman .
His proposals have caused uproar , with critics objecting to federal government interference in an area that has traditionally been left to the jurisdiction of individual states .
Mr Schwarzenegger 's remarks , on Monday evening , contradict his earlier pronouncements .
A week ago he denounced San Francisco 's mayor , Gavin Newsom , for issuing same - sex marriage licences , arguing that it was illegal and contradicted the constitution of the state .
He also suggested last week that the issuing of the licences could spark a deluge of city hall - inspired disobedience .
"" We can not have , all of a sudden now , mayors go and hand out licences .
In San Francisco it 's the licence for marriage of the same sex .
Maybe the next thing is another city that hands out licences for assault weapons .
And someone else hands out licences for selling drugs . ""
Although different in tone , his comments seemed to mirror those of President Bush , who has attacked what he sees as the politically inspired acts of courts in sanctioning gay marriages .
But in apparently changing his position , Mr Schwarzenegger has attempted to bolster his image as a bridge - builder between left and right , an ordinary amateur Hollywood politician who is against the partisan deadlock many blame for California 's problems .
He has distanced himself from the Republican establishment , which has been critical of the gay marriages recently in an attempt to attack the Democrats .
His u - turn has also , however , shown the Democratic establishment , which has determinedly sat on the fence over the issue , to be timid .
Mr Schwarzenegger 's comments came as he made a last attempt to persuade California voters of all persuasions to approve two crucial budget propositions , obliging the state to set a balanced budget , and authorising a $ 15bn ( £ 8bn ) bond to cover the state 's existing budget deficit .
Yesterday 's vote was held on the same day as the Super Tuesday primary elections .
He had succeeded in mobilising bipartisan support behind the proposals , uniting Democratic and Republican luminaries in support of his campaign .
And with the battle for the Democratic nomination proving lacklustre in California , despite the state offering the largest number of delegates to the party 's convention , Mr Schwarzenegger 's budget plans have provided the only point of interest for many voters ."
"The governor of California , Arnold Schwarzenegger , might have been reciting lines from his 1977 movie Pumping Iron .
"" We have a massive weight that we must lift off our state , "" he told supporters in a Santa Monica hotel on Tuesday .
"" Alone , I can not lift it .
But together we can . ""
And you did the lifting today
, you went out there and you lifted this massive weight off this state . ""
From that he segued neatly into what sounded like an extract from Conan the Barbarian .
"" We have removed the financial sword that was hanging over California 's head . ""
For once the hyperbole may have been justified .
He has passed his first test before the voters since he was elected last year , winning two votes in favour of budgetary reform .
The first authorises a $ 15bn ( £ 8bn ) bond issue to cover the budget deficit and the second compels the legislature to pass a balanced budget .
And they were seen as make - or - break tests for his election promise to lead an administration which would transcend party rivalries .
Contrary to expectations , exit polls showed that the two proposals were passed by large majorities : 61 % voting in favour of the bond issue , and 70 % in favour of the balanced budget .
Two weeks ago they were doing badly , but Mr Schwarzenegger has been on the road campaigning .
By travelling the state barnstorming and making a relentless and energetic case for his proposals , he persuaded people to change their minds , the former governor Pete Wilson said .
He was almost unopposed .
He conducted a lavishly funded campaign which bypassed state laws restricting fundraising for political measures .
It culminated in a series of television and radio advertisements which dominated the airwaves in the final days of campaigning .
But one of his critics , the state treasurer , Phil Angelides , remained critical of the two measures .
"" Balancing the budget has just begun , "" he said on Tuesday night . ""
Essentially , the governor 's approach would put all the burden of balancing the budget on the backs of children and working people . ""
Mr Schwarzenegger has also asked state legislators to approve billions of dollars of spending cuts , since the $ 15bn bond issue alone is not sufficient to cover the deficit .
But the air of triumph was hard to escape on the night .
"" I love it when the people go to the polls and flex their muscles , "" Mr Schwarzenegger said , once again reprising his former career ."
"Allegations of sexual harassment against Arnold Schwarzenegger which were made during last year 's campaign for the governorship of California resurfaced yesterday .
Rhonda Miller , a former stuntwoman who worked with Mr Schwarzenegger on two films in the 1990s , went to court in Los Angeles to ask a judge to order him to testify under oath about the allegations .
She launched a libel suit in December alleging that the governor and his advisers sought to sully her reputation following the allegations .
Mr Schwarzenegger 's lawyers say the allegations and libel suit are a "" political witch hunt "" .
The allegations concern two incidents .
The first is said to have occurred during the filming of Terminator 2 in 1991 .
Ms Miller alleges that Mr Schwarzenegger pulled up her shirt , sucked on her breasts and took a photograph of her breasts .
In 1994 , while filming True Lies , he is alleged to have grabbed her breasts .
The allegations surfaced on the eve of the election last autumn .
Ms Miller says she did not go public before then because she feared she would not be able to find work in Hollywood .
She was subsequently advised by the Screen Actors ' Guild that too much time had elapsed since the alleged offences for a formal complaint .
At the time Mr Schwarzenegger 's team issued a rebuttal by email in which they suggested that journalists look up the name Rhonda Miller on an internet database of court convictions .
Reporters found records of a Rhonda Miller with convictions for prostitution and drugs .
But it was a different Rhonda Miller .
The libel suit centres on whether Mr Schwarzenegger 's aides knew this and did not tell reporters .
Mr Scwarzenegger has said the email was sent without his consent ."
"Pumping Iron was the film that helped transform Arnold Schwarzenegger from just another middle European body builder into a celebrity , film star and ultimately the governor of California .
Now its director is hoping to repeat the trick with John Kerry , the likely Democratic presidential candidate .
Tour of Duty , directed by George Butler , will draw on the bestselling book of the same name by Douglas Brinkley .
The film , like the book , will follow the trajectory of Mr Kerry 's life , from his time with the navy in Vietnam , where he commanded a boat on the Mekong Delta , to his conversion to the cause of the peace movement and his subsequent political career .
But it is the documentary 's possible political impact that will be of most interest .
The film is to be released in September , midway between the Democratic convention in July and the presidential vote in November .
The Republican convention is set for early September in New York . ""
John Kerry has had the most interesting life of anyone in the presidential arena since Theodore Roosevelt , "" Butler told the film industry paper Variety . ""
His history as a politician is that he 's been underestimated , and that he has enormous willpower , not unlike Arnold Schwarzenegger . ""
Hostile In Pumping Iron , Schwarzenegger , the five - times Mr Olympia champion , defends his title against a young pretender , the older man psyching out the new arrival .
The drama in Tour of Duty will be played out against a background of an increasingly hostile campaign between the Republican incumbent and his Democrat opponent .
But while Pumping Iron was part vérité , part scripted , the new film will be in a more traditional documentary style , with interviews intercut with archive footage .
Butler , who started making the film last year , has recorded interviews with Mr Kerry and those who knew and were close to him in Vietnam and after his return .
Butler himself is hardly a disinterested party .

Tour of Duty is one of several films that promise to make cinema - going a tricky task for George Bush this year .
The summer blockbuster is expected to be The Day
After Tomorrow , a natural disaster movie with global warming as its starting point .
President Bush is known to be sceptical about the existence of global warming .
Fahrenheit 9/11 , Michael Moore 's follow up to the Oscar - winning Bowling For Columbine , is to be released in September .
With the tagline "" The temperature where freedom burns "" , the documentary examines the aftermath of September 11 2001 , and is expected to allege that the Bush administration exploited the attacks for its own ends .
The film comes in the wake of the commission into the anti - terrorism policy of the administration immediately before the attack .
Another hard - hitting , if more traditional , political film also due for an autumn release comes from the veteran director John Sayles .
His Silver City stars Chris Cooper as the bumbling son of an ultra - conservative political dynasty .
His lack of political ability does not seem to hinder his campaign to be elected governor of Colorado , until the discovery of a body threatens to derail his campaign and tarnish the name of his family and the special interest groups behind him .
Silver City is being distributed by Newmarket Films , the company behind The Passion of the Christ . ""
Silver City is John Sayles ' best film yet and will really shake up this political season with its spirited sense of mischief - making , "" said Bob Berney , the president of Newmarket .
The film 's co - producer , Maggie Renzi , hoped that Newmarket would provoke the same levels of interest for Silver City that it raised for The Passion . ""
John Sayles and I are thrilled to join the Newmarket juggernaut straight through to the November 2 election and beyond , "" she said .

But Maria Shriver , member of the Kennedy clan and wife of Californian governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , has gone one better .
She has produced her own range of jewellery , marking the remarkable sights that greet visitors to the state .
The Maria Shriver California Jewelry Line offers charm bracelets , cufflinks and even a money clip bearing a variety of Californian landmarks .
For prices ranging from $ 18 ( £ 10 ) to $ 170 ( £ 96 ) customers can choose from designs depicting the Golden Gate Bridge , the Hollywood sign and Yosemite National Park .
But the certain best - seller is a charm showing the first couple in all their youthful joy : a heavily airbrushed Governor Schwarzenegger beams out from the bracelet as he cuddles - or possibly grips - Ms Shriver .
"" It 's totally Maria 's doing , "" Jill Schiff , who makes the jewellery , told the San Jose Mercury News .
"" She just felt it would have a long shelf life and appeal to a lot of people .
"" The jewellery was unveiled at the opening by Ms Shriver of an exhibition entitled California 's Remarkable Women at the State History Museum in Sacramento .
Her husband , possibly angling for a price reduction , said : "" I can not think of a more remarkable woman than my own wife , Maria Shriver .
She is an inspiration to women everywhere . ""
Proceeds from sales of the jewellery will go to a fund set up to cover the costs of hosting visits by foreign dignitaries ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger 's wife is to launch a line of jewellery featuring Californian landmarks , with a portion of the proceeds going to a "" worthy cause "" .
Maria Shriver recently started wearing a charm bracelet displaying emblems of famous landmarks , including the Golden Gate bridge , the Hollywood sign and Yosemite National Park on official engagements with her governor husband .
The bracelet attracted so much attention Ms Shriver decided to sell similar jewellery and donate the profits to a worthy cause , the California State Protocol Fund , her spokeswoman , Terri Carbaugh , said .
The fund was set up so that the cost of hosting foreign dignitaries and promoting international trade and cross - cultural activities would be covered by private donations .
The Los Angeles designer Jill Schiff , a friend of Ms Shriver 's , created the handmade jewellery .
"" It 's totally Maria 's doing , "" Schiff told the San Jose Mercury News .
"" She just felt it would have a long shelf life and appeal to a lot of people .
"" The Maria Shriver California Jewellery collection was unveiled last night at the opening of the California 's Remarkable Women exhibition at the State History Museum .

About 25 % of the price of each piece goes to the fund .
Mr Schwarzenegger was elected governor of the state in a landslide victory in October 2003 ."
"For a politician , it was an unusual way to describe a budget plan .
The language was more Tinseltown than Treasury , the turn of phrase more Donald Rumsfeld than Gordon Brown .
"" I have an overall plan , "" the Californian governor Arnold Schwarzenegger told a press conference last week , as he announced parts of his budget plan for the coming financial year .
"" I 'm laying out a nice script , a nice James Cameron script , with a great , great ending in the end . ""
The ending , when it came the following day , betrayed all the strengths and several of the weaknesses of the fledgling "" Governator "" .
"" The people are tired of the annual slam - fest in the Capitol , "" said Mr Schwarzenegger , referring to the often protracted debate over the budget that takes place every year in the state capital of Sacramento .
As in his election campaign , he managed to appeal directly to individuals .
He banged heads together and used the full wattage of his celebrity appeal to get reluctant legislators to drop their customary objections and cave in to deals that they might more soberly have resisted .
Most impressively , at least in the minds of the voters , he managed to deliver a balanced budget , on time , and with no new taxes ; a rare achievement in Californian politics .
But the glare of his smile could not remove the doubts about the long - term prospects for the health of a state that proclaims itself the world 's fifth - largest economy .
The governor has cut individual deals with groups that might be expected to oppose his plans .
Thus opposition to a cut in university funding of hundreds of millions of dollars was bought off by the promise that universities would gain in future years .
Similar deals were made with local government , which accepted a $ 1.3bn cut in return for a constitutional amendment banning further reductions ; and schoolteachers , who agreed to a $ 2bn cut .
Such deals have allowed Mr Schwarzenegger to outflank his opponents .
"" It 's actually been a brilliant strategy for him , "" the Democratic state assembly member Joe Canciamilla told the Los Angeles Times .
"" He is picking off the natural constituencies that normally oppose this kind of budget . ""
But , as many budget analysts were keen to point out , by promising no cuts in the future , the governor is only delaying his problems .
His most vocal critic is the state treasurer , Phil Angelides , tipped as a likely rival at the next gubernatorial election , due in 2006 .
"" These are the very kind of actions that got this state into deep fiscal trouble , "" he said .
"" This is a Bush - like approach to the deficit , which is to push every problem into the future . ""
Mr Angelides was equally vocal a month ago on the subject of the Mr Schwarzenegger deficit bond , which aims to raise $ 15bn to cover California 's budget deficit .
It is hard to see how Mr Schwarzenegger will get out of his fiscal fix without raising taxes .
When last month he gently floated the possibility that taxes might need to rise sooner or later , he had his first taste of political vulnerability as his Republican supporters started to distance themselves from such a measure .
The discussion was swiftly dropped .
Also gone from the budget proposals were plans to cut funding for those with certain disabilities , and to reduce the number of poor children and people with Aids who were entitled to state healthcare .
In what is more of a political than a fiscal triumph , Mr Schwarzenegger has succeeded in overcoming the perceived stasis of government .
But he has not yet overcome the chronic long - term financial problems facing California ."
"For years it has been the king of the American road - the bane of environmentalists and the joy of those wanting the biggest , baddest car on the highway .
Yet now sales of the Hummer , made famous by Arnold Schwarzenegger , are skidding to a halt . '
The H2 has seen its day come and go .
It does not seem to make sense any more , ' said Wes Brown , a car industry analyst at Iceology , a market research firm .
The Hummer , a civilian version of the US army 's Humvee vehicle , does 11 miles to the gallon , but is so large that it falls outside most fuel economy regulations . '
We need to buy cars more suitable for the environment .
The Hummer is not one of those , ' a Greenpeace spokesman said .
Part of the reason for the falling sales is a steep rise in the price of petrol .
Buyers have turned to the Toyota Prius , a petrol - electric hybrid that does more than 50mpg .
But the Hummer is n't dead yet .
Makers General Motors plan a smaller H3 model , which will use less fuel , and it is even developing a version with hybrid power ."
"Home to the world 's first nationalised film industry and first journal of film , Hungary is now setting its sights on becoming the Hollywood of the new Europe .
The Hungarian producer Andy Vajna , who has been jointly responsible for a number of Hollywood blockbusters , announced in Budapest that he was building the world 's biggest film studio on a disused military base south - west of the city .
Mr Vajna improved the bank balances of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone by producing the Rambo movies and Terminator 3 .
Now he hopes to restore Hungary 's long pedigree in the film industry and steal the thunder of east European film rivals such as Prague and Bucharest by building studios on a 10-hectare ( 26-acre ) site .

Korda , who was born Sandor Kellner on the Great Hungarian Plain in 1893 , left Hungary at the age of 26 , never to return , and eventually settled in England .
Mr Vajna told journalists he was teaming up with a Budapest shopping centre magnate to build the studios at the cost of £ 100 m on the disused base at Etyek , less than an hour from the city .
The Hungarian government is seeking to revive the film industry by offering tax breaks .
That , combined with cheap and skilled labour in a country that has just joined the EU , is expected to boost its chances of attracting Hollywood productions . ""

"Why Arnold Matters :
The Rise of a Cultural Icon by Michael Blitz and Louise Krasniewicz 302pp , Basic Books , £ 14.99
After Arnold Schwarzenegger 's election victory in California , no one wants to be caught under - estimating the power of celebrity .
But there 's a danger of over - estimating it , and of over - simplifying it , too .
Why Arnold Matters purports to explore "" the constellation called Arnold Schwarzenegger - a constellation of activity , philosophy , iconography , and influence "" .
The authors surf through the virtual universe , awestruck by the immensity of this "" constellation "" , perpetually astonished at finding references to Schwarzenegger or his movies cropping up wherever they look .
Though disquieted by the protean phenomenon they 're observing , they ca n't stop gawping at it . ""
How do we talk about this without being mystical ? "" asks Louise Krasniewicz .
"" There is a kind of magic going on here , "" agrees Michael Blitz .
The authors hail from academia , but in entering the palace of popular culture , they appear to have checked their analytic rigour at the door .
Page after page is littered with hyperbole . ""
American culture has invited Arnold to reach into almost every sector of our society "" ; "" In America today , the construction of identity has an undeniable dependence on the metaphors that we generate using Arnold Schwarzenegger "" ; "" He lives inside each of us every day and all the time "" ; "" Every time someone says ' Hasta la vista , baby ' or ' I 'll be back ' he or she is both echoing and reinforcing Arnold 's uniquely influential sculpting of the language . ""
In documenting "" Arnold 's remarkable omnipresence in the culture "" , the authors make no attempt to weigh sources or to assess depth and resonance ; all that 's done is to register "" presence "" .
An advertising slogan , a chat - show joke , a bad pun in an academic treatise , an election result - no distinctions are drawn and no real connections are forged .
Much of the book reads as though it was compiled by an undiscriminating search engine .
Type in "" Arnold "" and see what comes up .
No comparisons .
No context .
No history .
Just the ever - expanding constellation .
After cataloguing dozens of examples of people declaring that "" So - and - so is the Arnold Schwarzenegger of such - and - such "" they conclude that this coinage is ubiquitous because "" [ Arnold ] himself is the Arnold Schwarzenegger of metaphors "" .
They do n't consider the possibility that so many writers resort to "" Arnold "" as a metaphor for bigness or domination mainly because they ca n't be bothered ( and are n't encouraged ) to think up anything fresher .
Gazing in wonder at our daily discourse , the authors routinely mistake clichés for portentous signifiers .
Although Blitz and Krasniewicz claim there 's a global fascination with Schwarzenegger , the lens through which they view him remains a narrowly American one .
Arnold , they tell us , is "" the American essence "" , "" our premier cultural prototype "" and "" the essence of the American dream "" .
They find Schwarzenegger 's version of that dream disturbing .
His "" model of fitness "" is "" consistent with the all - American view of the value of the big , strong , non - disruptive , centrist , very white , very male , very heterosexual citizen "" - a view they consider a sad falling off from "" the original concept of the American dream "" .
But as with much American criticism of American popular culture , there 's an America - shaped hole at the heart of the analysis .
For the authors , the California election was a "" wrestling ring , a pseudo - drama "" in which , inevitably , the bigger metaphor wins . ""
For that moment in history , America was Arnold and Arnold was America . ""
But they make little effort to examine that moment , its background or its likely consequences .
"" There are no politics in the sense that political scientists would recognise . ""
Indeed , "" politics as usual was now targeted for termination "" .
That was certainly how Schwarzenegger and his backers wanted voters to view the contest , but in fact "" politics as usual "" was anything but absent from California 's extraordinary gubernatorial race .
Schwarzenegger has been a committed Republican and free marketeer since the days of Richard Nixon .
It was precisely because of that political record that he proved a suitable candidate for the interests that backed his campaign to the tune of $ 26 m - real estate developers , agri - business , corporate executives , industry associations .
These interests have moulded politics in California for generations .
They were behind the seminal suburban tax revolt of the 1970s , a model for the tax - cutting , government - bashing , rich man 's populism that Schwarzenegger deployed so successfully .
The authors of Why Arnold Matters paint a picture of a public culture entirely overwhelmed by the phenomenon that is Arnold , but a closer look at the election reveals division , resistance and contradiction .
Only 17 % of black voters backed Schwarzenegger and only 31 % of Hispanics .
The authors declare airily that "" no one was really longing for Arnold to say anything concrete about any issue "" - but 63 % of voters told exit pollsters that Schwarzenegger "" did not address the issues in enough detail "" ; 47 % did not think that California could solve its budget crisis without raising taxes ( which was what Schwarzenegger implied he could do ) ; 44 % had an "" unfavourable opinion "" of him ; and while 53 % of voters with household incomes of between $ 75,000 and $ 100,000 supported Schwarzenegger , he was backed by only 35 % of those with household incomes between $ 15,000 and $ 30,000 .
His 3.7 million voters represented an impressive 49 % of a relatively high turnout , but they are only 27 % of the state 's registered voters , 17 % of its eligible voters and 14 % of its voting - age population .
As governor , Schwarzenegger has pursued precisely the policies to be expected of a big - business Republican .
He 's cut back a driver 's licence tax while seeking reductions in social programmes .
His answer to the state 's energy crisis is another dose of the deregulation that caused the system 's collapse in 2001 .
And he 's taken a stand against gay marriage .
The California election displayed a volatile mix of political and social polarisation with mass disaffection - features that now seem to characterise US politics as a whole .
Yes , Schwarzenegger 's victory demonstrated the power of celebrity , but it did so in the specific context of a revolt against incumbency of global dimensions ( see , for example , the recent Indian elections ) .
This revolt takes both left and right populist forms , and sometimes both at once ( which , I suspect , is why celebrities make useful lightning rods for it ) .
It is now commonplace for wealthy and powerful individuals to seek votes as outsiders , as challengers of a corrupt political establishment .
Here Schwarzenegger was following a well - beaten path .
By dissolving politics into popular culture , by treating the former as an extension of the latter , the authors of this book discard the tools necessary to illuminate their complex relationship .
Worse yet , they obscure the realities of power .
Schwarzenegger the human being , the actor and the politician are all rendered invisible by Arnold the free - floating metaphor .
Blitz and Krasniewicz warn the literal - minded that "" it may be a mistake to try to distinguish ' real ' life from Arnold 's life ' in the movies ' "" .
As time passes , I suspect more Californians will come to disagree with them on that .

"Jerry Bailey was one of just two protesters who turned out at a shopping mall on Sunday to put the other side of the argument dominating Californian politics . ""
He 's the girlie man , "" said Mr Bailey , holding a drawing of state governor Arnold Schwarzenegger wearing a bikini .
"" I passed him in the Capitol a couple of weeks ago and he had on more makeup than an anchorman . ""
Girlie men were propelled into the political spotlight by the macho movie star turned Californian governor on Saturday when he addressed an audience to explain why the state had gone more than two weeks without a budget .
Democratic legislators , he charged , were obstructing the passage of the $ 103bn ( £ 55bn ) budget because they were beholden to "" special interests :
the unions , the trial lawyers ...
I call them girlie men . ""
The jibe , like so many of Schwarzenegger 's more memorable political lines , is the product of his showbiz career .
A regular skit on the television programme Saturday Night Live featured two comedians as bulging bodybuilders complete with spoof Austrian accents who derided those without the correct musculature as wimps and "" girlie men "" .
The humour , however , did not translate politically .
"" It uses an image that is associated with gay men in an insulting way , and it was supposed to be an insult , "" said state senator Sheila Kuehl .
"" That 's very troubling that he would use such a homophobic way of trying to put down legislative leadership . ""
Another Democrat , assemblyman Mark Leno , like Ms Kuehl a member of the legislature 's gay , bisexual and transgender caucus , said the comment was "" as misogynist as it is anti - gay ...
To disparage a group of law abiding tax paying citizens is just wrong . ""
Although he did not use the line again at the weekend , the governor was unrepentant .
"" It 's a forceful way of making the point to regular Californians that legislators are wimps when they let special interests push them around , "" said his director of communications , Rob Stutzman ."
"Since coming to power as governor of California last year Arnold Schwarzenegger has seemed invincible .
Opponents were pulverised in the election , critics have been seduced , indolent legislators have had their skulls cracked together by the last action hero .
The popularity of the movie star turned republican politician and his larger - than - life political style - his favourite meeting spot is a tent erected outside his Sacramento office to allow him to puff on cigars in defiance of the building 's smoking ban - suggested that he could fulfil his promise to do away with the internecine fighting of politics as usual .
But all that has come unstuck with his first real political test since being elected governor .
Despite his pledges to foster a non - partisan spirit in the state capital , Sacramento , and to make local government work more efficiently , Schwarzenegger has been unable to win approval for his $ 103bn state budget .
As California limps into its third week without a budget Schwarzenegger turned his ire on the Democrat politicians he accuses of holding up the budget , accusing them of working for "" special interests : the unions , the trial lawyers I call them girlie men .
They should get back to the table , and they should finish the budget .
""
Even the governator 's Republican colleagues have been heard to mutter that Schwarzenegger has turned out to be just like all the other politicians : ineffectual , beholden to interest groups , and outmanoeuvred by the in - built inertia of the political process .
Late last week the governor pledged to "" fight like a warrior "" to pass his budget and derided his opponents for creating chaos through their partisanship .
"" There is chaos here , "" he told a press conference .
"" There is no budget . ""
Terminate
Over the weekend he was out campaigning , dispensing with his customary talk of bipartisanship to lambast the Democrats for stalling the budget and threatening to target intransigent Democrat politicians with the full force of his celebrity .
"" I was the Terminator on the screen , "" he told one group of mainly teenagers at the California Pizza Kitchen in Long Beach , south of Los Angeles .
"" I 'm going to terminate the big problems in Sacramento right now in real life . ""
The Democratic leader of the California senate , John Bruton , a veteran Californian politician , criticised Schwarzenegger for grandstanding .
"" There 's nothing new happening here that has n't happened with every governor that I can remember around budget time , "" he told the Los Angeles Times . ""
And he should either have known that or should get used to it or just realise that he was elected governor and to my knowledge
- I have n't checked it out - may not have been elected God . ""
The problems began some time between the announcement of Schwarzenegger 's budget plan in mid - May and the start of the new financial year on July 1 .
That he had made much of the importance of not missing the deadline in his election campaign , lambasting the administration of his predecessor and state legislators for leaving the state budgetless , added to the irony of the situation .
The day before the deadline he had even gone as far as to assert that "" there is a whole new mood in Sacramento .
Business as usual - politics as usual - is out of the window . ""
But according to those familiar with the budget negotiations , the governor let things drift between May and the end of June , assuming that his popularity and his implicit threat to go over the heads of state legislators and appeal directly to the voters would suffice to pass his budget .
The reality was somewhat different as negotiations became stymied in the opposition of Democrats and Republicans .
"" This is déjà vu all over again , "" Republican Assemblyman Keith Richman told the LA Times . ""
Last year Democrats refused to make spending reductions because they were concerned about people dying in the street .
And Republicans refused to raise taxes .
So what did we do ?
We borrowed $ 18 billion and rolled the problem over another year .
Now Democrats are unwilling to make spending reductions and Republicans are unwilling to raise taxes and fees .
It 's the same .
It does have to change . ""
Faced with continuing wrangling in the state capital and the impasse over his budget last weekend Schwarzenegger did what he does best : he took to the road .
But the road was a short one - it took him as far as a diner on the outskirts of Sacramento , where he surprised brunchers by appearing in their midst , media in tow , to tell them that he was still the "" Kindergarten Cop "" and that the state legislature consisted of "" 120 children "" .
The remark did n't go down well with his Sacramento colleagues .
"" That may help build his persona , "" Fabian Nuñez , the Democratic speaker of the senate told the LA Times .
"" It may be helpful to the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie when they do that .
But it does n't help solve the budget .
"" The governor continued to campaign but the brakes of political procedure stopped the celebrity politician 's juggernaut .
John Bruton dismissed the campaigning .
"" That is part of the governor 's gestalt , "" he said .
"" He likes the crowd and he likes to go out .
And that is fine with me .
Gestalt .
You can look it up .
It 's a German word meaning gestalt . ""
One adviser to the previous , Democratic , governor told the San Francisco Examiner that Schwarzenegger "" was overly optimistic that a charming personality ... and sheer force of will could get the legislature to do its job .
He 's been larger than life until now .
This has exposed him as a mere mortal , "" said Garry South .
Obsession
That the Californian budget has been passed late in nine of the past 11 years serves both to underline the difficulty of the task facing Schwarzenegger and to emphasise his vulnerability in fiscally challenging times .
He has not been helped by the political elite 's obsession with this November 's presidential election .
With budgetary standstill a contentious political issue in California , both Republicans and Democrats are keen to paint each other as the stick - in - the - muds responsible for any delay .
Neither side has been above engineering a delay to make it look as if their opponents are delaying the budget .
But more seriously his personal style has come in for concerted criticism from all sides as a series of deals he made in the run up to the budget have started to unravel .
He has been accused of double - dealing , of telling both left and right what they want to hear .
To Schwarzenegger this is the political art of compromise , and he has trumpeted compromise as sensible non - partisan political practice .
But to others the approach reeks of weakness and a lack of principle . ""
Schwarzenegger loves to be loved , "" wrote the West Coast columnist Dan Walters in the influential daily Sacramento Bee . ""
The corollary to that preoccupation with popularity is Schwarzenegger 's evident penchant for telling people what they want to hear , rather than what they need to hear .
"" In Hollywood , everyone is always pitching something ( Schwarzenegger calls himself a ' salesman by nature ' ) , everyone always talks in positive superlatives , and no one believes anyone . ""
But the disarming politics - for - beginners mood may have changed .
"" We 'll see how [ legislators ] respond after tasting steel for 72 hours , "" said Rob Stitzman , Schwarzenegger 's communications director .
The impassioned tone of the governor 's words over the past few days , by turns tetchy and humorous , suggest that he has woken up to the grubby reality of politics ."

Another morale enhancer came with yesterday 's news that Liverpool city council has granted the club planning per mission to build a new 60,000-seat stadium in Stanley Park , only 300 yards away from their current home .
Forced to endure the indignity of qualifying , Manchester United , also on a summer tour of the US , were relieved to avoid potentially awkward ties against Benfica or Basle in yesterday 's lunchtime draw at Uefa 's headquarters in Nyon , Switzerland .
Like Liverpool , United have been drawn away in the first leg to be played on August 11 - a week after they discover the identity of their opponents .
Ferguson 's players were involved in the qualifying round two years ago when they lost 1 - 0 away to the Hungarians of Zalaegerszeg but redeemed themselves with a 5 - 0 triumph in the Old Trafford return .
That experience has persuaded Dinamo Bucharest - who hold a 1 - 0 first - leg lead over their second - round rivals from Zilina - to plan staging the anticipated tie with United at their cramped , 15,000-capacity Stefan cel Mare stadium in the Romanian capital .
"" We know what happened to United in Hungary and our stadium is our only advantage against one of the biggest teams on the planet , "" said Adrian Alexandrescu , director of football at the former club of the secret police .
Anxious that Uefa would permit travelling fans only 500 tickets for the Bucharest leg , Ken Ramsden , United 's secretary , intends to lobby the European governing body for an increased allocation of 2,000 .
Rangers will face Neftchi Baku of Azerbaijan or CSKA Moscow .
Alex McLeish , the Rangers manager , has admitted that Neftchi represent an unknown quantity but fully expects to meet the Russians , whom he anticipates providing "" very tough "" opposition .
The Uefa Cup second qualifying round sees Dunfermline , in European competition for the first time since their Fairs Cup foray in 1969 - 70 , paired with FH Hafnafjordur of Iceland .
Davie Hay 's side travel towards the Arctic Circle for the first leg but may have to play the return at McDiarmid Park in Perth , home of St Johnstone , because their East End Park home having an artificial surface .

First legs Aug 12 ; second legs Aug 26 ."
"California is proposing to add solar power to a million homes in the next 10 years , paid for by a surcharge on consumers ' electricity bills equivalent to about 15 pence a month .
The plan , proposed by the California Environmental Protection Agency , is intended to honour the election pledge of California 's governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , to ensure that half of all new homes in the state are built with solar power facilities .
The surcharge would raise $ 1bn ( about £ 570 m ) in 10 years for the installation programme , with the state using the money to give rebates to home builders who install solar panels on new homes , and incentives for installing panels on existing homes .
Homeowners would be able to reduce their power bills and even make money by selling "" unused "" solar energy back to the electricity companies via two - way meters .
Electricity supply has been a sensitive issue since the energy crisis in 2001 when a free - for - all market pushed prices so low that many stations shut down leaving the state short of power .
Solar power became more popular .
According to the California Energy Commission , while 900 photovoltaic systems were installed from 1998 to 2000 , more than 11,000 systems were installed from 2001 to mid-2003 .
Most of the changes were to older properties , but with 150,000 new homes being built a year the greater potential led to a campaign for the state to use its "" greatest asset "" - sunshine .
Tim Coyle , the senior vice president of the California Building Industry Association , said home solar systems could cost from $ 17,000 - 20,000 ( £ 9,714-£11,428 ) and did not pay for themselves as customers would typically pay $ 120 a month to repay the purchase price and receive about $ 70 in "" returns "" in electricity generated .
The state grants are designed to make the system pay .
According to the draft plan , presented by Drew Bohan , under - secretary of the EPA , "" each month the homeowner will save more money in reduced electricity charges than [ will be paid ] on the solar mortgage "" .
Environmental groups said the proposal would once again make California a national trendsetter while encouraging technical advances that would help make solar power more affordable worldwide .
"" This is so far ahead of any other state ... there 's no comparison , "" said Bernadette Del Chiaro , of the group Environment California .
Together the solar installations would equal 36 new , 75-megawatt natural gas plants , and would avoid adding 50 m tons of carbon dioxide into the air annually .
The incentives should be enough to get solar panels on 40 % of new homes by 2010 and 50 % by 2013 , the EPA believes .
The hope is that 1.2 m homes will be producing solar energy by 2017 , including 884,000 new and 313,000 older houses .
Mr Schwarzenegger has yet to endorse the plan publicly , despite the election pledge .
Ms Del Chiaro said : "" My hope is the governor comes out even stronger by increasing the incentives and mandates , and applying the requirements to commercial buildings as well .
There 's no guarantee builders will take advantage of incentives , though [ they ] are great . ""
Many environmentalists are also backing solar home incentives .
A solar incentive bill , approved by the California senate , would require 15 % of new homes to be built with solar panels by 2006 .
By 2010 more than half of homes would come equipped with solar systems .
The building industry opposes the solar homes bill but said the proposed incentives were the way to encourage technological and economic improvements that will make widespread use of solar energy more realistic ."
"' We are not a sparring partner , we can put up a real fight , ' says a bullish Grazer AK captain Anton Ehmann ahead of the third - round Champions League qualifier against Liverpool at the Arnold Schwarzenegger stadium in Graz on Tuesday .
GAK won the 2003 - 04 Austrian league by a point and came close to eliminating Ajax at this stage last season , drawing 1 - 1 at home before going down 2 - 1 in Amsterdam after extra - time .
Their main danger comes from 27-year - old striker Roland Kollmann , who scored 27 goals in 32 league games last season .
He is likely to be partnered by new signing Alen Skoro , who has arrived from Olimpija Laibach with a reputation for being the ' Bosnian David Beckham ' .
Tall and commanding Croat defender Mario Tokic will try to subdue Michael Owen , Djibril Cissé and Milan Baros , and he is also one of the team 's most dangerous players at set pieces .
Coach Walter Schachner usually plays a tight 4 - 4 - 2 formation , and his team will aim to deny the Liverpool players any space . '
We have a 30-per - cent chance of qualifying , ' he says .
Manchester United take on Dinamo Bucharest after the Romanian champions beat Zilina in the second qualifying round .
Dinamo have lost two of their best players , defender Cosmin Barcauan and midfielder Dan Alexa , over the summer and will be without their number - one goalkeeper , Cristian Munteanu , after he was sent off against Zilina .
The club signed eight players in the summer , but only veteran midfielder Liviu Ciubotariu has any experience of playing in western Europe .
He will lead a three - man defence that can only be described as sluggish .
Last season 's top scorer , Ionel Danciulescu , is still at the club and fellow - forward
Claudiu Niculescu is also a threat .
Rangers , meanwhile , take on CSKA Moscow , currently fifth in the Russian league .
The club signed a three - year , £ 29 m sponsorship deal with oil company Sibneft earlier this year and have since bought Czech international midfielder Jiri Jarosik , Croatian international striker Ivica Olic and Brazilian striker Vagner Love .

"Arnold Schwarzenegger will seal his status as a player in US national politics tonight by topping the bill at the Republican party 's convention in New York .
The Californian governor 's address , which will emphasise his muscles - to - riches life story as the epitome of American opportunity , is expected to be second only to President George Bush 's performance on Thursday night as a star attraction .
Mr Schwarzenegger was expected to fly into New York last night on a corporate - sponsored private jet , attend a string of parties and - in a sign of his independence and political distance from the president - he may not even stick around long enough to hear Mr Bush speak .
An official at his office in Sacramento said there were "" no plans "" for the governor to stay in New York on Thursday night .
His wife , Maria Shriver , a Democrat and Kennedy family member , will be in the crowd to watch him tonight , but will then return home to take their children to school .
Mr Bush arguably needs Mr Schwarzenegger more than the governor needs him .
He will bring an element of glamour to the Republican convention , which can not compete with its Democratic counterpart in star wattage .
No other Hollywood stars will be present .
The Schwarzenegger glow will also contribute to the Bush campaign 's efforts to present the Republican party as an inclusive organisation .
Not only is he a successful immigrant , his state delegation will be considerably more diverse than the convention as a whole .
Mr Schwarzenegger will spend part of tomorrow at a primary school in Harlem to promote his scheme for after - school teaching for poor children , drawing media coverage that will help to embellish the gentler image the party is trying to promote this week .
His job is also considerably more secure than the president 's .
He is freshly elected and , unlike Mr Bush , his approval ratings are comfortably above 60 % .
Unlike the president , he can claim to be a fiscal conservative , having made at least some cosmetic steps towards reducing his state 's deficit .
The convention will mark Mr Schwarzenegger 's transition from a Californian phenomenon to a powerful figure on the US stage .
Unless a constitutional amendment is passed , he can not become president because he was not born a citizen , so he does not depend on party grandees for his advancement .
He is expected to praise Mr Bush in tonight 's speech , but will probably not take part in the derision of John Kerry .
He owes his high standing in Californian public opinion mostly to his reputation as a unifying figure .
Unlike most of his party , he supports abortion rights and gay rights .
His trip , costing at least $ 350,000 , is funded by the oil company Chevron Texaco and a group of other oil , drug and entertainment companies .
The last time he starred in this city , it was a disaster .
His big screen debut , Hercules in New York , was panned by the critics .
In the 1970 film , he plays the hero who is banished to the Big Apple by his father , Zeus , and ends up cleaning up the city .
This time he is likely to play to much better reviews ."
"Tuesday 's theme is "" people of compassion "" , which means appearances on the podium by the education secretary , Rod Paige , and the governor of California , Arnold Schwarzenegger - who will not presumably be using any catchy one - liners from his Terminator franchise on this sensitive primetime occasion .
Dr Bill Frist of Tennessee , the Senate majority leader , also gets the chance to try out his bedside manner on the convention , some time in the middle of the evening .
The headliner for compassion night , however , is the first lady herself .
Laura Bush will be introduced to the adoring delegates by a lady whose dreams of getting her hands on the White House died when her husband was soundly beaten in 1996 : Liddy Dole .
Tuesday evening may also see the most tense standoff so far between protesters and the vast numbers of NYPD officers on overtime : today is "" direct action day "" , so anything could happen ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger delved deeply into his Hollywood past during his speech last night at the Republican national convention .
While the man who is now governor of California has put his Hollywood career on the back - burner , his back catalogue still played a prominent role in his address to the party faithful .
Although focused on saluting the achievements of President Bush , Mr Schwarzenegger 's speech came peppered with references to his own former career .
After arriving on stage to prolonged applause , he told the delegates that the reception was "" like winning an Oscar "" ( something he has never actually done ) .
Later he reminded the convention that "" one of my movies was called True Lies , and that 's what the Democratic convention should have been called "" .
The choice of Mr Schwarzenegger as an early speaker at the RNC was widely interpreted as an attempt by the party to appeal to swing voters .
The actor 's views on such issues as abortion , gun control and gay marriage are markedly less right - wing than those of the bulk of Republican activists or , indeed , of the current President .
Nonetheless , Mr Schwarzenegger repeatedly praised Mr Bush for his "" perseverance , character and leadership "" in a speech which also made much of Mr Schwarzenegger 's "" rags to riches "" story after arriving in America as an Austrian immigrant . ""
Ladies and Gentlemen , America is back , "" he told a rapt convention in homage to his signature role as the Terminator ."
"George Bush 's Republican party formally nominated him last night as its candidate in November 's presidential election .
The 2,508 delegates gathered at the New York convention bestowed the nomination with the familiar chants of "" four more years "" on a night scripted to reinforce the theme of compassionate conservatism that brought Bush the presidency four years ago .
Star turns on the podium last night were the governor of California , Arnold Schwarzenegger , completing his transformation from the Hollywood film set to political centre stage , and the first lady , Laura Bush , who described in intimate detail her husband 's "" agonising "" decision to declare war on Iraq .
Mr Schwarzenegger , the cigar - smoking , pro - choice , pro - gay rights moderate who until a few weeks ago distanced himself from campaigning directly for the president outside California , came to Madison Square Garden and delivered a powerful sermon on the liberating virtues of Republicanism .
Two Americas
In a speech that limited itself to only a few direct attacks on the opposition and ignored the spate of arrests taking place outside the arena in New York 's midtown streets , he rubbished the mantra of John Kerry 's Democratic presidential running mate , John Edwards , that America is now two nations , divided between rich and poor .
"" I 've visited our troops in Iraq , Kuwait , Bosnia , Germany and all over the world , "" he said .
"" Our young men and women in uniform do not believe there are two Americas : they believe we are one America and they are fighting for it .
We are one America and President Bush is defending it with all his heart and soul . ""
Mr Schwarzenegger 's children watched from the star - spangled dais reserved for Republican royalty and waved placards emblazoned with the word "" Arnie "" .
However , his Democrat - supporting wife , the Kennedy scion Maria Shriver , conspicuously failed to applaud until the very end .
At its heart , the speech was an optimistic tale of how America changes lives for the better - especially for immigrants , who are "" full of determination , full of desire "" .
"" America gave me opportunities and my immigrant dreams came true , "" he said .
I want other people to get the same chances I did , the same opportunities - and I believe they can . ""
' Economic girlie men '
But the Governator was never an ordinary American immigrant : he was already a body building champion when he arrived in the late 1960s and decided , on hearing Nixon speak , that Republicanism was the way to satisfy his voracious ambitions .
In June the governor revived the whiff of unbridled sexism that pervaded the final few weeks of his run for the California governorship last year by referring to California 's Democratic legislators as a bunch of "" girlie men "" during state budget negotiations .
Last night the phrase won a self - deprecating reprise , to the delight of the crowd : "" To those critics who are so pessimistic about our economy , I say : ' Do n't be economic girlie men . '
"" At least half the speech was devoted to shoring up the president 's foreign policy .
This was from a man whose Austrian birth renders him too foreign to occupy the White House .
( It would take a constitutional amendment for that to happen , and the governor already has legislators on Capitol Hill pressing his case . )
America 's power was limitless , he said , and should not be curtailed by any carping voices : "" If you believe this country , not the United Nations , is the best hope of democracy in the world , then you are a Republican ...
If you believe we must be fierce and relentless and terminate terrorism , then you are a Republican . ""
' Awesome ' Arnold
On a night dedicated to showing Republican diversity and the compassionate face of the party 's domestic agenda , it proved impossible to escape the week 's overarching theme : that America will only be safe with four more years of George Bush .
Not to be outdone by the more mature Kerry daughters , the Bush twins , Barbara and Jenna , introduced themselves to the primetime American television audience as two ordinary college grads who mainly want to have fun .
"" It 's great to be here , "" said Barbara .
"" We love Arnold .
Is n't he awesome ? ""
Looking over at their grandmother , Jenna had a joke at her expense : "" She thinks Sex and the City is something married people do but never talk about . ""
President Bush was shown , via a series of cutaway shots on national television , chuckling at his daughter 's scripted antics , but for everyone in the convention centre it was a complete surprise when he popped up live on satellite to introduce his wife .
He was on the campaign trail , standing in a Pennsylvania baseball field .
It was yet another triumph of political theatre for the event 's producers .
Laura Bush has made it her job to be nice and inoffensive , but last night she put her quiet , librarian 's charm to powerful effect in painting a portrait of her husband as a thoughtful , dignified man who only wants to do good at home and abroad .
Tough choices
It was not a well - delivered speech but it carried authority and appeared insightful : "" You can count on him , especially in a crisis .
His friends do n't change , and neither do his values ...
He 's a loving man with a big heart . ""
And on Iraq she debunked the idea of George Bush the warmonger : "" I remember some very quiet nights at the dinner table ...
I was there when my husband had to decide .
Once again , as in our parents ' generation , America had to make the tough choices , the hard decisions , and lead the world toward greater security and freedom . ""
Without releasing a single barb towards the Democrats , the speech dwelt also on domestic themes of education and business development , and the liberation of Afghan and Iraqi women .
But at its heart was the message : here stands an ordinary , decent American woman who believes in her husband - how could you not vote for him ? ""
George and I grew up in west Texas , where the sky seems endless and so do the possibilities .
He brings that optimism , that sense of promise ...
These are times that require an especially strong and determined leader , and I 'm proud that my husband is that kind of leader . ""
Those who disagree with that view were also out in force yesterday .
Nearly 1,000 protesters were arrested during a day of demonstrations .
Colin Powell
The evening ended with the Harlem Boys ' Choir singing the Battle Hymn of the Republic .
Moderate Republicans may have been wondering , on an evening when so many of the party 's African - American contingent were on or around the platform , about the whereabouts of the party 's most popular minority face , the secretary of state , Colin Powell .
He will not be addressing the convention at all this week .
Tonight the vice - president , Dick Cheney , will step up to denounce John Kerry 's "" confusion of conviction "" and set the stage for Mr Bush 's acceptance speech tomorrow .
The president arrives in New York late tonight to meet the city 's firefighters and press home the connection with September 11 and the war on terror ."
"It may say something about Republicans that on the day they dedicated to showcasing their compassion the headline speaker was the man who once played Conan the Barbarian .
But if Arnold Schwarzenegger was miscast in his new supporting role - a pro - choice , gun control liberal in a deeply conservative setting - then both he and the audience masked it well .
For when the former action hero and current governor of California took to the stage of Madison Square Garden the faithful were ready for him .
The delegates ' posters , waved to the cameras , had been switched from proclaiming A Nation of Courage to People of Compassion .
An array of female and minority speakers had been lined up to soften the edges of a reputation the party fears may be just too hard for many moderates and undecided women .
And while the undecideds watched on television , the devoted looked on in the audience .
Valerie White , from Asheboro , North Carolina , had had each of her nails decorated with the American flag , and her favourite sequinned vest was in his honour . ""
He 's what America is all about , "" she said .
"" You can come to this country and be successful . ""
As though the president 's address today were strictly B - list , Patti Gaines , from Alabama , told the New York Times : "" From the time we found out about it , that 's who I wanted to make an effort to come and see .
I wanted to see Laura , too .
It was nice that they were on the same night , but he was the main reason . ""
Mr Schwarzenegger 's performance did not disappoint .
He brought star quality to a party now renowned for its hostility to Hollywood . ""
Governor Schwarzenegger is someone people pay $ 8 to see - in droves , "" said the Republicans ' chairman , Ed Gillespie , explaining how Arnie 's fame could help Republicans reach beyond the committed to the star - struck .
And so the governor did his party pieces .
Rehashing lines from his movies , he recounted how a wounded soldier told him , "" I 'll be back "" .
He told the crowd "" America was back from the attack on our homeland "" , and the Democrats should have called their convention "" true lies "" .
Not surprisingly , his biggest cheers were for his least moderate statements .
When he branded those questioning the performance of the economy as "" economic girlie men "" the crowd went wild .
When he told them he had been inspired to become a Republican by Richard Nixon , they cheered heartily .
When he said "" if you believe that this country and not the United Nations is the best hope for democracy , then you 're a Republican "" , they chanted "" U - S - A , U - S - A "" .
But in a speech in which he used personal narrative - from immigrant to bodybuilder to film star to politician - to champion the American dream , this was more about his own political prospects than about George Bush .
In a 23-minute speech , he mentioned America 47 times , used the word Republican 15 times and referred to President Bush by name six times .
As the New York Post columnist , Linda Stasi said , "" whoever put those [ Bush ] twins on after Arnold needs to be beaten severely about the head and neck "" .
For the sorority goodtime girls this was their coming out parade , the first time they had publicly supported their father in politics .
Giggling through a litany of feeble one - liners , the sole task of the two 22-year - old daughters of Mr Bush was to introduce their father on video - satellite who would then introduce their mother , Laura .
The crowd shuffled awkwardly in their seats at their attempts to be cute .
As more than a thousand of their peer group were being arrested in the city , the Bush girls gleefully admitted they were "" not very political "" before cracking jokes about their underage drinking and telling the world that their parents ' pet name for each other was Bushie .
Compassionate conservatism would have sent them back to their temporary hangout , the Union League Club , and to bed with a large Cosmopolitan .
CNN 's anchor woman summed it up for many when she turned from the sister act to camera to confess : "" I 'm not sure what that was about . """
"Austrian historians are ridiculing Arnold Schwarzenegger for telling the Republican convention in New York that he saw Soviet tanks in his homeland as a child and left a "" socialist "" country when he moved away in 1968 .
Recalling that the Red Army once occupied part of Austria after the second world war , the California governor told delegates on Tuesday : "" I saw tanks in the streets .
I saw communism with my own eyes . ""
One historian , Stefan Karner , told the Vienna newspaper Kurier : "" He could not have seen a Soviet tank in Styria . ""
Mr Schwarzenegger , admired by many Austrians for rising from a penniless immigrant to become a Hollywood star and now the governor of the most populous US state , was born in Styria in 1947 .
But the Russians left the province in 1945 , said Mr Karner .
In his convention address , Mr Schwarzenegger also said : "" As a kid , I saw the socialist country that Austria became after the Soviets left . ""
But Martin Polaschek , a law history scholar and vice - rector of Graz University , told Kurier that , between 1945 and 1970 , all Austria 's chancellors were conservatives - not socialists .
Mr Polaschek saw the Republican governor 's recollections at his party 's convention as a tactical move .
Mr Schwarzenegger , he said , was "" using the old communist enemy image for Bush 's election campaign . """

"The governor of California , Arnold Schwarzenegger , has signed a bill making it criminal to mass - distribute a video , music or other file on the internet without providing a link to its source .
According to the Hollywood Reporter , the law requires anyone passing copies of a film , game or piece of music to include their email address - on pain of a year in jail , or a fine of $ 2,500 ( £ 1,400 ) .
After much anxiety over the piracy of films , the Motion Picture Association of America has applauded the move , describing itself as "" grateful "" to Mr Schwarzenegger , and calling for the law to be introduced across the entire US .

"The Chelsea tractor - the urban behemoth blamed for wreaking environmental carnage , making roads impassable during school runs and terrifying cyclists -- may finally have met its match .
Arnold Schwarzenegger , the Terminator star turned Republican governor of California , is backing tough new moves by his state to drastically reduce the poisonous chemicals emitted by gas - guzzling transport such as Sports Utility Vehicles .
In a landmark ruling on Friday night , environmental officials appointed by the former action hero voted to force motor manufacturers to make all new vehicles sold in the state after 2009 significantly cleaner .
Producers will have to reduce emission of carbon dioxide gases , which have been linked to global warming , by up to a third .
The decision has profound implications for Britain , where there is now a rising backlash against the use of these powerful Sports Utility Vehicles .
Dubbed ' Chelsea Tractors ' because they are fashionable with middle - class families in well - off areas , they are loathed by environmentalists as ' Yank tanks ' .
Statistics show that people involved in an accident with an SUV are more likely to die or suffer serious injury than with an ordinary car .
SUVs are a source of concern across the political spectrum .
The Liberal Democrats last week pledged to slap extra taxes on 4x4s because of the environmental damage they cause , and the Conservatives have said that something needs to be done . '
If you drive a huge American people carrier or four wheel drive , you are going to pay more than if you drive a small , fuel - efficient family car , ' declared Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor . '
I think Chelsea tractors can expect to pay more . '
Despite that , sales of vehicles bearing names such as Explorers , Avalanches and Navigators have risen sharply over the last few years .
Although designed for off - road driving by country people , and named to evoke a spirit of adventure in wild terrains , ironically only a minority have ever been driven in such conditions .
They are increasingly common sights in Britain 's cities and are often used for short hops , such as trips to collect offspring and go shopping .
Their exact contribution to global warming is unknown , but emissions from vehicles and planes are two of the biggest sources of carbon dioxide pollution .
While environmentalists hailed the California decision as historic , the motoring industry condemned the move .
Manufacturers will be forced to make a series of modifications , for example to engines and air conditioning systems , during the construction of cars and trucks to comply with the regulations , adding up to £ 2,000 to costs . '
The fact is that this will not do anything about global warming .
But it will be very costly for California consumers , ' said Gloria Berquist of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers , which represents nine big car producers .
The motor manufacturing industry is worried that California 's move will prompt lawmakers elsewhere in America and beyond to follow suit .
It is threatening lawsuits to try to stop the plan .
The move could also pit the governor against the federal government led by his friend President George Bush .
Schwarzenegger is fully behind the scheme , despite owning at least five Humvee H2s , the notoriously fuel - inefficient 4x4 which is closely modelled on an American light military vehicle .
Once a champion of SUVs , the one - time ultimate Hollywood tough guy argued during last year 's gubernatorial race that Californians should consider switching to more environmentally - friendly modes of transport such as hydrogen - fuelled cars .
It was a bold move in a country where sales of SUVs and trucks now outnumber those of traditional cars , and especially in a state widely seen as the capital of the car - obsessed United States .
Now in office , Schwarzenegger supports the decision taken by the California Air Resources Board .
He appointed its eight members , who voted 8 - 0 in favour .
California 's action met with a mixed reception in Britain .
The RAC warned ministers that if they took similar action , motorists would revolt . '
If Government was to enforce the same thing here , you would get an enormous backlash from the 28 million motorists who regularly drive in this country , because without effective alternatives to the car , such as decent public transport , people will feel that they do n't have a choice ' , said spokeswoman Rebecca Bell .
But last night the Government 's senior transport advisor , David Begg , raised the prospect of ministers eventually following California 's lead . '
The Government may ultimately end up forcing motor vehicle manufacturers to do something similar here on emission standards , as part of its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , ' he said .
' If it 's successful in Los Angeles , then it could come in here . '
Ken Livingstone , the capital 's Labour mayor , also welcomed California 's stance . '
Measures like this are long overdue , ' he said . '
Vehicle exhausts are also a major contributor to the pollutants which cause or aggravate chest complaints , killing hundreds of people each year in London alone . '
Rise of the ' Yank Tank '
There are 1.2 million 4x4 vehicles in Britain , and a further 150,000 are bought every month .
A typical SUV does only eight to 10 miles per gallon , whereas a standard car does more than 40 .
Mr Livingstone , recently described 4x4 drivers as ' complete idiots ' and condemned the vehicles as status symbols which were ' bad for London ' .
SUVs and trucks now outsell cars in America .
The French government plans to impose a tax of up to 3,200 euros ( £ 2,175 ) on new 4x4s .
The Liberal Democrats support similar action ."
"It is an unlikely coalition : London Mayor Ken Livingstone , Tory leader Michael Howard , Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Matthew Taylor of the Lib Dems .
They all agree something must be done about the bete noire of the modern road : the four - by - four , or sports utility vehicle ( SUV ) .
The complaints are familiar : ' Chelsea tractors ' clog up urban streets loaded with chil dren on the way to school or chicken nuggets bound for the freezer , pumping out carbon dioxide and threatening road surfaces , pedestrians and other motorists with their weight , bull bars and height .
They may be used by politicians as handy symbols of ostentation and excessive consumption , but demand for them has risen unchecked since the early Nineties , despite growing fears about climate change ...
Now the backlash is coming .
Regulations are being considered or introduced here and in the US to force manufacturers to make cleaner vehicles ( Schwarzenegger ) , impose higher vehicle excise duty or congestion charges ( Taylor and Tim Yeo , Howard 's environment spokesman ) , ban bull bars ( Livingstone ) , and bar heavy vehicles from residential streets ( the Santa Monica transport department ) .
The regulations are usually designed to hit all high - emission vehicles , but the invective most often hits the SUV .
This is going to hurt the industry .
Through what has been a barren period , particularly for the US giants , SUVs have been a key factor in keeping the business afloat outside low - cost Asia .
Citigroup automotive analyst John Lawson says : ' It has been the long - term growth segment of the North American industry and in the past two or three years in Europe as well . '
Figures produced by auto industry consultancy Global Insight show a 72 per cent increase between 1995 and 2000 , from 3.1 million vehicles to 5.3 million worldwide , while in the US they have soared from 930,000 in 1990 to 4.8 million this year .
The impact on profits has been even more dramatic .
Lawson adds : ' The rates of growth are going to be more than threatened . '
Global Insight 's figures show that SUV sales will continue to grow in future , though at diminished levels .
Sales are expected to hit 7.7 million in 2005 , up 43 per cent on 2000 .
They are forecast to grow to 9.8 million in 2009 .
But SUVs are not expected to go the way of the dinosaurs amid the hostile environment of a maturing market , $ 50-a - barrel oil and a welter of environmental , congestion , weight and safety measures .
It is more likely that they will evolve to survive .
The drive behind the growth in SUVs has been product innovation .
Nick Matthews , senior fellow of the Warwick Manufacturing Group , says this reflects the fact that the SUV was born from one of only two ' breakthrough ' products in car design in the past 50 years - the Range Rover in the early 1970s .
The other was the prototype people carrier , the Renault Espace in the 1980s . '
The Range Rover was launched and everybody copied it ; then the model diversified , ' he says .
From this followed Toyota 's Land Cruiser and , in the mid - Nineties , the start of smaller vehicles , such as Toyota 's Rav4 .
Now there are five accepted sub - categories , ranging from the luxury / full - size Jeep Grand Cherokees and Porsche Cayennes , through compacts ( such as the Rav4 or Honda CRV ) to mini - SUVs such as Daihatsu 's Terios Kid .
In the US , growth has focused on the massive ' Yank tanks ' and their popularity remains , as indicated by the huge civilianised military Humvees on the streets this year .
US tax incentives have encouraged manufacturers to build bigger , heavier ( and higher - emission ) SUVs .
A sales tax credit first intended for commercial vehicles or light trucks - classified as over 6,000 lb - is now applicable to full - size wagons from Ford or GM or luxury models from BMW and Porsche .
These commercial vehicles are also exempted from total emissions limits imposed on US manufacturers .
The effect has been a proliferation of monster and chic SUVs .
US manufacturers are determined that these exemptions should remain , and are fighting to ensure that initiatives such as Schwarzenegger 's or Santa Monica 's are not repeated by less forward - looking states than California .
But pressure is mounting , and experts believe that the highest - volume growth will be from manufacturers that reduce SUV size , weight and emissions .
This could provide an entry into the market for European makers , along with established Asian brands .
Philip Rosengarten of Global Insight says : ' The important thing so far has been that the growth has more or less happened in the E [ full - size/ luxury ] segment .
We expect some growth in the D [ Ford Explorer , Toyota Highlander ] , but most of all it will come in the C [ compact ] segment ...
We expect launches from Volkswagen , Renault and Fiat . '
Rosengarten accepts that regulations may encourage change , but believes consumer preferences and product innovations will be more important . '
And [ remember ] people feel more protected in these vehicles because the impact they have on smaller cars in a crash is very bad . '
The impact of a shift towards smaller SUVs on US manufacturers is shown in GI 's sales forecasts .
While GI expects Ford to see 15 per cent growth between this year and 2009 , GM 30 per cent , and Daimler / Chrysler 65 per cent , it is looking at 269 per cent from Volkswagen , 914 per cent from Renault - while Fiat is simply off the scale .
The Europeans are starting from much lower positions and the margins in smaller products are slimmer .
But their domestic markets have been growing - in the UK ,
the SUV share of the total has risen from 4.5 per cent in 1999 to 6.8 per cent in 2004 , while in the EU it has gone from 3.8 to 5.2 per cent .
In the US , SUVs were not immune to dismal August sales figures .
For example , Ford 's UK - based Land - Rover subsidiary has seen US sales fall by 15 per cent so far this year .
The Ford Expedition full - size vehicle has dropped 12.7 per cent , while its Explorer fell 6.7 per cent .
The US giants are not taking it lying down .
Last month Ford launched the Escape , billed as the first ' hybrid ' SUV , able to run on electricity and conventional fuel .
But Rosengarten says : ' It is possible to see what happened to the car market in the Nineties happening to SUVs in the next 10 years : increased competition and pressure on margins .
For the Americans it will be difficult .
In the Nineties they faced pressure from the Asians in small and medium - sized cars at the bottom end , and from European makers such as BMW and Mercedes at the top .
SUVs were the answer .
Now they are under attack too . '"
""" A new California law aimed at curbing spyware , software applications that surreptitiously collect the keystrokes , passwords , and credit - card numbers of Internet users , will go into effect Jan. 1 , "" reports InformationWeek .

The law , dubbed the Consumer Protection Against Spyware Act , was signed last week by Calif. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger .
It outlaws software that secretly steals personal information , such as user names and passwords , sends viruses , or takes control of infected systems as part of a distributed denial - of - service attack .
The law also requires software companies and Web sites to inform users if their software or sites will install spyware and disclose what the spyware will do and what information it will collect .

"· As the countdown to the US presidential election begins , Sidelines has an idea for getting all those undecided male voters along to the polls : a sex strike .
After all , it 's tried and tested - remember the women who went on strike to stop their menfolk from endless warmongering in Aristophanes ' Lysistrata ?
We 're cheered already by signs of ( in)action from the US - California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger revealed this week that "" there was no sex for 14 days "" with his Democrat wife , and niece of JFK , Maria Shriver , after he made a pro - Bush speech at the Republican convention .

Oh , and we have n't the slightest idea what Kate Winslet 's new film , Finding Neverland , is about , but we do know she turned up to the London premiere in a size-8 dress .
She might claim she 's simply returned to "" normal "" after having a baby , but we 're sure the newspapers that proudly boasted of her new single - digit sizing ( at last , proof that constant harping can pay off ! ) were there with tape measures to check she had the required 18-in waist .

Another contender in the pointless measurements of the week competition : a new book , Numbers , by David Boyle and Anita Roddick , informs us that the "" average woman "" spends 40 minutes every day shopping .
Presumably that includes buying lunch , paying for your bus ticket and picking up a pint of semi - skimmed on the way home from the job that does n't actually allow for 40 minutes ' swanning down the high street every day .
And probably does n't pay enough , either : this week 's less pointless statistic is the news that the pay gap between men and women is wider than previously thought .
According to UK pay analysts Incomes Data Services , women working full time are earning 19.5 % less than men , not 18 % as earlier surveys had indicated .

Excellent plan , we think , and one that presents the Saudis with an easy way around what would seem to be their purely practical difficulties in this little matter ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger , the Californian governor , dubbed presidential hopeful John Kerry an ' economic girlie man ' at the Republican party 's New York convention last month .
But the Governator was holding something back - he did n't tell those endorsing the Bush candidacy that he had n't been man enough to get to the Big Apple under his own steam .
Schwarzenegger 's trip to New York - worth a whopping $ 350,000 - was paid in large part by Pfizer , the biggest drug company in the world .
Just why Pfizer backs Arnie and the Republicans is now a campaign issue in the California Senate race .
Pharmaceutical firms are desperate to see Republicans maintain control of the Golden State .
The Hollywood star turned politician has received close to $ 500,000 from pharmaceutical companies since beginning his run for office last year .
But recent events could backfire badly on the Governator and his paymasters .
Furthermore , there are growing calls for all Schwarzenegger 's drug money to be paid back .
An unseemly row is brewing over sick and old people in California , too poor to buy medicine , organising themselves to take trains up to Canada , where drug prices are much lower .
The drugs are imported back to California and distributed to the needy .
In trade - law speak , this is known as ' parallel importation ' , and under intellectual property law it is highly contentious .
It seems Pfizer 's and other drug firm 's campaign donations initially paid off .
Earlier this month , Schwarzenegger rejected Democrat proposals targeting the high cost of prescription drugs .
Part of these proposals was to legitimise parallel importation from Canada .
Schwarzenegger said the measures would have broken federal law and made the state vulnerable to lawsuits if anyone got ill from imported drugs .
Not true , said the Democrats .
A similar debate is raging across the rest of the US , and it is , for the most part , split down party lines .
That explains why drug - firm donations to the Republicans far outstrip those to the Democrats .
In the 2002 election cycle , out of total contributions of $ 29.4 m , drug firms lavished $ 21.7 m on the party of George W Bush .
Joel Bakan 's new book , The Corporation , shows how , after donating more than $ 1 m to Congressional candidates - most of them Republicans - during the 2001 election cycle , Eli Lilly was the beneficiary of a provision buried in the Homeland Security Act that protected makers of thimerosal , a preservative used in vaccines , from lawsuits arising out of harm caused by the drug 's use .
Eli Lilly was the sole manufacturer of the substance .
The provision was eventually removed after intense public outcry ."

"With just two days to the US presidential election , the jockeying for the 2008 Republican nomination stepped up a gear yesterday with an unexpected admission by Arnold Schwarzenegger that he would be interested in running .
On previous occasions the governor of California has sidestepped the question , but asked last night on the CBS programme 60 Minutes if he would support an amendment to allow a foreign - born national to be president , Mr Schwarzenegger said : "" Yes , absolutely . ""
"" I think , you know , because why not ?
I mean , you know , anyone with my way of thinking , you always shoot for the top , "" he said .
"" But it 's not something that I am preoccupied with .
I am not thinking one single minute about that because there 's so many things I have to do in California , and my promise was to straighten out the mess in California . ""
The Austrian - born former action hero 's ambitions are not possible at present : under the constitution , a president has to have been born in the US .
An amendment would allow anyone who has been a US citizen for 20 years to run .
Mr Schwarzenegger became a citizen in 1983 .
His words come just two days after he appeared alongside George Bush in Columbus , Ohio .
Mr Schwarzenegger 's relations with the president are known to be cool , as was evident during the rally on Friday .
The governor failed to attack John Kerry during his speech , and then sat with his hands folded during Mr Bush 's speech , failing to applaud many of the more conservative , crowd - pleasing lines .
The differences between the two stem in part from political ambitions , but also from genuine policy differences .
Mr Schwarzenegger is mindful that he owes much of popularity to his ability to talk to both Republican and Democrat voters .
His aides are concerned that if he is too closely aligned with Mr Bush , much of the governor 's liberal support will be scared away .
The two have very different priorities .
Mr Schwarzenegger is married to Maria Shriver , a member of the Kennedy clan and active Democrat .
Her influence is credited with moving Mr Schwarzenegger to more liberal positions than the president on issues such as gun control , abortion and stem cell research .
That issue , brought to prominence by the recent death of Christopher Reeve , also flared up at the weekend as the actor and director Mel Gibson opposed Mr Schwarzenegger 's endorsement of a Californian ballot proposition to authorise $ 3bn ( £ 1.63bn ) into stem cell research .
Gibson , one of the most powerful men in Hollywood after the success of his Christian traditionalist - inspired film The Passion of the Christ , said he had tried to call Mr Schwarzenegger to discuss the issue with him . ""
He said , ' Well , I 'm very busy now .
I 'll call you back .
I 've got to make a speech , you know .
I 'll call you right back . '
Well , Arnold , I 'm still waiting for your call , "" Gibson told ABC news .
But Mr Schwarzenegger disputed Gibson 's version of the conversation , saying that it was Gibson who had failed to return his call .
"" I do n't know what this was all about , "" Mr Schwarzenegger said .
"" I did talk to him for several minutes and explained to him what my position was .
I called back at 9 o'clock and left a message .
He has n't returned my call . ""
Gibson , who has also recorded a radio commercial opposing the proposition to fund stem cell research , said : "" I was never in a petri dish , but at one stage I was that little cluster of cells myself , as were you , as was the doctor , as is everybody . ""
Tell me anybody who was not that at some point in their development , and I 'll give you a cigar , "" he added , in reference to Mr Schwarzenegger 's custom of presenting visitors and admirers with his own brand of cigar ."
"At a Beverly Hills victory party on election night , Arnold Schwarzenegger , the governor of California , crowed that he liked nothing more than an election . ""
When the people flex their muscles , "" he declared in the now compulsory reference to his body - building , action - hero past , "" then the state gets much stronger . ""
Come Wednesday , Schwarzenegger had good reason to feel pleased with himself .
While the presidential election was a distant irrelevance for California - the result may matter but the state with the most electoral college votes in the country had little influence on the outcome - voters did have a chance to "" flex their muscles "" on a variety of propositions , ranging from medical insurance to gambling to stem cell research .
Schwarzenegger invested much of his political capital in these issues , and that investment paid a hefty dividend : voters agreed with the governor on 11 of the 14 propositions on which he took a stand .
The spread of positions taken by Schwarzenegger shows what an agile strategy he has pursued in his relentless accumulation of power .
He won over liberal supporters with his well - publicised backing for Proposition 71 , the measure to grant $ 3bn ( £ 1.67bn ) of state money for embryonic stem cell research .
Had a Democrat governor backed that sort of investment in a state , such as California , with a rolling multi - billion dollar deficit , he or she would have been crucified by the Republicans .
As it was , the only meaningful opposition Mr Schwarzenegger encountered was from a member of a different branch of the cult of celebrity , Mel Gibson .
But while Arnie could use stem cell research to contrast himself with the nation 's faith - based president and burnish his liberal credentials , he also needed to talk to his Republican base .
The governor may have campaigned for Bush in Ohio four days before the election , but Republican voters in Orange County still needed something to cheer about .
So Schwarzenegger took the easy course : he picked the most emotive proposition he could find - the attempt to reform California 's draconian three strikes law .
Even in the surreal universe of three strikes , California 's version of the law is extreme .
Most states with three strikes legislation confine it to serious violent crime .
However , in California felons with two convictions for violent crime can be jailed for life for a third conviction , regardless of the nature of the crime .
Shoplifting , burglary , drunken driving , arson of an unoccupied building - all these offences can mean a life sentence in California .
But the campaign to reform the poorly drafted law to make it more faithful to the intentions of those who fought for it 10 years ago came up against a governor intent on playing politics .
A week before voting day , with the reform proposal enjoying 70 - 30 support in the polls , Schwarzenegger weighed in with two television commercials .
Striding through a display of blown up mug shots of convicted criminals , Schwarzenegger tried to scare the wits out of voters , alleging that reform of the law would see thousands of violent criminals back on the streets .
In fact , the proposed changes would have led to the review of some 4,000 sentences , all of them involving petty offenders who received life sentences . ""
Murders .
Rapists .
Child molesters .
Twenty - six thousand dangerous criminals will be released from prison under Proposition 66 , "" he said .
"" Keep them behind bars . ""
Of course it was not true , but this was politics , and Schwarzenegger made his point .
By election day , the polls were showing the vote on the measure neck and neck .
By Wednesday , it was clear that the governor had succeeded in turning the vote around : 53.4 % of people voted to keep the three strikes law as it was .
It was law'n'order populism of the most unabashed sort .
Schwarzenegger himself came close to admitting that the reform had become a political football when he said a day ago : "" If there 's something wrong with it that you know needs to be adjusted , then we should do that .
"" That he did not have the courage to say that before Tuesday 's vote reflects poorly on a governor who prides himself on his bipartisanship , and reveals him as just another cigar - lounge Republican ."
"Afghanistan 's tough guys used to wear beards and wool caps , study the Qur'an and fight mountain battles .
These days an increasing number have waxed chests , cheesy grins and bulging biceps .
"" People do n't want to fight any more , "" says Temour Shah , a beefy 23-year - old , pumping weights under an Arnold Schwarzenegger poster at Gold 's Gym in central Kabul .
"" They want to look healthy - like in the movies . ""
Bodybuilding is the new craze of postwar Afghanistan , particularly among young urban men .
The number of gyms in Kabul has doubled to 46 in the past two years , while a further 30 are scattered across the country .
Every day from 5 am men crowd into sweaty halls across the city , grappling with clanking weights machines before cracked mirrors .
Conditions are spartan - water coolers , neat white towels and showers are unknown luxuries - but enthusiasm runs high .
Barely able to afford the £ 4 monthly membership fee , some enthusiasts work out in their baggy shalwar kameez trousers ; others use their work clothes .
"" Everyone wants to look strong , but the problem is calories .
Most clients just do n't have enough food , "" says Hafizullah Anis , 26 , who owns Gold 's Gym .
He says he helps his poorer clients by offering them free protein supplements he buys at Bagram US military air base .
Returning refugees from Pakistan and Iran have fuelled the bodybuilding craze , but its origins stretch back to the 60s .
One of the oldest aficionados , Aziz Arzo , owns a rundown gym in a former dental surgery overlooking the dried bed of the Kabul river .
A short , stocky man in his 50s , he proudly displays his first exercise machine : a homemade contraption of weights , hooks and pulleys .
Other weights in the gym are fashioned from concrete moulds and old engine parts .
He says he has 150 "" students "" , of whom the poorest work out free of charge .
"" I am one of the originals .
They come to me for my experience , "" he says , beside a pouting portrait of himself on a podium in the 70s .
Bodybuilding is a natural pursuit in a culture that prizes machismo .
The national sport , buzkashi , involves two horseback teams beating a headless calf carcass around a pitch .
The streets are covered with pensive images of the Tajik warlord Ahmad Shah Mas soud , an Afghan national hero .
But inside the gyms , the governor of California is king .
"" I studied Schwarzenegger 's career carefully , "" says Noorulhoda Sherzad , a dentistry student and the current holder of the Mr Kabul title .
""
He achieved everything he wanted .
I have dreams , too . ""
The Taliban tolerated bodybuilding , but only if those working out remained fully clothed and wore beards . ""
The competitions were ridiculous .
You could only show your top , "" Mr Sherzad says .
In those days , strong , young men could be conscripted into fighting .
Today , however , "" our gun is our muscle "" , says Ahmad Ranjber , a gym owner who boasts a 77-year - old among his clients .
"" And he has a good body , too , "" he adds .
The body - conscious vogue also reflects slowly increasing freedoms .
Strict social norms prevent young men and women from mixing in public , but many bodybuilders coyly admit they hope to impress .
Mingling with American soldiers has fuelled their desires .
"" I am exercising for the big body so the girls will like me , "" says Feroz Khan , a 20-year - old lorry driver at Bagram base , taking a break from his first workout .
He has an American girlfriend called Nikita , he boasts in broken English , although some of his friends express doubts .
Romantic choice was part of Afghanistan 's new dispensation , he insists .
"" I am a love man - I am not for arranged marriage , "" he says .
"" Under the Taliban , it was very dangerous .
If I looked at a girl ; they would say , ' Why you look ? '
Then they would fight me . ""
But now Hamid Karzai is my chief .
Since he become president he will allow the love marriage . ""
Regrettably , however , an unsavoury side of modern sport has seeped in .
The prestigious Mr Afghanistan crown lies unclaimed after controversy engulfed last month 's contest .
There was a "" small problem "" with one of the frontrunners , explains a judge , Fazal Ahmad , of the Afghan Bodybuilding Federation .
"" We suspected him of doping . "" There are no drug testing facilities in Afghanistan ."
"A prominent housing lawyer and former Tory councillor has returned to Britain after supervising a polling booth in Ohio as part of John Kerry 's failed presidential election campaign .
Simon Randall was the only British lawyer in John Kerry 's 350-strong legal team in Ohio .
And he said would he volunteer again for the Democrats in 2008 - when he predicts a contest between Hillary Clinton and Arnold Schwarzenegger . ""
That 's what I 'm betting , "" he said .
In last week 's election he volunteered to supervise the vote in Toledo , in the crucial state of Ohio and was on hand to ensure people were not barred from voting .
"" I was keeping an eye to ensure that voters were able to vote .
When people were rejected we ran along to the courts to get them reinstated , "" he said .
Mr Randall , who is head of housing and local government services at the law firm Lawrence Graham , added : "" If the vote had been close , our work might have been really significant . ""
Around 160,000 provisional votes were cast in Ohio by people who had problems voting on the day .
Mr Kerry would have needed to take more than 90 % of these votes to overturn Mr Bush 's lead .
Mr Randall said he was right to concede .
Mr Randall 's foray into US elections provides the latest episode in a colourful political career .
He represented the Conservatives on the Greater London Council , is a former leader of Bromley council , and advised Conservative housing ministers as chairman of the housing committee of the London Borough 's Association .
In 1998
Mr Randall ran the campaign against setting up a directly - elected mayor in London .
He is also currently chairman of Broomleigh housing association .
Mr Randall , who is still a Tory party member , said he volunteered for the Democrats ' campaign because he supported John Kerry 's environmental promises and was alarmed at President Bush 's "" bellicose "" attitude to green issues .
Commenting on the result , he said : "" I was very upset , but the whole campaign was exciting . """
"He did his best , but Arnold the would - be statesman could not quite shake off Arnie the film star .
Arnold Schwarzenegger , the governor of California , and a 57-strong entourage of business leaders flew into Tokyo earlier this week .
He was , commentators noted , the first visiting politician to be greeted at the airport by crowds of screaming , camera - wielding fans .
He was at pains to point out that this was a tour to promote California , but the Terminator struggled to get the message through .
Japan is familiar territory for Mr Schwarzenegger , where he is known by the affectionate nickname Shuwa - chan .
Even the prime minister , Junichiro Koizumi - another star turned politician - appeared a little awestruck when the two met yesterday .
"" You 're very popular , "" Mr Schwarzenegger told Mr Koizumi , who was until recently the most popular Japanese prime minister in living memory .
"" You too , "" Mr Koizumi replied . ""
More popular than Bush . ""
Mr Schwarzenegger quickly made light of the comment .
"" He 's very funny , very complimentary always , "" he said .
"" He still thought I looked like a Mr Universe , which I 'm not . ""
Mr Schwarzenegger has made numerous visits to Japan to promote his films and has earned millions of dollars endorsing everything from beer to instant noodles and pep drinks on Japanese television .
This time he was courting business leaders : Japan is California 's largest foreign investor , and the second - biggest destination for its exports after Mexico .
To that end , his five - day visit , which ends today , was choreographed with all the precision of one of his more hair - raising scenes on the Hollywood set .
Mr Schwarzenegger 's associates have made no secret of his ambition , and sections of the US press have billed the trip as his first chance since being elected governor to display his credentials as a statesman , with a view to running for the White House in 2008 .
There was no repeat , for example , of the gaffe on a previous trip when his forgetfulness forced the resignation of a senior politician .
On that occasion Mr Schwarzenegger arrived without his passport , but was waved through by the justice minister , Shozaburo Nakamura , who later said : "" If I had n't allowed him in , I would have been killed by my wife and daughter . ""
The minister sealed his own downfall by pocketing Mr Schwarzenegger 's immigration application form as a memento .
On this visit , Mr Schwarzenegger 's chief target was Toyota 's president , Fujio Cho , whose company is considering manufacturing its popular Prius hybrid car in the US .
Many analysts say the deal will fail because of the state 's high operating costs and unionised labour .
But the governor was determined to return home with something to show the voters , even if that did mean revisiting his previous life .
He offered to appear in another advert and to use the millions of dollars he made to revive California 's trade and tourism office in Tokyo , which closed down last year amid accusations of financial irregularities .
The governor might have hoped for less of a showbiz approach in an interview on one of Japan 's serious evening news programmes .
But having questioned the governor on the economy and the war in Iraq , the broadcaster , Tetsuya Chikushi , had one more request .
Arnie was happy to oblige , looking straight into the camera and saying : "" I 'll be back . """
"He did his best , but Arnold the would - be statesman could not quite shake off Arnie the film star .
Arnold Schwarzenegger , the governor of California , and a 57-strong entourage of business leaders flew into Tokyo earlier this week .
He was , commentators noted , the first visiting politician to be greeted at the airport by crowds of screaming , camera - wielding fans .
He was at pains to point out that this was a tour to promote California , but the Terminator struggled to get the message through .
Japan is familiar territory for Mr Schwarzenegger , where he is known by the affectionate nickname Shuwa - chan .
Even the prime minister , Junichiro Koizumi - another star turned politician - appeared a little awestruck when the two met yesterday .
"" You 're very popular , "" Mr Schwarzenegger told Mr Koizumi , who was until recently the most popular Japanese prime minister in living memory .
"" You too , "" Mr Koizumi replied . ""
More popular than Bush . ""
Mr Schwarzenegger quickly made light of the comment .
"" He 's very funny , very complimentary always , "" he said .
"" He still thought I looked like a Mr Universe , which I 'm not . ""
Mr Schwarzenegger has made numerous visits to Japan to promote his films and has earned millions of dollars endorsing everything from beer to instant noodles and pep drinks on Japanese television .
This time he was courting business leaders : Japan is California 's largest foreign investor , and the second - biggest destination for its exports after Mexico .

"The UK television premiere of Arnold Schwarzenegger movie Terminator 3 gave Five one of its best audiences ever and helped make it the most popular channel among 16-to-34-year - olds yesterday .
Terminator 3 : The Rise of the Machines was watched by 4.5 million people , just under a fifth of the audience at 9 pm last night , making it the eighth most watched programme in the station 's seven - year history .
It was just beaten by England 's European Championship qualifier against Bulgaria in 1999 , which was also watched by 4.5 million but had a bigger audience share .
However , the audience for Terminator 3 is likely to rise once people who recorded it are taken into account .
Five had a 14 % share in the key 16-to-34-year - old demographic , compared with 13.1 % for Channel 4 and 13 % for BBC1 .
ITV1 had 11.9 % while BBC2 took 8.5 % .
Multichannel took the lion 's share , with a 39.5 % chunk of viewing .
Five 's record audience remains the 5.4 million who watched another sci - fi movie premiere , Independence Day , in 1999 .
Last night was the first time the Terminator movie has been seen anywhere on UK TV because Five bought up both the terrestrial and pay - TV rights .
But not even Schwarzenegger could overcome the appeal of Foyle 's War , the last in the current run of the ITV wartime drama starring Michael Kitchen .
It finished with 7.5 million viewers , three in 10 viewers , at 9 pm .
Foyle 's War also eclipsed the first instalment of BBC1 's new costume drama , North and South .
The adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell 's novel , starring former EastEnder Daniela Denby - Ashe , Richard Armitage and Sinead Cusack , began with 6 million viewers , just under a quarter of the audience .
In a good night for ITV , Heartbeat once again took the spoils at 8 pm , with 9.1 million viewers against 5.2 million for Monarch of the Glen on BBC1 .
And ITV soap Emmerdale had 8.5 million against 5.7 million for Antiques Roadshow .
BBC2 's documentary series The Fight finished with 1.9 million , a 7 % share of the audience .
It had 200,000 more viewers than the 1.7 million who saw the climax to Channel 4 's marathon UK Music Hall of Fame , in which only one of the first six original featured artists were from the UK .
Earlier , BBC1 's coverage of the FA Cup first round clash between non - league Thurrock and League
One side Oldham Athletic had 1.6 million viewers , a 15 % share from 1.40pm .
The football beat ITV 's Jonathan Dimbleby and World Rally Championship , with 800,000 viewers apiece , but lost out to BBC2 's The Blue Max .
The 1966 movie , starring George Peppard and James Mason , had 1.8 million viewers , nearly a fifth of the audience .
Panorama , which last night looked at the genocide in Sudan , had 1.8 million viewers , a 9 % share of the audience at 10.15pm .
The start was boosted by the BBC news and had 900,000 more viewers than a Have

"In one corner of California , prosecutors in the Balco investigation are trying to blow the lid off the biggest steroids scandal in US history .
In another , a grass - roots political movement is endeavouring to change the country 's constitution so that the Austrian - born governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , arguably the most famous self - confessed steroid - user in the world , can one day run for president .
That nobody finds this dichotomy at the heart of America 's attitude to drugs in sport the slightest bit ironic is hardly surprising .
"" The use of performance - enhancing drugs in baseball , football and other sports is dangerous and it sends the wrong message : that there are short cuts to accomplishment and that performance is more important than character , "" President George W Bush said in his State of the Union address last January . ""
So tonight I call on team owners , union representatives , coaches and players to take the lead , to send the right signal , to get tough and to get rid of steroids now . ""
Even allowing for the fact that in a previous life , as owner of the Texas Rangers , Bush had signed José Canseco , once described as the "" Typhoid Mary of steroids "" , there was optimism that the president 's speech would usher in a new era of White House interest in the issue .
But when Schwarzenegger took the stage as a keynote speaker at the Republican presidential convention eight months later , steroids seemed to have disappeared from the agenda .
As soon as the first excerpts from Martin Bashir 's ABC television interview with the Balco founder Victor Conte began leaking out this week the moral equivocation began on the airwaves .
For every fan willing to denounce Marion Jones , Barry Bonds and other superstars as heroes with feet of clay , there were two trying to justify the use of performance - enhancing substances .
The most facetious argument proffered is that the drugs do n't work unless the talent is there , that the hand - eye co - ordination required to hit a baseball coming towards you at 95 mph can not be improved by bulking up on steroids .
Equally popular is the candid admission by many that they do n't care how Bonds hits home runs as long as he hits them .
In the wake of news that the New York Yankees ' Jason Giambi reportedly confessed to the Balco grand jury that he had used steroids , a host on WFAN , the No1 sports - talk radio station in New York , postulated that it was up to the athletes if they wanted to risk their long - term health for short - term gains .
Sixteen years after Ben Johnson 's gold in Seoul was stripped from him , this country appears to be a decade behind Europe in its approach to the problem .
From time to time media outlets tut - tut about the growing abuse of steroids by high school athletes .
According to a 2002 survey , 30 % of high school gridiron players use supplements to gain weight , and in California the road south to Tijuana , Mexico , which boasts 1,500 pharmacies that openly sell a cornucopia of performance - enhancing substances , is known among teenage boys as the Roid Corridor .
How puzzling , then , that two months ago Schwarzenegger vetoed a bill that would have required high - school coaches in the state to learn the dangers of steroids and would have established a list of banned substances .
Every Saturday morning , infomercials peddling HGH ( human growth hormone ) fill television time slots , and across the US gyms are overrun with the stuff .
The easy availability may explain the ambivalence towards them and it does n't help that there is no stigma attached to getting caught .
The former Oakland Raiders and Denver Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski is one of several NFL players alleged in the Balco investigation to have received the designer drug THG .
Now retired , he popped up on television the other week as a co - commentator for a college gridiron game involving his alma mater Boston College .
In other nations he might be considered a pariah .
Here he 's seen as an articulate analyst with a good future on the box .
Next Saturday Bonds comes to New York to meet fans at the Marriott Marquis in Times Square .
For an admission fee of $ 7,500 ( £ 3,900 ) , supporters can participate in a question - and - answer session with the home - run - hitting behemoth and the New York Yankees ' Alex Rodriguez .
To the outsider , it appears a ridiculous exercise .
Round here , they bill it as the Christmas gift for the fan who has everything .
Everything except the truth ."
"A European assignment at the Arnold Schwarzenegger Stadium may sound like an intimidating prospect but Middlesbrough will expect to triumph at the home of Grazer AK in mid - February .
Having topped their preliminary Uefa Cup group , Steve McClaren 's side were paired with the Austrian champions by yesterday 's third - round draw in Switzerland .
Apart from harbouring the benefit of facing Grazer at home in the decisive second leg , Boro 's appearance at a 15,000-capacity ground known affectionately as the Arnie coincides with the end of Austrian football 's winter break , meaning that McClaren 's team can expect to face ring - rusty hosts .
Although Heerenveen , Newcastle 's next Uefa Cup opponents , may boast a little more match practice , Graeme Souness 's side were similarly afforded second - leg home advantage against the Dutch side .
Not that the initial away journey is exactly long - haul .
"" The lads will be happy because it involves only a short trip across the North Sea , "" said Alan Shearer , the Newcastle captain .
"" It 's a good draw and the biggest plus is that we should have a tremendous amount of our fans behind us over there . ""
Provided Newcastle , semi- finalists last season , prevail , the fourth - round opposition will be either Olympiakos of Greece - eliminated by Liverpool from the Champions League - or the French club Sochaux , where Newcastle won 4 - 0 en route to winning their preliminary group .
Boro can anticipate a potential mid - March pairing with Sporting of Lisbon or Ruud Gullit 's Feyenoord in the last 16 .
Not that McClaren is taking victory against Grazer for granted .
Grazer succumbed only narrowly to Liverpool in the Champions qualifiers after winning at Anfield and then defeated Rangers on the way to finishing a disappointing third in their Uefa Cup group .
The Boro manager , who has visited the Arnie with Manchester United , said : "" They 're no mugs ; we 're the third British side they 'll have faced this season
and it 's not going to be easy , but we 'll hopefully attract a full house at The Riverside . ""
Such optimism may be ill - founded because Teessiders proved distinctly underwhelmed by the Uefa Cup 's overly synthetic second- round group stage .
Souness will probably simply be grateful for Newcastle 's continuance in a competition in which his domestic stutterers have accrued some criticism - deflecting wins .
His team will visit the northern Netherlands as clear favourites against a club who sold the Danish striker Jon Dahl Tomasson to one of his St James ' predecessors , Kenny Dalglish , for £ 2.5 m in 1997 .
"" We have a good feeling about this competition , "" said Russell Cushing , Newcastle 's chief operating officer , before recalling the Geordies ' penchant for self - destruction :
"" But we know apparently easy games can become difficult . ""
Henk Hoekstra , a Heerenveen director , said : "" We have a young side and this is an opportunity for them to make a name for themselves . ""
Heerenveen are fifth in the Netherlands , three points behind Gullit 's Feyenoord whom Boro hope to meet in March .
"" Our four Dutchmen ( Bolo Zenden , Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink , Michael Reiziger and George Boateng ) want Feyenoord , particularly Boateng who used to play for them , "" said Keith Lamb , Boro 's chief executive .
If Sporting Lisbon v Feyenoord ranks among the better February ties , Ajax v Auxerre and Valencia , the holders , v Steaua Bucharest appear the pick of the round ."
"In 1990 , which is almost unimaginably long ago in internet years , the notion that computer scientists might one day create an artificial replacement for human memory was the stuff of science fiction .
Literally so : the idea was the premise of Total Recall , the needlessly violent and confusing Arnold Schwarzenegger movie released that year by Twentieth Century Fox .
( The future governor of California was cast - appropriately , some might have argued - as a man who has had part of his brain stolen . )
Real computer science in 1990 was far more modest .
At McGill University in Canada , one of its practitioners , a student named Alan Emtage , was busy developing a program that would enable people to find documents on the embryonic computer network known as the internet .
He wanted to call it Archives , but the system he was using did n't allow names that long , so the first - ever search engine had to be called Archie instead .
At least , that 's probably how it happened : most of the information in the paragraph above comes - albeit double - checked - originally from sources reached through internet search engines .
Emtage could n't possibly have known at the time , but his invention gave birth to an idea that would come to change , at a fundamental level , the way we think .
Its most feverish point was reached yesterday , when Bill Gates officially launched MSN Search , Microsoft 's long - awaited rival to Google , the website that has become a sort of outboard brain for millions of people in the information age .
Google and its rivals no longer just point us in the direction of useful websites .
They help us navigate through online dictionaries and telephone directories , scholarly journals and image libraries ; one Google service launched this month allows clip - by - clip searching of American television news broadcasts .
The company has announced plans to digitise a million books from Oxford University 's Bodleian library , along with many millions more from Harvard , Stanford and the New York Public Library .
Enter "" time in Beijing "" into the AskJeeves.com search engine and it will tell you the actual time in Beijing ; put "" John - Stevens New - Mexico "" into Google and it will give you the phone numbers and home addresses of four people by that name in that state . ""
It becomes an extension of my mind , an extension of my taste , my sensibility , my active memory , "" says Sherry Turkle , a philosopher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston .
We no longer need to remember , yet nor can we ever truly forget , because everything 's out there , logged and stored .
It 's not so much that knowledge is power .
Dominating the market in the tools people use to navigate that knowledge - which is what Gates wants to do now - is the true source of power .
Own that , and is it too much of an overstatement to say that you own a little piece of people 's brains ?
In truth , Microsoft has been incredibly late in coming to the game .
A recent survey , conducted before the full launch of MSN Search , showed that the site that 66 % of Microsoft employees were using to do their searching was ...
Google .
The California - based company , founded in 1998 by the Stanford students Larry Page and Sergey Brin , revolutionised the concept of searching .
Its system relies on the wisdom of crowds - the belief that the more people link to a page , the more authoritative it becomes .
At a stroke , searching was democratised .
There was no need for people to sit at desks , categorising pages according to their subject matter ; the classification of information on the internet became a self - supporting , organic structure .
The power to find things on the internet was in the hands of the people , not the programmers .
( MSN Search appears to follow a similar logic . )
Google also happened upon an ingenious source of revenue for its ever - expanding operations .
As web users became increasingly exhausted by louder and louder and more and more annoying advertising , Google introduced low - key advertising on its results pages , matched to the words being searched for .
The ads got their value not by bludgeoning users around the head , but by being precisely targeted to their specific interests - an advertiser 's demographic dream .
Competition is hotting up : A9 , the search facility attached to the website of the bookseller Amazon.com , allows visitors to search the text and footnotes of books - real books , made of paper - before committing to purchasing them .
But do we really want all this new information ? ""
The end result of a perfect search world is that as fast as answers are generated and consumed , new questions come quicker , with the consequence that ignorance expands , "" the internet guru Kevin Kelly writes in an email .
"" What we know we do n't know expands faster than what we know .
This has been true for a while and will only continue .
Science , in fact , will come to be measured as the expansion of our ignorance , rather than an expansion of our knowledge . ""
Turkle , meanwhile , says she has noticed subtle transformations in the ways some of her students think and order their ideas .
"" There is this sense that the world is out there to be Googled , "" she says , "" and there is this associative glut .
But linking from one thing to another is not the same as having something to say .
A structured thought is more than a link . ""
Besides , she adds , something seems to be missing .
She is organising a forthcoming trip to Bangkok with her daughter , and recently pulled up search results promising 50,000 websites related to her area of interest , where before she would clip cuttings from magazines and keep them in files . ""
But there 's a superficiality , a sameness .
I get 50,000 sites , but the one I cut out from a magazine came from somewhere quirky , or it was something one of my friends had sent me .. ""
And then there 's the question of accuracy .
In fields where tracking down a completely correct fact is the very point of the job , people still regard search engines as very far from direct access points to the truth .
David Elias , a professional verifier of answers for television quizzes , says he tends to mistrust the web - ""
There 's so much rubbish out there "" .
"" The rule is that you have to have two independent sources saying the same thing , "" says Katie Purnell , who researched questions for the quiz show Grand Slam .
"" We would very rarely go with a question if we could only find the answers by searching the internet .
There 's still something about the Encylopaedia Britannica . ""
( Although the Encyclopaedia Britannica is , naturally , online . )
But there is no sign of any diminution of our appetite for what aficionados now know simply by the noun "" search "" .
Over the past year , the battle between the search engines has intensified dramatically , and last year AOL and Yahoo launched their own search technologies .
Google continues to be the market leader , and now commands around 42 % of all internet searches - a commanding , but far from unassailable position .
Enormous sums are involved : the company 's flotation , last autumn , raised more than $ 1bn on the opening day , and its price now stands at almost $ 200 a share .
It is all a very long way from just a few years ago , when what you put on the web was what mattered , not how you helped people find it .
With the market consolidated between a handful of strong players , the biggest threat to Google and MSN Search will be from non - traditional companies who choose to do something daring : abandon Google 's page - ranking model .
Sites with names like Orase and Technorati are offering a new phenomenon , real - time searching , which catches events and web - pages as they are put on the internet , instead of sending "" spiders "" through the web to index them afterwards .
Meanwhile , a variety of new tools promise to seamlessly integrate searching for data on the web with searching for data on our own computers .
It need not stop there : if internet telephone calls become as ubiquitous as email , why should n't we search through archives of our every conversation ?
Every new development is a new opportunity to deliver value to the user ( and thus , not coincidentally , to advertise to them even more effectively ) .
If search engines really do function as artificial memories , they are memories that are set to become ever larger and ever more rapidly updated .
But will being able to access more information really help us do the things we want to do ?
Dr Eric Davies , a library scientist at Loughborough University , has seen it all : long rows of card index files , followed by proprietary computer - search systems installed in libraries , and now the internet . ""
Fundamentally the important point remains the same , "" he says .
"" Before you go anywhere near a keyboard or a catalogue , you have to define the subject you 're after .
These are disciplines we need to recover , "" he adds , with only the faintest trace of exasperation , "" and instil in people who just have the Google mentality .
"" You ca n't fight technology , Sherry Turkle says , but you can influence the way it changes your life .
"" I ca n't ask my students to pretend they do n't live in this century , "" she says .
"" But you have to put the technology in its place . ""
Which is the best engine to use ?
Simple searching For a no - frills query , good old Google remains the best .
But if you 're looking to organise and refine the results - eg , you 're after Franz Ferdinand the band , but are bombarded with pages eulogising the assassinated archduke - you want a clustering site .
These use a combination of major engine results , which are sorted into folders grouping similar items together .
Clusty ( http://clusty.com ) is the most user friendly .
Clusty can uncover unexpected results and relationships between items - who 'd have thought McFly was not only a band and a character in Back to the Future , but an angling accessory too ?

"Arnold Schwarzenegger and the entire leading cast of Terminator 3 have been written out of the planned fourth film in the science fiction series .
With the state of California now in his care , perhaps it 's not so surprising that the musclebound former action hero has not found the time to make a starring appearance in Terminator 4 , but he had been scheduled to make at least a cameo .
Schwarzenegger 's two co - stars from the poorly received Terminator 3 , Clare Danes and Nick Stahl , also appear to have been consigned to the Skynet refuse heap .
"" None of the cast is coming back , "" Stahl , who played John Connor in the third film , told Sci - Fi Wire .
"" The story is changing conceptually .
I believe it 's a jump to the future , so my character will be quite a bit older .
That 's all that I know .
So I 'm not coming back , which is a drag . ""
The last film ended with the pair set to unite the survivors of Armageddon in a bid to destroy Skynet and ensure the survival of mankind , so it will be interesting to see how the screenwriters manage to handle the jump forward in time .
Die - hard fans of James Cameron 's original sci - fi noir and its bombastic 1991 sequel will be forgiven for having switched off the last blinking red light and gone home long ago ."
"Security personnel examining the Middlesbrough players ' luggage as they left Durham Tees Valley airport yesterday might have been surprised to note that each bag contained at least one pair of tights .
Such leg - wear is , however , common at the Arnold Schwarzenegger Stadium at this time of year and could be just what Steve McClaren 's side need when they kick off against Grazer AK tonight .
With snow predicted and the temperature in Graz forecast as low as -14C the first leg of the first knockout stage of the Uefa Cup may prove one of the coldest games several of Boro 's players have experienced .
Austrian football has just resumed after its winter break and Chris Riggott joked : "" We might even see Joseph Job [ a Cameroon international and the most fashion - conscious Boro player ] in tights tomorrow .
I had to remind him to pack a warm pair . ""
Bolo Zenden , who , like Ray Parlour , returns to the Boro midfield after suspension , said : "" They will be more used to the conditions but it is their first game back after the winter break , so we do n't know what to expect .
"" Boro 's image was revamped by last season 's League Cup win ; securing the second trophy of the club 's history in their maiden European campaign would enhance the process .
McClaren 's attempt to reach the last 16 and earn a meeting with Sporting Lisbon or Feyenoord has even been helped by Liverpool and Rangers .
Liverpool narrowly defeated the Austrian champions in the Champions League qualifying round and Rangers lost to them in the group stage of this competition .
"" Liverpool and Rangers have given us videos and scouting reports , "" said McClaren , whose side topped their qualifying group after conceding just three goals .
"" You would say we are favourites but Grazer are no mugs .
We do n't know whether their winter break will work for or against them
but we 've an experienced bunch of players who expect to win .
"" Middlesbrough ( 4 - 4 - 2 , probable ) : Schwarzer ; Reiziger , Riggott , Southgate , Queudrue ; Morrison , Parlour , Zenden , Downing ; Hasselbaink , Job .
TV :
Channel Five , kick - off 5.30pm"
"Middlesbrough 's Uefa Cup hopes survived a torrid test as they escaped with a draw at the Arnold Schwarzenegger Stadium last night .
Steve McClaren 's side , facing the Austrian champions in the first leg of their round - of-32 tie , produced one of their worst performances of the season in the opening half .
The second period was a different story as they twice took the lead through Boudewijn Zenden and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink - only for equalising goals from Mario Bazina and Roland Kollmann to set up what will be a tense second leg at the Riverside next Thursday .
Boro 's quest will be aided by the fact that Kollmann , who set Austria on the road to a famous comeback in last September 's World Cup qualifying draw against England , is suspended after being sent off late on for two bookable offences .
McClaren was left disappointed afterwards .
"" We should have won it , "" he said .
"" We had the advantage and if you are going to win away in Europe then you have to defend a whole lot better than we did for the two goals .
You need total concentration .
So we go back to the Riverside with an advantage , although there is still a long way to go in this tie .
We have to finish off the job we started here . ""
McClaren was bemused by the decision making of the Croatian referee Edo Trivkovic .
"" I do n't think it was a free - kick for their second goal , "" he said .
"" It was a ridiculous decision , but then there were a few for both sides , although you always get strange refereeing when you play in Europe . ""
From McClaren 's point of view the first 45 minutes were as bad as it gets , the only saving grace being Grazer AK 's inept finishing .
This was the first game back for coach Walter Schachner 's side after a two - month winter break , but it was Boro who were caught cold as the temperatures dipped below freezing .
In the first minute Franck Queudrue failed to prevent Imants Bleidelis , the former Southampton midfielder signed from Viborg during last month 's transfer window , from delivering a low cross .
After a suspicion of handball from the Boro captain , Gareth Southgate , Mathias Dollinger drilled a 20-yard drive inches wide .
McClaren 's defenders were out of position again in the 20th minute when Kollmann took a free - kick after Queudrue had brought down Rene Aufhauser .
The centre - back Anton Ehmann was given the freedom to meet the cross but headed over .
Still the opportunities came , with Mark Schwarzer producing a superb save in the 34th minute to keep out Ehmann 's shot .
Six minutes later Queudrue and Southgate got in each other 's way and the ball fell to Bleidelis , but he shot wide .
The visitors were ahead six minutes after the restart even though McClaren persisted with a 4 - 5 - 1 formation .
Zenden picked the ball up in midfield , surged ahead and turned inside Ehmann before drilling a 20-yard shot inside Andreas Schranz 's right - hand post .
Four minutes later Grazer showed they were not prepared to roll over , with Kollmann feeding Bazina to his left for a first - time shot that Schwarzer parried .
The same combination conjured up the equaliser in the 65th minute , with Kollmann again playing in Bazina on the left after a Doriva mistake .
Schwarzer got a hand to his shot - only for the ball trickle over the line .
Inside 90 seconds Boro were back in front , with Hasselbaink playing the ball out wide to Downing , whose cross picked out the Dutchman for a header from four yards out for his 12th goal of the season .
But Grazer hit back again with Trivkovic awarding a free - kick for Samir Muratovic simply falling over and Kollmann curling home his 15th goal of the season .
A minute later , though , he was booked a second time for what Trivkovic claimed was a dive -yet on this occasion appeared to be a clear foul from Southgate , giving Boro a boost for the return leg ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger is attempting to attract film - makers back to Hollywood with tax cuts .
The former actor , who is now governor of California , is trying to revive Hollywood 's fortunes as producers increasingly head to cheaper locations such as Canada and eastern Europe to make films .
Many US states have also recently upped their efforts to attract both film and television productions .
Louisiana , New Mexico and New York have all passed new tax incentives , making shooting there ever cheaper .
Now Schwarzenegger is preparing a proposal as part of his state budget which will increase tax credits for any productions spending at least 75 % of their budget in California .
Although the new plan will not be able to match the tax cuts of certain US states , Variety reports that Schwarzenegger 's aides , along with those in the California Film Commission , are confident that the state 's "" added extras "" such as a better talent pool and appealing climate will make a difference too .
Schwarzenegger insists the incentives will benefit California 's entire economy generating higher sales and income tax revenue for the state .
Figures released in the UK this week showed that the number of films made in Britain dropped by 40 % over the past year after the withdrawal of tax incentives in 2004 .
Many films folded as chancellor Gordon Brown announced the government was closing a tax - relief loophole .
However , the government insisted that it was still committed to supporting the UK film industry and that some tax relief would be extended ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger has defended his use of steroids and said he has no regrets about using performance - enhancing drugs .
The Terminator star has long acknowledged using steroids as a professional bodybuilder but admits he would not change a thing .
"" I have no regrets about it because at that time it was something new that came on the market , and we went to the doctor and did it under doctors ' supervision , "" he said .
But the California governor told ABC News that he would not encourage anyone to use drugs .
His comments come just days before the Bay Area Laboratory Co - Operative steroid scandal is due to be heard in a US court .
Mr Schwarzenegger defended his decision to veto a bill that would have required high - school coaches to teach about the dangers of steroids and illegal substances because he said the bill lumped food supplements in with illegal drugs ."
"Just like the Terminator in his film trilogy , Arnold Schwarzenegger says he will keep coming back for more unless he gets his way on pension reform .
The California governor and former action film hero said yesterday that he was prepared to call a referendum if necessary over his plans for a partial privatisation of the state 's employee pension provision .
The move goes further than anything the British government has put forward during the debate in the UK over public sector pension reform .
The shift from final salary pensions , which are guaranteed by employers , to schemes that rely on investment returns is more akin to the pension reforms pushed through by corporations on both sides of the Atlantic .
Public sector unions in Britain are preparing to strike over plans to cut back on some benefits in the state scheme , including an increase in the retirement age from 60 to 65 years old .
Unison , the largest public sector union with 1.3 million members , will know the result of its ballot at the end of next week .
Mr Schwarzenegger has drawn up plans to cut pension provision for public sector workers following reports that the cost of running guaranteed state pensions will spiral as life expectancy increases .
The Republican governor said he was willing to negotiate with the Democrat - dominated legislature , but would move to a referendum if an agreement failed to emerge before the summer .
The plan to change the state 's public pension funds , including the California Public Employees ' Retirement System ( Calpers ) , the largest US pension fund , has attracted attention because it mirrors George Bush 's efforts to reform the US social security system .
While polls show Mr Bush fighting an uphill battle , Mr Schwarzenegger 's celebrity has attracted national attention . ""
Do n't think that we are watering down anything or that we are compromising or softening our stance on pensions , "" Mr Schwarzenegger said .
Unions said the former body builder was only opening the door to wider debate following growing complaints from public sector workers and threats of industrial action .
Office workers , teachers , police and firefighters are rallying against it , and union leaders vowed to help fund a campaign against the initiative .
Under the new scheme , California state workers would be prevented from joining the existing secure final salary pension scheme .
Instead they must pay into an occupational money purchase scheme similar to a personal pension , known in the US as a 401k plan .
Unions said a lobbying campaign by business leaders , such as the Disney boss , Michael Eisner , and Sanford Weill , Citigroup chairman , was also behind the demands for reform .
Business leaders have argued that Calpers , and its sister fund , the California State Teachers Retirement System ( Calsters ) , which have combined assets of $ 250bn ( £ 130bn ) , have been over zealous in their pursuit of more accountability in business .
Calpers led the shareholder revolt against Walt Disney last year that resulted in Mr Eisner being stripped of the chairman 's job .
He is still chief executive .
In Britain , the fund has argued for more transparent structures at Shell and against the appointment of James Murdoch at Sky .
Business scored a victory in December when union supporter Sean Harrigan , president of Calpers , was ousted by a three - to - two vote of trustees , one of whom had been placed on the board by Mr Schwarzenegger ."
"Stem cells are being touted as the next big thing in research , so it was not surprising that the government prefaced its research budget announcement last Monday with promises for more cash for biotechnology .
But there is no earmarked fund for stem cells - nothing to compete with the $ 3bn ( £ 1.6bn )
Californian bonanza announced by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger last year .
This means that it will be up to the research councils themselves to decide how much to spend on stem cells .
Their delivery plans , expected in May , are sure to place it high on their list of priorities .
But the basic research they fund predominantly is only one side of the coin .
For the UK to cash in on its stem - cell investment , support is needed for companies to bring discoveries from the lab into the clinics .
The UK has a history of making discoveries but failing to capitalise on them .
It happened with magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scanning : it was developed over here in the 60s and 70s , but later brought to the market in the US .
In order for this not to happen with stem - cell research , there needs to be a coherent funding strategy .
This , alongside a simplification of the bureaucracy , is what the UK needs to stay ahead of the game , according to Professor Roger Pedersen , head of the Cambridge Stem Cell Institute .
Pedersen , who defected from the US to the UK in 2001 , was speaking at the launch of the East of England Stem Cell Network last Tuesday .
Also last Tuesday , Dr Ian Gibson , the ever - vocal chair of the House of Commons science and technology select committee , told fellow MPs that there needed to be more funding to bring stem - cell therapies to market .
"" There is little or even no money for the translational steps from existing sources , "" he said .
In reply , health minister Melanie Johnson said that the government was interested in the suggestion for a stem cell foundation .
The foundation , backed by financiers in the City , would distribute £ 100 m of public and private money , with a focus on clinical development .
In fact , there is more funding for innovation in last week 's research budget .
Knowledge - transfer funds go up by 41 % from 2004 - 05 to over £ 110,000 in 2007 - 08 .
However , these figures should be read with caution as universities will be charging more for the research they do from September , meaning that budget increases will partly cover these extra costs rather than funding new initiatives .
The government prides itself on its regulatory framework , which allows stem - cell research to take place in the UK , quoting it as the reason why researchers come here from all over the world .
But with significant funds being set aside in places like Singapore and California , the government should not be complacent .
The research councils ' £ 40 m stem - cell fund from the last spending review runs out in 2006 .
Beyond that , there will be money for research .
But without targeted innovation funds the UK risks missing a trick in the commercialisation stakes .

"A controversial project by a group of armed private Americans to patrol the border with Mexico has received an unexpected boost from California 's governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Twice last week the Austrian - born actor - turned - politician praised the Minuteman project in Arizona , saying it was an understandable response to the failure of the federal government to patrol the border .
He said the group would be welcome to patrol California 's border with Mexico .
His comments came just a week after he said the border with Mexico should be "" sealed "" .
He subsequently withdrew the remarks .
Mr Schwarzenegger told a Los Angeles radio station last Thursday that the Minuteman group had done a "" terrific "" job .
"" They 've cut down the crossing of illegal immigrants a huge percentage .
So it just shows that it works when you make an effort .
It 's just that our federal government is not doing their job . ""
The next day he reinforced his praise for the group , condemned as "" vigilantes "" by George Bush .
"" When the government ... does n't do its job , then the private citizens go out and it 's like a neighbourhood patrol .
"" The Minutemen spent April patrolling a 23-mile stretch of the border in Arizona .
Their aim , organisers said , was to spot and report suspected illegal migrants .
The group claimed to have helped the capture of almost 350 people .
Mr Schwarzenegger 's comments were condemned by Democrats , immigrants ' rights groups , the Mexican government and some Republicans .
"" The hypocrisy of the governor is incredible , "" Mark Silverman of the Immigrant Legal Resource Centre told the San Francisco Chronicle , pointing out that Mr Schwarzenegger had admitted working illegally when he first entered the US .
The Mexican foreign ministry reminded him that Mexico was California 's largest export market ."
"Taking over one of the best universities in the world proved a nightmare at first for Robert Dynes .
When he became president of the University of California in October 2003 , it was being bled white , as the state 's finances descended into chaos .
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , who had just been elected on promises to sort out the mess , was said to be eyeing the higher education budget , one of the few areas where he had the discretion to make cuts .
Everyone assumed a research university was n't a cause close to the Terminator 's heart .
It was probably full of girlie men , anyway .
The governor , it was reported , wanted to slash state funding to UC and California State University by at least 8 % , at the same time raising tuition fees for the state 's residents by 10 % , in an effort to tackle a $ 14bn ( £ 7.8bn ) deficit .
Since 2000 , the university 's operating budget from the state had dropped by 15 % , while student numbers had risen by 19 % - an effective cut of 33 % , as Dynes pointed out to legislators .
Dynes met the governor face to face and they talked for an hour and a half .
Far from being blown away , Dynes emerged with a deal to stop the cuts and stabilise the university budget .
He was put through a staccato barrage of questions from the governor , who made him explain the nature of a research university and how it contributed to California 's economy , the sixth largest in the world . ""
He was asking good questions .
At one point he said , ' Are you worried ? '
and I said , ' Yes , I 'm worried about budgets and losing faculty . '
He said , ' What can I do to help ? ' , "" says Dynes .
The UC president proposed a six - year compact to turn around the decline in budgets and offer staff a glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel .
Schwarzenegger agreed .
The state budget is still being fought over , but Dynes believes the governor will deliver .
Not that this made Dynes popular with all his colleagues , or the majority Democrats in the Californian legislature .
"" I was under a lot of criticism for having sold out to the devil , but he has been enormously supportive , "" says Dynes , who was in the UK last week to talk to scientists and business people about collaboration , and to explore joint projects with Oxford , whose vice - chancellor , John Hood , is an old friend .
One potential link - up is on stem cell research .
The UK has been able to take a lead in this field thanks to the Bush administration 's restrictions in the US .
California is keen to get back in the race and the state has raised $ 3bn for the purpose .
Among those Dynes met in London was Roger Pedersen , a leading stem cell researcher who quit UC San Francisco for Cambridge to continue his work .
Dynes also mentions Africa , where he feels UC could contribute expertise in health and agriculture , perhaps in tandem with Oxford .
UC has collaborations all over the world - while other institutions ponder their fees policy , it merits a foreign policy .
With 208,000 students , UC is enormous .
In effect , it is a coalition of nine universities that would be large by UK standards , with a 10th on the way - Merced in the San Joaquin Valley .
Its influence , however , is attributable not to its size , but to the quality of its research at campuses such as Berkeley , UCLA and San Diego .
Since 1995 , its researchers have claimed 17 Nobel prizes .
And , for the 11th year running , UC has come top of the US league for patents .
On average its researchers produce three patents a day , with obvious benefits to the economy , as Dynes keeps telling state legislators .
UC 's areas of research range from nuclear weapons to winemaking .
"" The things we do affect every Californian , "" says Dynes .
British academics and policy - makers tend to be fixated by Ivy League private universities such as Harvard and Princeton , but the great American public universities , of which California can claim to be the leader , provide a much more realistic comparison with universities here .
The problems are similar - how to cope with falling state funding , how to raise more money from students while opening access to the poorest families , how to balance the demands of research and teaching - but the approach is rather different .
The size of the American state universities gives them political clout .
Imagine a grouping that included , say , Oxford , Birmingham , Bristol
plus half a dozen others , or a University of London that acted as a cohesive body .
But funding for higher education is one of the few things states can cut when the going gets tough - and they have been doing so for 20 years to keep taxes down .
So the head of a state university has to lobby hard .
Dynes spends a lot of time travelling , meeting the public and local politicians .
The Governator evidently did n't mistake the rangy , Canadian - born physicist for a girlie man and Dynes did n't make the error of patronising the actor - turned - politician , though he admits : "" I was surprised he was so focused on finding out what a research university was all about . ""
After 22 years in industrial research at Bell Laboratories , Dynes went to UC San Diego to pursue his research into semiconductors , eventually becoming chancellor ( in British terms , vice - chancellor ) of San Diego .
He is deeply concerned about the state of science and maths teaching in schools .
Some he has visited had no qualified teachers in the subjects at all .
Last month he and Schwarzenegger agreed on a plan they call "" a thousand teachers , a million minds "" .
The university has undertaken to produce 1,000 maths and science teachers a year for the next 10 years .
Schwarzenegger will be wheeled out to appeal to students and persuade them to enter a noble profession .
UC is following through with a programme to ensure they gain classroom experience with "" master teachers "" during their degrees .
Leading companies such as Pixar and Sun Microsystems will offer internships , which Dynes hopes will not only help financially but keep graduates up to date with technology .
The hardest part is retention - the state has agreed to write off student loans over five years if graduates teach in certain school districts .
Why should the head of a research university get so involved in schools ?
"" It 's unstable to have one of the best universities in the world and dismal K-12 [ schooling from kindergarten to 12th grade ] .
If we ca n't correct that over time , the instability will show up in the university .
If high school graduates ' education is deteriorating , we are deteriorating , "" he says .
UC is proud of its record on access .
A third of undergraduates are eligible for federal Pell grants because they are from low - income families , higher than the rate for other research universities .
Historically , UC has tried to keep tuition fees low , but this year it put them up by 8 % to just over $ 6,000 ( £ 3,300 ) a year , to compensate for cuts in state funding .
The university has pledged to set aside 25 % of new revenue to help poor students , but Dynes concedes it is difficult to get this message across to low - income families .
Every time fees go up , the news is greeted with protests and marches .
In California , the subject for discussion is not whether 50 % should go into higher education , but how to cope with the numbers applying .
Under a master plan of the 1960s , the top 12.5 % of high school graduates are guaranteed a place at UC and a further third at California State .
The rest can go to community colleges and , provided they perform satisfactorily , on to UC campuses after two years .
Student numbers in the first two years at UC make up 40 % of the total population , but the second two years form 60 % , showing that thousands have taken this route .
That should not compromise the university 's research mission , says Dynes .
"" Our job is not to teach students out of a book but to teach them to think .
That 's part of the research process , too . ""
He believes one of the tasks of a research university is to expose undergraduates to the research environment .
"" I do n't know how else you can teach creativity .
To create that spark in an undergraduate ... that is the education process .
Not stuffing books down people 's throats , but generating inqusitive people . ""
He recalls the excitement he felt as a physics student when he discovered something .
"" When I look back , it seems trivial now , but I remember being elated .
It lights a fire . ""
So what does he think about the UK government 's policy of concentrating research in fewer university departments ?
"" It 's a big mistake , "" he says .

In the latest crack to appear in the wall of support for Arnold Schwarzenegger , the governor of California , one of his own has turned against him .
Warren Beatty , famed lothario , politico and thespian , has broken ranks with the polite silence many Hollywood Democrats have maintained on Mr Schwarzenegger to deliver a caustic speech attacking the bodybuilder and actor turned politician .
His speech at a graduation ceremony in Berkeley , the heart of Californian radicalism , has prompted a flurry of speculation : will Beatty run against Schwarzenegger in next year 's gubernatorial election ?
Beatty 's words should speak for themselves : "" I do n't want to run for governor , "" he told his audience at the University of California .
But he went on to say , "" I 'm an opponent of his muscle - bound conservatism with a longer experience in politics than he has ...
I 'd do one helluva lot better job than he 's done . ""
By midweek , Beatty was sounding less committed to the notion of not running for governor of the state with the largest population in America and the fifth - largest economy in the world .
"" One never knows at what point one becomes sufficiently inflamed to take a step that one does not basically want to take , "" he told reporters .
The Schwarzenegger camp attempted to defuse the challenge , first with humour and then with scorn . ""
Warren is just mad at Republicans because he is afraid they 're going to cut off his social security , "" said a spokesman .
Another referred to Beatty as a "" crackpot "" .
Declaring , "" We are not the governor 's dumbbells "" , Beatty used the speech to attack Mr Schwarzenegger for playing cheap politics , for his rightwing agenda and for cloaking himself in the aura of the Kennedys .
Mr Schwarzenegger 's wife , Maria Shriver , is a niece of JF Kennedy .
He attacked Mr Schwarzenegger for trivialising politics : "" Ca n't we accept that devotion to the building of the body politic is more complex and a little more sensitive than devotion to body building ?
Does that make me a ' girly man ' ? ...
Cut down on the photo - ops , the fake events , the fake issues , the fake crowds , "" he urged the governor .
Beatty , who has never run for political office , has been a prominent Democrat for many years , although he kept a low - profile in last year 's presidential election , sensing that the Republican party had successfully demonised "" Hollywood liberals "" .
His political convictions have spilled over into his film career .
He directed and starred in Reds , the stirring film version of Ten Days that Shook the World , an eyewitness account of the Russian Revolution .
But his most notable foray into on - screen politics was his 1998 film Bulworth , which saw him play a political candidate who starts telling people the truth .
Should this be the blueprint for a future run for office by Beatty , he may want to drop the most innovative part of Bulworth 's strategy : his unexpected ability to rap ."
"Coast of Dreams : A History of Contemporary California by Kevin Starr ( Allen Lane £ 30 , pp784 )
Schwarzenegger Syndrome by Gary Indiana ( New Press £ 13.99 , pp140 )
Long before that great psephological soap opera the 2003 recall election made ex - body builder and fading action hero Arnold Schwarzenegger the celebrity governor of the world 's sixth largest economy , California was a society teetering on the edge of all kinds of disaster , both natural and manmade .
It was also , as Kevin Starr describes , a society of Dickensian contrasts , from Beverly Hills luxury to Los Angeles riots and new - age therapies to dot.com frenzy .
Starr , a professor of history at the University of southern California , has devoted much of his career to writing about the Golden State , and sets considerable store by cheerfully skewering some of the myths by which the wider world has interpreted life in the far - out west .
But as much as he is concerned to debunk , he also paints a vivid picture of a society in the midst of appropriately volcanic change , from its surging immigration to its imploding economic base .
There is , says Starr , a probability that the place has ' gone seriously awry ' .
Some people would say that it was ' awry ' from the get - go .
Coast of Dreams : a History of Contemporary California begins in the surf at San Clemente , in sight of former President Nixon 's western White House and ends with Schwarzenegger , the archetypal immigrant , groping his way to victory in the madness of the recall election .
In between , Starr celebrates the teeming energy of a state whose culture and wealth continues to dominate the world .
But for how much longer ?
That 's a question that lurks behind Schwarzenegger Syndrome : Politics and Celebrity in the Age of Contempt .
If Starr 's account is the heavyweight Brandoesque performance , Gary Indiana 's feisty essay is the cool , rake - thin supermodel version , the rapier to Starr 's blunderbuss .
Horrified by the Governator 's famous self - reinventions , Indiana eviscerates Arnie 's ascendancy in what he calls ' a society where fetishised images seem more credible than reality ' .
It 's a blistering , slightly confusing , polemic .
As well as merrily trashing California 's trivialisation of the democratic process , Indiana offers a spirited explanation of the state 's budget deficit , its energy crisis , and what he discerns as its cultural bankruptcy .
Most entertaining of all , he convincingly demonstrates how America 's richest state was thrown into chaos by the corporate fraud perpetrated by a succession of Republican governors and Bush cronies .
This , supremely , is a book for insiders and anoraks who know their ' girly - men ' from their Proposition 21 .
Coast of Dreams , at five times the length , is the book that commentators will probably turn to when the Governator takes his case to the electorate this autumn .
Indiana will make them question the Governator , but Starr will give them the ammunition to zap him where it hurts - in the polls ."
"He will have the body of Arnold Schwarzenegger and the brain of Stephen Hawking .
Step forward the Pentagon 's perfect Hollywood hero , possibly coming soon to a screen near you .
According to the New York Times , the US military is paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to send scientists on a screenwriting course in Los Angeles , with the aim of producing movies and television shows that portray scientists in a flattering light .
It is being billed as a radical solution to one of America 's most vexing long - term national security problems : the drastic decline in the number of US students pursuing science and engineering .
The students at a five - day course at the American Film Institute included experts in rocket science , nanotechnology and genetics .
They agreed that films such as Deep Impact , the 1998 blockbuster starring Robert Duvall and Morgan Freeman , were the sort that should be emulated .
While the decline in interest in science is a problem for US industry as a whole , it is particularly acute for defence laboratories , which , because of security concerns , can not use immigrants to take up the slack .
The idea of teaching screenwriting to scientists was that of Martin Gunderson , a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Southern California and a technical adviser to Hollywood . ""
My thought was , since scientists have to write so much , for technical journals and papers , why not consider them as a creative source ?

"California 's governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , is offering seats in a luxury box to see the Rolling Stones next weekend - provided would - be concert - goers donate $ 100,000 ( £ 55,000 ) to his campaign funds .
His offer for the gig in Boston caps a fundraising swing that is to begin next week for Mr Schwarzenegger 's November special vote on reforms .
He called referendums to push a wide range of proposals on issues such as state spending , education and abortion .
Donors contributing $ 100,000 apiece will be invited to watch the concert with Mr Schwarzenegger in a luxury box .
The lead sponsor of the Stones ' 2005 tour , the Ameriquest mortgage lender , has given him a number of prime seats .
Fran Curtis , the Stones ' publicist , said the band had no role in the governor 's fundraiser ."
"The honeymoon is over for California 's governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger .
The bodybuilder - turned - actor - turned - politician is facing plummeting popularity .
An opinion poll this week showed Mr Schwarzenegger with an approval rating of only 34 % - a 31-point drop in the past year .
This puts him even lower than President George W Bush , who won an approval rating of 38 % from Californians interviewed for the survey .
Mr Schwarzenegger tried to gloss over the dismal ratings in a series of radio interviews .
"" I had a choice a year ago , "" he said .
"" Do I want to continue my 70 % popularity rating and keep quiet and not create the reforms we need and not rattle the cage and upset the status quo ?
Or do I really want to keep my promise ? ""
He won election on a reformist platform in November 2003 , promising to do away with "" politics as usual "" and to go directly to the voters if state politicians refused to embrace his ideas .
Almost two years on , people no longer see him as an outsider coming in to reform the government of a state that has one of the 10 largest economies in the world .
Instead , say analysts , voters view him as a political insider - and therefore part of the problem .
His decision to go directly to the voters this November with a special election to push through a series of reforms has generated at best apathy and at worst outright hostility .
"" It 's very hard for him to be running an initiative campaign from inside the governor 's office , "" Mark Baldassare , director of the Public Policy Institute of California , which conducted the latest poll , told the Sacramento Bee newspaper .
"" It 's hard for people ... to at this point feel he is not part of [ the ] political process in Sacramento . ""
Mr Schwarzenegger 's ratings have steadily declined since he proposed cutting benefits for public - sector workers , including nurses , teachers , firefighters and the police .
Since the early summer , he has faced a stream of negative advertising from unions representing nurses and teachers .
Mr Schwarzenegger has still not said definitely whether he will seek re - election next year , although he said this week : "" I am not here for the short run .
I am a follow - through guy . """
"The business people at the other end of the Glasgow hotel room can not help themselves .
Curious about all the racket , they peer over the tops of their newspapers .
Paula Sage is bounding about doing impressions of Arnold Schwarzenegger , or "" the guvnor , "" as she playfully insists we refer to him .
Sage , a true friend of the camera if ever there was one , is relishing having her photograph taken .
With an impish grin she proclaims : "" I 'll be back "" a la Arnie , as she manoeuvres seamlessly to the photographer 's requests .
Aged 25 , she has a cheeky , mischievous wit .
She delights in mocking me if I ask what she regards as a stupid question ; she is canny , funny , quick with a quip and has the sort of infectious smile that makes everyone around her do the same .
Her father , Alan , a university lecturer , who is acting as chaperone ( a family member always accompanies her to interviews ) sits in an armchair brimming with pride .
Sage is a rare talent .
She is an Olympic medallist , winning silver for netball at this year 's Special Olympics in Glasgow . ""
I love my netball , "" she beams .
"" I would have liked the gold , although silver is good too .
It was awesome . ""
But extraordinary as her sporting achievements are , it is for her accomplishments as an actor that she is best known .
Her acting has earned her a string of high profile admirers - among them designer Georgio Armani , who recently made a £ 250,000 donation to a learning disability charity after seeing her on the big screen . '
I love Sir Sean ' A mere three years after she began her acting career , Sage , who has Down 's Syndrome , is already making her mark among Scotland 's acting fraternity .
One of her favourite anecdotes is about meeting Sean Connery at the Edinburgh Film Festival .
Connery was formally introducing the film in which Sage was starring , the critically acclaimed , award - winning Scottish independent film , Afterlife , about a young girl who has Down 's Syndrome .
Sage got to appear on stage with him . ""
I love Sir Sean , "" she says with an faux , ironic bow .
Sage bagged a fistful of awards for her performance in Afterlife , including a Bafta .
The film won the Edinburgh Film Festival Audience Award in 2003 .
Such has been the rapid trajectory of her rise that Sage now has charities queueing up to enlist her services .
Last year she was signed up as an ambassador for Down 's Syndrome Scotland and became a patron of the Ann Craft Trust alongside Love
Actually star Bill Nighy .
Last month she agreed to become an ambassador for the learning disability charity , Mencap .
Some of the other ambassadors , Radio 1 DJ Jo Whiley , investigative reporter Donal MacIntyre , Lisa Scott - Lee ( of defunct popsters
Steps ) , Pop Idol winner Will Young and actor Christopher Eccleston , signed up because they have family or friends who have learning disabilities , but Sage is the first person with Down 's Syndrome to become a Mencap ambassador .
How does she feel about it ?
"" It 's brilliant , "" she says in her soft Glaswegian brogue . ""
Fan - tastic !
I 'm doing it because it might help people who have what I 've got realise what they can do . ""
Mencap 's chief executive , Jo Williams , echoes the concerns of many disability campaigners disappointed that opportunities for disabled performers remain limited .
She hopes Sage 's example "" will encourage more writers , producers , and directors to realise the talent that is out there and create more roles for performers with a learning disability "" .
Sage went to primary school in Cumbernauld , just outside Glasgow , and later split her time between Merkland school in Kirkintilloch and Our Lady 's high school in Cumbernauld ( Merkland caters for pupils with moderate learning disabilities ) .
She passed four standard grade exams in English , maths , science and social and vocational studies .
Her school life was happy and fulfilling , she says .
"" I loved it ! ""
After school she went to Falkirk College where she completed a three - year course .
It was there , while studying drama , that she discovered a love of acting .
But Sage 's professional acting career began by accident .
She was attending a weekly drama group in her home town of Cumbernauld ( one of the many clubs with which she fills her week ) when the director and producers of Afterlife paid a visit as part of a tour the country in search of the right actor .
They chose Sage from a shortlist of 14 .
How did she feel about being selected out of all those girls ?
The cheeky grin surfaces . ""
Let 's just say I outsmarted them . ""
She chuckles .
"" What can I say ?
I 'm a natural with the camera . ""
"" We never ever thought that Paula would do what she has done , "" her father confides .
"" Paula has been amazing .
She got up before 7 am six days a week for six weeks
it took to shoot Afterlife .
She just got on with it . ""
But Sage did more than get on with it .
Afterlife is one of the those small British movies ( it had a budget of just £ 320,000 ) that could have descended into trite sentimentalism .
But it did not .
It had a strong script ( written by Andrea Gibb as a tribute to her sister , who has Down 's ) and a heavyweight cast , but the critics agreed that Sage 's performance lent it added gravitas .
For a novice actor to play the lead role in any movie is a nerve - wracking task .
But in Sage 's case , this appears not to have mattered .
Watching her sharp and gripping performance in the film - she plays Roberta Brogan whose mother ( played by Lindsey Duncan ) is dying of cancer and whose brother ( Kevin McKidd of Trainspotting fame ) is reluctant to take over caring responsibilities - there is not a hint of an amateur making a transition .
She shifts effortlessly from being funny ( there is plenty of comedy despite the film 's serious premise ) to raw emotion .
"" I did a lot of funny bits , "" Sage says .
"" When I did the sad bits , I thought of ... do you know the Bee Gees ? "" "" Well , I love them .
I lost Maurice
[ Gibb , a member of the Bee Gees ] .
He only goes and dies on me while I 'm making the film .
Nice , eh ?
I thought about that for the sad bits . ""
"" Paula was amazing , "" says the film 's director , Alison Peebles .
"" It did n't faze her at all .
She stole the show .
The other actors said they learned from Paula , and they meant it .
She is just so cool .
Roberta was very different to Paula .
I had to remind her of that the few times
she was reticent about doing something , but the wit and honesty
she brought to the role is part of her . ""
"" I loved it , "" Sage says of the experience .
"" The cast were brilliant , especially Kevin McKidd .
I look up to him like a big brother . ""
Gangster 's daughter Sage is currently a regular on River City , a popular soap opera north of the border , and is , as ever , disarmingly effusive about it .
The words come thick and fast .
"" I love it !
It 's great .
I play a gangster 's daughter .
I get the scripts two weeks before and then turn up .
They keep the part open for me 'cause they love me . ""
I ask what her character is called . ""
She 's named after a kebab , "" Sage says , mischievously goading me to guess .
Is she called Donna by any chance ? ""
Thank youuu , "" Sage declares with a victory cheer for herself and a sneaky glance at her doting father .
The management at the hotel has allowed us to take over half of their business suite for the interview , hence the nosy professionals .
Over many cans of Diet Pepsi , the conversation covers the passions of Sage 's life - bingo , netball , football ( she has five favourite teams ) , TV , men ( mainly of the boy - band variety ) , and of course , acting .
Did she always want to be an actress ? ""
Definitely .
It was actually my dream , "" Sage says .
"" But I did n't think I 'd get into it . ""
Why ? ""
Because everyone thought it would be my sister "" ( she has an older sister , Marie Louise , and a brother , Mark ) .
"" It should have been Marie Louise . ""
How come ? ""
Beause she is such a drama queen . ""
Sage and her father chuckle at the remark .
"" Paula was always dancing and singing , even when she was very young , "" her father says .
Sage nods in agreement .
So how does she deal with her recent celebrity ?
( She is frequently asked for autographs and is a regular interviewee on television ) . ""
Ach , sure I 'm used to it all now , "" she says , with a camp flounce of the wrist and a giggle .
"" I love it .
It 's fantastic . ""
Sage is eager for more acting work .
She would like to act with McKidd again , she says , or get a part in The Bill , her favourite soap .
Peebles says the one disappointment about Sage 's career is that more work has not been forthcoming . ""
I really believe that she could play any number of roles , "" she says .
"" And they do n't have to be characters with Down 's . ""
The business folk look faintly relieved to see us finally get up to leave .
If she has been aware of their attention , Sage does not let on .
She smiles her impish smile , shakes my hand , and disappears through the door .
It is as if someone has just switched off the lights .

"Ron Perlman , last seen here as Hellboy , is down to provide the voice of Conan in a new animated feature about the mythic barbarian .
Principal animation is about to begin on the 2-D/3-D Conan : Red Nails , and the finished feature is set for a summer 2006 release .
Of course , this will not be Conan 's first appearance on the silver screen - film fans will remember California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger essaying the role in Conan the Barbarian and Conan the Destroyer in the early 80s .
Tilda Swinton , next seen as the White Witch in The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe and opposite Bill Murray in Jim Jarmusch 's Broken Flowers , has signed to star in Stephanie Daley .
Swinton will play a forensic psychologist investigating a 17-year - old accused of infanticide , to be played by Amber Tamblyn .
Walt Disney Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer Films have won a fierce bidding war for an unpublished children 's book , Variety reports .
Monstrous Memoirs of a Mighty McFearless was written by Frank Zappa 's youngest son Ahmet and is due to be published in the US this autumn .
It tells the story of a brother and sister who discover they are descended from a long line of monster - hunters .
They are forced to get over sibling squabbles and see off a diabolical creature threatening the universe .
Disney and Bruckheimer ended up shelling out $ 1.5 m ( £ 850,000 ) for the book , which will now go into development ."
"Another week , another challenge for California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger - but the latest challenge , unlike his declining poll ratings and his support for imperilled ballot propositions , is more serious : this one involves death and darkness in the sunny , liberal state of California .
Should he accept this challenge the film star , who was elected a politician on the promise of making a difference , has an opportunity to deliver on his pledge ; should he fail California will have taken a further step towards permanently forfeiting its place among the 12 civilised states of the union that do not have the death penalty .
For the third time since he became governor a year ago , Schwarzenegger will consider a request for clemency from a prisoner facing execution .
The last time clemency was granted to a murderer in California was by that other Hollywood Republican Governor Ronald Reagan in 1967 .
But this is a case like no other : it has a gangster - turned - educator , a 51-year - old man who has already served 24 years in prison ; it involves a flawed trial and a questionable conviction ; the man behind bars has been nominated for Nobel prizes and is the subject of a Hollywood movie ; and he also recently received a commendation from President Bush .
That the case of Stanley "" Tookie "" Williams has come to Governor Schwarzenegger 's desk is the result of one of the first acts of the US supreme court under Chief Justice John Roberts .
In mid - October , the court refused to consider an appeal from Williams against his death sentence for the 1981 murder of a convenience store worker .
He was also convicted of the murders of three other people .
This week , a judge set December 13 as the date for Williams ' execution , at San Quentin prison .
The California superior court judge , William Pounders , was perhaps trying to sound humane when explaining his decision to proceed immediately to an execution date , but he only succeeded in sounding macabre .
"" This case has taken over 24 years to get to this point , "" he noted .
"" That is a long delay in itself , and I would hate to add to that delay . ""
The timing gives Williams ' lawyers until November 8 - coincidentally , the day of voting on the ballot propositions - to submit a request for clemency to Schwarzenegger .
Williams ' case is an unusual one : in 1971 , at the age of 17 , Williams co - founded the Crips gang in Los Angeles , a fraternity that , together with its rivals the Bloods , now boasts 150,000 members in LA and outposts as far afield as South Africa .
At his trial , Williams was found guilty of the "" execution - style "" murder of a worker at a 7-Eleven convenience store in February 1979 and of the owners of an LA motel and their daughter two weeks later .
He has always maintained his innocence , arguing that the physical evidence found at the scene could not be connected to him and that the prosecution relied on the testimony of police informers whose credibility was questionable .
The conduct of the trial itself raised other questions : the prosecution successfully argued for the removal of African - American jurors , meaning that Williams - who is African - American - was not tried by a jury of his peers .
And in his closing arguments , the prosecutor compared Williams to a Bengal tiger in a zoo , likening the black community of South Central Los Angeles to the natural habitat of a Bengal tiger .
Williams received the death sentence .
In jail , however , something happened : in a classic tale of redemption , Williams saw the error of his ways and started to work to stop others following him .
"" I no longer participate in the so - called gangster lifestyle , and I deeply regret that I ever did , "" he wrote in 1997 .
"" I vow to spend the rest of my life working toward solutions . ""
He co - wrote a series of lauded children 's books entitled Tookie Speaks Out Against Gang Violence .
He mentored and counselled young gang members and troubled youths from his prison cell .
He drew up and has promoted a Protocol for Peace , a formula to help gangs reach a truce , based on the coexistence of gangs inside prisons .
It has been successfully implemented in New Jersey .
His work - and his plight - started to be recognised .
He was nominated ( five times ) for the Nobel peace prize and even for the Nobel prize for literature .
A TV movie titled Redemption - based on Williams ' own memoir - was made , with Jamie Foxx playing Williams .
In August this year he received a President 's Call to Service award commending his work on death row , complete with a letter from President Bush praising him for demonstrating the "" outstanding character of America "" .
The White House , apparently , had no idea who he was .
And then came the supreme court decision , one of three this month that have raised the possibility of a series of executions in California in the months to come .
Earlier this year , after Governor Schwarzenegger rejected his plea for clemency , Donald Jay Beardslee was executed by the state of California .
He was the first prisoner to be killed since 2002 and the 11th since California re - enacted the death penalty in 1977 .
"" This is a big sea change for California , "" says Lance Lindsey , executive director of Death Penalty Focus .
"" It 's coming to look a lot more like Texas , with regular executions . ""
Lindsey hopes Schwarzenegger will live up to his rhetoric .
"" We 're encouraged , "" he says . ""
Governor Schwarzenegger was the one who said he wanted the criminal justice system to focus on rehabilitation .
This is a classic case for clemency .
It 's what it was designed for : to recognise extra - legally that someone has turned their life around , has shown remorse , has given back . ""
The American Civil Liberties Union has taken up Williams ' cause , as have others .
And there are hopes that Governor Schwarzenegger may see a hint in the words of a judge on the ninth US circuit court of appeals who in 2002 ruled against Williams ' appeal .
At that time , Judge Proctor Hug said : "" We are aware of Williams ' laudable efforts opposing gang violence from his prison cell ... [ but ] they are not matters that we in the federal judiciary are at liberty to take into consideration . ""
For Williams ' supporters , these words suggest that the governor , the only person who can take such matters into consideration , should do so .
Should he choose not to , California will have killed another person ."
"One afternoon in the mid-1970s , Stanley "" Tookie "" Williams , a keen bodybuilder and the co - founder of the Crips gang , was walking along the broadwalk at Venice Beach , Santa Monica , near Los Angeles .
He passed the then Mr Olympia , Arnold Schwarzenegger , who was out for a stroll with a friend . ""
See that guy there ? ""
Mr Schwarzenegger said , pointing to Williams ' bulging muscles .
"" Those are n't arms , they 're legs . ""
Now , more than a quarter of a century later , the paths of the man who became a movie star and politician and the man who became a convicted multiple murderer are about to cross again .
At 12.01am on December 13 , Williams will be executed by lethal injection for the murders of four people during two robberies committed more than a quarter of a century ago .
The only person who can spare him , should he choose to exercise his power of clemency , is the governor of California , Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Mr Schwarzenegger faces a tough choice , for Williams , 51 , is a model of jailhouse redemption .
Although he has always maintained his innocence , he has renounced his gang life and written children 's books aimed at steering them away from gangs .
He has counselled gang members from behind bars , been nominated five times for the Nobel peace prize , and his life story has been made into a film starring Jamie Foxx . ""
His status was legendary , "" said Najee Ali , a former gang member turned community activist who served two years in prison .
"" He was the first ghetto superstar .
He 's what we call a big homie .
So many preachers , politicians and law enforcement officers talk about stopping gang violence but they do n't have any experience of it .
But when you have the founder of the most well - known gang in history , it speaks a lot .
"" At the time of the crimes , Williams was a feared figure on the streets of what was then known as South Central Los Angeles .
As the co - founder of the Crips , he carried a fearsome reputation for violence and the control he exerted over the gang .
The crimes for which he was convicted were heinous .
On February 28 1979 , said the prosecution at his trial , Williams and two other men robbed a 7 - 11 convenience store in Pico Rivera , east of Los Angeles .
Williams took the store assistant , 26-year - old father of two Albert Owens , into a cold room and shot him twice with a 12-gauge shotgun .
Williams got away with around $ 100 .
On March 11 1979 , the prosecution alleged , Williams shot the owners of a small motel in Los Angeles , Tsai - Shen Yang and her husband Yen - Yi Yang , as well as their 43-year - old daughter Ye - Chen Lin , before stealing about $ 100 .
At his trial in 1981 , Williams was found guilty of the four murders and given four death sentences .
But his conviction , Williams has argued , was unsafe .
Forensic evidence was never linked to him , he has said , and claims the prosecution relied on the testimony of informants whose integrity was compromised .
His lawyers have also argued that jury selection was tainted : the prosecutor , Robert Martin , dismissed the three African - Americans in the jury pool .
The prosecutor also compared Williams to a "" Bengal tiger in captivity in a zoo "" .
Once inside prison , Williams continued his gang activity , behaviour that brought him six and a half years in solitary confinement .
It was during this time , he has said , that he began to see the error of his ways .
In 1997 , he wrote an open apology for his gang activities , but not for the killings of which he was convicted .
"" I no longer participate in the so - called gangster lifestyle , and I deeply regret that I ever did , "" he wrote .
"" I vow to spend the rest of my life working toward solutions . ""
Those solutions included writing nine children 's books aimed at preventing young people joining gangs .
He has published a memoir of his time in prison and , last year , an autobiography titled Blue Rage , Black Redemption ( blue is the colour of the Crips gang ) .
In August this year Williams received a President 's Call to Service Award in recognition of his work with young people .
The accompanying citation from President George Bush noted that : "" Through service to others , you demonstrate the outstanding character of America and help strengthen our country .
"" Two months later , in October , the supreme court rejected his final appeal without hearing it .
After serving 24 years on death row in San Quentin , Williams has exhausted the appeals process .
Governor Schwarzenegger is his only hope .
"" Arnold is really caught in a bind , "" said author and political analyst Earl Ofari Hutchinson .
"" He 's up for re - election next year and he 's not going to win without iron - clad support from his conservative base .
And when you look at the climate , California is still a death penalty state .
I ca n't see a win - win for Arnold Schwarzenegger granting clemency to Tookie Williams .
It does n't fly .
Tookie Williams , to be brutally frank , is doomed . ""
In the two clemency appeals Mr Schwarzenegger has heard , he has ruled against a reprieve .
Williams has until tomorrow to file his request for clemency .
The LA district attorney 's office , which brought the original prosecution , has until November 17 to file a response , to which Williams ' legal team can respond by November 21 .
In a parallel move , other lawyers representing Williams will present a "" discovery motion "" detailing new evidence that was not heard at his trial and has only now been uncovered .
Williams ' petition for clemency is not expected to address his guilt or innocence .
Instead , his lawyers are likely to focus on his rehabilitation . ""
The governor will take all the facts that are submitted to him into consideration and after consultation reach a decision , "" a spokeswoman for Mr Schwarzenegger said .
His two previous decisions do not bode well for Williams .
In rejecting Donald Beardslee 's appeal for clemency in January this year , Mr Schwarzenegger wrote : "" I am not moved to mercy by the fact that Beardslee has been a model prisoner .
I expect no less . ""
Williams ' supporters wonder what sort of anti - rehabilitation message a denial of clemency will send .
Standing on the corner of West 43rd Street in LA , a small group of them gathered last week .
Zane Smith is a former gang member and contemporary of Williams . ""
Me and Tookie had our histories , "" he said .
"" But when they talked about putting him to death , I had to put it aside .
Tookie was never a killer .
He was a bodybuilder .
Arnold Schwarzenegger was his hero . ""

"It 's a busy day on the political front , with Jack Straw and Gordon Brown hotfooting it back to Westminster from foreign trips in an attempt to bolster Labour 's vote on this afternoon 's terror bill , as the government faces possibly the first defeat of Tony Blair 's premiership .
Meanwhile the two Davids are trying to charm female Tories , with appearances on BBC Radio 4 's Woman 's Hour and a hustings event at the Conservative Women 's Organisation 's annual conference in London .
We 'll also be covering Chinese president Hu Jintao 's meeting with Blair this lunchtime , and we 'll bring you the latest results from elections in the US which saw considerable gains for the Democrats , including winning the governor 's office in New Jersey and the defeat of propositions from Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to cap spending and limit the powers of the California state legislature .
Also on the site today , Ben Goldacre , who writes the Guardian 's Bad Science column , responds to Melanie Phillips ' latest salvo in the row over MMR vaccinations ."
"A last - minute intervention by the US president , George Bush , failed to win the governorship of the southern state of Virginia for his Republican party in a night of improved election results for the Democrats .
City and state polls in the so - called off - year election also saw Democrats win the governor 's office in New Jersey and the defeat of propositions from Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to cap spending and limit the powers of the California state legislature .
The Republicans held City Hall in New York , where Michael Bloomberg , the socially liberal mayor , won re - election , but voters ousted a religiously - inclined Pennsylvania school board that promoted the teaching of intelligent design alongside the theory of evolution .
The nine - person Dover area school board was the subject of court action by parents over the policy and lost eight of its members in the vote .
The most - watched contest of the night was in Virginia , where Democratic candidate Tim Kaine held the governorship for the party for a second consecutive term in a rural and Republican - leaning state .
Mr Bush threw himself into the campaign late on with an appearance at a Monday night rally for Jerry Kilgore , the Republican candidate , but failed to swing the contest .
The US president is at his lowest approval ratings since taking office in 2001 , while his party has been damaged by criminal charges against Tom DeLay , its powerful former leader in Congress .
Republicans warned against reading too much into the results - New Jersey and Virginia voted Democrat in 2001 - but Howard Dean , defeated candidate for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination and now the party chairman , said the votes reflected unease with the nationally dominant party . ""
I believe national Republican politics really had an effect in Virginia and California .
[ Voters ] do n't like the abuse of power , they do n't like the culture of corruption .
They want the nation to go in a different way . ""
The Virginia result is likely also to boost the standing of its outgoing governor , Mark Warner , who campaigned for Mr Kaine , and could be in a good position to run for the Democratic presidential nomination if - as his success in Virginia suggests - he can bring back the southern and rural voters who have deserted the party . ""
May I just say : I 'm looking forward to standing with you at your next victory party , "" Mr Kaine told Mr Warner in his acceptance speech .
Control of Congress and 36 governors ' seats are at stake in the November 2006 mid - term elections before jostling begins in earnest for the 2008 presidential election .
Both the governors ' races were marked by record - breaking spending and vicious personal attacks .
In Virginia , Kilgore 's campaign ran an advert claiming Mr Kaine , an opponent of the death penalty , would have refused to execute Adolf Hitler .
Doug Forrester , the Republican candidate in New Jersey , quoted Democrat Jon Corzine 's ex - wife as saying he had let down his family and he would let down New Jersey .
Elsewhere , Texas voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional ban on gay marriage while the north - eastern state of Maine voted to preserve its new gay - rights law .
In Detroit , Kwame Kilpatrick , 35 , won a tight race against Republican challenger Freman Hendrix to remain the city 's mayor ."
"Republicans were licking their wounds yesterday after a series of chastening reversals in elections across the country that cast further gloom over the Bush administration .
Two Democratic governors were elected by surprisingly large margins , in New Jersey and Virginia , the latter despite the last - minute intervention of President Bush .
In California voters rejected proposals by the Republican governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , to reform the state 's government .
It is the first time Mr Schwarzenegger has been defeated in an election , leading to speculation that his political career is nearing its end .
The only bright spots for Republicans were in two mayoral races , including that of Michael Bloomberg , who won an expected second term in New York City .
"" There is no question the country has turned dramatically negative about President Bush and the Republican party , and there is an albatross around the neck of every Republican candidate at every level of government , "" Democratic pollster Mark Mellman told the Los Angeles Times .
Republicans rejected that conclusion , arguing that the elections had been decided by local not national issues .
"" From the beginning we have viewed these as not national but state races , "" said the party chairman , Ken Mehlman .
"" History is consistent with that , and the results tonight are consistent with that . ""
Former presidential candidate and Democratic party chairman Howard Dean said : "" I believe national Republican politics ... really had an effect in Virginia and California . ""
Voters , he said , "" do n't like the abuse of power , they do n't like the culture of corruption .
They want the nation to go in a different way . ""
The campaigns in Virginia , New Jersey , New York and California did have one thing in common : money .
The two candidates to succeed New Jersey governor Jim McGreevey , who resigned over a homosexual affair , spent $ 72 m ( £ 41.3 m ) on the race .
In Virginia the candidates spent almost $ 40 m , and mayor Bloomberg spent just under $ 67 m on his campaign , while the Californian election cost an estimated $ 300 m ."
"I am taken to Thal , birthplace of Arnold Schwarzenegger , the pretty country village whose charms he deserted - for Romford - in 1968 .
Thal is in Styria ( in Austrian , Steiermark ) , just south of Graz , and I 'm on the trail of the Styrian pumpkin , a variety with shell - less , bottle - green seeds .
At this time of year , Thal and its neighbouring villages go pumpkin crazy .
Every home has an Alpine roof , wooden shutters with heart motifs , gingham curtains and , in the front garden , a tableau vivant of pumpkins .
These range from collections of gourds wearing painted smiles and swimming goggles to full - blown scenes from Strauss operas .
My favourite has a dirndl - clad pumpkin - frau pushing her own arm through a mincer .
In Thal , I am in thrall to sturm , a cloudy near - wine of just - pressed grapes that tastes like Vimto , but whose alcohol content creeps up on you like The Terminator in sheepkin slippers .
After a litre of sturm , I 'm reminded of Arnold 's line in Total Recall : "" If I am not me , who da hell am I ? ""
Peter Kapaun knows who da hell
he is .
He is Styria 's largest trader in pumpkin seeds , an evangelist for their flavour and medicinal properties and a committed wearer of lederhosen .
Herr Kapaun is keen to let me know that his "" naked nuts "" contain lots of essential fatty acids , not to mention any amount of Vitamins B , E and K. Delicious as they are when roasted and salted , I come more to adore Peter 's pumpkinseed oil , a thick green condiment he manufactures in the village of Grabersdorf , near the Austrian - Slovenian border .
This is an oil with the richness of , say , hazelnut or walnut oil , but with added deep dark round nuttiness and what a Styrian calls delikass Having toiled down sodden country lanes , admired countless acres of straggly squashes and drunk pumpkin oil warm , thick , straight off the press ( imagine the velvet of liquid roasted nuts with tones of coffee , parkin and fresh grass ) , Peter rewards me with lunch at Wirtshaus Jagawirt in the hamlet of St Stefan bei Stainz .
Dried corncobs and rough piles of striated pumpkins frame its carved porch , and its pine - panelled stubl is dressed as if ready to receive the entire von Trapp family .
Werner and Maria Goach not only cook up a sturm , but also distill their own pear schnapps , an aperitif I decline in favour of local wine .
Most Styrian wines never make it to the international market , but are worth seeking out , and new - wave Styrian winemakers of note include Sattler , Polz , Tement and Gross : at best , their wines demonstrate some of the racy acidity and occasional austerity of white burgundies .
The Goaches serve us a full - on , pumped - up pumpkin feast .
The gourd arrives raw , thinly sliced , with lamb carpaccio and ewe 's milk cheese ; as ravioli in broth ; casseroled with ham hocks plus pumpkinseed bread ; in a salad dressed with roasted pumpkinseed oil and apple cider vinegar ; baked in a gorgeous pie with walnuts and thick , thick cream .
I 'd expected great naked pumpkinseeds , but had been unprepared for Styria 's great green beauty , or the delikass of her table .

"It is a marvel to me , after a lifetime of disavowing all gender differences but the most obvious , how much boys like robots .
I 've no interest in robots , unless they 're on the telly , and they can do everything a human can , only 10 times better , and when they 're Arnold Schwarzenegger painted silver .
Even then , my engagement is fractional .
Imagine my surprise , then , when the men of the household fell upon these items like they were something you could eat .
We had : a robot dog , even though there is a perfectly good regular dog ; a tiny robot man , whose skills are implausibly limited ; a robot vacuum cleaner , even though the business of vacuuming has never set light to even the tiniest flare of spirit ; and a robot football duo , easily the least sophisticated of the robot brigade , really just two remote - controlled hillocks of plastic , each very slightly equipped to kick a very small plastic ball into a plastic net .
This was enjoyable , like playing table football without having to break into a tiny , tiny sweat .
It is to table football , effort wise , what darts is to javelin throwing .
Though when you watch darts , its players do , obscurely , seem to sweat quite a lot .
You could play with the footie robots all night , unless you happen to be rubbish at it , and ca n't work out which way is forwards , in which case you 'll tire fast , and the words "" let 's start a tournament "" will fill you with derision .
The little robots are fun to send across your floor , with the remote .
Let 's be clear - they ca n't do anything at all , apart from backwards , forwards , sideways , the other sideways .
The notion of a robot as a time - saving device is flagrantly ludicrous in the face of these nuggets , unless you already happen to waste a lot of time racing snails .
They take direction better than snails .
The robot man , though technically more advanced , saved even less time .
It ca n't actually do anything , apart from dance in an amusing way , though it ruined the amusement by saying , "" I ca n't believe I did that ! "" at the end of the dance , which made it sound altogether too self - aware , like a precocious child doing an Irish jig .
It will also flinch if you mime punching it in the face .
A slightly human feature is that , when you try and get it out of its box , it wriggles .
Apparently , it burps - this is only hearsay , though .
We never heard it burp .
I guess you 'd have to feed it something indigestible before you 'd hear a proper burp .
It can grab light items , such as a packet of fags and , at a pinch , a drink - hilarious !
Look , I 'm corrupting my robot !
Next I 'm going to put it in a funny position where it looks like it 's having sex with a chair .
It reclines backwards until it 's fallen over , whereupon it can get back up again .
Phenomenal abs , you say , until you realise that it has no abs
, it 's just a robot .
What can I say ?
This totally sucks .
Some more boys , also with more passing interest in robots , said this is just a development stage - they 're working on a robot that is a lot more like Arnold Schwarzenegger and in the meantime , they release products featuring small advances just to cover their costs .
Now , we need to talk about this dog .
As the only robot with any real - life usefulness ( unkind parents , fakely satiating the offspring demand for a pet with this non - pet ) , this is also the most expensive , coming in at two grand or thereabouts .
There is something incredible about how dog - like this thing is - in the way it moves , the way it nuzzles into things that show it any affection , the way it wags its funny plastic tail , the jut of its doggy chin .
Even in its totally synthetic embodiment , featuring nothing of the soft and fluffy experience you 'd associate with a dog , it is more dog - like even than a toy made of real dog skin .
It totally messes with your understanding of sensory experience , and of visual recognition - what we think we know by "" dog "" , I mean , is nothing like what we actually know .
It 's neither visual nor tactile ; it 's all in the gestures .
And in turn , this screws with your understanding of wordless affection ; you can scratch a dog on the chin , it will wag , or similar , and you get a sense of cross - species understanding , of oneness with the world , of the purity and sincerity of unmediated physicality .
And then you scratch a bloody robot on the chin , and it wags its tail as well , and you get the same warm feeling , before you check yourself , and suddenly , everything is meaningless , and we 're all just flotsam in a loveless world .
No offence to the robot , but this feels like a shame .
Anyway , Aibo ( for that is his given name ) is a Japanese dog , with freakishly good English in an American accent .
He has a memory of 128 megabites ; this is way more than a regular dog , apparently .
Now , there are features of Aibo that are distinctly undoglike .
He can speak , for a start .
And he can also walk backwards .
But so doglike is he otherwise , that when he does these things it flummoxes you , rather than making you think , "" well , obviously , he 's a robot "" .
So , five minutes in , he says "" you have n't named me yet ! "" , and instead of thinking about it , and naming him something very droll like a swearword or a historical dictator , you panic , and think "" what 's a dog 's name ?
What ? ""
and then you call him Spot , which is coincidentally the same name as your existing dog , and this spawns an ongoing fight between the two dogs to do your bidding which , despite the real - life dog not knowing how to dance , or take pictures , or store music ,
continues until such time as the robot dog goes to sleep .
Then the real dog goes to sleep as well .
He 's exhausted ; he 's been trying to dance , when he does n't know what it means .
Spot the Second , in the end , is a bit too assertive .
He says things like , "" give me your hand "" , when any fool knows that correct protocol is for the human of the equation to say "" give me your paw "" .
From a scissor - paper - stone point of view , the vacuum won hands down .
It frightened the real dog ; it obstructed the robot dog ; it knocked over the robot man .
And it sucked up components of the robot football , which discomforted me , partly because it would interfere with play , and partly lest I start some new variant of mad cow disease .
You charge up the little mite , and send it on its way .
There is a kind of force field you can set up , whereby it ignores areas you do n't want vacuumed .
Otherwise , it trundles about the floor , sweeping until it meets an obstruction , then scooching off in the opposite direction .
Where it falls down compared with human endeavour is that it ca n't tell which bits it 's already done , so it 's not unusual to see it disappearing under an oven , emerging with a chip on its head , and then disappearing back under , like the movement pattern of one of those rats that gets fed ecstasy to see how mental it goes .
I 'm sentimentalising the thing , I know .
I feel very fond of it .
My floor is extremely clean .
The conclusion , I think , is that , with robot technology being what it is , you 'll get the most satisfaction from things with very narrow job remits .
You want something to suck dust , you got it ; you want something to mimic human company , you generally do n't got it .
The dog is something of an anomaly here , but given the choice , I 'd still keep the real dog .

"It 's no longer a surprise to see Arnold Schwarzenegger , film star and Governor of California , in a hotel foyer in Beijing ; or to meet the New York - based fashion designer Vivienne Tam at a Business of Design Week event in Hong Kong .
China now seems the destination of almost everyone - much as Paris was in the 1930s or New York in the 1950s .
But what is remarkable is why these east coast and west coast icons are here , in China , at the same time .
The simple answer is fashion , which is now big business in China .
Schwarzenegger is here to publicise and host a show of Californian fashion designers in Beijing and Shanghai ; and Tam is here to collect an award as the world 's outstanding Chinese designer .
It 's a sign of the changing Chinese times that a fashion designer is the winner , rather than an industrial or product designer .
Earlier this year , British newspapers were full of ' bra wars ' stories , the tabloid term to describe the trade dispute between the European Union and China over textiles .
And the figures speak for themselves .
Imports of Chinese textiles into the EU have increased by 45 per cent in the first half of 2005 and the World Trade Organisation says that China is soon likely to control 50 per cent of the world 's textile market .
In Shenzhen , on the Pearl river delta , I meet a German fashion lecturer at a conference .
He tells me about a 24- hour - a - day , seven - day - each - week factory in Hangzhou with 3,000 employees .
It turns out a staggering 1.2 million black blazers each week for the cheap - chic retailers Zara and H&amp;M.
He compares the conditions of work to those in the early days of Britain 's Industrial Revolution .
Yet , however awe - inspiring and humanly frightening as the figures about China 's clothing manufacturing capacity are , there is a danger that their sheer size blinds us to even more important changes in the role of China in the fashion business .
To put it simply , China is weary of being the manufacturing clothing basin of the world and wants to be a player in the fashion business .
It wants to develop its own brands rather than be the manufacturing arm of other countries ' ; sell to its own consumers , not to mention those in the rest of the world .
And it 's easy to see why .
Two out of five Chinese people now live in cities and by 2010 the country is predicted to have 250 million luxury brand consumers - a market of enormous proportions .
Why should n't the Chinese ' get a piece of the action ' , to speak American - ese ?
Well , that 's the question - and who better to ask than Tam , one of the very few Chinese who have managed in the fashion world to develop a global brand .
I meet her in Hong Kong on a glorious balmy November day on which she is to receive her award .
She speaks with immense energy , but looks tired , though it 's the elegant tiredness of someone named as one of People magazine 's ' Fifty Most Beautiful People ' .
We begin by talking about her early life .
Born in Guangzhou , she was brought up during the Cultural Revolution and moved at the age of three to Hong Kong .
Her Chinese name is Yin Yok , but she felt the need when younger to change it .
Educated in a Catholic school where the teachers found it hard to pronounce her Chinese name , she took Vivienne from Vivien Leigh in Gone with the Wind , but then French - ified it because it felt more feminine .
Her hybrid life is at the heart of her identity as a designer . '
I remember seeing a bride change from her Western white tulle gown into a traditional red Chinese silk wedding suit , ' she says . '
Looking back , these occasions were my first fashion shows . '
After graduation in Hong Kong she did what others of her generation did - moved to New York where she launched her business .
She ' had no money and knew no one ' .
It was n't until the mid 1990s that she came to general fame , when she launched her Mao collection .
Noticing how Chinese artists were using Mao in their art work , she developed a fashion collection around his image , something so sensitive in Hong Kong that when the collection was launched there ' angry passers - by would bang on the shop windows ' .
Nevertheless in the West the collection was a triumph , one of those rare fashion / art crossovers , which meant that some of the work ended up in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art .
Since then her company has grown , and now has a turnover of $ 65 million ( £ 37 m ) .
Her clients include Julia Roberts , Goldie Hawn , Madonna and Britney Spears , but she tells me that she still does everything herself , including the branding of the company .
In 2000 , she published a glorious coffee table book with the prophetic title China Chic .
It took most commentators several more years before they could recognise - and some still do n't - that China - cheap is an adage belonging to the past ; China - chic belongs to the future .
But when I compliment her on her foresight , she sighs and repeats several times , ' Too early , too early ' .
And in the most obvious way she 's right .
In commercial terms it is always important to have the right idea when the market can recognise it .
Now it probably can ; then it could n't .
We talk about the next generation of Chinese designers , about what a young Vivienne Tam would need now if she were starting out in mainland China to develop a fashion brand .
She speaks about the infrastructure that is missing in China ( and even in Hong Kong ) which New York designers take for granted - the market weeks , the trade shows , the creative management , the magazines and media support , the distribution system , the independent retailers and sympathetic stores .
These are what help to turn talent into a business .
It 's a story I hear all over China :
the talent and the market are here - but what 's missing is the absolutely necessary infrastructure that allows developed economies to turn creativity into commerce .
And when I speak to fashion people in Beijing they echo Tam 's thoughts .
One of them mentions the omnipresent counterfeiting of fashion brands ; another tells me that the people who sit on those all - important front - row seats during Beijing Fashion Week are one index of the immaturity of the China fashion business .
In Milan or Paris , the front row seats are reserved for the global fashion elite , the gatekeepers who make the decisions , the celebrities who provide the endorsement .
In Beijing , too often , local grandees occupy the front row .
In Shanghai , at an opulent party thrown by the gallery entrepreneur Pearl Lam , I ask Angelica Cheung , the editor of China Vogue , what she believes needs to be injected into the Chinese fashion scene to give the nation 's designers the necessary business break .
She mentions ' the opportunity to see the world and learn about how things work in the fashion industry in more advanced markets ' .
On the other hand , the very existence of China Vogue is one sign that that most hard - headed of publishers , Condé Nast , is confident that China is maturing as a fashion market .
And , of course , there are many other such signs .
There are , to my knowledge alone , several initiatives between European and Chinese designers to try to develop indigenous Chinese clothing brands for a Chinese market .
Most are backed by European money .
But competition will be tough in China for any indigenous brand .
Much like the East Germans after the fall of the Berlin Wall , the new Chinese have rushed to embrace luxury rather than the culture some might have wished for them - nowhere more so than in fashion , where European luxury brands thrive .
Armani has reported that first quarter sales in Greater China this year were up 52 per cent ; and while fake Prada may be a badge of pride for the hip Western tourist , for the aspiring Chinese only the real thing will do .
But how might an indigenous Chinese fashion brand gain credibility at home and abroad ?
Well , perhaps it would have to be exported and gain international credibility before it is reimported - such being the Chinese present love - affair with foreign goods .
Or perhaps a Chinese fashion brand needs to attach itself to Chinese art that is globally hip ( see the V&amp;A 's current Chinese photography show ) .
Well , if so , that 's what Shanghai Tang is already doing .
Taking a leaf out of Tam 's Mao strategy , Shanghai Tang is working with some well - known Chinese artists for its next - year collection , as it tries to penetrate the Chinese market and expand its dominion globally .
Or maybe this is the moment when the Chinese will once again embrace the strengths of their own history , produce work based on traditional craft skills , made from beautiful materials , and yet be defiantly modern .
China now enjoys the world 's attention - and will do so through the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the Shanghai 2010 Expo - and there could n't be any better moment for the Chinese fashion business to strut its stuff .
This is Tam 's dream : to open a Chinese lifestyle department store , where fashion would be a part but only a part ; where everything from bed linen to dresses would have the virtues of modern design married with traditional craft skills .
I ask her in which city in the world she would site the department store , and she is characteristically open - minded . '
I do n't mind ' , she says , ' New York , London , Shanghai , Hong Kong . '
But my guess is that it would have to be in Beijing or Shanghai .
Whoever develops the Chinese fashion brand that captures its domestic market and moves west , I 'm sure they wo n't have to leave home to do so - as did Tam .
Schwarzenegger now appears in China as the supplicant rather than terminator .
It 's a sign of things to come ."
"To coin one of Arnold Schwarzenegger 's best - known and over - used lines : "" Hasta la vista , baby . ""
Republican party activists in California are so disenchanted with the governor that they have decided they want to trade him in for a more reliable Hollywood model : Mel Gibson .
"" We have to look for alternatives to the governor because for the last few weeks he 's been behaving like someone who wants to go back to Hollywood , "" said Mike Spence , the president of the California Republican Assembly .
Mr Spence has launched a website , Melgibsonforgovernor.com , and an online petition to persuade Gibson to stand for governor of the richest state in the US in next year 's election .
The website points to Gibson 's political credentials from the success of The Passion of the Christ to his comments on the stem cell research and case of Terri Schiavo , the brain damaged woman who died in March . ""
He 's shown himself to be both fiscally and socially conservative , "" said Mr Spence , "" and the success of The Passion of the Christ shows that he has the ability to reach out to people "" .
Mr Schwarzenegger had appeared to be immune to the normal vagaries of political fortune , but then his poll ratings plummeted .
Last month a special election he had heavily promoted backfired when none of the measures on the ballot were passed .
This week he delivered another shock to his Republican base by appointing a Democrat and a Kennedy to boot as his chief of staff . ""
In public relations terms it 's a disaster , "" said Democratic party official Bob Mulholland .
"" Not only are the Republicans disappointed with him losing all the ballot propositions but they think he 's throwing the Republicans over the side . ""
While Mr Schwarzenegger has said he intends to stand for re - election next year , there are known to be two lucrative Hollywood offers awaiting him : Terminator 4 and a sequel to True Lies .
There is , however , only one problem with the move to draft Gibson to stand for governor : nobody has asked him .
Gibson 's office refused to comment on the website yesterday , adding that he had never expressed an interest in standing for political office .
Mr Spence said his organisation , part of the Republican party , was trying to get an audience with the actor.""We hope to meet with him and encourage him , "" he said .
Should they succeed , it raises the bizarre prospect of Californian voters being faced with a choice between Warren Beatty and Mel Gibson for governor ."
"Former gang leader Stanley "" Tookie "" Williams was due to be executed by lethal injection this morning , barring a last - minute act of clemency by the governor of California , Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Last night Williams was preparing to move to a new cell at San Quentin prison before his planned execution at 12.01am local time .
Appeals from lawyers representing Williams were rejected by courts in California at the weekend , and with a final appeal being heard yesterday it appeared that his last hope lay with Mr Schwarzenegger .
Williams has refused a final meal , to meet a chaplin or to have a witness at his execution .
There were rallies in his support at the weekend , including a demonstration at the church attended by Mr Schwarzenegger , and a vigil continued outside San Quentin .
Last week the governor heard petitions from lawyers representing Williams and from the Los Angeles district attorney 's office , which prosecuted Williams for four murders committed in 1979 .
Saying the decision was a "" heavy responsibility "" and the hardest decision he had ever had to make , Mr Schwarzenegger promised to make his ruling yesterday .
Supporters of Williams , whose case has attracted enormous media interest , were disheartened by the delay , while prosecutors dismissed the validity of the last - minute appeal .
Williams , 51 , has attracted support because of his anti - gang work from within prison .
A co - founder of the infamous Crips street gang based in Los Angeles , Williams denounced his gang lifestyle in 1997 .
Since then he has written a series of acclaimed children 's books counselling against gang membership .
His autobiography , Blue Rage , Black Redemption , was published to acclaim last year and was the basis for a film , Redemption , starring the Oscar - winning actor Jamie Foxx .
Foxx has joined the campaign to save Williams , as have other celebrities .
Williams has apologised for his gang past but has never admitted responsibility for the four murders for which he received four life sentences .
He was convicted of shooting Albert Owens to death during a convenience store robbery on February 27 1979 .
He was also convicted of the murder on March 11 1979 of Yen - I Yang and Tsai - Shai Chen Yang and their daughter , Yu Chin Yang Lin , at a Los Angeles motel ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger , California 's governor , rejected an appeal for clemency from Stanley "" Tookie "" Williams yesterday , clearing the way for the former gang leader and convicted murderer 's execution this morning .
Citing Williams ' refusal to apologise for the 1979 murders , which he has always maintained he did not commit
, Mr Schwarzenegger said he could not justify overturning the verdict of the courts . ""
Without an apology and atonement for these senseless and brutal killings there can be no redemption , "" Mr Schwarzenegger wrote in his published decision . ""
The basis of Williams ' clemency request is not innocence .
Rather , the basis of the request is the personal redemption Stanley Williams has experienced and the positive impact of the message he sends .
But Williams ' claim of innocence remains a key factor to evaluating his claim of personal redemption .
It is impossible to separate Williams ' claim of innocence from his claim of redemption . ""
The decision was announced shortly after midday in California , less than 12 hours before the scheduled execution by lethal injection .
Supporters of Williams , a founder of the Crips gang praised for his anti - gang work inside prison , condemned the decision .
The Reverend Jesse Jackson emerged from a visit with Williams to learn of the decision .
Standing in the street leading up to the prison , Rev Jackson expressed his "" disappointment "" .
"" I feel pain that the governor has made this critical choice and has chosen revenge over redemption , "" he said .
"" Tookie is no threat to society .
He becomes a trophy for some and a martyr for others .
"" Others were more forthright in their condemnation of the decision , the third request for clemency in a death penalty case denied by Mr Schwarzenegger since he took office .
Calling the decision "" racist and immoral "" , Todd Chretien , an anti - death penalty campaigner who was observing a vigil outside the gates of the prison , said : "" This decision is a gigantic moral failing .
It confirms the racism of the death penalty , and sends a message to young Latino and African - American people that the governor and the attorney general do not care about them .
"" Williams will be strapped to a trolley and injected with a sedative and potassium chloride to induce paralysis .
He will then be given pancuronium bromide to bring on a heart attack .
The execution will take place before 50 witnesses .
Earl Ofari Hutchinson , a political commentator , said the decision was determined by the governor 's faltering political fortunes .
"" He 's a conservative Republican , he 's up for a tough re - election next year
and he needs the Republican base , "" he said .
"" This country puts a lot of lip service into the concept of redemption .
The message this decision sends is horrible and hypocritical . ""
Ellen Kreitzberg , professor of law at Santa Clara University , criticised the governor 's decision on legal grounds .
"" He 's making a clemency decision based on a reluctance to go against what has already been decided , whereas clemency is designed to go against previous decisions , "" she said .
Williams ' case has attracted unusual levels of support and attention from all over the world .
He has been acclaimed for his anti - gang work from inside prison , including a series of children 's books .
A film based on his autobiography , starring Jamie Foxx as Williams , was released last year .
But Mr Schwarzenegger 's ruling questioned the validity of Williams ' redemption , arguing that as a co - founder of the Crips street gang , he was responsible for the deaths caused by gang violence .
"" The continued pervasiveness of gang violence leads one to question the efficacy of Williams ' message , "" Mr Schwarzenegger wrote , in a response to those who said that Williams was more valuable alive than dead .
Peter Fleming , the attorney who led the plea for clemency on behalf of Williams , said : "" If Stanley Williams does not merit clemency , what meaning does clemency retain in this state ? ""
In a recent interview with Reuters news agency Williams appeared calm at the prospect of his execution . ""
Me fearing what I 'm facing , what possible good is it going to do for me ? , "" he said .
"" How is that going to benefit me ?
If it 's my time to be executed , what 's all the ranting and raving going to do ? """
"The former Crips gang leader and convicted murderer Stanley "" Tookie "" Williams was executed by lethal injection in California today .
Last - minute appeals by his lawyers and a clemency petition to the state 's governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , were unsuccessful .
Amnesty International today condemned the execution as a "" travesty of justice . ""
Williams , 51 , was convicted in 1981 of murdering four people during robberies carried out in 1979 .
He has always maintained he did not commit the murders , but did apologise for founding the Crips gang in Los Angeles in 1971 .
The gang has been blamed for hundreds of deaths during decades of fighting with rival gangs .
Mr Schwarzenegger said he could not justify overturning the decision of the courts .
"" Stanley Williams insists he is innocent , and that he will not and should not apologise or otherwise atone for the murders of the four victims in this case , "" Mr Schwarzenegger wrote in his published decision . ""
Without an apology and atonement for these senseless and brutal killings , there can be no redemption . ""
Officials at San Quentin state prison said Williams was composed and cooperative before being taken for execution .
He did not request a final meal .
Guards struggled for about 12 minutes to place the needle in a vein in Williams ' left arm ; "" Still ca n't find it ? ""
he joked at one point .
Williams often raised his head to look at his supporters , particularly Barbara Becnel , the editor of his anti - gang books .
As he died , Ms Becnel and other supporters gave what appeared to be black power salutes .
"" The state of California just killed an innocent man , "" they said .
He was pronounced dead at 12.35am local time ( 0835 GMT ) .
The stepmother of one of Williams ' victims also attended his execution .
"" I believe it was a just punishment long overdue , "" Lorna Owens told ABC television .
The high - profile case has generated renewed rows over the death penalty .
Williams wrote a number of anti - gang books for children and dedicated his 24 years on death row to educating young people about the dangers of gang life .
His supporters said this showed he had changed his views , but Mr Schwarzenegger did not agree .
Amnesty International today condemned Williams ' execution .
Kate Allen , director of Amnesty International UK , said : "" This is yet another sad milestone in the history of the US justice system . ""
Williams ' violent past was well known but he had become a textbook version of rehabilitation and his execution was a travesty of justice . ""
At the Vatican , Pope Benedict XVI 's top official for justice matters denounced the death penalty for going against redemption and human dignity .
"" We know the death penalty does n't resolve anything , "" Cardinal Renato Martino told Associated Press .
"" Even a criminal is worthy of respect , because he is a human being .
The death penalty is a negation of human dignity . ""
Around 2,000 death penalty protesters gathered outside the prison today where the Rev Jesse Jackson , a supporter of Williams , addressed the crowd and folk singer Joan Baez performed on a temporary stage . ""
Tonight is planned , efficient , calculated , antiseptic , cold - blooded murder
and I think everyone who is here , is here to enlist the morality and soul of this country , "" said Baez .
Williams ' cause also attracted supporters such as rap star Snoop Dogg , a former Crips member ; actor Jamie Foxx , who played Williams in a film , and Archbishop Desmond Tutu .
Mr Jackson met Williams yesterday , and told protesters outside the prison that he thanked them for their support . ""
He said ' Do n't cry , let 's remain strong , ' ""
Mr Jackson told Reuters . ""
He smiled , you know , with a certain strength , a certain resolve .
I think he feels a comfort in his new legacy as a social transformer . ""
Mr Schwarzenegger has rejected three appeals for clemency by death row prisoners ."
"Forget "" Hasta la vista , baby "" and "" I 'll be back "" .
The phrase by which the California governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , might best be remembered is "" Stop me before I kill again "" .
Those words were scrawled over a picture of him in all his Terminator pomp held aloft by a protester outside the gates of San Quentin prison on Monday night .
The protests came as Stanley "" Tookie "" Williams became the 12th person to be executed since California brought back the death penalty in 1977 .
At 647 people , the state 's death row is the largest in the US , giving Californians the luxury of expressing support for the death penalty in ballots and opinion polls while not having to witness the fruits of that support - the judicial killing of prisoners .
But that situation is about to change .
Many of the death penalties imposed in the state date from the early 80s , shortly after the ending of a moratorium .
Like Williams , many death row inmates have spent more than 20 years taking their cases to various appeals courts .
And like Williams , many of them are now approaching the end of that particular road .
The antiquated execution chamber at San Quentin is about to see a lot more use .
And California , to its shame , is about to become the new Texas , which has the highest number of executions of any US state since 1976 .
Meanwhile , the US has its own place in the top 10 for executions in the world , lying fourth behind China , Iran and Vietnam .
Judicial killings in California will resume early in the new year , with 75-year - old Clarence Ray Allen set to be executed on January 17 .
He is likely to be followed , in February , by Michael Morales .
Three other death row inmates - Mitchell Carlton Sims , William Payton and Kevin Cooper - are thought likely to be given execution dates next year .
Some observers think there will be more .
The rate is speeding up .
This year , there have been two executions in the state ( the previous one , in January , was of Donald Beardslee ) .
In 2003 and 2004 , there were none .
But now the enthusiasm of prosecutors and politicians for the death penalty in the days after it was reinstated is bearing its strange fruit .
Campaigners against the penalty are pinning their hopes on a proposed moratorium , due to be voted on by the state legislature in early January .
The moratorium has been proposed by Democrats who want the state 's execution schedule to be put on hold for three years pending the results of a special committee 's investigations into wrongful convictions .
The possibility of error and the influence of politics and any number of other factors have moved a man who was central to the return of the death penalty in California to change his mind .
Don Heller wrote the legislation to bring it back - a measure put before voters and approved in a special ballot . ""
On its face it is fair and neutral , "" he says , "" but in reality it 's not fairly applied . ""
Too many human variables enter into the decision - making process governing human death .
It 's clear that , in applying the death penalty , there is discrimination against the poor and minorities , "" he adds , with that claim backed by a study published in September by the Santa Clara Law Review .
"" If you 're rich and have the funds , the probability is that you 're not going to end up on death row . ""
But Heller says that even if the system were perfect , he would not now support the death penalty .
"" The state should not be in the position of administering death , "" he says .
The committee - the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice - was set up last year , and its members hold a wide range of views on the death penalty .
It will complete its work against a rapidly changing and contradictory landscape .
In the first years after its reintroduction , the death penalty was handed down "" widely and wildly "" , in the words of Lance Lindsey , the executive director of Death Penalty Focus .
"" It was a political tool , and politicians - including elected prosecutors and judges - were moving defendants into the death process faster than the courts could keep up . ""
But the pace slackened over recent years .
Until the end of the 90s , between 30 and 40 death penalties were handed down in California each year .
Last year , only nine were issued .
This year , the figure is even lower .
Similarly , public opinion in the state has evolved .
In 1983 , support for the death penalty in opinion polls registered at 83 % .
By last year , it had dropped to 68 % in one poll and 57 % in another .
As every pollster knows , it all depends on the question .
Those approval ratings are in response to whether a person supports the death penalty .
However , when respondents were asked whether they would support life without parole or the death penalty for first - degree murderers , only 38 % chose the death penalty .
"" It 's a very odd time for us , "" Mr Lindsey says of the challenges facing anti - death penalty campaigners .
"" It will be very bipolar because we have this momentum with the commission and public support in the polls for the death penalty falling , and then we have a Texas - style execution process . ""
Like many campaigners , he has come to believe that the death penalty is a function of politics .
His initial idealism , he says , has given way to pragmatism .
"" There has to be a political solution , "" he says , "" which means we have to take the political approach , which means an incremental approach .
"" The committee is due to begin considering the proposal for a moratorium on January 10 .
Clarence Ray Allen is scheduled to die by lethal injection on January 17 .
Let 's hope the increments come quickly ."
"Unlike most of what is produced in Hollywood , this ending was not redemptive .
Tookie Williams , the convicted multiple - murderer whose new role as an anti - gang campaigner was lauded by the White House , was executed after California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denied a last - minute reprieve .
With 647 people , the state has the largest death row in the US .
Campaigners against the death penalty are pinning their hopes on a proposed moratorium due to be voted by the state legislature next month .
Across the water ( the Pacific that is ) momentous events were taking place in China .
Hundreds of South Korea 's notoriously militant farmers , stripped off their boxer shorts and leaped into Hong Kong harbour in an attempt to sink the WTO trade talks .
Their Chinese hosts took a relaxed view of this , but acted against their own errant security forces , who shot and killed anti - factory protesters in southern China .
Chinese authorities arrested the commander of paramilitary forces , who ordered his troops to open fire on a village riot .
An official statement said at least six people had died in the incident .
Lebanon was plunged into a fresh political crisis by the assassination of another leading critic of Syria , the prominent newspaper editor Gibran Tueni .
He was killed when a car bomb detonated by the roadside as he was driving to work , the fourth high - profile critic of Syria to die this year .
His murder came as the UN security council considers a new report into the killing of former Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri .
Iran 's hardline Islamic president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad also added to his credentials as one of the pariahs of the Middle East , by dismissing the Holocaust as a myth and calling for Jews to be moved to Canada and Alaska ."
"Already in trouble with voters in California , Arnold Schwarzenegger was facing a backlash in his native Austria yesterday over his decision last week to allow the execution of Stanley "" Tookie "" Williams .
Leftwing councillors in Graz yesterday announced that they are seeking to strip Mr Schwarzenegger - who was born and grew up near the town - of his Austrian citizenship .
In a further protest , they also want to rename the local sports complex , now the Arnold Schwarzenegger Stadium , as the Tookie Williams Stadium .
"" People have had enough of him , "" Peter Pilz , a Green MP in the regional parliament of Steiermark , told the Guardian yesterday .
"" He was an idol across Austria .
But since the death of ' Tookie ' Williams , the public mood has changed .
"" Stripping him of his citizenship would send a message to opponents of the death penalty in the US .
Austria has signed up to the European human rights convention , which forbids the death penalty .
For us , he has committed a state crime . ""
The rightwing governor of California - who left Austria at 21 - has both American and Austrian nationality .
Previous attempts to strip him of his passport have lacked the support of conservatives .
But in October the Social Democrats won power in the Steiermark parliament , the region in which Graz is located , giving the centre - left a majority for the first time .
In a pre - emptive strike on Monday , however , Mr Schwarzenegger sent a letter to Graz 's mayor announcing that he wanted to sever all his links with the town .
"" Graz will not have any problems in the future with my decisions as governor of California , because officially nothing connects us any more , "" he wrote .
Adding that he still considered himself "" Austrian with all my heart "" , he went on : "" The death penalty is law here and I have to uphold the law of the land and the will of the people . ""
He was returning a ring given to him in 1999 when Graz made him an honorary citizen , he said , and withdrawing permission for the football stadium to use his name . ""
Since the official Graz appears to no longer accept me as one of their own , this ring has lost its meaning and value to me , "" Mr Schwarzenegger wrote ."
"Hundreds of mourners have attended the funeral of the former gang boss Stanley "" Tookie "" Williams , who was executed in California last week .
A series of celebrity speakers at the service , held in south Los Angeles , criticised the California governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , for his refusal to grant clemency to the 51-year - old convicted murderer .
More than 1,500 mourners , including religious leaders and gang members , attended the service at the Bethel AME church .
Speakers included the hip - hop star Snoop Dogg , the anti - death penalty campaigner Bianca Jagger , the Reverend Jesse Jackson , the Nation of Islam leader , Louis Farrakhan , and the motivational speaker Tony Robbins .
Williams , who co - founded the Crips street gang and was convicted of murdering four people , was executed by lethal injection at San Quentin prison last Tuesday .
He was killed despite a high - profile campaign for clemency in which supporters claimed he had become a reformed character during more than 20 years on death row .
At a service lasting for more than four hours , speakers denounced capital punishment .
Ms Jagger said Mr Schwarzenegger 's actions "" revealed disregard for human rights , due process and the US constitution "" .
Snoop Dogg recited a poem entitled Until We Meet Again , in which he referred to the execution .
"" It 's nine - fifteen on twelve - thirteen and another black king will be taken from the scene , "" he said .
A stanza that read : "" I do n't believe Stan did it , "" drew wild applause from the car park outside the church where more mourners - including some gang members wearing blue , the colour associated with the Crips - were watching the service on large television screens .
Williams was executed for the shotgun murders of 26-year - old convenience store clerk Albert Owens and motel owners Yen - I Yang , 76 , and
Tsai - Shai Chen Yang , 63 , and their 43-year - old daughter Yu - Chin Yang Lin in 1979 .
He had always claimed he was innocent , although Robert Martin , one of the prosecutors who sent Williams to prison , recently claimed the evidence had been thoroughly scrutinised by the courts and was "" rock solid "" .
Mr Martin questioned arguments that Williams had redeemed himself while on death row , where he wrote children 's books warning against gang life .
There was a high police presence in the area surrounding the funeral .
After the service , many of those outside the church dropped to the ground at the sound of what appeared to be three gunshots being fired nearby .
There were no reports of injuries or arrests .
The death of Williams - who asked for his ashes to be scattered in South Africa - was an "" abuse of power , "" the Reverend Al Sharpton told mourners by telephone from New York .
Mr Farrakhan compared Williams ' trial and execution to those of Jesus .
Both , he said , were innocent men executed for political reasons . ""
Every true revolutionary , every man that will not bow down to the forces of this world , will be rebuked and scorned , "" he said .
He called on gang members to become "" natural leaders "" of the black community , and urged them to down their guns .
Williams "" is the patron saint of all those struggling in gang life , "" he added .
Rev Jackson said that , at the end of his life , Williams saw himself as a "" healer , not a predator "" .
Several dozen gang members watched the service in the car park .
One who identified himself as "" Killowatt the Third "" said of Williams : ""
That 's my role model , man .
That 's the CEO of the Crips . ""
Other mourners included Al Birdsong , a 54-year - old school security officer who said Williams did not deserve to be executed after more than two decades in prison .
"" I 'm here to pay my respects to humanity , and that goes to Tookie and everyone else they do in ...
what if it was your son ?
"" he said .
A message recorded by Williams in prison was played for the mourners .
"" The war within me is over , "" he said .
"" I battled my demons and I was triumphant . ""
He asked listeners to spread a message to their loved ones , saying : "" Teach them to promote peace and teach them to focus on rebuilding the neighbourhoods that you , others and I helped to destroy . """
"Heavy machinery is used to remove the name of the Austrian - born California governor from Graz 's football stadium .
Photograph : Martina Paier / EPA
The Terminator has been terminated : early yesterday the piqued Austrian city of Graz removed the words "" Arnold Schwarzenegger "" from the city 's football stadium after tempers flared over the California governor 's refusal to spare the life of a death - row prisoner .
The impromptu midnight renaming ceremony means the stadium will revert to being known simply as Stadion Graz - Liebenau , after the district of the city where it is located .
The former film star , who was born in Graz , demanded that the city remove his name from the stadium after fierce criticism from the residents of Graz of the execution of Stanley "" Tookie "" Williams , a multiple murderer who died by lethal injection earlier this month .
Promotional articles about Schwarzenegger have now been removed from Graz 's official website but tempers remain frayed .
A brief news item on the site reporting the name change prompts the pithy comment from one reader , Helmut Horn : "" Good .
You do n't name sports stadiums after murderers . ""
Johannes Rosbacher deems Arnie 's reaction "" stupid and exaggerated "" , adding "" only Graz can win from this .
The real greats do n't come from Hollywood . ""
Over on the Graz tourism website , the guestbook - formerly a civilised forum for the exchange of information about hotels and taxis , and encomiums from satisfied holidaymakers - has been taken over by a furious row about Schwarzenegger .
A user calling him / herself Noodles , presumably unaware that the name change has been demanded by Schwarzenegger , dismisses it as "" a feeble statement by politically correct city officials "" .
US supporters of the death penalty ( who are many , prolific and vitriolic in their scorn of "" liberal "" Europeans ) , have posted gems such as "" Europeans coddle child rapist murders and this is an injustice "" , and the topic of Austria 's Nazi past is a popular one ( sample posting : "" How can your citizens condemn the execution of one known murderer when your still have the blood of thousands on your hands ? "" ) .
One poster even announces he is "" initiating a drive to rename any American stadium that is named after a European "" .
Last word to Joe Gandalmann at the Moderate Voice , who has a not - quite - serious take on how all this affects Schwarzenegger 's election prospects : What 's interesting now is how all of this helps frame Schwarzenegger .
His popularity is at an all - time low here in California but he ends the year with having thrown both Democrats ' and Republicans ' noses out of joint as he attempts to inch back to the middle .
Now you have this : he 's being opposed by Social Democrats , Communists and Green Party members in Austria .
So , if he plans to for run for re - election arguing that he 's an independent , he 'll be able to boast that he 's hated by partisans on TWO continents ."
"A day after Arnold Schwarzenegger 's Austrian birthplace of Graz removed his name from a football stadium to comply with the California governor 's wishes , it yesterday deleted references to him on the city 's websites .
He had written demanding that it stop using his name for promotional purposes , angered by fierce criticism of his refusal to block the December 13 execution in California of Stanley "" Tookie "" Williams .
Mr Schwarzenegger opted for a pre - emptive strike after calls mounted in Graz , whose slogan is City of Human Rights , for the stadium to be stripped of his name ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger was riding his motorcycle illegally over the weekend when he collided with a car in Los Angeles , police said .
The California governor does not have the proper motorcycle endorsement on his driving licence , contradicting statements by his spokeswoman since the accident on Sunday that left him with 15 stitches on his lip .
Police referred their findings to the city attorney 's office , which will determine whether he should be charged .
His spokeswoman had said his licence allowed him to ride the motorcycle with its sidecar attached ."
"California is set to execute a 75-year - old blind man who has diabetes , suffered a heart attack in September and can not walk unaided .
Clarence Ray Allen turns 76 on January 16 .
Unless a last - minute appeal to a federal court delivers a stay of execution or Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger grants clemency , it will be his last full day alive .
At one minute past midnight on January 17 , Allen will be executed by lethal injection in the same San Quentin chamber where the convicted murderer and gang leader Stanley "" Tookie "" Williams was executed last month .
For death penalty advocates , Allen 's case demonstrates the inadequacies of the life sentence .
For opponents , the execution of a frail elderly man is inhumane .
In 1982 Allen was convicted of ordering the 1980 killings of Bryon Schletewitz , 27 , Josephine Rocha , 17 , and Douglas White , 18 .
Prosecutors alleged that Allen had ordered the killings while serving a life sentence for ordering the murder of an accomplice in a 1974 robbery .
Schletewitz had testified against Allen in his first trial .
Prosecutors alleged that Allen paid Billy Ray Hamilton $ 25,000 ( £ 14,000 ) to kill Schletewitz .
When Hamilton was arrested he had a list of eight people who had testified against Allen .
This week lawyers representing Allen asked a federal court to block his execution .
An appeal was rejected by the California supreme court on Tuesday .
After considering depositions from lawyers for Allen and from the district attorney , Governor Schwarzenegger will make a decision on clemency .
But Allen 's refusal to express remorse is unlikely to sit well with Schwarzenegger , who cited "" Tookie "" Williams 's refusal as one of the grounds for rejecting clemency .
Allen 's attorneys wrote in the petition to the California supreme court : "" To wheel Mr Allen , a blind , aged , crippled and enfeebled man , into the execution chamber at San Quentin to be put to death would be a bizarre spectacle that shocks the conscience . ""
But prosecutors are adamant that Allen 's past behaviour demonstrates that he is a threat even while incarcerated .
"" Allen was 50 years old when he orchestrated the ... murders , "" the deputy attorney general .
Ward Campbell . wrote in a brief . ""
The fact that he faces execution as a senior citizen is his responsibility ...
Mr Allen has shown that imprisonment is simply no guarantee of public security . """
"BP has polished its green credentials - and pleased Arnold Schwarzenegger - by announcing plans for a revolutionary hydrogen - fuelled power plant in California costing $ 1bn ( £ 570 m ) .
The facility will be able to generate electricity with almost no carbon emissions by converting the waste product of oil refineries into hydrogen and separating off carbon dioxide for capture and storage .
Although some environmentalists remain sceptical about the unproven process , known as carbon sequestration , many see it as an acceptable compromise in the battle against global warming . ""
Wide - scale deployment of technology such as hydrogen power can make a significant contribution to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions needed worldwide , "" said Ross Pillari , president of BP America .
Mr Schwarzenegger , the actor turned California governor , said the plant , 20 miles south of Los Angeles , was a "" perfect fit "" for his policies for the US west coast state .
The scheme mirrors one announced last June in Scotland when BP said it would construct a hydrogen plant at Peterhead separating natural gas from CO2 .
The £ 350 m project involves reinjecting the greenhouse gas into the Miller oil field in the North Sea to help flush out more hydrocarbons , before being stored there .
The greenhouse gases from the Los Angeles plant are expected to be taken by pipeline to oil fields being developed by Occidental Petroleum in California .
Instead of natural gas , as at Peterhead , the US plant will take petroleum coke produced as a by - product of oil refining .
Currently the waste coke is exported to China as fuel .
The hydrogen plant would capture around 90 % of the CO2 produced and generate 500 megawatts of power , powering 325,000 homes .
But BP , and its local partner Edison Mission , have made it clear that the costs of hydrogen power are higher than traditional fuels and they will be looking for financial help .
In November BP launched plans , revealed in this paper , to invest up to $ 8bn over the next ten years to create a low - carbon power business .
It aims to produce revenues of $ 6bn as the company , under chief executive John Browne , also invests in solar and wind power ."
"Barring a last - minute intervention by the courts , California will execute the third death - row prisoner in as many months at one minute past midnight tonight .
The planned lethal injection at San Quentin prison near San Francisco follows the rejection on Friday by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of a clemency petition on behalf of the murderer Michael Morales .
But it has pitted medical professionals against the governor .
In line with a federal court order , an anaesthetist will ensure that Morales has been rendered unconscious by a sedative before being injected with drugs to stop his heart .
The order follows an appeal by Morales that California 's lethal injection procedure constituted "" cruel and unusual punishment "" .
The issue arose in part because of problems with the execution of Stanley "" Tookie "" Williams in December when guards took 12 minutes to find a vein .
The presence of an anaesthetist is intended to prevent similar difficulties , but it is in conflict with the ethical code governing medical professionals . ""
The use of a physician 's clinical skill and judgment for purposes other than promoting an individual 's health and welfare undermines a basic ethical foundation of medicine - first , do no harm , "" said Dr Priscilla Ray , who chairs an American Medical Association ethics committee .
"" Requiring physicians to be involved in executions violates their oath to protect lives and erodes public confidence in the medical profession . ""
The California Medical Association agreed , arguing that it "" has for decades sought to end physician participation in capital punishment "" .
Morales 's lawyers appealed to a federal court on Friday arguing that the anaesthetist 's presence "" does nothing to alleviate the substantial likelihood "" of "" unnecessary and excruciating pain "" .
All five appeals to Mr Schwarzenegger for clemency have now been rejected .
Morales , 46 , was convicted for the 1981 rape and murder of Terri Winchell , 17 .
His lawyers requested that his sentence be commuted to life without parole , citing good conduct , his remorse , the influence of drugs on his actions and the role of a prison informant in his conviction .
The clemency appeal contended that the death penalty was sought because Bruce Samuelson testified that Morales had boasted about the crime in a conversation conducted in Spanish .
Samuelson gave his testimony in return for a deal on his own charges .
A decade later it emerged that Morales does not speak Spanish .
The trial judge told Mr Schwarzenegger that without Samuelson 's testimony , Morales would not have received the death penalty .
But the governor said that judge and jury were aware of Samuelson 's deal , and said he was one of several witnesses at the trial who testified about Morales 's attitude .
But Morales 's attorney , David Senior , said : "" For 25 years , he 's shown regret and remorse .
We 're not asking for a pardon .
We 're asking that his sentence be commuted to life in prison without the possibility of parole . """
"Ever since Arnold Schwarzenegger became Der Kali - Führer in 2003 , I 've been wondering if the Democrats could ever find an equivalent figure to run for office .
And suddenly it seemed so obvious : If Mr Freeze can run on his celebrity - recognition quotient alone , with a campaign platform containing no discernible political ideas whatsoever , then surely Batman himself can run for the White House .
That 's right : George Clooney for president .
Far - fetched ?
Well , let 's run some comparisons .
It 's been a while since we had our last actor president , and , whatever liberals may think of Reagan , celebrity earns you extra points with the public and knowing how to deliver one 's lines is an asset in politics , so Clooney already has one up on the verbal dyslexic currently calling the shots in Washington .
Clooney has one divorce in his background , but no scandal beyond clipping David O Russell round the ear on the set of Three Kings , which is the kind of thing that plays well in the Red states - much like shooting lawyers in the face .
His youthful indiscretions pale against the current incumbent 's binge - drinking , DUI convictions , perpetual bailings - out , not to mention draft - dodging .
Clooney might merely be expected to apologise for Revenge Of The Killer Tomatoes and for his never - released debut movie , co - starring the louchely Kennedyesque Charlie Sheen .
He 'd be the first single president , well , since Michael Douglas in The American President , which would make him a bit like the skirt - hound Kennedy , though Clooney appears not to be the almost neurotic priapist JFK was .
One of Kennedy 's more famous conquests was Angie Dickinson ( "" the most unforgettable 60 seconds of my life , "" was her post - coital verdict ) , better known as the original Mrs Danny Ocean , so there 's a whiff of that retro - Camelot glamour for you right there .
Like Reagan , Kennedy and Clinton , he 'd probably be a grating presence to a good half of the American electorate , but it did n't kill them and it would n't kill him .
Politically , a Clooney presidency would probably strive to return sanity to the national debate .
The American right has long smeared Clooney as just another loopy Hollywood liberal , but there 's no evidence that he 's anything but an old - fashioned American centrist .
His political movies , particularly this Friday 's Syriana and Good Night , And Good Luck , are hardly radical agitprop .
They ( and Three Kings and Clooney 's TV remake of Fail Safe ) may have the slightly worthy air of civics lessons , but they certainly suggest the guy is engaged with his times .
A good - looking , independently minded , lapsed - Catholic , clean - and - sober actor versus a bought - and - paid - for , dry - drunk fundamentalist and four - decade failure of a human glove - puppet ?
Voters , the choice is clear !"
"Arnold Schwarzenegger has granted parole to a murderer who became an Episcopal priest while in jail .
The state parole board voted last October to release James Tramel , 38 , who was convicted of killing a homeless man in an unprovoked attack in 1986 that the victim 's family called a "" thrill killing "" .
Mr Schwarzenegger rejected Tramel 's parole a year ago , but his office did not say why the governor of California had changed his mind .
While in jail , Tramel gained a master 's degree in theological studies and counselled dying inmates .
He is due to be released tomorrow ."
"Well it had to happen sooner or later .
Last year , senators throughout the US busied themselves attempting to restrict the sale of violent games to minors - you may remember that Arnold Schwarzenegger oversaw the implementation of a violent videogame bill in California last October .
Well now State Senator Tommy Kilby of Wartburg , Tennessee has put forward a bill making violent games illegal to everyone . ""
The bill states games depicting violence against anyone including authority figures , such as police , should be outlawed , "" explains Wate.com .
Gamesindustry.biz elaborates on a story which seems all too predictable .
Of course , the bill has little chance of being accepted and this may be about one senator merely attempting to raise his profile , but it 's an interesting glimpse at where the conservative agenda may be heading this year ."
"Producers planning the fourth film in the Terminator series have given up on Arnold Schwarzenegger taking anything more than a cameo role , according to the Daily Mirror .
With Schwarzenegger firmly ensconced in his role as Governor of California they have decided to make the movie without relying on his assistance .
Andy Vajna , who produced the most recent film in the franchise , Terminator 3 : Rise of the Machines , said : "" We would like Arnie as a cameo .
"" We want to go on with the Terminator and turn it into a real sci - fi picture - there is a very interesting role for Arnold if he wants it .
But I 'm not sure where he is with his politics - we 'll see . ""
The film is planned to go into production next year on Australia 's Gold Coast but no cast or crew details have yet been released .
Nevertheless Vajna says a script is in place and "" we are now looking for a director and figuring out what the next step is "" .
Terminator 3 was famously dismissed by James Cameron , who directed the first two films in the saga , and said simply : "" I told the story . ""
But the third film , directed by Jonathan Mostow and starring Clare Danes and Nick Stahl opposite Arnie 's cyborg from the future , nevertheless made more than $ 150 m in the US alone ."
"Tony Blair will tonight meet the Terminator - aka the governor of California , Mr Arnold Schwarzenegger - in a round - table discussion on global warming as part of his business trip to the state .
Mr Blair , the first serving British prime minister to visit the Golden State , will meet the governor in Long Beach and is expected to announce a joint UK - California agreement on CO2 emissions .
The two men will also hold a joint press conference .
However , the environmental record of the former Hollywood hardman has been attacked , as the governor owns a highly - fuel inefficient Humvee .
Mr Schwarzenegger is facing relection later this year , and Mr Blair will also meet his Democrat challenger , the Californian state treasurer Phil Angelides .
Tomorrow , Mr Blair will give another major foreign policy speech at the World Affairs Council in Los Angeles , before ending his five - day trip to California and jetting off to Barbados , where he and his family are expected to stay once again at Sir Cliff Richard 's villa .
Before meeting Mr Schwarzenegger , Mr Blair was due to tour biotech firms in San Francisco .
The most controversial engagement of his trip has seen him address several hundred executives of Rupert Murdoch 's News International corporation at a private seminar at the Pebble Beach golf resort .
He has also been the VIP guest at a Malibu reception hosted by Antonio Villaraigosa , the mayor of Los Angeles .
However , the trip has been overshadowed by the deepening crisis and bloodshed in Lebanon .
Mr Schwarzenegger was elected in a special ' recall ' election in 2003 and faces a new election in November .
Although a Republican , the naturalised American citizen is seen as a liberal on issues such as stem cell research and gay rights - putting him at odds with the Republican party in Washington ."

Perhaps Mr Blair wanted to help nurture the debate in US politics about whether there needs to be greater direct engagement with countries like Syria and Iran , who are part of that arc , or "" archipelago of danger "" as one US diplomat once described the problem to me .
Mr Blair 's recent speeches have been greeted a little wearily by political editors at home , but whisking them off to the Golden State might have been expected to add some pep to the coverage .

"Armoured golf and the Governator Tony Blair and Arnold Schwarzenegger were n't in California just to address Rupert Murdoch 's management conference .
Oh no .
As well as signing an agreement to tackle global warming , the Governator was reportedly spotted cruising around the Spanish Bay golf links in his golf cart .
But this was no ordinary fairway buggy , according to the Monterey Herald , it was a miniature Hummer golf cart .
One like this , perhaps ?
Blair - sized hole in the Times
It was quite a coup , of course , for Rupert Murdoch to get Tony Blair to turn up at his Pebble Beach News Corp conference .
Even better , he gave the keynote address , and the icing on the cake was that the prime minister came up with a brand new headline - friendly phrase - "" cross - dressing "" policymakers .
Brilliant !
So Murdoch 's flagship British newspaper , the Times , would surely be all over the story .
What better way to big up the boss - all in the interests of a genuine story , of course .
And yet , and yet ... not a single word of Blair 's speech made it into the paper .
Editor Robert Thomson , one of the many News Corp executives with Murdoch in California , was presumably as surprised as Monkey was .
Tuesday August 1
Long John Witherow hobbles forth Sunday Times editor John Witherow and its economics editor , David Smith , were the paper 's only representatives to be invited to Rupert Murdoch 's Pebble Beach festival of chin stroking .
Monkey hears the normally shy and retiring Witherow has been making a bit of a spectacle of himself .
For all the right reasons , though - he is on crutches , poor chap , after hurting his ankle playing tennis with Lord Levy , apparently .
It has drawn unkind comparisons with Long John Silver from Sunday Times staff who can now hear him hobbling along the corridor , giving them plenty of time to get their heads down and avoid eye contact .
Apologies for the interruption to your service With Rupert Murdoch 's executive chinwag in full swing , Monkey thought we should mark the event with our very own MySpace page .
After all , Murdoch 's new toy was never likely to be far away from the top of the Pebble Beach agenda .
What a shame , then , that the site has been periodically down today because of routine maintenance .
Perhaps they decided to do it when the boss was otherwise engaged ...
Sun shines on Pascoe - Watson
It 's a tale of two political editors .
Trevor Kavanagh , the Sun 's former political editor turned associate editor , was one of the paper 's senior staff invited to Rupert Murdoch 's Pebble Beach party - unlike the man who succeeded him , George Pascoe - Watson , who did n't make the guest list , poor chap .
But hang on , Pascoe - Watson made it Stateside after all , not in Pebble Beach but following Tony Blair on his whistlestop tour of the US .
So which is the better gig - schmoozing with Murdoch and listening to endless presentations in a Pebble Beach marquee , or hobnobbing with Blair and Arnold Schwarzenegger ?
Monkey knows which one has the better biscuits .
Hasta la vista , Rupert Everyone 's talking about Tony Blair 's American meeting with one of the country 's most instantly recognisable faces .
No , not Rupert Murdoch but Arnold Schwarzenegger , with whom the prime minister has just signed a groundbreaking agreement on carbon emission .
Let 's hope the News Corp boss , who invited Blair to address his Pebble Beach powwow , is n't too upset at being upstaged by the Terminator .
They have a lot in common , of course .
Both born overseas , both adopted American citizenship , both worth a bob or two and both sent back from an apocalyptic future to battle the seemingly unstoppable T-1000 - aka the Daily Mail .
Church of Bono Iconoclast , visionary , maverick ...
really , Monkey is at a loss to describe the planet - sized entity that is Bono .
Further showing the resolute , bloody - minded , sheer get - things - done - in - your - own - way - and - stuff - them - ness that makes him a worthy successor to Bob Geldof 's pajamas , Bono showed them on Monday night ( or Night 2 of the Future , as it is known in News Corp circles ) that he was n't one to follow the crowd .
None of that trooping into the marquee thing , which actually resembles a Scientology church , for Bono and his followers .
Instead , he dragged the faithful to the Mission in nearby Carmel .
Way to go , Onob .
Baddie bag
Of course this would n't be a corporate shindig without the goodie bag .
The Imagining the Future bag was a disappointingly low - grade , blue - and - white shiny vinyl number , not , frankly , the sort of gift basket to which the assembled glitzers are accustomed .
But never mind .
The contents , alas , remain a mystery .
Inexplicably , Monkey was not on the list , an oversight for which News Corp will surely suffer when its imagined future becomes reality .
Staying off the green With the morning 's slog over - including all that wearying yoof stuff from the unbearable MySpace groupies - the delegates rushed to the sumptuous golf course .
Actually , that 's not true .
The course remained disappointingly bereft of future imagineers .
Even Ross Kemp stayed away .
The nearest any of them got to the great outdoors was to take the proffered lunch box and stroll to the beach .
Where is that spirit of adventure , that desire to tackle nature , to pit one 's will against that of a small white ball ?
Rupert will surely take note .
Nicole 's the star attraction
Monkey is still intrigued by the presence of Nicole Kidman and new hubbie Keith Urban at the opening night 's do .
Forget the politicos , the captains of industry , the rock stars , the face all heads turned to see was Nicole .
Waiters surreptitiously took circuitous routes to cop a look at the waif - like one , guests at the resort pressed their noses to the windows in the vain hope that her fragrance could penetrate glass .
But other than providing star power and being Australian , why was she there ?
Is Rupert about to offer her a place on the board ?
Monday July 31 Rebekah takes flight Boarding the 8.44am flight from Los Angeles to Monterey : "" And daahling , the diamantes in Pebble Beach ... "" squawks a voice .

She 's an actress , "" explains Rebekah , betraying not a hint of exasperation .
"" What 's she done ? "" asked Ross .
After some delay , the plane starts to taxi .
And taxi .
And taxi . ""
Is this going to fly or are we going on the freeway ? "" asks Ross .
Shortly after , the plane takes off , forced skyward by the thrust of his jaw .
For the rest of the flight , they are forced into silence by the droning of the propellers .
Rebekah turns to more serious reading matter , waving some papers at a colleague sitting behind . ""
Not much , is it , "" she says .
Surely no way to talk about the prime minister 's speech to the News Corp gathering before he 's even delivered it .
The plane touches down in Monterey at 10.22 .
"" Twenty two minutes late , "" frets Rebekah .
She looks out of the window .
"" Nothing better than seeing the News Corp jet sitting there doing nothing when you arrive . ""
Ah , the perils of public transport , eh , Rebekah ?
Cop that Fortunately no one misbehaved during the flight , no tabloid antics , smoking in the loos , demanding extra miniature wines .
Had they been tempted they would have felt the long arm of the law reach forward from the back of the plane .
For who else should be sitting there than another of Rupert 's friends - he has so many - LAPD chief Bill Bratton .
Flying the flag
Meanwhile at golf central - the Inn at Spanish Bay on the private peninsular of Pebble Beach - Bill Clinton has put in his final practice rounds and
the finishing touches are being put to the marquee for the evening 's main event .
But this is more than a marquee .
This is a structure , replete with columns , pillars , stanchions , the lot .
It even flies flags : one for the US , one for the UK , and lots of blue and white flags for News Corp. Security blanket Law enforcement prowls the grounds , disrupting the serenity of the bay : Monterey County Sheriff 's Department , private security guards , men in shiny black jackets bearing gold star badges , and squads of heavily built gentlemen sporting crew cuts , mirror shades - in spite of the heavy cloud - with yellow wires spiralling out of their ears .
Some are dressed a la Dude , all vests and flip - flops , others wear secret service suits .
Is this what they mean by Imagining the Future ?
Sun shines for Tony One could sense spirits sinking as the arriving Brits surveyed the grey , cloudy skies above Pebble Beach .
The spectacular , craggy coastline was more reminiscent of the west coast of Scotland , even down to the palm trees , than the stereotype of California .
But then , midway through the afternoon , shortly before the arrival of his Tonyship , the clouds parted , the sun shone and blue sky was glimpsed .
Just goes to show the power of "" complete inner self - confidence "" .
Cross - dressing in the cabinet
And what to make of the prime minister 's assertion in his speech that "" cross - dressing is rampant "" in policy .
What can this mean , or more urgently
, what should be done to address this disturbing social trend ?
Can Asbos be modified to combat the scourge of cross - dressing policy wonks ?

"Richard Branson , the Virgin tycoon , stood out from the business leaders flanking Tony Blair and California 's governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , at a photocall last week for two reasons .
First , he was the only one wearing jeans .
And second , he was clutching a well - thumbed paperback .
Branson was showing that he is reading the bible of enlightened businessmen : The Weather Makers , a book by Australian scientist Tim Flannery issuing a passionate call to arms about climate change .
Since its publication in Britain in March , the book has struck a chord .
Blair himself has said that anyone who reads it ' will be left wiser and able to appreciate how fragile our climate is ' : Robert F Kennedy , nephew of JFK and environmental activist , describes it as ' the finest account of the overwhelming science behind global warming ' .
It is being discussed everywhere from the blog run by David Miliband , the Environment Secretary , to the Church of England , with Flannery taking part in debates with senior clergy interested in climate change .
So what does it say ?
Reviews suggest it is not the most scientifically dazzling or groundbreaking account of climate change - but it is one of the most accessible , setting out in punishing detail how mankind is destroying the planet .
Crucially , the last chapter has a list of small steps all individuals could take to reduce the environmental threat , leaving the reader on a positive note .
Branson might run an airline , one of the worst offenders in carbon emissions , but his reading matter sends a convenient signal that he 's green at heart ."
"Celebrities , it seems , are everywhere .
California 's superstar - in - chief , Arnold Schwarzenegger , has persuaded Steven Spielberg to back his gubernatorial re - election campaign ; his challenger , Phil Angelides , can count Diane Keaton and Barbara Streisand among the faithful .
On this side of the Atlantic , Tony Blair once wooed Noel Gallagher , while David Cameron has courted everyone from Bob Geldof to , er , Adam Rickitt .
But in recent days Cameron 's proposed "" celebrity A - list "" of parliamentary candidates has come under fire , with high - profile candidates accused of waiting for plumb seats to fall into their laps .
Indeed , it sometimes appears that not all celebrities are truly interested in politics .
So , is our politicians ' obsession with celebrity dumbing down British politics - or helping to bring a welcome touch of razzle - dazzle to the dusty corridors of Westminster ?"
"Arnold Schwarzenegger stood , his hands folded in front of his muscular frame , looking as if he had stepped directly out from the big screen .
In the same intimidating pose as the Secret Service men hovering in the background , California 's celebrity Governor cuts a beefier figure than his erstwhile bodyguards .
It is a jarring sight - The Governator in the flesh .
The jutting jawline , perma - tan and thick Austrian accent are iconic for action movie fans across the world .
Though he is now a politician responsible for a state with the eighth largest economy in the world , you still expect him to growl '
I 'll be back ! ' ,
not ' Balance the budget ' .
Moments earlier Schwarzenegger had walked from behind a blue curtain to kick off a vital campaign event in the state capital of Sacramento . '
Good to see you ! '
he exclaimed to a group of sober - suited anti - tax crusaders who had lined up to endorse his re - election bid .
Then he spied a pack of journalists and cameras . '
Lighten up ! '
he commanded . '
It is all good news once again ! '
Arnie was in a good mood .
He joked , pressed the flesh and took questions from reporters .
It was a typical performance , exuding the confidence that comes from being comfortably ahead in the polls .
Most believe that Schwarzenegger will win re - election in November - something unimaginable just a year ago .
Back then , Schwarzenegger was in deep trouble .
His ambitious reform plans had hit the buffers .
He looked powerless and adrift .
Californians of all political stripes had begun to doubt the wisdom of electing to their highest office a man famous for playing a killer robot .
Not now .
Over the past six months Schwarzenegger has embarked on a wholescale political reinvention .
He has pushed environmental policy to the front of his agenda and distanced himself from the White House .
So successful has his revamp been that Schwarzenegger has managed to split one of America 's most reliable liberal bastions : Hollywood .
Some of the biggest movers and shakers have turned their back on years of Democratic support to back him publicly .
Yet perhaps Schwarzenegger 's comeback should have been as easy to predict as one of his movie plot lines .
For a man who made Terminators 1 , 2 and 3 , there was always going to be a sequel to The Governator .
John Campbell is the reason that Schwarzenegger is winning .
A registered Democrat in a state where Republicans make up less than 40 per cent of the electorate , Campbell , and thousands of other Californian Democrats , are happy to vote for Arnie the Republican . '
He was a reasonable actor
but he 's been a much better governor , '
the banker said on his lunch break in Long Beach , a seaside suburb of Los Angeles .
To win , Schwarzenegger has to persuade middle - ground independents and right - wing Democrats to back him .
So his policies are far from the Republican issues dominating national politics .
Schwarzenegger does not get involved in disputes over evolution or abortion and does no kowtowing to the evangelical rightwingers .
Schwarzenegger harps on themes Democrats listen to : the environment and small businesses .
He goes against national Republican policy on stem cell research , which he supports in defiance of a White House veto on funding .
His biggest coup has to be winning over some of Hollywood 's leading lights .
In the rest of America , Republicans slam Hollywood as a liberal stronghold out of touch with heartland values .
But , for this Republican , they number some of his most notable fans .
A host of top directors and producers has been coming out to endorse Schwarzenegger , including Steven Spielberg , James Cameron , Haim Saban and Jeffrey Katzenberg , Jerry Zucker , who was behind the Airplane !
movies , and Bud Yorkin .
Many have been among the most reliable and generous Democrat donors .
Saban spent $ 200,000 fighting the 2003 recall election that brought Schwarzenegger to power .
Schwarzenegger has split Hollywood 's usually unified front .
Supporters of his opponent , Democratic state treasurer Phil Angelides , have come out fighting .
His campaign has cited more than two dozen celebrity backers , including Barbra Streisand , Diane Keaton , Will Ferrell , Laura Dern and Matt Dillon .
Angelides staffers say Schwarzenegger has just tapped his old mates to get support . '
He has become a fake Democrat in a Republican power tie and a few of his friends in Hollywood seem to be buying his new act , ' a campaign spokesman said .
But there is no denying that Schwarzenegger 's style - if not always his substance - is a very different Republicanism from that on offer in the rest of the country . '
People forget that there are other sorts of Republicans out there , ' said Professor Shaun Bowler of the University of California .
Schwarzenegger is definitely different .
While national Republican strategists attack gay rights , Schwarzenegger is socially liberal and at ease with California 's powerful gay lobby .
His chief of staff is gay and so is his personal assistant .
He spends more time during the week with those two gay staffers than he does with his wife , Maria Shriver ( her chief of staff is gay , too ) .
Schwarzenegger recently spoke to a Republican gay rights organisation and told the crowd in his booming Teutonic voice : ' I love all of you ! '
It is hard to imagine George W Bush or Dick Cheney doing that .
Schwarzenegger 's political career has been like a Disneyland rollercoaster .
He roared into power in the bizarre circus that was 2003 's recall election .
He promised big change and bipartisan support .
It worked for a few months and then collapsed .
When a budget was not enacted in time he taunted Democrats as ' girlie men ' .
Then he went directly to the people , holding hugely expensive public ballots aimed at curbing the power of teaching unions and other labour groups .
Millions of dollars were spent by both sides .
Schwarzenegger lost every time .
He reshuffled his staff and adopted a less ambitious agenda that managed to get laws on the books .
Then , most importantly , he went green .
The change was most obvious on his campaign bus .
Out went the brash red , white and blue and in came a glorious image of Yosemite National Park .
He touts the green line constantly . '
California can show true leadership in protecting the environment , ' he told the Sacramento meeting , which was ostensibly about tax cuts .
But it is not all talk .
Earlier this month , Schwarzenegger and Tony Blair announced an agreement to bypass the Bush administration with a bilateral approach to fighting global warming .
Schwarzenegger is essentially conducting his own foreign policy .
He wants California to cut its greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels by 2010 and , as California is the twelfth largest emitter in the world , that is no small goal .
Schwarzenegger has endorsed research into greener cars .
He has unveiled a ' bioenergy plan ' to boost energy production from alternatives such as ethanol .
But he is treading carefully so as not to antagonise his Republican big business backers . '
The challenge for us is showing how we can protect the environment and also protect the economy while we do so , ' he said .
It is a campaign that has so far seen Schwarzenegger easily pull ahead of his opponent , who has appeared short of money and ideas .
In a state where many value razzmatazz , Angelides 's efforts have failed to inspire .
He is a long - time Democratic insider and his day job involves complex issues of finance , bond sales and pensions .
His speaking style is seen as too caustic and he has been lambasted in the press for frequently mentioning his Harvard education .
In the best of times he would perhaps have been an average candidate .
Faced with a man whose celebrity is known planet - wide , these are far from the best of times .
But on the streets of Hollywood there is real anger .
California faces huge social issues and large swaths of genuine poverty .
The real Hollywood is a down - at - heel area of strip malls and dowdy bars .
The celebrities all live in Beverly Hills or Malibu .
Few good words are to be found about the Governator on the streets .
Standing on Sunset Boulevard , film student Tony Bainbridge has short shrift for Schwarzenegger 's conversion to green causes .
He points out that this is the man who almost singlehandedly brought the gas - guzzling Hummer to popular attention . '
He 's just another big rich Republican driving a big car , ' Bainbridge said .
Here Schwarzenegger is seen as a poor joke .
He is the bad punch - line to 2003 's freak show of candidates .
He is not a moderate Republican .
He will forever be the former star of Conan the Barbarian . '
Californians just go for the whole movie star thing .
They ca n't help it at times , but it is insane .
They like the strong - man image .
A guy like Angelides is n't perfect , but at least he 's a real politician , ' said Gabriel Jacobs , an entertainment industry executive .
Certainly , behind the Democrat - friendly spin , Schwarzenegger is a true Republican , even if not in the Bush mould .
On the environment , his words often far exceed his actions .
Last year he lopped nine staff from a well - respected energy programme .
He has halved funds for wild salmon restoration and eliminated funding for state fish hatcheries .
He slashed $ 17 million from a $ 31 m ' Natural Resources Stewardship Package ' .
He has cut money for staffing and maintenance in state parks .
He is also facing huge business pressure to pare back his ambitions for cutting greenhouse gas emissions and has shown every sign of ceding to it as the legislation takes shape .
He has backed Big Oil in its fight to stop it being forced to pay taxes to fund alternative energy research .
In truth , many would say , Schwarzenegger 's success is all smoke and mirrors .
On immigration , he speaks movingly about his own immigrant story and the need of America to look after its immigrants and give them a job and a chance .
And then he sends National Guard troops to the Mexican border . '
On many issues he does not so much sit on the fence , as jump from one side to the other , ' Bowler said .
Back in Sacramento , Schwarzenegger basked in the moment as a succession of businessmen hailed his record .
They painted the prospect of an Angelides win as a nightmare . '
It will bring California back into the fiscal dark ages , ' thundered Lew Uhler , head of the National Tax Limitation Committee .
Schwarzenegger beamed and then took questions .
One reporter pressed him on how he could pose as a tax - cutting governor when he had raised college fees for many Californians .
It was a fair point . '
What is the difference between a fee and a tax ? '
the reporter demanded .
Schwarzenegger stepped aside . '
I have an expert here who can answer that , ' he said as a grey - suited businessman stepped up .
The man launched into a reply laden with jargon .
It was incomprehensible .
When he finished , Schwarzenegger said : ' That is my position .
I could not have been more articulate . '
It was a bizarre moment of political theatre and completely successful .
The press corp laughed at the stunt and moved on to more friendly issues .
Then Schwarzenegger brought the proceedings to a close .
With another broad grin he declared : ' Well , now I am going to go off . '
With that , he disappeared to pose for pictures .
He was like a latter - day Wizard of Oz : a master of illusion and the undisputed King of La La Land .
In his own words ' I see California as the golden dream by the sea .
Perhaps some think this is fanciful or poetic but to an immigrant like me who , as a boy , saw Soviet tanks rolling through the streets of Austria , it is not fanciful . ' '
Well , there was no sex for 14 days . '
On getting the cold shoulder from his wife after backing President Bush at the Republican Convention ' To those critics who are so pessimistic about our economy , I say , do n't be economic girlie men ! '

"California aims to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by a quarter over the next 14 years in a landmark deal struck by the Republican governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , and the state 's Democrats .
In a significant break from Bush administration policy , Mr Schwarzenegger has agreed to sign the Global Warming Solutions Act into law after it is approved by the Democratic - controlled state assembly .
California is in effect declaring environmental independence from Washington , where the White House and Congress have opposed mandatory limits on emissions of greenhouse gases ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger , the Republican governor of California , today made a clear break with the White House when he announced an agreement for a state - wide cap on greenhouse gas emissions .
Mr Schwarzenegger said he hoped the legislation - approved by the Californian Senate last night - would become "" an example for other states and nations to follow "" in the fight against climate change .
Californian senators voted 23 - 14 in favour of the plan after weeks of tough negotiations .
It is now expected to be backed by California 's Democrat - controlled Assembly .
The move is in sharp contrast to George Bush 's inaction on climate change , notably his refusal to sign up to binding targets in the Kyoto protocol .
In the past , Mr Schwarzenegger has accused the US president of failing to demonstrate leadership on climate change .
Last month , Tony Blair broke with his usual loyalty to the Bush administration by signing a statement of intent with California that could open the way for a new transatlantic carbon trading agreement aimed at cutting emissions .
Today , Fabian Nunez , the Democrat speaker in the Californian Assembly , explained his backing for Mr Schwarzenegger 's plan .
"" My main objective was getting a bill that the environmental community can champion around the country and say : ' California did this , and you should be , too ' , "" he said .
"" And we did that . ""
The bill requires the state 's major industries , such as utility plants , oil and gas refineries and cement kilns , to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by an estimated 25 % by 2020 .
A market programme allowing businesses to buy , sell and trade emission credits with other companies is among the key proposals designed to drive the reductions . ""
Today , it feels as if the whole world is watching - and I hope they are , "" Ann Notthoff , of the Natural Resources Defence Council , one of the environmental groups involved in the negotiations , said .
The agreement was announced simultaneously by Mr Schwarzenegger 's office and Democratic leaders in both the Senate and the Assembly .
It gives him a key environmental victory as he seeks re - election this autumn .
The bill states that the California Air Resources Board , an 11-member panel appointed by the governor , must identify "" market - based compliance mechanisms "" that could be used as part of its plan to achieve the emissions cap .
The state 's move has been praised by environmentalists as a step toward fighting global climate change .
However , it has been criticised by some business leaders , who say it will increase costs and force them to scale back operations in California .
Republicans have also condemned the bill , saying it would have little effect but would make California an expensive place to do business . ""
This bill is the road to economic ruin , "" Senator Dennis Hollingsworth said .
California - the most populous state in the US - is the world 's 12th largest emitter of greenhouse gases , and could suffer dire consequences if global temperatures increase by only a few degrees .
In the absence of federal action , much of the effort to combat climate change has been taking place in individual states .
More than 100 climate - related bills have been held up in Congress , including one demanding a national cap on emissions .
California has led the country in reducing greenhouse gas emissions through renewable energy policies and the passing of a law reducing exhaust emissions from vehicles in 2004 .
Ten other states are poised to enact the car law , while more than 20 now require utilities to eventually generate some power from renewable sources .
The California bill includes a so - called "" safety valve "" sought by Mr Schwarzenegger that would allow him to delay the emission cap target if the state was hit by a natural disaster or terrorist attack ."
"California greening "" Arnold ,
how could you ?
Sure , you were squishy on social issues , but how could you allow a global warming programme that will leave your people drowning in red ink ? ""
That was , by and large , the affronted reaction of US climate - change sceptics , neoconservatives and Republicans to Californian governor Arnold Schwarzenegger 's move last week to more than match the UK 's Kyoto climate - change targets .
"" This is feelgood legislation to appease liberal special - interest groups , "" wailed Republican environment chiefs .
The Competitive Enterprise Institute warned that it would cost "" billions "" .
The really big question is the fate of Arnie 's fleet of militaristic Hummers .
He has at least eight , and they do about three miles to the gallon .
The Terminator says he will now retrofit them to be green , but Eco Soundings needs convincing .
Showing their age Is it goodbye for ever to the creaking 38-year - old Oldbury nuclear power station near Bristol ?
These days , its twin reactors only work about half the time , but No 2 has been shut since June and can not reopen after its graphite core was found to have corroded more than a third of its weight .
No 1 , which closes this month for routine safety work , is in a similar state .
This should n't be .
Freedom of Information documents show the nuclear industry has sunk at least £ 2bn into graphite core research in the past two years in a so - far futile attempt to extend the lives of all Britain 's ageing reactors .
Jim Duffy , spokesman for the Shut Oldbury campaign , says the plant should be abandoned .
"" Give up now for safety 's sake and announce its permanent closure , "" he says .
But with each reactor earning it £ 1 m a week when working , British Nuclear Group is hanging on .

"Photographs of a topless Andy Murray practising for this weekend 's Davis Cup tie in Odessa may have been a Brad Gilbert idea to show off some of the lean muscle the American coach is helping Murray to develop .
Whether this will be enough to shoulder the extra burden of national expectation being lowered on to his shoulders - the doubles defeat he and a sub - standard Jamie Delgado suffered yesterday emphasised how great it is - is looking doubtful .
Arnold Schwarzenegger might wince at the Davis Cup task that faces Murray , even if Greg Rusedski delays retirement and Tim Henman can be persuaded back into the team .
The two thirtysomethings are beyond the age of being the answer for a strong British Davis Cup side .
The worryingly delicate state of the present team was clear for all to see as Murray and Delgado were overrun 6 - 3 6 - 3 6 - 3 by the honest but limited Ukraine pair Sergiy Stakhovsky and Orest Tereshchuk to cut Britain 's lead to 2 - 1 .
Murray should win the first of today 's singles against Stakhovsky , whom he beat in the 2004 US Open junior final , to give Britain an uncatchable 3 - 1 lead and keep them in Europe / Africa Zone One , the competition 's second division .
Really , though , the British tennis machine that has been expensively overhauled by the Lawn Tennis Association 's new chief executive , Roger Draper , should not be struggling to grind out a victory against a team of Ukraine 's modest ability .
Having to play away , on a slow clay court that has had the desired effect of narrowing the gap in quality , only partially excuses the poor showing .
As ever , Britain 's problem is bringing through a group of good players rather than one or two at a time .
Once Henman and Rusedski have gone , Murray will be our only player of consequence , with , most depressingly of all , no one else showing any sign of moving forward to join him .
Murray will need all the conditioning Gilbert can give him if he is to withstand the demands of being asked to play three best - of - five - set matches every time he turns up for a Davis Cup tie .
Murray is not the first of Gilbert 's charges to be told to shed an item of clothing to frighten the opposition .
Andy Roddick was made to cast aside his sun visor because it was the sort of wimpy thing a weekend golfer wears ( sorry Monty ) .
Back in his familiar baseball cap , Roddick regained his momentum .
Murray is some way short of looking like another Arnie and pumping him up too much may endanger the loose - limbed power generation that is a feature of his game .
Murray , who swept through his opening singles in straight sets on Friday , often found himself left out of things yesterday as Ukraine ruthlessly targeted Delgado , a fairly obvious tactic considering the only England - born player in the British squad had not won a Davis Cup match in six previous tries .
John Lloyd , captaining Britain for the first time , picked Delgado for the doubles having originally selected Rusedski , who ruled himself out after the exertions of his five - set win over Stakhovsky on Friday .
It proved an ill - starred selection as Delgado dropped serve four out of six times .
Even Murray served poorly in the second set , his two double faults in the ninth game handing the set to the opposition .
Britain led for the only time in a set in the third , but from 2 - 1 up won only one more game .
Murray was not prepared to blame Delgado . '
I obviously did n't play at my best today .
I did n't serve too well and maybe missed too many reflex volleys , ' he said . '
But give credit to them - they looked like they had played together a lot whereas we had only had one previous Davis Cup match together . '
The loss messed up Murray 's travel schedule .
He had planned to fly out of Ukraine last night and go straight to Thailand for the Bangkok Open .
Bob and Mike Bryan beat Mikhail Youzhny and Dmitry Tursunov 6 - 3
6- 4 6 - 2 in the doubles to keep the United States ' hopes alive in their Davis Cup semi - final against Russia in Moscow .
The twins broke Youzhny 's serve once in each of the first two sets to take a two - set lead before breaking Tursunov in the opening game of the third set to seal a comfortable victory in less than 90 minutes .
The win pulled the Americans back to 2 - 1 down after Marat Safin and Youzhny had given the home team , who are seeking their first victory over the US in the Davis Cup , a 2 - 0 lead by winning both singles matches on Friday .
Safin overpowered Andy Roddick 6 - 4 6 - 3 7 - 6 while Youzhny prevailed over James Blake 7 - 5 1 - 6 6 - 1 7 - 5 .
The winners will face either Argentina or Australia in the final ."
"Depending on one 's point of view , the bodybuilder - cum - screen actor Mickey Hargitay , who has died aged 80 , can either be thanked or blamed for the career of Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Born Miklos Hargitay in Budapest , he emigrated to the US in 1946 , won the Mr Universe contest in 1955 , married blonde sex symbol Jayne Mansfield and became an actor of sorts .
For the young Schwarzenegger , Hargitay was an "" inspirational force "" .
That someone from central Europe could become Mr Universe gave Schwarzenegger hope for someone like myself and others to dream about that "" .
It was appropriate that Schwarzenegger played Hargitay in the television movie The Jayne Mansfield Story ( 1980 ) , with Loni Anderson as Mansfield .
As a boy , Hargitay was a skilled footballer , and he and his brother performed an acrobatic act throughout Hungary .
Still in his teens , during the second world war he joined the anti - Nazi resistance .
As the communists were taking over after the war , and to avoid being drafted into the military , Hargitay moved to the US .
First he went to Indianapolis , where he worked as a builder and performed a nightclub dance act with his first wife , Mary .
One day in 1947 he walked into a gym out of curiosity and lifted a 215 lb bar over his head , a feat which astonished the gym owner because Hargitay weighed only 180 lb .
So began a bodybuilding career which included winning Mr Indianapolis and Mr Eastern America .
After becoming Mr Universe , Hargitay 's handsome face and well - chiselled body decorated many a fitness magazine .
He did much to popularise a sport which had been considered a rather freakish activity .
In 1955 , a 64-year - old Mae West saw Hargitay on the cover of Strength and Health magazine .
She asked him to join her chorus of musclemen , clad in leopardskin G - strings , in her Las Vegas nightclub act , the Mae West Revue .
According to West , when she first met him , Hargitay had said : "" Miss West , you are the end of my search for an ideal , my dream come true . ""
One evening , the buxom 23-year - old Jayne Mansfield , who had just become a star in Frank Tashlin 's The Girl
Ca n't Help It ( 1956 ) , was in the audience .
Legend has it that when her dinner companion asked her what she would like , she answered : "" I 'll have a steak and the man on the left . ""
After each had divorced their respective spouses , Mansfield and Hargitay were married in 1958 amid much publicity .
They appeared together in a number of films , the best being Tashlin 's Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter ?
( 1957 ) , a satire of sex , money and fame .
Hargitay 's muscles did most of the acting as Bobo Branigansky , a Jungle Boy TV actor , jealous of his starlet girlfriend ( Mansfield ) , who is called upon to endorse Stay - Put Lipstick , whose motto was "" For those oh - so - kissable lips "" .
Among the low points was the badly dubbed , Italian - made The Loves of Hercules ( 1960 ) , in which Hargitay , in the title role , falls for two Jaynes , one good ( in a black wig ) and one evil ( red wig ) , and decapitates a three - headed dragon .
Promises !
Promises !
( 1963 ) , a wife - swapping comedy , gained notoriety because Mansfield bared almost all .
Offscreen , the couple were continually photographed in their Beverly Hills mansion , usually alongside the pink , heart - shaped swimming pool .
After their divorce in 1964 , Hargitay continued to appear in schlocky Italian movies for six years .
He then became a successful contractor and real estate investor .
Hargitay is survived by Ellen Siano - his wife of 38 years - two sons and two daughters , one of whom is Mariska Hargitay , the star of the Law and Order : Special Victims Unit series .
She , with her two brothers , Zoltan and Mickey Jr , were in the back seat of the car that crashed killing their mother , Jayne Mansfield , aged 34 , in 1967 . ·

"The moment came towards the end of the uncompromisingly boring debate between Arnold Schwarzenegger , the governor , and the Democrat challenger , Phil Angelides .
Mr Schwarzenegger , in the only televised debate of this election , had just listened to a lengthy answer from the challenger about some obscure point of policy .
“
I feel a bit like I ’m having dinner with Uncle Teddy at Thanksgiving ,

The audience hooted .
This was Arnold , their Arnold , being cheeky and charming , poking fun at himself , at America , at the political process .

The line about good old “ Uncle Teddy ” reminded the state ’s 16 million voters , in case they had forgotten , of all they needed to know about their governor : the nation ’s most favoured immigrant sups at the table of the Kennedys , the nearest the US has to a royal family .
And here was Mr Schwarzenegger poking fun at Uncle Teddy - Senator Edward Kennedy .
Arnold , he was telling us , can cut through all the old politics stuff , he is his own man , a politician unlike others .
The voters seem to be impressed .
Most polls agree Mr Schwarzenegger has a lead of at least nine points .
Some put it much higher , prompting reports that Democrats are in despair .
How could it have come to this ?
A state where 43 % of registered voters describe themselves as Democrats while just 34 % are Republicans has turned into a Republican shoo - in .
Part of the answer lies in the governor ’s much - vaunted bipartisanship , his professed keenness to work across party lines and do what is best for the state .
“
I think the Democrat with the funny accent won the debate , ” said Rob Long , author of Conversations With My Agent and scripts for the TV show Cheers , and also a friend of the governor .
Mr Schwarzenegger , much to the consternation of Democrats , has been adept at stealing the best lines from the centre .
“
He ’s been three different governors , ” said John Burton , a Democrat who retired last year as speaker of the state Senate and who had a topsy - turvy relationship with Mr Schwarzenegger .
In his first year , said Mr Burton , the governor played the bipartisan moderate , seeking compromise not confrontation .
“
But last year , ” he said , “ he took a hard - right turn and the people rejected that kind of confrontational politics .
This year he ’s become more conciliatory and passed bills that he would n’t have passed before .
In an election year everybody tries to work things out .
”
Mr Schwarzenegger signing bills has become the symbol of what has been a lacklustre campaign .
The environment , education , prison reform , port security , California ’s troubled levee system - each day has produced a new photo op for the Republican governor to burnish his liberal credentials and in the process protect himself from the only stick the Democrats have to beat him with - George Bush .
Again , Mr Schwarzenegger used a TV appearance - this time on Jay Leno ’s late - night show - to defuse attempts to link him with the president .
“ Trying to link me with George Bush is like trying to link me with an Oscar , ” he said .
The Democrats , too , have helped him .
Their candidate , Mr Angelides , who is the state treasurer , came into the race with all the handicaps any politician would have running against the perfect storm that is Mr Schwarzenegger : low name recognition , the need to pay for media time rather than simply calling up a chat show .
But then he added more ; he emerged from a bruising and expensive primary campaign , his money spent and his vulnerabilities exposed to voters by another Democrat .
“
Angelides is just another party hack , ” says Gary Indiana , author of The Schwarzenegger Syndrome : Politics and Celebrity in the Age of Contempt .
“
And he has the charisma of a biology teacher .
In American politics , for good or bad , you have to have something going on .
”
Indiana , whose book was scathing about Mr Schwarzenegger and the recall campaign , has in part changed his mind about the governor .
“
He ’s made a much better governor than anyone thought he could .
The positive thing about Arnold Schwarzenegger is that he ’s a movie star and people pay attention to movie stars .
He has at least tried to improve some things that he cares about .
I ’m not saying he ’s solved them but at least he ’s working on them .
He ’s proven to be a better person than I thought he was .
”
Which leaves Democrats hoping for one of two things : an unprecedented cock - up by Mr Schwarzenegger , or - less likely - an appearance by President Bush to repay the governor for stumping for him in Ohio in 2004 .
“ Arnold had been very careful , very measured , ” says Mr Burton , “
but he does know how to step on his own dick .
If they catch him with a two - year - old puppy or something ...
”
Last week at a school in Bakersfield , in the heat of California ’s central valley , midway between Los Angeles and the state capital , Sacramento , the governor had the look of a stately ocean liner not even the fiercest hurricane could blow off course .
His skin is a little less orange than a year ago , his hair a little more natural in colour , and he has the fixed grin , perched somewhere between shock and awe , of the institutionally bored .
His large head , long body and short legs give the impression of something knocked up in a lab .
The flashy rings , absent for the electoral debate , had returned and , as ever , he was wearing cowboy boots .
He gave his standard stump speech to the 150 children present , a spiel that has not varied since he announced he was running for governor three years ago .
Mr Schwarzenegger always talks of growing up in Austria , of living the American dream , of success , empowerment , inner strength and self discipline .
The lessons could be equally applied to a bodybuilder , movie star or politician .
And he always rounds off his speeches with a reference to his film persona .
“
Keep up the great work
and ... I ’ll be back , ”
he tells the children , who dutifully break into whoops as they swarm around him to get an autograph .
Is it enough ?
Is a Thursday afternoon appearance at a middle school in Sacramento what he had in mind when he stood for public office ?
“
I think this is the end game ,
” says Indiana .
“
He may actually have wanted to be governor just to prove he could be governor .
I ’m not sure that his political ambitions run any further than that .
All he ’s done all his life is win , but politics in this country is so sorted and tangled .
”
But Long senses Mr Schwarzenegger ’s political career may not end with the governorship .
“
He ’s an ambitious guy .
He could be president , probably .
Maybe he wants to be senator .
Traditionally a successful governor of California runs for president .
For the Democrats to win the presidency they must win California .
So a popular Republican governor of California is a very important person .
November is very important . ”"
"The moment came towards the end of the uncompromisingly boring debate between Arnold Schwarzenegger , the governor , and the Democrat challenger , Phil Angelides .
Mr Schwarzenegger , in the only televised debate of this election , had just listened to a lengthy answer from the challenger about some obscure point of policy .
"" I feel a bit like I 'm having dinner with Uncle Teddy at Thanksgiving , "" said the former movie star .
The audience hooted .
This was Arnold , their Arnold , being cheeky and charming , poking fun at himself , at America , at the political process .

"Alec Baldwin is demanding that his narration be removed from a documentary on the political rise of California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger .
The actor ordered his lawyers to issue a cease - and - desist demand against the makers of the film , Running With Arnold , after realising that his voiceover would be accompanied by images of Nazi party rallies , together with footage of the official Nazi paperwork of Schwarzenegger 's late father .
Writing on the Huffington Post website , Baldwin argued that "" the film - makers hammer Schwarzenegger over his private behaviour and his record as governor .
But Schwarzenegger deserves to be treated fairly and the film 's images of Nazi rallies were over the line . ""
However , producer Mike Gabrawy claims that Baldwin had plenty of time to view the footage beforehand and denies that his film is an attack on the governor .
"" What 's really shocking about this situation is that this is not really a critical look at Arnold , "" he insists .
"" There 's a lot more we could have shown . """
"Alec Baldwin .
Photograph :
Diane Bondareff / APThe Hollywood actor and political activist Alec Baldwin has asked to be removed as the narrator of a documentary about the governor of California , Arnold Schwarzenegger , writes Paul Willis .
The documentary , called Running With Arnold , was written and directed by former Vanity Fair writer Nick Cox , and promises to expose Schwarzenegger 's life "" in all its sordid glory "" .
As a vocal critic of Arnie 's political career , Baldwin seemed an obvious choice to voice the documentary .
But the actor got cold feet after watching the finished product .
Baldwin objected to the filmmakers ' use of images from Nazi rallies , which were included to make points about Schwarzenegger 's father and the actor 's friendship with the former president of Austria Kurt Waldheim .
The star 's father was a member of the Nazi party in his native Austria , and Waldheim , who was invited to Schwarzenegger 's wedding , was barred from entering the US after an investigation into his activities in a German unit associated with Nazi atrocities .
Waldheim has always denied the connection .
On the Huffington Post , Baldwin explained his sudden U - turn , saying he was "" somewhat dismayed by some of the images "" in the film . ""
The filmmakers hammer Schwarzenegger over his private behaviour and his record as governor , "" he said in his posting . ""
But Schwarzenegger deserves to be treated fairly , and the film 's images of Nazi rallies were over the line . ""
Baldwin said he had returned his fee for the film and had asked his lawyers to issue a cease - and - desist demand against the filmmakers .
The film 's producers said they were surprised by the actor 's reaction .
The producer , Mike Gabrawy , who has yet to find a distributor for the documentary , said : "" I knew we 'd get resistance to a film about the most prominent Republican in California .
"" We 're all just a bit shocked that it 's coming from a supporter of the film and arguably the most outspoken Democrat . ""
However , he insisted that the film - complete with Baldwin 's narration - would remain uncut .
Schwarzenegger is no stranger to controversy .
His election campaign in California in 2003 was dogged by scandals concerning his private life , with scores of women claiming to have been sexually harassed by the Terminator star .
But it is his links to Waldheim , who is seen in the film photographed in his second world war Wehrmacht uniform , that have caused the biggest storms of his political career .
Shortly after revelations about Waldheim 's links to the Nazis emerged , Schwarzenegger reportedly gave a glowing tribute to his countryman during a speech at his wedding .
In his post , Baldwin made it clear that he was still no fan of the actor - turned - governor .
"" I think he was unqualified for his current job when he ran in the bogus recall election .
I believe he is unqualified for that job today , "" he said .
But he added : "" The people of California have the right to re - elect an unqualified man to lead their state , and they have the right to do so without unfair and ultimately offensive images of the Third Reich thrown in for bad measure . """
"The governor of California , Arnold Schwarzenegger , completed what analysts described as a remarkable political turnaround when he secured a sweeping re - election victory over his Democrat opponent .
Mr Schwarzenegger had won 57 % of the vote with 70 % of the precincts reporting , while his Democratic challenger , Phil Angelides , secured 38 % .
"" I love doing sequels , "" Mr Schwarzenegger told supporters at a rally in Beverly Hills . ""
This without any doubt is my favourite sequel . ""
Mr Angelides called Mr Schwarzenegger to concede shortly before 10 pm local time ( 6 am GMT ) , two hours after the polls had closed .
The victory comes just a year after Californian voters humiliated Mr Schwarzenegger by rejecting a series of ballot initiatives he supported .
But , in the intervening year , he has gone back to basics , returning to the promise of bipartisanship that saw him elected in the 2003 recall election .
At the plush Beverly Hilton hotel in Beverly Hills the Schwarzengger campaign team partied in style .
Hundreds of green , orange and white balloons cascaded from the ceiling of the hotel 's International Ballroom after the governor had delivered his acceptance speech .
"" I received a gracious and kind phone call from our opponent , "" Mr Schwarzenegger told supporters . ""
He is not our opponent any more .
I look forward to working with him .
Here in California we have proven to the nation that there is a better way to go forward ...
We have shown the nation that leadership is about solving problems , about getting results . ""
By contrast , the defeated Angelides campaign held its victory party at the 10,000 sq ft Grand Nave Room at the Sheraton Grand Hotel in the state capital , Sacramento .
Music by the Grateful Dead was played in the party 's early moments .
Speaking after he voted near his home in Sacramento , the Democrat challenger said : "" I have no regrets in this race .
I have nothing but fullness in my heart .
I know we stood up for what is right .
We stood up without retreat , without backing down , without looking at the polls .
We stood up for the people who needed a voice . ""
Mr Schwarzenegger also appeared to have gained approval for an ambitious public works programme .
Four proposals backed by Mr Schwarzenegger and approved by voters earmarked $ 37bn ( £ 19.5bn ) in new borrowing to be spent on the state 's infrastructure .
The proposals covered spending on housing , transport , education and flood protection and , by backing them , Mr Schwarzenegger was able to defuse the challenge from the Democrats .
Throughout the campaign , at least in public , Mr Schwarzenegger did not so much campaign as carry out his duties as governor .
A typical day would see challenger Angelides looking for hands to shake while Mr Schwarzenegger would appear at a photocall , often flanked by leading Democrats , to sign a piece of bipartisan legislation .
Angelides made little headway in establishing either his personality or his policies with voters .
While some have questioned the calibre of his opponent , many observers argue that the reborn Mr Schwarzenegger was close to unbeatable .
His name recognition and charisma enabled him to do away with the usual niceties of campaigning .
His courting of leading Democrats also enabled him to undermine his opponent .
Indeed , many speculated that it served the ambitions of some Democrats , notably the mayor of Los Angeles , Antonio Villaraigosa , for Schwarzenegger to win .
Under the state constitution , Mr Schwarzenegger is ineligible for a third term .
His victory ensures that in four years ' time the field will be open for the next generation of Democrat leaders to challenge for the governorship of the most populous state in the union .
And given that Californians have shown that they have little problem getting their tongues round the phrase "" Governor Schwarzenegger "" , "" Governor Villaraigosa "" presents a small challenge ."
"MIDTERMS LATEST :
Democrats have taken control of the House of Representatives .
Control of the Senate now depends on two states , Virginia and Montana , where the result is too close to call .
Arnold Schwarzenegger held California ( "" I love doing sequels "" , he said ) and Democrat Nancy Pelosi becomes the first woman speaker of the House of Representatives .
Coverage now and throughout the day at theguardian.com/midterms2006 SENATE HANGS IN BALANCE
The timing of elections in America could n't be more awkward for the British press .
The results are unclear when the papers go to bed , but readers usually know the outcome as soon as they get out of bed turn on their radios or TVs .
Most of yesterday 's results came in too late for print deadlines and the outcome was too close to call for the paper 's night editors .
The Independent sticks its neck out furthest with a headline across pages two and three reading : "" Bush presidency enters its twilight as Democrats surge . ""
It said the first returns indicated that the "" Bush White House was braced for a Republican loss of at least the House of Representatives . ""
For the Guardian , it was "" too early "" to tell whether the Democrats had done well enough to take the House of Representative .
So it concentrates instead on the way the elections were conducted , with "" widespread claims of dirty tricks "" and "" glitches "" on new electronic voting machines .
The Times takes a similar stance .
It says there was a "" blizzard of dirty tricks claims against both sides . ""
But it also reported that these were the most expensive US midterm elections ever , with both sides spending at least £ 1.5bn , up 20 % on 2002 .
The FT turns its attention to the 2008 race for the US presidency .
It tips Senator Barack Obama , the young black Democrat from Illinois .
Few Democrats can disguise their excitement at his "" meteoric rise "" , the FT says .
Larry Sabato , head of the political centre at the University of Virginia , tells the paper "" Barack Obama is like a rock star - he is so fresh .
Most of the rest of the field look like Rolling Stones . ""

POLICE TO QUESTION BROWN
The Telegraph leads with news that Gordon Brown and other cabinet ministers are to be questioned by the police in the investigation into the cash - for - peerages allegations .
It hastens to add that they will be questioned as witnesses , not suspects , over whether "" they knew that four Labour businessmen who secretly loaned the party millions of pounds had been put forward for peerages by Tony Blair . ""
But the paper also predicts that Mr Blair himself could be questioned under caution , and reports that he is in a "" state of panic "" over the inquiry .
Meanwhile , the Guardian reports that the attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , has sought to end the escalating row over his role in deciding whether charges should be brought against the man who appointed him .
He has come up with a "" compromise "" , the paper says , by refusing to stand aside from the affair but he has appointed an independent QC to advise him on whether the Crown Prosecution Service should bring charges against the PM .

VEILED
INTENT
The debate over the veil wo n't go away .
The Daily Express splashes with a row that broke out in a court when a lawyer twice refused a judge 's request to take off her niqab .
Shabham Mughal 's refusal to show her face during an immigration hearing caused the case to be halted .
The vexed issue of the veil has now been referred to a High Court judge , the Express says .
The paper also invites readers to vote in a text poll on whether Britain should ban veils .
In case there is any doubt about the Express 's stance on the issue , it wheels out Tory MP Philip Davies who says that Ms Mughal 's defiance is "" outrageous "" , and that she should be charged with contempt of court .
BRITNEY SPEARS TO DIVORCE
The red - tops focus on a late breaking story from America of a very different kind .
Court papers say Britney Spears ' marriage to Kevin Federline has broken down because of "" irreconcilable differences "" and the singer is demanding custody of their 14-month and eight - week old sons .
The Mirror says the marriage was marred by endless rows .
Under the headline "" Brit Split Writ "" , the Sun says that a row at Halloween was the final straw for the "" pop babe . ""
* Sun : Brit split writ BAROT SENTENCED TO 40 YEARS
The Sun is delighted with the minimum 40 year - jail sentence for the "" al - Qaida plotter "" Dhiren Barot .
It sends out the right message to "" other fanatics "" thinking about following his example , the paper reckons .
"" They have been warned they will rot behind bars if they try , "" it says .
The Times also welcomes what it notes is "" one of the longest terms handed down for non - capital offences . ""
It says Barot had "" masterminded plans for mass murder on a horrendous scale . ""
But it claims that nothing would have been known about what Barot had been planning without the efforts of the Times , the BBC and the Associated Press to lift gagging orders on the trial .
The Telegraph 's leader says Barot 's career as a terrorist challenges a number of the left 's assumptions about Islamic extremism .
"" He was neither Muslim - born nor from a disadvantaged background , "" it says .
"" He could not , in other words , claim either a lifetime 's experience of anti - Islamic prejudice in Britain , or poverty .
Born of a comfortable Indian Hindu family , he converted to Islam as a young adult and went on , without any apparent ground for personal grievance , to chose the fundamentalist path of violent extremism . ""
It also points out that evidence in the trial revealed that Barot was plotting attacks before the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq . ""
Those who ascribe indigenous Islamic terrorism to Britain 's participation in the Iraq war should reflect on this , "" the Telegraph urges .

HEATED DEBATE
The Guardian has a story that is sure to please Prince Charles and other lovers of traditional architecture .
According to a survey by British Gas , timber frame and wattle and daub homes built 500 years ago are more energy efficient than those built in the 1970s .
The paper does n't say how homes built in the 1980s and 1990s fared in the test , except that the results were "" mixed "" .
But it adds that Victorian homes also performed well in the survey .
The results are "" an indictment of recent government regulations "" , the Guardian says .

"It 's always nice to see one 's pet theories confirmed by rigorous analysis , and a subject close to this writer 's heart is encapsulated in the title of A Perfect Mess : The Hidden Benefits of Disorder , by Eric Abramson and David H Freedman ( Weidenfeld , January ) .
Looking at more than just my desk , the authors conclude that there is an ideal level of messiness that makes any system more robust and productive .
The virtues of disorder are illustrated with examples from "" business , parenting , cooking , the war on terrorism , retail and even the meteoric career of Arnold Schwarzenegger "" , and the authors promise that their insights can be applied on a society - wide scale as well as to your kitchen .
I would say more on the subject , but I seem to have lost my notes somewhere in the piles of detritus towering around me .
Apparently averse to mess , on the other hand , is Phil Spector , legendary record producer and - it says here , rather unkindly - "" demented control freak "" .
Are there well - balanced control freaks ?
Should n't a record producer actually want to be in control ?
Spector gave his first interview in 25 years to journalist Mick Brown in late 2002 .
Two months later , the producer was arrested after an actress was shot dead in his Los Angeles castle .
Thus prompted , Brown has written Tearing Down the Wall of Sound ( Bloomsbury , April ) , recording his own "" personal odyssey "" into the bizarre story of the man with the golden ears who gave the world such acoustic palaces as "" Unchained Melody "" and "" River Deep , Mountain High "" .
Spector 's long - delayed murder trial finally begins in January .
Chess genius Garry Kasparov , whom no one would dare to call a "" demented control freak "" to his face , retired from competitive play in 2005 , but has hardly been idle since , founding the Russian political party United Civil Front and continuing to write his history of chess , titled with no false modesty My Great Predecessors .
Now , somewhat like a hirsute , modern Sun Tzu , he offers his general philosophy of strategy , How Life Imitates Chess
( Heinemann , March ) .
As he promised in a Wall Street Journal article last year , the book "" examines the unique formulae people use in thinking and problem - solving .
For example , the way hope and doubt affect how we process information , or the way we perform in a crisis .
I hope it will also serve as a guide to improving these processes . ""
Can the ability to calculate a 20-move forced tactical sequence in chess help you navigate the shark - infested waters of office politics ?
We shall see .
Competing in the sage stakes is Terry Eagleton , the fun - loving literary critic who has lately taken to offering public lessons in theology to Richard Dawkins , probably not much to the latter 's enrichment .
It will be interesting to see if this spat has any bearing on the content of Eagleton 's new book , breezily entitled The Meaning of Life ( Oxford , February ) .
( No doubt it 's only to me that this looks like a misprint for The Meaning of Liff . )
Schopenhauer , Beckett and Shakespeare are wheeled on and off , and people are castigated for filling the void of meaning with Scientology or football .
We are promised laughs along the way . ""
The meaning of life is a subject fit either for the crazed or the comic , and I hope I have fallen more into the latter camp than the former , "" Eagleton writes .
I hope so too ; I really do .
It may not be clear where Paul Virilio fits in Eagleton 's curious schema of crazed or comic ( to which there is no doubt more than mere alliteration ) , but the zestfully polemical French philosopher of speed no doubt hopes to ruffle a few complacent feathers with his Art
As Far As the Eye Can See ( Berg , July ) .
Virilio loves to provoke with vast diagnoses .
"" The defining characteristic of mass culture today is cold panic , "" according to his new book 's blurb . ""
The same panic which has used terrorism to derail democracy has hijacked the whole art enterprise .
This panic is reliant on audio - visual technology to create a new all - seeing , panoptic politics .
And the first casualty of this politics is the art of seeing ...
In the 21st century , the new battleground is art as light versus art as matter . ""
Is it true ?
What does it mean ?
It will be fun to find out .
More apparently traditional literary talk might be expected from Kevin Jackson 's The Book of Hours ( Duckworth , March ) , which includes such curious facts as that dinner used to be taken at 10 am and has gradually slipped ever later , and explanations of Linnaeus 's floral clock ( which told the time using smell ) , or the system of bells on Royal Navy ships .
In the hands of a lesser writer you might fear a merely twee temporal miscellany , but Jackson , author of the wonderful Invisible Forms ( on the paratextual paraphernalia of books : indexes , acknowledgments , footnotes and so on ) , can be relied upon to make of it something fascinating .
Meanwhile , a hush of anticipation should by rights attend the new book by Milan Kundera , whose The Curtain ( Faber , March ) is an essay on the novel .
We each , he argues , have a preconceived notion of reality - "" a magic curtain , woven of legends , hung before the world "" - and the job of the novelist is to tear through it and reveal what lies on the other side .
( A small wizard ? )
The maestro also promises to make more of translinguistic influence than is usually allowed in talk of "" the English novel "" or "" the French novel "" .
We are lucky to have a great novelist who is also a great critic . ·
Steven Poole 's Unspeak is published by Little , Brown"
"Last week , an American governor unveiled a truly audacious proposal : health insurance for almost every resident of his populous state , children of illegal immigrants included .
This might normally be considered career suicide for many American politicians , the sort of thing that dooms hapless Democrats to accusations of European socialism and worse on Fox News .
The plan 's architect , however , is no mild - mannered liberal , but an avowedly tough - guy Republican - California 's Arnold Schwarzenegger .
What 's more , he 's following the lead of another of his party 's square - jawed stars , Mitt Romney , a probable presidential candidate who signed a comprehensive healthcare plan last year as governor of Massachusetts .
This emerging Republican support for universal healthcare , long a liberal holy grail , is the latest plot twist in one of the longest running sagas in American politics .
The country 's healthcare system is so unmistakably broken that it 's astonishing anyone allowed it to exist for so long .
The US spends more than twice as much per capita as any industrialized country on medical care , but has higher infant mortality , lower life expectancy , and 47 million Americans with no coverage at all .
Unpaid medical bills are by far the largest single cause of personal bankruptcy .
And then there are the unquantifiable problems , like the daily anxiety of knowing that if you had to go to hospital you could n't pay the bill , or the difficulty of impressing an employer in a job interview when you ca n't afford to fix your teeth .
Yet despite the current system 's resounding unpopularity , no one has been able to figure out how to fix it .
Since the Depression , political leaders have made six major efforts to provide some kind of comprehensive coverage , and have failed on every occasion .
The most recent attempt , led by Hillary Clinton in the mid-1990s , tanked so spectacularly that it scared most Democrats away from the issue for the better part of a decade .
Admittedly , the plans championed by Romney and Schwarzenegger are hardly the government - run , single - payer programs many Democrats desire .
Massachusetts 's law blends liberal and conservative solutions
- Romney dubbed it a "" personal responsibility system .
"" Everyone in the state must buy health insurance , the same way that all drivers must buy car insurance .
The state government subsidizes the cost for the poor , and companies over a certain size must also chip in .
The plan , which goes into effect this July , is expected to cover more than 95 % of the state 's uninsured residents over the next three years .
Schwarzenegger 's proposed bill , which operates along broadly similar lines , faces a far tougher challenge .
Massachusetts has a smaller uninsured population than most states , while California has the largest , and Schwarzenegger 's scheme is not without its flaws .
It 's less generous than the Massachusetts model , which could prompt poorer Californians to opt for barebones plans that will still leave them with medical bills they ca n't pay .
And already , voices on both the right and the left are complaining that the system will cost far more than the $ 12bn .
that Schwarzenegger claims .
But for now , the particulars of Schwarzenegger and Romney 's plans are n't so important .
Neither man is a typical red - state Republican , but Schwarzenegger is still one of the party 's biggest celebrities , and Romney hopes to make the Massachusetts plan a centerpiece of his 2008 presidential campaign .
By embracing the idea of health insurance for everyone , they 've made it possible for lawmakers of all political stripes to tackle the country 's ailing medical system .
For perhaps the first time , Americans can debate different ways of achieving some form of universal healthcare .
That 's a vast improvement over choosing between a government - run program and nothing at all ."

"Last year , California 's governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced that he would try to deal with the state 's prison overcrowding crisis by asking thousands of prisoners to voluntarily relocate to prisons out of state .
Only a dribble of volunteers responded .
Faced with likely court rulings to deal with the overcrowding , Schwarzenegger last week went further .
He ordered the forced relocation of several thousand prisoners .
Absent judicial intervention , those transfers - to prisons in Arizona and elsewhere - are likely to start in the near future .
Overcrowding and the double - or even triple - bunking - of inmates that it necessitates is a real problem .
Put too many prisoners into too small a space , and the results are predictable : miserable health conditions , prison riots , inmate - on - inmate murders , increasingly brutal interactions between guards and their prisoners .
But it 's not as if California has stood still when it comes to building new prisons in recent years .
Since 1980 , the state has opened over 20 new penal facilities , many of them extremely high security institutions like Corcoran and Pelican Bay .
Yet , no matter how fast it builds prisons , because its population and legislators are wedded to ham - handed lock-'em - up policies , crafted in a spasm of social hysteria over a few years in the 1980s and early 1990s , it continually runs low on cell space .
Five years ago , my book Hard Time Blues was published .
It was my attempt at understanding the politics that had led to so many people being imprisoned in America in recent decades .
Much of the book was set in California , following the life story of Billy Ochoa , a middle - aged heroin addict from Los Angeles who had spent most of his adult life cycling into prison on relatively minor and non - violent charges .
When I met him , Ochoa was serving thirteen consecutive 25-year sentences - a total of well over 300 years - in a super - maximum security prison .
It was costing California upwards of $ 50,000 a year to keep him behind bars .
Was Ochoa an axe - murderer , a serial rapist , a terrorist ?
No
: he was a perennial nuisance , a man who had been bedeviled by addiction for most of his life , and who , to fund his addiction , did a whole series of low - end crimes .
He 'd spent time in prison for burglary , for possession of drugs and of drug paraphernalia , and for welfare fraud .
What finally landed him his 300 year sentence was a series of false welfare claims - 13 different claims in different welfare offices around LA .
In total , he had cheated the welfare system out of a little over $ 2,000 .
Clearly Ochoa was a royal pain in the arse .
But he was hardly Charles Manson .
Nevertheless , he was charged , and sentenced , under California 's then - new "" three strikes "" law , an initiative passed , in 1993 , by plebiscite that mandated a 25-year - to - life sentence for a person with two "" serious "" prior felonies who was convicted of any third felony .
A few years later , Ochoa , then approaching sixty - years - old , died of liver disease .
He never did get out of prison .
California 's prison system has more than quintupled in size in the past three decades , far outstripping the state 's population growth .
There are now more than 170,000 prison inmates in the state , as well as many tens of thousands of local jail residents .
Hundreds of thousands more Californians are on parole or probation , a particular problem given that a higher percentage of parolees bounce back to prison in California than in any other state .
All told , the correctional system in the state now costs an extraordinary $ 9bn a year to run .
According to a study by Families to Amend California Three Strikes , by 2003 there were over 7,000 "" three - strikers "" in the California prison system , less than half of whom had been convicted , in their strike - out trial , of violent crimes .
Since then , as the state 's prison population has continued to grow , those numbers have likely climbed , though the organization has not crunched the data more recently .
Thousands more are serving enhanced sentences under the "" second strike "" provision of the law .
Many thousands more are serving long mandatory sentences for drug crimes that , before the contours of the "" war on drugs "" took shape , would not have resulted in such stiff penalties .
Clearly , guaranteeing public safety is one of government 's most vital roles .
Failure to provide such safety only undermines the legitimacy of those in power .
Yet there are ways of delivering on this that do n't involve the sorts of wholesale incarceration policies California , and most other states in the U.S. , have chosen to adopt in recent years .
Put more money into rehabilitation programs , invest more in community drug treatment and mental health services , put more police on foot patrol in high - crime areas , boost education spending and job creation programs in impoverished communities .
None of these programs will entirely negate the need for prisons - there will likely always be a hard core of individuals who pose such a safety risk to the public that they need to be incarcerated .
The challenge is to minimize the size of this pool of people .
California 's current approach - keep locking up vast numbers , build until the funds for building run dry , then fish around for short - term fixes to prison overcrowding such as the just - started inmate exportation program - ignores the fundamental problem .
Badly crafted public policies such as "" three strikes "" do n't suddenly get made better by putting a few thousand inmates on buses and shipping them to nearby states .
At the end of the day , unless California 's legislators grapple with the web of laws that mandate the imposition of often - absurd sentences , the state will continue to spend far too much on incarcerating far too many people , and it will continue to stumble from one prison crisis to the next ."
"It 's a case of "" I 'll be Blackpool "" for Arnold Schwarzenegger , the Terminator star turned Republican governor .
He has agreed to be the special overseas guest speaker there at the Conservative conference in the autumn .
David Cameron , the Tory leader , spoke yesterday of his excitement at Mr Schwarzenegger coming to town .
The Californian governor is not just a genuine A - lister but has developed a brand of moderate , environmentally conscious Republicanism which chimes with Tory modernisers .
"" I am delighted that Governor Schwarzenegger has accepted my invitation to address our party conference this year , "" Mr Cameron said .
"" Governor Schwarzenegger led a dramatic revival of his party 's fortunes in California and as governor he has shown tremendous leadership - above all in pioneering measures to protect the environment , reaching out to political opponents in doing so .
It 's great he 's coming to our party conference , and I very much look forward to welcoming him there . ""
Another moderate Republican , John McCain , the Arizona senator and US presidential candidate , who spoke at last year 's conference in Bournemouth , helped the Tories get in touch with the governor .
But Mr Schwarzenegger has also formed a mutual admiration society with Tony Blair .
He described the prime minister as "" the action hero "" of the battle against global warning when the two men held a joint interview with ITV News last month ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger , Republican governor of California and metal - endoskeleton - covered - with - living - tissue star of Terminators 1 to 3 , has agreed to speak at this year 's Tory party conference .
Ostensibly he is there because the Tories feel they have much to learn from the man who made rightwing politics acceptable in a hitherto impeccably liberal state , but their leader would be a fool to ignore the other valuable lessons he could glean from the "" Austrian Oak "" .
First , Arnie should give him instruction on the importance of a catchphrase .
Schwarzenegger cannily lodged himself in the global consciousness with the help of "" Hasta la vista , baby ! "" , "" I 'll be back "" and "" If it bleeds , we can kill it "" .
Cameron should assemble a team of speechwriters under Arnie 's aegis immediately .
Cameron should also grab the chance to learn how to smite his enemies .
If he can master a few tricks from the man who defeated the evil snake cult of Thulsa Doom with nothing but a loincloth and an over - elaborate sword , what need he fear from the underground followers of Thatcherdor and the High Priest tebb
- It ?
Then there is Schwarzenegger 's proven ability to transcend his lower - middle - class background , disavowing his Nazi father 's beliefs , building an $ 800 m fortune and marrying into American royalty - Maria Shriver of the Kennedy clan .
Cameron is equally keen to make himself over and he will have to work even harder to renounce his Bullingdon Club days , hide his family coffers and divorce Samantha ( a baronet 's daughter ) .
He can take heart from the fact that , like Arnold , he has established his green credentials with minimal effort .
Arnie , once lambasted for owning the first civilian Hummer in 1992 , became Republicanism 's answer to Jonathan Porritt by converting this gas - guzzler to run on hydrogen a few years later ."
"The Tories are bending over backwards to be seen as a modern , progressive , mainstream party , even the "" voice of liberal Britain "" .
When elected , David Cameron declared that his mission was "" to change the face of the Conservative party "" and that , it seems , is just what he has done .
With newly selected candidates such as the green campaigner Zac Goldsmith and
black youth charity organiser Shaun Bailey , and now the prospect of some Hollywood glamour at the Conservative conference - where the Republican governor and Terminator star Arnold Schwarzenegger is due to do a turn in October - the Tories have undergone extensive cosmetic surgery .
Beneath the surface , however , it is unchanged .
Cameron is keen to distance himself from the party 's old guard but , like them , he has little to say on poverty , marginalisation , racism and the many other unpleasant words that describe the lives of minorities in Britain and confine them to the bottom of the social ladder , and much to say on national identity and cohesion , integration and multiculturalism , the right wing 's bete noire .
True , he has had little to say on another Tory favourite , immigration , but it is worth remembering that he was the author of the party 's scandalous manifesto that firmly associated Michael Howard and his party with nastiness in the mind of the British electorate , with its talk of caps and quotas for refugees , and offshore asylum centres .
David Cameron insists that the Conservatives are no longer the party of the rich and "" mouthpiece of big business "" .
And yet he promises to slash inheritance tax , even though it affects only the richest 6 % in Britain , while pledging to cut taxes and corporate regulation .
For Cameron , "" prosperity , the creation of wealth and enterprise have to come first "" .
The Conservatives share this reverence for the free market with the right in the US , and they are united , too , on foreign policy .
Cameron is a champion of what he refers to as "" humanitarian intervention and the spread of democracy and freedom "" , in an echo of the neocon rhetoric used to justify military adventurism .
Cameron 's objections to the occupation of Iraq relate to the fact that "" not enough was done to plan for post - war Iraq "" , rather than to the principle of military intervention itself .
On Iran , Cameron pointedly does not "" rule out the use of force "" .
Another issue that places Cameron squarely in the neoconservative camp is his partisan cheerleading for Israel .
Like the hawks in the Bush administration , he is a self - professed "" very good friend and strong supporter of Israel "" .
In a recent interview he said of the separation wall , declared illegal by the international court of justice : "" I can understand why they built [ it ] .
I saw it for myself . ""
He boasted that while calls for a ceasefire in Lebanon were reverberating in every world capital - bar London and Washington - when war broke out last summer , he and his party had "" strongly "" opposed any such move .
His reservations over Israel 's brutal assault , which left more than 1,000 people dead and 915,000 homeless , centred on its "" bombing of the Christian parts of Beirut "" - as if to suggest that other Lebanese areas were legitimate targets .
British voters disillusioned by New Labour should not forget the American experience of 2000 , which showed that to move from Democrats to Republicans can be to plumb new depths of misery .
The few votes that made the difference then came from the margins .
Ironically , the Muslim minority rallied around Bush in 2000 in protest against Clinton 's secret - evidence law and pro - Israel policies in the Middle East , giving him more than 70 % of its votes , against a mere 10 % for Al Gore .
Today , some of those voters find themselves inside the jails of the president they had helped bring to power .
Experience shows that parties of the centre - left , though they might veer towards the right , tend to remain more liberal , pluralistic and sensitive to the needs of minorities and underprivileged groups in society .
Labour has been greatly weakened by the string of blunders and disasters into which Blair has dragged it .
But Labour is not reducible to Blair , nor to the Blairites - it remains an umbrella of different forces , including trade unions , radicals , ethnic minorities , peace activists .
It would be unthinkable , for example , to find such figures as Tony Benn , Ken Livingstone , or Diane Abbott in the Conservative party .
There , the choice is between grey and greyer , right and ultra right , Cameron and Tebbit .
But if Labour wants to avoid the Democrats ' fate at the hands of the neocons in 2000 , it must make a real effort to reconnect with its disillusioned and alienated bases .
It will have to clear up Blair 's mess and undertake a real change of policy .
That is the only way it can keep Cameron and his clique out of 10 Downing Street . ·

"If everyone loves a celebrity turned politician , we positively lose the plot over one who then goes green .
Arnold Schwarzenegger , the muscle man with a penchant for fat cigars and even fatter cars , is now the Emissions Terminator .
Last week he graced the cover of Newsweek , a globe balanced on his finger , with the slogan : ' Save the Planet or Else ' .
Later this year he will beef up David Cameron 's green credentials by appearing as the star turn at the Tory Party Conference in Blackpool .
Tony Blair should be hurt .
Just months ago Arnie proclaimed him , ' a real action hero ' for his work on busting emissions .
Until recently , Schwarzenegger was regarded as a bit of a Swampy - come - Lately , his nascent interest connected to his bid for the 2003 governorship of green - minded California .
Certainly his eco passions were cleverly disguised by a reputed collection of seven gas - guzzling Humvee military vehicles , which he was happy to popularise as run - around cars for morons everywhere .
We now learn , however , that his passion for green can be traced to his Austrian upbringing , with rationed food and electricity and bath water drawn from a well . '
I 'm a conservation fanatic , ' he has said . '
I ca n't walk out of a room without turning off the lights .
I ca n't stand it when the kids spend longer than five minutes in the shower . '
He was apparently horrified when he arrived in LA in 1968 to mounds of rubbish and dense smog .
The Hummers are now ' in storage ' .
And these days Arnie even offsets the emissions pumped out by the private jet that takes him from his home in LA to his office in Sacramento each week ( though many environmentalists consider offsetting as useful as a chocolate teapot ) .
Notable green highs as Governor ( Arnie secured his second term last year ) include a protection agreement for a 25 m acre area on the Sierra Nevada and his Million Solar Roofs initiative - an 11-year state subsidy plan to stimulate purchase of solar systems for all buildings .
California 's Global Warming Solutions Act , signed last September is the cherry on the cake .
This requires a 25 per cent cut in the state 's greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 , and an 80 per cent cut by 2050 . '
What we 're saying to the federal government is , "" Look , we do n't need Washington , and so let us create the partnerships and let us let the world know that America is actually fighting global warming , "" ' Arnie told Newsweek This made headline news all over the world .
Even Blair praised Schwarzenegger , and David Hawkins , climate director for the heavyweight Natural Resources Defence council , told Rolling Stone magazine : ' He belongs in the sparsely populated top tier of elected officials who are not only taking global warming seriously but devising solutions on a scale that actually matches the problem . '
Yet Arnie is also popular with big business because he does n't do all the apocalyptic stuff .
His brand of eco living is less hemp hair shirt and more about having your carbon cake and eating it .
He 's a relentless advocate of the free market economy , so green taxes do not float Arnie 's bio - fuelled boat . '
One of the constraints in his [ green ] policy is that he 's very conservative in how to pay for it , ' Bill Magavern of the Sierra Club ( an influential environmental body ) said recently .
He reserves his childlike enthusiasm for the ' techno fix ' - the idea that mankind can invent its way out of global warming .
See as evidence the ' green dream tent ' at his electioneering fairs , inevitably featuring Heath Robinsonesque hydrogen contraptions , the 21st century answer to a steam fair .
He is collaborating with British Columbia Premier Gordon Campbell on a proposed hydrogen highway planned for 2010 .
This would ( and note the heavy use of the subjunctive when discussing unproven hydrogen technology ) line the 5,300-mile Pacific coastline with hydrogen gas stations .
This is a very different approach to that other environmental colossus , Al Gore , whose inconvenient pronouncements are more fire and brimstone .
So who has the upper hand ?
Schwarzenegger has confessed he 's a fan of the work of the former presidential candidate , even turning up at a book signing of An Inconvenient Truth with his daughter , but he 's unlikely to be too star struck .
Gore may have an Oscar and claims the eco upper ground by virtue of being a Democrat .
He also has the prominent family pedigree ( although Schwarzenegger 's wife , Maria , is a Kennedy cousin ) .
But let 's not forget that Arnie is in charge of the sixth largest economy in the world .
When that goes green , it means serious muscle .
Hasta la vista , baby .

"A week after the Democrats staged their first full debate of the presidential primary season , 10 Republican candidates gathered on a stage at the Ronald Reagan presidential library in Simi Valley , north of Los Angeles .
Under the watchful eyes of former first lady Nancy Reagan and California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger the candidates displayed unity when asked about the war in Iraq and the perceived threat posed by Iran , and diversity when questioned on social "" values "" issues .
The debate came as the latest polls show former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani pulling ahead in the crucial early primary states .
Mr Giuliani was on 33 % in the Wall Street Journal / NBC poll , Arizona senator John McCain on 22 % , and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney on 12 % .
The actor and former senator Fred Thompson , who has not yet declared his candidacy , was on 17 % .
In the opening exchanges of the debate , which was moderated by political talk show host Chris Matthews , the candidates lined up to profess their opposition to an early withdrawal from Iraq .
"" We should never retreat in the face of terrorism , "" Mr Giuliani said in the evening 's first answer . ""
Terrible mistake . ""
Mr Romney opted for a more nuanced response , stating : "" I want to get our troops home as soon as we possibly can , but at the same time we do n't want to get them out in such a precipitous way that we have to go back . ""
Mr McCain , who has been hampered in the early stages of the campaign by his support for the administration 's recent increase in troop deployment , stated that while he thought the war had been "" terribly mismanaged ... now I believe it is on the right track .
"" All the candidates took the opportunity to shift the focus of the debate from Iraq to Iran .
For Mr McCain , Iran was "" one of the greatest threats to the security of the world "" , while Kansas senator Sam Brownback said , "" We 've got be very confrontational and very aggressive there "" .
The starkest differences between the candidates came when they were asked for their opinion on abortion , specifically whether they would support efforts to repeal Roe vs Wade .
Colorado congressman Tom Tancredo declared that it would be "" the greatest day in this country 's history "" , while Senator Brownback said it would be "" a glorious day of human liberty and freedom "" .
But the question posed some problems for two of the leading candidates .
Mayor Giuliani , stressing that he "" hated "" abortion , noted that abortion law should be a matter for the states , not the federal government .
He also argued that there should be respect for the individual . ""
Ultimately , since it is an issue of conscience , I would respect a woman 's right to make a different choice . ""
Governor Romney , pressed on his apparent change of heart on abortion , invoked the record of President Reagan .
"" I took the same course that Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush and Henry Hyde took , "" he said , "" and I said I was wrong and changed my mind and said I 'm pro - life .
And I 'm proud of that , and I wo n't apologise to anybody for becoming pro - life . ""
Divisions between the candidates also emerged when they were asked for their views on immigration and stem cell research .
While Senator Brownback articulated the opinion of most of the candidates when he said , "" It is not necessary to kill a human life in order to save one "" , Senator McCain was the lone voice in favour of federal funding for stem - cell research .
"" I believe that we need to fund this , "" he said , as Nancy Reagan , a firm supporter of the research , watched from the front row .
"" This is a tough issue for those of us in the pro - life community . ""
Mr McCain , who has authored legislation to introduce a path to citizenship for undocumented migrants in the US , also found himself out of step with the other candidates on the issue of immigration .
California congressman Duncan Hunter took credit for building a wall on the US - Mexico border in San Diego and urged its extension across the continent .
The debate took place in the shadow of the Air Force 1 , the plane that flew Reagan to Berlin to declare , "" tear down that wall , Mr Gorbachev "" .
It is also the plane that took Jimmy Carter to Germany to meet the US hostages released from Iran .
That episode was brought up in the debate , in possibly the most artful attempt to harness some of Reagan 's glory . ""
His philosophy was a philosophy of strength , "" Mr Giuliani said , in answering a question about how best to restore America 's pride .
The Iranians , he continued , "" looked in Ronald Reagan 's eyes and in two minutes they released the hostages "" ."

"Tony Blair will have his last official talks as prime minister at No 10 tomorrow - with California 's governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger .

The talks will be followed by a joint press conference , again the last Mr Blair will host in Downing Street .
The environment secretary , David Miliband , will join in the discussions with Mr Schwarzenegger , which will be followed by a round - table meeting of business leaders .
Asked if the meeting would be Mr Blair 's last bilateral talks at No 10 , his official spokesman said : "" I suppose that will be the case . """
"Arnold Schwarzenegger today praised Tony Blair 's environmental leadership as "" truly a model for the world "" , as the two men met in Downing Street on Mr Blair 's last full day as prime minister .
Mr Schwarzenegger , the former actor turned governor of California , is in the UK for a day of round - table talks with Mr Blair , the environment secretary , David Miliband , and business leaders , on climate change .
He revealed that it was only thanks to Mr Blair "" getting everyone back round the table "" at this month 's G8 that any deal at all was achieved .
In an early morning press conference between the two men , Mr Schwarzenegger said that the prime minister 's visit last year had "" been an inspiration to everyone in California "" , and the state had now copied a British style cap - and - trade model on curbing emissions .
Mr Blair , in his turn , praised Mr Schwarzenegger 's "" vision and leadership "" on the issue , which has seen California lead a small number of US states in adopting Kyoto - style targets , despite Washington having pulled out of that treaty back in 2001 .
Asked if the meeting would be Mr Blair 's last bilateral talks at No 10 , his official spokesman said : "" I suppose that will be the case . ""
The PM signed a deal with Mr Schwarzenegger and BP last year in California , and today the governor praised the UK 's ten - year economic growth with carbon emission reductions as "" truly a model for the rest of the world "" .
Mr Blair cracked a gag with the assembled press corps , harking back to Mr Schwarzenegger 's role in the Terminator movies .
Without confirming or denying whether he would become an international envoy to the Middle East , the PM joked : "" My press officer said to me , whatever else you do this morning , do n't say : ' I 'll be back ' . ""
Mr Schwarzenegger said he would support Mr Blair 's appointment as envoy for the quartet of the US , EU , UN and Russia , which is leading the international drive for Middle East peace .
But the governor , who has made the battle against climate change a personal crusade , added : "" Out of selfish reasons I hope that he becomes the envoy for the environment and brings all the countries of the world together to join some kind of treaty - a Kyoto kind of treaty - that everyone can join and we can all together reduce greenhouse gases .
"" I think the prime minister is the only person who can do that . ""
The governor spoke with the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , yesterday on climate change , and today put California 's success in agreeing action on the environment down to getting Republicans and Democrats to work together .
"" It 's the only way we 're going to fix anything "" , he told reporters in Downing Street .
He also joked that Number 10 's "" delicious British breakfast "" had caused him to put on five pounds in weight ."
"It was The Terminator meets the terminated .
Arnold Schwarzenegger paid his first visit to Downing Street , where he held talks about climate change with Tony Blair and business leaders .
The two men held a joint press conference .
It was full of weird moments .
Tony is almost the same height as Arnie , but Arnie has the bigger face .
He has a simply enormous face .
When he dies , they can embalm him and stick him straight on to Mt Rushmore .
And it is topped with enough hair to stuff one of the famous Blair sofas .
Then there 's the accent .
You ca n't listen to him talk about climate change without seeing him waving a howitzer - sized gun about at various villains .
He had , he growled , just gained five pounds from eating "" a delicious Briddish breakfast "" .
Someone must have been sprinkling the sausages with fairy dust , because he seemed to think that Tony Blair had , almost single - handed , saved the planet . ""
He came to California at a criddical stage - [ you can talk Arnie by substituting the letter D for T in the middle of words , and using G in place of the hard C ] - and what was grade aboud it , was he invided Democrads and Republicans and thad way you can accomplish anything .
He showed grade leadership , and the Briddish mardel has inspired everyone in California . ""
Really ?
Relaxing in Santa Barbara , cruising the freeways of LA , pruning vines in the wine country , do they speak only of Tony Blair and the Briddish mardel ?
"" You are rolling back emissions to the 1990 level , in Grade Briddain
you 're 9 % or 10 % below the 1990 level ...
"" Who told him that stuff ?
Then it clicked .
This was the Oscars .
Anything less than glowing , gushing , demented praise for everyone within earshot is virtually an insult .
They say that politics is show business for ugly people , though in the case of Mr Schwarzenegger , it may be the other way round too .
He felt that the Americans would have to clean up their act before asking for cuts from India and China , or , as he put it , "" i d 's a chiggen and egg siduation "" .
However , tegnology was going to save the day . ""
Clear green tegnology will be the new gold rush for California , "" he added .
We turned our star - struck gaze away to Tony Blair .
He was busy not denying that he was going to the Middle East .
"" I have n't retired yet - this is the last press conference I 'm giving to you guys - that 's something I 'm really going to miss ! ""
( Sarcasm has suddenly become fashionable in politics . )
Someone asked if he had any advice for his successor . ""
No , "" he snapped . ""
He is perfectly capable of doing the job on his own .
"" The word "" Not ! "" hovered unspoken in the air .
Finally officials nudged him away .
"" My press officer said , "" he told us perkily , "" whatever else you say this morning , do n't say ' I 'll be back ! ' ""
And I wo n't use such a cliche either .
So it 's "" hasta la vista , baby ! ""
Or , a less well known Schwarzenegger film quote that might be useful in his new career :
"" If it bleeds , we can kill it . """
"Hollywoodised politics : Tony Blair meets Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Photograph :
Peter Macdiarmid / Getty
On his very last full day of office , Tony Blair held a meeting with movie - star - turned - Californian - governor Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Their subject , not too contentious , was climate change .
This was a summit meeting of world - political celebrities , rather than politicians ; it was a stunningly appropriate pointer to how Blair 's post - Westminster career is going to look :
Hollywoodised and bathed in bipartisan glitz , in star power ; a shock'n'awe world - theatrical showcase for pure prestige .
Blair has already said that the boring old House Of Lords is n't his style .
This clearly is .
For post - prime ministerial Blair , international politics is showbusiness for pretty people .
But how poignant for Tony to muse on Arnie 's great catchphrases : hasta la vista , and I 'll be back .
Tony wo n't be back - or at least never in the same way .
How he must envy Governor Schwarzenegger .
At 54 , Blair 's real political career is behind him , and he moves into lucrative but nebulous political theatre .
At 59 , Schwarzenegger is just getting started .
He has put his showbiz phase behind him and his political career is blooming - and who knows if it might not be possible to change the rules about needing to be born in the US of A to be President ?
So this brush with Hollywoodised politics might have been a bittersweet moment for Blair as he prepares to leave office .
But what does Hollywood have to tell us about saying goodbye ?
Well , basically , it does n't do goodbyes , or at least not very often .
Goodbyes generally happen at the beginning of the story , when the hero leaves his comfort zone for adventures - and there 's a happy reunion for an ending .
Goodbyes at the end ?
Too much of a downer , in the main .
There 's the ending of Casablanca of course , in which Humphrey Bogart heroically urges Ingrid Bergman to leave for a happier , better life with Paul Henreid .
This was the "" goodbye "" ending playfully pastiched by the Walt Disney cartoon The Jungle Book , in which Bagheera and Baloo take Mowgli to the man village , and he is so entranced by the sight of a singing girl at the riverbank that he falls goofily in love there and then , and follows her , hardly bothering to say goodbye at all to heartbroken Baloo .
But Baloo cheers up quick enough , and dances off into the sunset with his pal Bagheera .
For this analogy , Blair has to be the tough Bogart figure , and we , the British people , are collectively the lovely , dewy - eyed Bergman , melting in his arms as he prepares to say farewell to us .
Blair knows it 's for the best to entrust us to another man : dour , prudent Gordon Brown is Henreid .
Less glamorous , but trustworthy .
And then Bogart strides off into the distance to console himself with a beautiful friendship with Claude Rains 's amoral Captain Renault .
Could Blair find that sort of consolatory friendship with Cherie ?
Perhaps .
Or perhaps he can relate more to Baloo 's fatherly , yet somehow tragic , relationship with the innocent man - cub .
Talking of Bogart , perhaps Blair could gloomily rent some DVDs of the classic gumshoe pictures , with titles that reference the ultimate farewell of death ?
Farewell
My Lovely ?
The Big Sleep ?
The Long Goodbye ?
( After all , with his delayed resignation , he gave us the most painful and longest goodbye in modern political history . )
As the wised - up detective cruises around dirty Los Angeles , he takes on tough guys and shady ladies , but knows he can only rely on himself .
Death is waiting for us all , but the sufficiently cynical will at least be spared the exquisite pain of disillusionment .
Like Westminster , LA is a hellhole that will suck you down in the end .
But this , too , is n't exactly the movie farewell that Blair 's long goodbye really brings to my mind .
More appropriate is a classic Bible picture like the King Of Kings or The Greatest Story
Ever Told .
The prime minister 's extraordinary speech to the Labour Party Conference in September 2006 , contained the resonant phrase : "" Whatever you do , I 'm always with you .
Head and heart . ""
Later , he is said to have told friends that he was inspired by Steinbeck 's The Grapes Of Wrath , in which the hero Joad - played by Henry Fonda in the 1940 film version - is about to face certain death by confronting vigilantes and tells his tearful mother that whatever happens , he will be with her in spirit .
But it is surely more obviously like Christ 's phrase : "" You can be sure that I am always with you , to the very end . ""
Today , as Blair bids farewell to the faithful and to the faithless alike , he could be mentally starring in his own religious film , one with the most uplifting ending imaginable ."
"The most astounding media artefact of the year - perhaps of this century so far - covered 16 whole pages of the Sun .
In them , George W Bush says that ' Tony Blair 's skill - and I wish I had it - is that he 's very articulate ' ; Bill Clinton remembers what a great golfer and chum
Tony was ; Bill Gates anoints him the ' saviour of Africa ' ; Bob Geldof wants to be an enduring ' mate ' ; and Arnold Schwarzenegger calls him ' my inspiration ' .
Plus added encomiums from Coronation Street stars , Bono , Blunkett et al .
Great goodbyes do n't come much more effusive than that .
Nightmare on Kinnock Street has never seemed further away .
Yet turn to the Mail or Telegraph ( sharers of the original nightmare vision ) and you might have wandered on to a different planet .
Paul Dacre 's chaps ladled out the ' breathtaking incompetence , spin , deceit , disarray and disrepute ' .
The Barclay brothers ' men winced at a ' cringe - making farewell tour ' now finally over and a leader who had ' debauched ' British governance .
Even the kindliest words - ' we wish him well in the Middle East ' - were hissed through gritted teeth .
Pause for a moment , though , and put cynicism a couple of millimetres aside .
Perhaps ( as some sneer )
the disreputable , deceitful Bun only does Rupert Murdoch 's bidding - and perhaps Rupert sucks up to those in power hardest of all .
Yet what was the point of being quite so nice about someone relinquishing power ?
Why hymn ' a country more tolerant and at ease with itself than at any time in its postwar history ' ?
Why praise a ' remarkable Prime Minister ' and his ' remarkable achievements ' as he , remarkably , closes the door behind him ?
Could it just be that the Sun - devoting those 16 pages on a day when the Labour - loyal Mirror was more interested in ' the liberation of Paris ' ( Hilton ) - caught a mood that others missed until they saw David Cameron urging his troops to their feet in the Commons on Thursday ?
It 's a big question , not just because of Blair 's legacy , but because it opens a road to the future . '
Gord help us now , ' said the Express on Brown day one , and Gord will be anxious to know whose help he 'll get .
Will the Sun stay loyal ?
What difference can 24 hours make in leader - writing life ?
One day on , indeed , the Bun country at ease with itself had a ' health service in turmoil ' , bad teachers in need of ' culling ' and the ' pressing issue ' of an EU referendum . '
Prove yourself on the EU , Gordon ' , boomed the commenter - in - chief .
And the Mail - ' Massive abilities ... worrying flaws ... awesome challenges ' - was singing exactly the same menacing anthem . '
As [ referendum ] decision day draws closer , we shall see if he has the courage to honour his party 's word . '
So the honeymoon may be short and not particularly sweet .
The Independent greeted Brown with a front - page list of tasks which began ' Take a lead on Europe ' ( from Jacques Delors ) .
Either way , he 's in trouble .
He could be a great PM , ' if he learns to work with his enemies ' , said Peter Oborne in the Mail ( a world expert on making enemies ) .
Or he could make his Guardian fans happy by doing the reverse .
Oddly , the relevant key may not be the one to Number 10 .
It lies down some Notting Hill bicycle track - for Tory wobbles are wobbling the Tory press 's faith in Cameron .
The Telegraph is already brooding over the prospect of ' a fourth successive defeat ' .
Stephen Glover in the Mail finds Cameron ' somewhat directionless ' .
Though the defecting Quentin Davies can be written off as a Euro - fanatic , the latest Boy David looks a touch vulnerable .
Kevin Maguire in the Mirror took Brown 's state school motto - ' I will try my utmost ' - and placed it against the ' toff - led ' Tories . '
Somehow I ca n't hear the smiling Old Etonian Cameron standing in front of the TV cameras to recite his old college 's motto , because "" Let Eton flourish "" stinks of privilege . '
It 's not exactly news that Simon Heffer thinks the Tories ' do n't want to develop any serious policy ' , but it 's a serious charge when things are n't going well .
Is this the opposition that launches a devastating onslaught over Europe ?
I hope not , muses Michael Portillo in the Sunday Times , because it will bring back memories of every visceral Tory split .
It 's not necessary , writes Peter Riddell in the Times ; it 's ' over the top ' to portray the treaty as some betrayal .
It 's just a ' messy series of compromises ' .
In short ( Riddell again )
the draft treaty wo n't be finalised until December , or ready for voting on before February , and time changes agendas .
Will the absence of spin that currently so delights the Mail have turned by then into too much grunting and groaning for Quentin Letts ?
Simon Hoggart in the Guardian proclaimed ' the bores are back in town ' as ' titans of tedium ' throng Brown 's front bench .
Off shot the Bun , in search of blondes wrestling in Big Brother .
What price a wistful piece praising Alastair Campbell before Christmas ?
Somewhere behind 16 pages of Sun stunners Y'ule love , that is ."
"Die Hard 4.0 ( 129 mins , 15 ) Directed by Len Wiseman ; starring Bruce Willis , Justin Long , Timothy Olyphant , Maggie Q Reviving a long - dormant ( or dead ) movie franchise is usually a sign that the star 's acting career is on the wane .
Just look at what happened to Bruce Willis 's ass - kicking , hamburger - flipping Planet Hollywood buddies .
Having won few fans with ' sympathetic ' comedic roles in tripe like Jingle All the Way and Junior , former bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger allowed himself one last metal - grinding hurrah with Terminator 3 ( worldwide gross : $ 418 million ) before moving on to become real - life ' Governator ' of California .
Poor old Sylvester Stallone , who announced in the mid - Nineties that he 'd swapped action movies for more serious fare like Cop Land , recently found himself back in the ring with Rocky Balboa ( which we must n't call Rocky 6 ) and is now tooling up for John Rambo ( which we must n't call Rambo 4 ) .
Only Bruce Willis , whose biggest financial hits have ranged from the intelligently creepy The Sixth Sense to the dumb - as - nuts apocalyptic actioner Armageddon , has been able to balance head - kicking duties with more ambitious artsy thesping .
So , after a worthy cameo in Fast Food Nation , it 's no surprise to find him back in the Die Hard saddle , albeit a full 12 years after last slipping into ' everyman ' anti - hero John McClane 's dirty vest .
In America this new McClane vehicle is called Live Free or Die Hard , the flag - waving , post - Iraq connotations of which were clearly considered inappropriate for the ' softer ' European market .
So here we have Die Hard 4.0 , flagging up the film 's already rather obsolete computer - literate hipness ( remember Hackers way back in ' 95 ? ) , and taking its inspiration from a Wired magazine article about cyber - terrorism .
This time the bad guys are tech - nerds who hold the East Coast to ransom by crashing computer systems and pilfering electronic millions in the process . '
You 're a Timex watch in a digital world , ' McClane is told , the head - banging techniques of yore apparently useless against this terribly modern threat .
Yet , for all it 's technological bluster , Die Hard 4.0 very soon downshifts into punching , shooting and smashing everything to smithereens . '
Think of it as hardware to your software
, ' croons Timothy Olyphant 's computer crook when the rocket launchers and bombs come out , reassuring us all that
, even in this brave new cyberworld , we 'll still get to watch a whole lot of stuff being blown up .
And we do .
Alongside much unfeasibly prompt internet keyboard fiddling ( sign me up to that super - fast service provider now ) , we find Bruce throwing an SUV down a fiery elevator shaft , kung fu fighting with exotic Asian babes , dodging missiles in an articulated lorry , and - most laughably - surfing on the tailfin of a Harrier jump jet ( so much for McClane being ' just a regular guy ' ) .
Yet , while the beauty of the original Die Hard was that it was basically ' cowboys and Indians in The Towering Inferno ' , this fourth instalment plays more like a Hits - on-45 compilation of disconnected movie cliches .
From the city gridlocked by traffic - light computer hacking ( courtesy of The Italian Job ) to the shot of the Capitol Building exploding ( like ID4 's White House ) there 's little here that we have n't seen before .
Even the central action set - piece in which a helicopter is brought down by an airborne car recalls a superior sequence from the cheap - and - cheerful Nineties exploitation romp Stone Cold , which threw a motorbike at a chopper to far more outrageous effect .
As for the script , writer Mark Bomback has trawled far and wide in his search for new / old quotable McClane - isms .
While repeating Die Hard 's trademark ' Yippee - ki - yay motherf *
*
* * * ' may be obligatory ( that zinger now being considered on a par with ' Here 's looking at you kid ' ) , ripping off Bruce 's ' I have asked you repeatedly to call me dad ' riff from Armageddon is stretching a point , even if McClane is rescuing his daughter rather than his wife nowadays .
Elsewhere , the usual collection of ' dry ' underreactions to incredibly noisy explosions ( ' That 's gon na wake up the neighbours ' ) fill in the blanks in solidly perfunctory fashion .
Somewhere in the middle of it
all there 's the merest whiff of politics , with anthrax scares and post 9/11 paranoia in the air , corporate rejection fuelling home - grown anarcho - terrorists ( rather than ' some religious nut hell - bent on apocalypse ' ) , and Bush 's infamous ' we will not tire , we will not falter , we will not fail ' speech being remixed to satirical effect .
McClane 's new slacker - hacker sidekick Matt Farrell ( Justin Long ) snipes at the government 's failure to bail out New Orleans and declares all TV and radio news stations to be ' totally manipulated ' .
Yet , perhaps unsurprisingly for a movie financed by Fox , he is soon forced to eat his words and accept that hacking corporate accounts is bad because ' this is not a system , it 's a country ' !
Even Kevin Smith 's uber - geek ' Warlock ' , who hates authority and hacks the planet from his mom 's basement , winds up helping the cops because , hey , y'know , we 're all , like , on the same side , are n't we ?
In the end , it 's anodyne , workmanlike fare with Underworld director Len Wiseman simply joining the dots between the explosions , giving the audience what they paid for in ludicrously pain - free screen carnage ( even when Bruce manfully shoots himself , although crucially not in the foot ) but sadly shortchanging them on substance and structure .
As for that vest - although it can be glimpsed peeking cheekily through bullet holes in his grey - green singlet , Willis seems to have decided that the time has come to keep his shirt on .
Die hard - but dress warm . ·

Arnold Schwarzenegger poses for the cameras to promote Pumping Iron .

AFP It seems like only yesterday that the world 's most famous Austrian was in regular employment making assorted Hollywood extras do the machine - gun dance , but Arnold Schwarzenegger , now the Governator , is 60 on Monday .
Not quite pensionable age , especially in the Californian vale of eternal youth , but a little too old for the murder'n'mockery routine of old , especially as he has other responsibilities now .
Nonetheless , it 's a time to reminisce on a career that had precious few movies ( really good ones , anyway ) , but some mighty fine moments : 1 ) Arnold the meathead :
"" I am getting the feeling of coming in the gym , I am getting the feeling of coming at home , I am getting the feeling of coming when I pump up backstage .
So am I coming day and night .
"" Sounds like the late 70s bodybuilding circuit had its perks , in George Butler 's outrageous hagiography Pumping Iron .

Arnold the Shakespearean : between the star persona already clotted in self parody and the attempts to break open a comedy persona , there was hardly anywhere else left for the big man to go in the 90s , and politics was beckoning .

Gramercy for your ideas about cinema 's greatest cross - dressers .
This is your select band of those zealots waging gender jihad : 1 ) I did n't broach the subject of the last decade 's spate of top African - American comedians making grotesque and faintly misogynistic forays into the dressing up box : there 's Eddie Murphy in the Nutty Professor remakes and Norbit , and Martin Lawrence following ( fat ) suit in Big Momma 's House .

The death toll from the recent flooding rose past 360 as the waters began to recede across northern India and Bangladesh , and aid workers scrambled to prevent an outbreak of diarrhoea and other waterborne diseases .
But the authorities have been criticised for being too slow to respond to the crisis with too little aid .
Officials said the flooding was due to an unusual monsoon pattern , not global warming .

"It 's probably not fashionable to do so , but I admit that I still enjoying watching repeats of Arnold Schwarzenegger 's 1990 blockbuster Total Recall .
Not so much for the film 's exploration of that common sci - fi ' reality - vs - dream ' theme ( see The Matrix et al ) , but for seeing once again Mars being ' terraformed ' into a habitable planet by the artificial manipulation of its atmosphere .
The film has a certain morbid appeal for me as the reality here on Earth is that we are doing the exact opposite - we are , if you like , ' terrafouling ' our planet .
Just imagine if we could press ' Stop ' on our remote control , as we can when watching movies .
But back to reality : the solutions to climate change - if only it was a dream , as in the film - that are now thrown up broadly fall into two camps .
There are the techno fixes .
And then there are the emissions - reduction strategies involving quotas and targets .
The former usually involve the ' boys toys ' approach - let 's trust those scientists to come up with super clever ways to soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , or deflect some of the suns rays away from the planet .
This seems to be the view of the current American administration , given what it has said in the past .
The latter involves tackling the causes rather than the symptoms - working out ways to preventing greenhouse gas emissions from entering the atmosphere in the first place .
But in the short term at least this route looks like it requires of us substantial lifestyle changes - particularly when it comes to how we get from A to B as our transportation technology remains , and will remain for decades yet , extremely fossil - fuel intensive .
As a result , this is by far the most unpalatable route for most of us to consider .
If the climate was a casserole requiring heating ( an ironic analogy , I know ) , we are now so hungry we 'd much rather hear the ping of the microwave oven than wait over an hour for it to cook in the conventional oven .
In the latest edition of the science journal Nature , two eminent environmental scientists are arguing that it is indeed now time to reach for that microwave oven .
Professor James Lovelock , the author of the Gaia theory , and Professor Chris Rapley , newly appointed director of the Science Museum in London and former head of the British Antarctic Survey , propose that about 134 million tubes , each 200 metres in length , be positioned throughout the world 's oceans .
They would then act , so the theory goes , to bring nutrients from the deep up to the surface , encouraging algae to bloom .
This would then act to absorb carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and lock it away in the oceans .
"" We are taking the very strong line that we are not going to save the planet by the regular approaches like the Kyoto Protocol or renewable energy , "" said Professor Lovelock , who also backs the use of nuclear energy because , despite its risks , he says there just is n't enough time now to develop other forms of low - carbon technologies that could provide the huge amount of energy we evidently need .
To me , it feels as if we are now standing before a giant roulette table .
Should we play safe and push all our chips onto black and at least have a good chance of walking away solvent ?
Or should we go for the high - risk / high - reward strategy and place everything on a single number ?
Personally , I 'm in favour of spreading the risk and exploring as many avenues as possible , but I do worry that by pouring many billions of dollars into big techno fixes - nuclear fusion , giant sea tubes , solar shields etc - that it could send us all a message in the many years they would take to develop and build that says ' relax , job done ' .
Should we place all out trust in those that would develop such technologies , especially when we know that more mundane , low - fi options are already available to us ?
And what if the big techno fixes do n't work ?"
"Not even a video message from Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California ( he praised Dave ) , or rumours that Theresa May would turn up in leopard print wellington boots ( she did ) , could fully restore grassroots morale when a microphone failure delayed proceedings .
Soon after the suitably named chairman , Simon Mort , predicted "" a fantastic week "" , the mics were cut off for repair - or "" 20 minutes of golden silence from the Tories - the most sense anyone has heard them utter for months "" , Labour HQ declared .

"Boris Johnson was today unleashed on the Conservative party in an eight - minute conference performance that threatened to upstage the appearance of Terminator star Arnold Schwarzenegger .
The Tory candidate for London mayor received a massive standing ovation as he took to the stage at the party 's autumn conference in Blackpool .
With his usual speed and gusto , Mr Johnson poked fun at his opponent , Ken Livingstone - whom he referred to as "" King Newt "" - but he assured delegates that he was "" deadly serious "" about achieving the post . ""
What gives me greatest pride of all is that from day one I have provoked such gibbering squeals of denunciation from the King Newt and his allies that I know they are scared , "" he said .
Mr Johnson delighted the audience with tales about his election campaigning on a Routemaster bus , "" sometimes at the wheel of that bus "" .
He denounced "" cyclist - crushing bendy - buses "" and told of a 14-year - old he met who observed : "" The trouble is , these days , adults are scared of kids . ""
"" I felt a certain challenge in his gaze , "" Mr Johnson said .
"" It said something both sad and true about the state of Britain today and I want to do something to change that .
"" It was a difficult act to follow - even for Mr Schwarzenegger .
The governor of California and former actor had been due to speak at the conference but instead his comments were beamed by satellite on to a large screen .
In a short address , Mr Schwarzenegger received his biggest cheer for insisting that elected governors , and indeed mayors , ought to be public servants , not party servants .
Earlier , Lord Heseltine , the former deputy prime minister , head of the Tories ' "" cities taskforce "" , said that all cities ought to be run by elected mayors .
The post as he envisioned it would combine the roles of council leader and chief executive .
Under Lord Heseltine 's proposals , the mayor would be given responsibility over local sheriffs to meet his / her city 's policing needs .
Local authorities would also be given greater responsibility for health , education and other powers currently in the hands of quangos .
Opening a debate on urban regeneration , Eric Pickles , the shadow secretary of state for communities and local government , reiterated David Cameron 's pledge to axe stamp duty for first - time buyers on homes costing less than £ 250,000 .
He also announced plans to introduce a family homes initiative to let communities not Whitehall decide where properties should be built .
Mr Pickles also promised to give local authorities greater flexibility on spending .
But he ruled out a proposals to tax supermarket car parks ."

"Now that Arnold Schwarzenegger 's political role has taken him out of the world of acting - and we use that word in the most generous sense - producers on Terminator 4 are rumoured to have found a replacement .
According to unconfirmed reports on cult websites Bloody Disgusting and Aintitcoolnews , the appropriately robotic Vin Diesel is in line to play the lead in the sci - fi action saga .
Diesel would appear to be a perfect fit for the role of the cyborg with a heart , boasting as he does a hulking physique and a predilection for monosyllabic , low - speed , and occasionally indistinct vocal delivery .
It emerged earlier this week that Diesel will return with Paul Walker for a fourth episode of the street racing series The Fast
And The Furious .
His other credits include the action blockbusters xXx and Pitch Black , and the Steven Spielberg war epic Saving Private Ryan .
Until recently The Rock had been considered the frontrunner for Terminator 4 .
However , Diesel is now widely regarded as the leading contender .
Filming on Terminator 4 is being lined up for sometime in 2008 ."
"There is a reason most men do n't like being asked the question "" what are you thinking about ?
"" It is because the answer is almost never the right one .
Instead of "" how much I love watching Dirty Dancing with you , my angel "" or "" when we could next go shoe shopping "" it tends to be more "" what your sister would look like in a bikini "" or "" who would win a fight between Mr T and Arnold Schwarzenegger "" .
The problem is , we 're quite sad creatures .
At least , I am .
One day a couple of weeks back , the missus asked what I was thinking .
Twice .
This was n't a wistful , romantic , dreamy , "" let me see the inner - you "" question ( thank God ) but rather more one based on the fact that I 'd frozen , a forkful of pizza inches from my mouth , and started to stare into the middle distance , perhaps drooling absentmindedly .
The problem was , I had to admit I was wondering if Leighton Baines had been named man of the match on Saturday .
She was deeply impressed .
Hours later , on a train , she asked why I 'd been staring at the luggage rack for several minutes .
It 's quite interesting to discover just how irritated a woman can become by the seemingly innocuous phrase "" I was just thinking about whether Gareth Barry will create any goals this afternoon , or whether he 'll be exhausted after his England games . ""
So here we go .
In an effort to ensure that my unborn child does not grow up fatherless , I need to tackle my demons : my name is Benjie Goodhart , and I 'm addicted to fantasy football .
I first discovered fantasy football when I was 22 , young , naïve and foolish .
I 'm not proud of what it made me do : I ended up buying a newspaper whose political stance made Enoch Powell look like Clare Short , just so I could play its shiny new football game .
Indeed , I actually appeared to be quite good at it .
In my second year , I finished the season 81st .
OK , that hardly makes me Carl Lewis , but I was happy .
For a while .
To paraphrase Winston Churchill , fantasy football has taken more out of me than I have out of it .
The games changed , were refined , improved .
They became cheaper and easier to play , more involving , more exciting and more time - consuming .
The Premier League brought out its own , official , free online version .
You no longer had two transfers a season , but one or two every week .
And before I knew it , I was hooked , drowning in a flood of transfers amid an ocean of statistics .
It has changed me , changed the way I watch my beloved football .
I no longer live for the moments when athleticism and genius combine in a moment of sublime aesthetics : the 30-yard strike , the balletic , weaving dribble .
Of far more importance is whether the ball hit the arse of one of my attackers on its way into the net .
If someone were to pick up the ball in their own area , beat 11 players and slot it home for the greatest goal ever , my only concern would be that it was one of my defenders who had initially passed them the ball .
And when you get involved in a mini - league - that 's where things really start to get out of hand .
Winning is everything : fantasy football is more important than life and death .
And it does n't matter what principles are sacrificed along the way .
At the start of every season , I pick a team devoid of Chelsea players : as a QPR fan , it is a matter of principle .
Except that , sooner or later , you notice that Frank Lampard is scoring regularly , or Shaun Wright - Phillips looks a bit tasty .
And suddenly they 're in , because beating your friends , grinding them into the dust , means more to you than any tribal loyalty .
To my shame , I have cheered Chelsea goals .
If not wanting them to win , necessarily , I have wanted them to lose 7 - 6 , with a Lampard double hat - trick .
And I 'm not even the worst offender .
I spoke to a friend recently who said he 'd had a bad weekend , football - wise .
He 's a Gooner , and they 'd just beaten Spurs 3 - 1 away , yet he was traumatised by his fantasy team 's poor performance .
This is the same man who has been known , towards the end of the season , to sit at home with the team line - ups of his rivals and a pen and paper , listening to the radio and keeping a running tally of scores .
Most tragically of all , this is the man who spent a large chunk of New Year 's Eve in an internet cafe in King 's Cross , planning his transfers .
Why ?
Because he and I had a £ 10 bet riding on that season .
At the end of the season , he won .
He won £ 10 .
His total internet cafe expenditure was £ 30 for the season .
And the saddest thing of all ?
He considered it money well spent .
Then again , I 'm hardly in a position to pass judgement .
If it had cost me three times that to beat him , I 'd have jumped at the chance .
Benjie Goodhart is a journalist and fantasy football expert .
He is currently rock bottom of the GU Sport Pick the Score league ."
"Fresh off the back of last week 's news that Vin Diesel may be taking over from Arnold Schwarzenegger in a fourth Terminator film comes the announcement that producers are planning not one but three new films in the sci - fi franchise .
Warner Bros , which now owns the rights to the Terminator films , wants to see an entire trilogy of movies set in the future , during the war between the robots and the humans .
Executive producer Moritz Borman said : "" The third film was really the conclusion of what happened in the ' now . '
You will find the most - loved characters , but the intention here is to present a fresh new world and have this be the first of a trilogy . ""
And if you 're one of those who wishes studio bosses had listened to original franchise director James Cameron , whose famous response when asked what he thought of Terminator 3 was to simply say : "" I told the story "" , then we 're afraid matters get worse .
The director being talked up to take on the next film is Charlie 's Angels ' McG. Steven Spielberg has confirmed what - thanks to a certain balalaika dancing extra - everybody already knew , namely that the villains on the new Indiana Jones film are Russians .
Last month extra Tyler Nelson let slip to his local newspaper , Oklahoma 's Edmond Sun , that he had been hired to play a Soviet soldier on Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull .
Spielberg was reportedly furious at the leak , but was gracious enough to confirm its validity to Chud.com , on top of a few further choice details about the new film , none of which , unfortunately , involve the plot .
Spielberg said he would be shooting entirely on film and would be using traditional editing techniques to ensure the new movie looked like its predecessors .
He also revealed that Harrison Ford , despite being the wrong side of 60 , was doing most of his own stunts .
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is due to hit cinemas in May next year .
In what is perhaps not the most surprising news of the week , it 's being reported that America 's Catholic League are objecting to the first film in the forthcoming trilogy based on Philip Pullman 's His Dark Materials books , The Golden Compass .
An extended trailer for the film , which can be viewed here , has just hit the web , so you can see for yourself whether the League - which admits it has n't yet seen the movie
- is likely to be vindicated in its claims that the film is an altogether sinful piece of work .
"" Unsuspecting parents may take their children to see The Golden Compass and then buy the ( book ) trilogy for them , perhaps as a Christmas gift , "" writes the League 's William A Donohue , a chat show regular in the States .
If this is the reaction in America , one wonders what the Vatican is going to think of a movie based on a book which cheerfully wraps up a thinly - veiled critique of organised religion in the bright enticing colours of a children 's adventure story .
The Golden Compass , which stars Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman , arrives here on December 5 , just in time for Christmas ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger and David Cameron meet in Sacramento , California .
Photographer : Stefan Rousseau / PA Gordon Brown has a lot of catching up to do : not only is David Cameron ahead in the British polls , the Tory leader is also proving to be a big hit Stateside .
Last night Cameron met with Californian governor , action hero and kindred green spirit Arnold Schwarzenegger for a "" very friendly and constructive "" meeting in Sacramento .
It 's certainly a far more glamorous choice than Brown 's last photo - op "" celebrity "" meeting with Margaret Thatcher .
And it looks like Arnie and Dave have formed a strong bond already as Schwarzenegger presented Cameron with a selection of his favourite DVDs .
Gordon Brown clearly needs to hit back to boost his transatlantic celebrity status .
Which silver screen icon should he associate himself with to improve his troubled image ?
And with which movie icon do you most associate him ?"
"The son of a favoured photographer of Marilyn Monroe is awaiting a court ruling that will determine whether he can sell his father 's pictures of the star .
Josh Greene , whose father Milton took more than 4,900 shots of Monroe , including the celebrated portrait in a ballerina outfit , spoke out last night against a decision by California 's governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger .
The governor 's "" dead celebrities bill "" , passed on Wednesday , decrees that famous people , even those who died years ago , are entitled to pass on image rights to whomever they choose .
According to a report on the US public radio network NPR yesterday , the ruling means that Greene will not be entitled to make money from his father 's work because Monroe bequeathed most of her estate to her acting coach Lee Strasberg .
The late Strasberg made millions of dollars from licensing Monroe 's image after her death .
Josh Greene has been at the centre of protracted legal action to determine who controls Monroe 's estate .
Greene thought the matter was settled earlier this year when federal judges ruled in favour of him and another photographer , saying that at the time of Monroe 's death in 1962 there was no law allowing anyone to pass on their image rights .
That decision paved the way for a spate of products bearing the star 's image , among them sex oil and underwear .
However Wednesday 's bill reverses the ruling and returns the advantage to the Strasbergs .
Greene contends that Monroe was a resident of New York and that her estate is not affected by the west coast state 's new legislation .
He awaits a court ruling on the location of Monroe 's residency .
"" It 's against the constitution to take away someone 's property , "" Greene told NPR .
"" Somebody ca n't come in and take away your property .
You own it .
Your father , let 's say , composed a piece of music .
Now , all of a sudden , someone else is going to come in and say , ' We 're going to take over your rights . '
I beg your pardon ? """
"David Cameron signals today that he will try to extend the dramatic political gains the Conservatives have made over the last fortnight by pressing ahead with his centrist , liberal agenda , inspired by California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger .
In an exclusive interview with the Guardian , the Tory leader says his success in halting Gordon Brown 's general election plans was not down solely to the Tories ' promise to cut inheritance tax , but the product of two years of recasting his party as ready for the 21st century .
Turning his back on calls from party hardliners for distinctive rightwing policies , he will move into core Labour territory by claiming that only his party can tackle poverty in Britain .
Speaking during an upbeat tour of the US west coast , Mr Cameron hailed Mr Schwarzenegger as a model centre - right politician and acknowledged his debt to the film star - turned politician , describing himself as a fan .
He said : "" My wife said to me : ' How are you going to explain to an American audience what sort of Conservative you are ? '
I said : ' I 'll say look at me and think of Arnold Schwarzenegger ' . ""
Speaking later to the Guardian , Mr Cameron said : "" He 's [ Mr Schwarzenegger ] a very impressive politician .
He 's achieved huge amounts in California because he 's had to work with a Democratic legislature , so he 's very good at making compromises , making deals , getting things done .
His analysis of US politics is very sharp . ""
Mr Cameron said Mr Schwarzenegger had encouraged him by showing that business and environmentalism could work together .
Mr Schwarzenegger has agreed a cross - party deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 25 % in California by 2020 .
"" It 's shown that a centre - right politician can make a lead on this issue , "" Mr Cameron said , adding pointedly : "" And he got re - elected . ""
The Tory leader said he was relaxed about the government 's adoption of large elements of the Conservatives ' inheritance tax policy in this week 's pre - budget report , and was not prepared to change tactics simply to differentiate his party from Labour .
"" I have always said that politics should n't be about trying to be distinctive , politics should be about trying to be right .
This expression ' clear blue water ' I think has been very damaging over the years for the Conservative party .
If you are trying to find clear blue water just for the sake of it , you 'll probably drown in it , "" Mr Cameron said .
"" The parties are closer together than they have been in the past and there is always going to be a bit of policy stealing going on .
What matters in politics is that you stand up for what you believe in , say what you want to do and if the other side nick it , great , say ' Well , implement it properly . '
"" Reflecting on his conference speech , Mr Cameron said that only his wife , Samantha , his chief strategist , Steve Hilton , and shadow chancellor George Osborne knew before the morning of the speech of his plan to deliver it without a script ."
"Hundreds of thousands of people in California have fled their homes as fierce brush fires burn out of control and were predicted to worsen today .
The California governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , declared a state of emergency and said it was a "" tragic time "" for the state .
At least 300,000 people had been told to leave San Diego county , where hundreds of homes have been destroyed .
The state of emergency opens the way for federal government assistance .
The US president , George Bush , today authorised the Federal Emergency Management Agency - the body heavily criticised for its response to Hurricane Katrina - to coordinate disaster relief in the seven worst affected counties .
One firefighter described the scene as looking like a "" nuclear winter "" .
Conditions were expected to get worse , with temperatures of up to 38C expected in parts of southern California and desert winds of up to 70 mph fanning the flames across the tinder - dry region .
At least 1,000 homes have so far been destroyed and thousands more are under threat from the 14 major fires burning across the state .
Neighbouring states including Nevada and Arizona are contributing crews and equipment , and the Pentagon is sending six water - dropping planes to help with the effort .
At least one person has been killed in the fires .
He was named by the Associated Press news agency as Thomas Varshock , 52 , of Tecate , a town on the Mexican border south - east of San Diego . ""
Lifesaving is our priority .
Getting people out from in front of the fire - those have been our priorities , "" Captain Don Camp , from the California department of forestry and fire protection , said .
A pair of wildfires consumed 128 homes in the mountain resort area of Lake Arrowhead , in the San Bernardino national forest east of Los Angeles .
"" We 're stretched very thin and we ca n't get any planes up , "" John Miller , a forest spokesman , said .
State officials called in the National Guard .
Air quality plummeted as winds of up to 90 mph deposited ash and soot across the area .
Low brown clouds darkened the skies on what would have been a clear , sunny day .
Power lines brought down by the high winds were thought to be responsible for sparking the fires at the weekend , although fire officials blamed arsonists for some of the fiercest blazes , in Orange county , south of Los Angeles .
Local television stations turned their schedules over to cover the fires , with helicopter shots showing lines of fire snaking across the canyons that reach inland from the Pacific Ocean .
The flames stretched from the Mexican border to Santa Barbara county , almost 200 miles to the north .
Some 16,200 hectares ( 40,000 acres ) had been burned by yesterday morning , forcing the evacuation of thousands of residents and the closure of schools in several areas .
In Malibu , where 1,500 residents were evacuated , a church was destroyed by fire - as was a mock turreted "" Scottish "" castle , an ornate local landmark that was on the market for $ 17 m ( £ 8.3 m ) .
The building 's owner , Lilly Lawrence , the daughter of a former Iranian oil minister , took mementoes , including Elvis Presley 's army fatigues , to safety .
"" My parents taught me not to allow my possessions to possess me , "" she told local TV . ""
So , that 's the story .
The house is a house . ""
News pictures showed some of the rich and famous of Malibu , including the film producer Jeffrey Katzenberg , dousing their homes with fire retardant .
The fierce winds , which calmed overnight on Sunday but picked up yesterday morning , carried burning embers across the Pacific Coast highway towards the exclusive beachfront properties .
"" We 're at the mercy of the wind , "" Malibu 's mayor , Pamela Conley Ulich , told reporters on Sunday night .
Firefighters yesterday estimated that the blaze was only 10 % contained .
The brush fires , fuelled by the Santa Ana desert winds , are an annual event in southern California .
The Santa Anas carry warm air from the desert to the coast , drying out the land as they pass and spreading the fires .
Despite recent rains , southern California , like all the western US , is experiencing a severe drought .
"" This was a conflagration that we knew was coming at some point , "" the Los Angeles county supervisor , Zev Yaroslavsky , told reporters ."
"President George Bush today took a helicopter tour over the smouldering devastation of California 's brush fires , promising government aid to those who lost their homes and livelihoods to the flames .
Air Force One touched down at San Diego airport at mid - morning local time , and Mr Bush was soon airborne once again , touring the southern part of the state with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger .
The pair later visited affected neighbourhoods around San Diego .
Hours earlier , on a rain - drenched morning in Washington , Mr Bush had told reporters his heart went out to the people of southern California , where hundreds of homes and hundreds of thousands of acres of land have been destroyed by the brush fires .
"" I fully understand that the people have got a lot of anguish in their hearts , and they just need to know a lot of folks care about them , "" he said .
"" I will assure the people of California that the federal government will be deploying resources , assets , and manpower necessary to help fight these fires . ""
Mr Bush 's show of concern for those whose lives have been disrupted by the fires - which include several A - list celebrities as well as ordinary folk - was intended to banish the reputation of an uncaring White House because of its slow response to Hurricane Katrina two years ago .
Today 's visit had been carefully choreographed with Mr Schwarzenegger to ensure that Mr Bush conveyed an impression of concern - without being accused of hindering the relief effort with a presidential visit .
"" There will be help for the people of California , "" Mr Bush said today .
The administration declared the fires a major disaster on Wednesday , which allows federal relief agencies to funnel more assistance to the recovery effort by state and local governments .
However , Mr Bush faced accusations of trying to score political points from the misery of others .
"" We 'll be polite but frankly that 's not a solution , "" California 's Democratic lieutenant governor , John Garamendi , said on the eve of the presidential visit .
"" How about sending the national guard back from Iraq ? ""
Mr Bush 's visit began on a day when there had been a flicker of optimism that falling temperatures and dying winds would aid the struggle to control the flames .
However , the pilot of the press plane accompanying Air Force One reported seeing a pall as far away as Arizona , and the San Diego airport smelled of smoke .
Two more people were confirmed dead today after their charred bodies were discovered in their home in Poway , north of San Diego .
More than a dozen fires were still burning as the day began , and in San Diego County barely 40 % of the flames were under control , five days after the first fires were ignited .
The fires have also disrupted the lives of those ordinarily insulated from natural disaster by their wealth and connections .
Many Hollywood celebrities maintain second homes in the Malibu area .
Others frequent its sushi bars and even rehab clinics - such as Promises , where Britney Spears and Lindsey Lohan were treated - which was evacuated .
Olivia Newton - John , who starred opposite John Travolta in the film , Grease , was among the first to be evacuated at the weekend as hotels in beach front towns filled up with well - heeled refugees from the flames .
Cher and Mel Gibson also had to flee to safety .
Several of the evacuees have moved into the notorious celebrity hangout , Chateau Marmont .
For those unable to shell out for such exclusive refuges , the billionaire producer , David Geffen , today invited firefighters and voluteer workers to stay for free in his recently renovated Malibu hotel ."
"The US president , George Bush , today arrived in southern California to see the devastation caused by the wildfires that have forced 1 million people to flee their homes .
Mr Bush is taking a helicopter tour of the affected areas , in which 15 major wildfires continue to blaze , with the California governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger .
The president , who is due to meet residents and firefighters , is hoping to erase memories of his response to Hurricane Katrina , which devastated New Orleans in 2005 .
"" It 's a sad situation out there in Southern California , "" Mr Bush said before leaving Washington .
"" I fully understand that the people have got a lot of anguish in their hearts .
They just need to know a lot of folks care about them . ""
The president 's visit comes as gentler winds and lower temperatures have helped firefighters make progress in controlling the biggest fires in the state 's history .
The record high temperatures of recent days began succumbing to cooling sea breezes , and two fires that burnt 21 homes in northern Los Angeles County were fully contained .
The hot Santa Ana winds of up to 100 mph , which have caused the flames to rage , were expected to all but disappear today .
Earlier , rescue workers found the bodies of two people believed to have been killed in the wildfires .
Sheriff Bill Kolender said recovery crews had discovered the bodies in a gutted home north of San Diego .
Medical examiners were attempting to establish their identities .
The fires had already claimed the life of 52-year - old Thomas Varshock .
The San Diego medical examiner 's office listed five other deaths as being connected to the blazes , because all were evacuees .
By last night , firefighters had fully contained the three major fires in Los Angeles County , with several smaller fires north of San Diego largely under control .
Blazes continued to burn in Orange and San Diego counties .
One of the most destructive fires , which has destroyed hundreds of homes in the , San Bernardino mountains , was repeatedly doused with water from helicopters and planes .
Some residents have been allowed to return to their homes to assess the impact of the fires .
The cost of property damage has reached at least $ 1bn ( £ 488,000 ) in San Diego County alone .
Part of the US marines ' base at Camp Pendleton , south of Los Angeles , was evacuated after a fire broke out , and the motorway connecting Los Angeles and San Diego was closed for some time yesterday .
One fire in the area briefly threatened the San Onofre nuclear plant , prompting a request from Mr Schwarzenegger for air tankers to douse the flames .
The causes of many fires remained under investigation .
A fire of 30 square miles near Los Angeles , which destroyed nine homes , was believed to have been caused by arson .
A 48-year - old man was arrested on suspicion of arson when civilians helping to put out fires in an area of brush saw him acting suspiciously and reported him to police .
A helicopter followed him to his house , where he was detained yesterday .
Authorities have reported that several of the fires in the region , including two in San Diego , were the result of arson .
Police in San Bernardino said they had shot a suspected arsonist dead on Tuesday night after officers approached him .
He was shot after he reversed into a police car following a chase .
Many have seen the response of the White House and the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( Fema ) to the fires as their first big test since Katrina in 2005 .
Diane Feinstein , the California senator , told the Senate yesterday : "" We are going to learn whether Fema actually learned from the hurricane in New Orleans ; a test of whether Fema has gotten its act together post - Katrina .
Fema must act quickly and urgently get help to California . ""
In Orange County and the San Diego area , where up to 500,000 people have been evacuated , there were claims that firefighters had insufficient resources .
Many residents said they had been evacuated while their homes were left undefended against the flames .
Mark Jackson , who lost his home in Modjeska Canyon , told local television : "" When I left , it was fully engulfed and there was n't a fireman in sight . ""
Chip Prather , the chief of the Orange County fire authority , said firefighting efforts had been hampered by a lack of air support .
"" If we had more air resources , we would have been able to control this fire , "" he said .
"" Instead we 've been stuck in this initial attack mode on the ground where we hopscotch through neighbourhoods as best we can trying to control things . ""
However , Mr Schwarzenegger - who spent Monday and Tuesday visiting fire scenes - denied there were insufficient resources .
"" The fact is that we could have all the planes in the world here - we have 90 aircraft here and six that we got especially from the federal government - and they ca n't fly because of the wind situation , "" he told local television ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger poses at the Cannes premiere of the 1977 documentary Pumping Iron .

In the past politicians have claimed that they did not enjoy it , or that they did not inhale , but Arnold Schwarzenegger has gone one step further and sparked controversy by denying that cannabis is even a drug .
In an interview with Piers Morgan for the men 's magazine GQ , the Californian governor claimed that he had never taken drugs .
When Morgan reminded him of a spliff he was filmed enjoying in the 1977 documentary Pumping Iron , Schwarzenegger replied : "" That is not a drug .
It 's a leaf . ""
He added : "" My drug was pumping iron , trust me . ""
The former bodybuilder and Hollywood star has been frank about his use of the disputed leaf in the past .
In 2002 before running for governor he said of the documentary scene : "" I did smoke a joint and I did inhale .
The bottom line is that 's what it was in the 70s , that 's what I did .
I have never touched it since .
"" Laws on cannabis were liberalised in Britain in 2004 and , despite a fall in use among young people , Gordon Brown has ordered a review to consider restoring its class B status .
What do you think to Arnie 's reclassification of the substance ?"
"The governor of California , Arnold Schwarzenegger , was joking when he said marijuana was "" not a drug "" , his spokesman said today .
The former Hollywood star told the British edition of GQ magazine that he had not taken drugs , even though he has acknowledged using marijuana in the 70s and was shown smoking a joint in the 1977 documentary Pumping Iron . ""
That is not a drug .
It 's a leaf , "" Mr Schwarzenegger said .
"" My drug was pumping iron , trust me . ""
Aaron McLear , Mr Schwarzenegger 's press secretary , said the governor had made the comments in a lighthearted context .
"" The governor was doing an interview with the host of America 's Got Talent [ Piers Morgan ] , the newest version of the gong show , "" Mr McLear said .
"" I think it 's important to keep that quote in the context of the environment where it was said .
"" Of course the governor understands marijuana is a drug .
It 's like when he goes on Leno or the Daily Show - if you took something like that out of context , it might seem shocking but it was in a silly entertainment context . ""
In the interview , Mr Schwarzenegger refused to condemn politicians who decline to answer questions about drug use .
"" What would you rather have ?
A politician taking stuff and not saying , but making the best decisions and improving things ?
Or a politician who names all the drugs he or she has taken but makes lousy decisions for the country ?
"" he was quoted as saying .
"" A politician 's job is to do what 's best for the people and to improve the country , the economy , the environment .
Why should I care if a politician takes sleeping pills every night so long as he can do his job ? ""
Mr Schwarzenegger also described the former prime minister Tony Blair as one of the greatest leaders in history ."
"The occupant of the Oval Office may be reluctant to put America 's name to the Kyoto Protocol on global warming , but towns and cities throughout the world 's only superpower are undercutting the White House by signing up anyway .
Frustrated by George Bush 's inaction , politicians at a local level are circumventing Washington by pledging that their communities will cut greenhouse gas emissions .
California was the first state to go it alone when its governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , signed a law in September last year committing the state to a 25 % drop in harmful emissions by 2020 .
Eight states along America 's north - eastern corridor from Maryland through New York to Maine have come together to develop a cap - and - trade system .
On a city - by - city level , nearly 700 American mayors - including the leaders of big cities such as New York , Miami and Atlanta - have put their names to a climate protection pact pledging to cut their towns ' contribution to global warming .
Douglas Palmer , the mayor of New Jersey 's state capital , Trenton , told the Guardian : "" We recognise we have a responsibility - and there are things that we can do about this right now . ""
Palmer is president of the US Conference of Mayors and is a leading figure in the Mayors ' Climate Protection Centre , which coordinates environmental best practice between cities .
Members have pledged to strive for a reduction of 7 % in greenhouse gases from 1990 levels by the year 2012 .
It is tempting to see such local gestures as purely symbolic - in just the same way that headline - grabbing British councils declared themselves to be "" nuclear - free zones "" in the 1980s .
But Palmer insists the program is backed by real action .
He reels off a list of categories of action under local control - energy efficiency in public buildings , renewable power , improved public transport , cleaner municipal vehicles and sensible land planning . ""
This issue will go beyond any one of our terms in office , "" says Palmer .
"" This is laying the foundation for future generations in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reducing our addiction to oil . ""
Spreading like wild fire
A sense of political urgency has rippled across America , originating on the west coast , where climate change is already beginning to show its teeth .
A report by California 's Environmental Protection Agency predicting that without action , the climate could become unbearably hot in areas that already swelter in the summer .
Los Angeles , for example , presently has 20 days a year with temperatures of more than 90 degrees - but this could rise to 120 by the end of the century , the agency predicts .
Despite his personal fondness for driving military - style Hummers , governor Schwarzenegger made the environment a key plank of his political platform .
He has become something of a posterboy for green action by pushing for a law requiring cars sold in California to adhere to strict standards on emissions .
This has won him enemies as well as friends - in America 's motoring heartland of Michigan , his efforts have provoked indignation .
Critics complain that Schwarzenegger 's regulations are the last thing needed by America 's struggling "" big three "" motor manufacturers - General Motors , Ford and Chrysler - which are shedding thousands of jobs due to fierce Asian competition .
Joe Knollenberg , a Republican congressman from the suburbs of Detroit , erected a billboard in his district characterising Schwarzenegger 's position as "" Arnold to Michigan : drop dead ! ""
The sheer size of California , however , gives the state sufficient leverage to throw its weight around .
Judi Greenwald , director of innovative solutions at the Pew Centre on Global Climate Change , said California 's emissions exceed those of many European countries .
"" If one state takes action , other states start to take action , "" she says .
"" This tends to be the way America is - we use states as , essentially , policy laboratories . ""
To the north of California , a parallel movement was prompted by similar concern for the local climate in America 's pacific north - west .
In Seattle , mayor Greg Nickels became increasingly alarmed three years ago at shrinkage in the seasonal snowpack that covers mountains around the city 's hinterland .
Run - off from the snow is crucial to drinking water supplies and to power generation - but in early 2005 , the weather was so warm and dry that Washington state 's ski season flopped , with a 74 % collapse in visitors .
When Kyoto was supposed to go into effect on February 16 , 2005 , mayor Nickels decided to act by challenging his counterparts around the country to meet the "" spirit and the letter "" of the Kyoto treaty - with or without support from Washington .
Mayors go it alone Initially , traditionally liberal cities such as San Francisco and Portland , Oregon , joined the cause .
But the movement has snowballed and by October this year , membership extended to 691 mayors representing a quarter of America 's population .
Glen Brand of the Sierra Club , a nationwide environmental pressure group , says : "" While politicians in [ Washington ] DC , the White House in particular , are yet to respond to strong public views on global warming , mayors are hearing their constituents ' calls for action . ""
At a micro level , measures can be relatively easy to achieve .
Local governments can replace lightbulbs in roadsigns and municipal buildings with energy - efficient light sources .
In Denver , the city authority calculated that replacing traffic lights with LEDs was not only sustainable but cost - effective , saving $ 218,000 annually .
New buildings can be constructed to higher standards of insulation , with improved heating and cooling systems .
Research by the Sierra Club found that a Pittsburgh development , the David Lawrence convention centre , achieved $ 500,000 in annual savings from energy efficiency .
"" Mayors are in a position to do something about this , "" says Brand , pointing to Chicago , where the municipal authority has built up a fleet of 113 hybrid vehicles .
Hoping to capitalise on the sympathetic leadership of the Democrats in Congress , mayors have asked for a $ 6bn grant to pay for energy and environmental measures - including local promotion of wind energy , mass transit and tree plantings .
To make a bigger dent in emissions , however , politicians accept that they need to go beyond the "" greening "" of public services by persuading their constituents to change their behaviour .
In Trenton , mayor Palmer says : "" The biggest thing for us to do is to begin educating the public about how important this is - by linking it to how it can directly affect you . ""
He continues : "" It relates to you because if you 've got a car , you 're spending enormous sums at the pump .
If you 've got a house , you 're spending enormous amounts on heating , air - conditioning and electric bills . ""
Palmer adds that the issue runs hand in hand with progressive social politics - because people in the lowest income brackets of communities tend to suffer more from asthma and respiratory disease aggravated by pollution emitted from petrol - fuelled vehicles .
As yet , the consensus is far from universal .
A map drawn up by the Sierra Club identifying "" cool cities "" with programs to cut greenhouse gas emissions has hundreds of flags on the west coast and dense clusters on the east coast - but there are far fewer in the Midwest and the industrial "" rust belt "" of the north .
In West Virginia , where the local economy is highly dependent on coal , only five mayors have signed up to the pledge to cut emissions .
Advocates of local action see hope in the fact that the White House has markedly softened its position on global warming - this year , for the first time , President Bush mentioned the issue in his state of the union address , although he still vehemently opposes any compulsory cap on emissions , arguing that technological innovation is a better path to combating the problem .
Palmer sees signs of hope in the bottom - up political pressure that has built on global warming .
"" I 'm optimistic because of how far we 've come over the last two or three years on this issue and , frankly , how far we 've come in the last year alone , "" he says .
"" We have to continue to show Washington how important this is to grassroots communities . """
"Last Sunday , in Orange County 's John Wayne Airport , I was sandwiched between a rack of untouched LA Galaxy jerseys and a host of Arnold Schwarzenegger - inspired "" The Governator "" merchandise , reading The Guide to Psycho Fan Behaviour .
When I 'd initially picked it up , I 'd hoped to marvel at techniques used to get around guard dogs or to break restraining orders .
Instead , I learned how to get my placard read on TV during half - time at an American football game .
The ESPN - published handbook outlined all kinds of silly behaviour which , upon further reflection , was n't too far off the culture I 've been watching for almost a decade : the games industry .
In a book dedicated to psycho game fans , there 'd be centrefolds of game conference attendees gurning at real - life Lara Crofts rather than big - bellied , beer - guzzling good ol' boys manhandling the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders .
The ABC of Body Paint section would be replaced by a series of Cosplay Tips for games conventions and fan fairs : "" Attaching Pointy Ears "" for role players ; "" Making a Replica BFG "" for first person shooter fans .
There 'd be a full - colour gallery of tattoos , but rather than emblems of sporting glory , they 'd celebrate interactive iconography , including a dedicated section for Half - Life psychos who seem particularly keen to put inked needle to skin .
And instead of the How to Tear Down a Goal Post chapter , I 'd include a list of famous hacks , from the classic "" Aleks Is Cool "" script on the Sinclair Spectrum to the coding breakthrough that made 2006 's Grand Theft Auto Hot Coffee scandal possible .
There 'd be a glossary of trash - talking terms and exercises inviting readers to imagine situations in which they might use the phrases .
And for the games geek with romantic intentions , The Half - time Marriage Proposal would be replaced with a series of suggestions for gaming - related overtures across the lifetime of the relationship .
When to introduce the hobby ( not too early or you might scare him / her off ) , how to pop the question ( perhaps you could send a note to your loved one during a game of Animal Crossing ? ) , planning the big day ( would you like your cake to represent a game console , a game character or a game scene ? ) and entertainment on the night
( multiplayer arcade games go down well , or you might want to get in touch with one of several bands offering game - related tunes ) to baby names .
Yes , baby names .
If sports fans can get a dedicated 250-page book celebrating the extremes of their culture , computer gamers should too .
I 'm currently seeking a publisher with a penchant for the freakish .
If all goes well , it should be in gamers ' stockings in time for the release of the PS4 ."
"The cultish world of bodybuilding has produced only one star , yet it might not have had Arnold Schwarzenegger had he never laid eyes on Reg Park , who has died aged 79 .
Park 's imperious physique ignited Schwarzenegger 's boundless ambition and ushered in a new age of muscle .
"" When he hit the lat spread , "" said Arnold , "" it was like someone had closed the curtains . ""
Park 's subsequent film career as the rugged hero of five sword - and - sandal sagas offered Arnie further inspiration , and his family gave the future governor a model of what he wanted his own family to be .
Park 's life , though , was more than just a paradigm for Schwarzenegger .
He was born Roy Park in Leeds , the son of a gym proprietor whose first name he came to be known by , and , in his teens , was a precocious athlete .
At 16 , he ran the 100-yard dash in 10.3 seconds , recorded a long jump of 21 ft 10 in and was selected for Leeds United 's reserve team .
A wrenched knee changed the course of his life .
In hospital he picked up a copy of Health and Strength magazine and saw a picture of Vic Nicolette becoming Mr New York City . ""
All at once I knew this was how I wanted to look . ""
Park worked as a physical education instructor in Singapore during national service , but made it back to London just in time to catch the 1948 Mr Universe contest .
On the small stage before him were the two dominant physiques of the day , both American : the squat , dense bulk of John Grimek and the classical , free - flowing lines of Steve Reeves .
Over the next decade , Park would build a body that combined their qualities .
He did so in conditions that would be anathema to modern strength athletes , struggling for nutrition in a country with ration books .
Yet so rare were his genetics that he stacked on 20 lb of muscle in a month and became Mr Britain in 1949 .
Reeves beat him to the 1950 Mr Universe title , but Reg broke the American monopoly the following year , and won again as a professional in 1958 and 1965 .
A shade over 6 ft tall , he packed 250lbs of beef on his frame .
He could bench press 500 lb and squat over 600 ; power was the bedrock of his physique .
The deep , grainy muscle that glowed with hardness under the bright stage lights came only with shifting huge weight .
In America , Park won the approval of Joe Weider , the self - appointed "" father of bodybuilding "" and became a staple of Weider 's many magazines .
From their pages , the young Schwarzenegger clipped Reg 's pictures for his bedroom wall , pictures that had his domineering father sneering : "" Are you a queer ? ""
Schwarzenegger came to the UK to seek Park out , and the baby - faced giant caused a sensation at the 1966 Mr Universe , finishing second before an audience that included J Paul Getty and Jimmy Savile .
He and Park met a few days later , and Arnold began to copy the fluid posing routines that Reg had developed with his wife Mareon , a former ballet dancer .
Arnie even cribbed his dramatic stage music , from the film Exodus , and made it his own .
Schwarzenegger would become the first giant of the anabolic era , when nutrition combined with steroids to build progressively freakier physiques .
By that time , Reg had made the five movies ( 1961 - 65 ) that suggested there was a market for muscle beyond the contest stage .
All were Italian epics , four featured Hercules and in one , Hercules at the Centre of the Earth , 1961 , he co - starred with Christopher Lee .
Park also appeared , joshing with Schwarzenegger , in Pumping Iron , the 1977 documentary that gave the sport its fleeting glimpse of a golden era .
Reg and Mareon opened a chain of gyms in South Africa , where Reg was still training clients into his seventies .
In February 2007 , at the Arnold Classic , Schwarzenegger 's own annual contest , he appeared on stage for the final time .
Handed a lifetime achievement award by his protege , Reg 's acceptance speech was a masterpiece of brevity : "" This is not a talk show , it is a see show , so I 'll let you get on with the show . ""
Arnold , as ever , was more loquacious : "" I would n't be here today if this man had n't inspired me the way he did . ""
Park leaves Mareon , his wife of 55 years , a son Jon Jon and daughter Jeunesse .

"Republican frontrunner John McCain snagged his second high - profile endorsement in 24 hours when it emerged during last night 's presidential debate that California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger will come out for the Arizona senator .
The news came shortly after former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani announced that he was ending his campaign and would support McCain on the campaign trail .
Schwarzenegger is expected to announce his support for McCain following a joint appearance by the two in Los Angeles later today .
The debate , the final Republican face - off before Super Tuesday next week , saw the two leading candidates , McCain and former Massachusetts senator Mitt Romney , sparring over the economy , their respective records , the war in Iraq and who could claim to be the most conservative .
The liveliest exchanges came towards the end of the debate when attention turned to Iraq and the allegation by McCain that Romney had expressed support for a timetable for the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq .
Talking across each other as CNN anchor Anderson Cooper tried to intervene , the two candidates gave expression to the tight race that awaits in next week 's primaries .
At one point Romney interrupted McCain to chide him with the words : "" How is it that you 're the expert on what my position is ?
"" Why do you insist on not using the actual quote ?
If this was a question it could have been raised in April or May.
"" McCain responded with an added barb : "" I raised the question many times , "" he said , "" of whether you have the experience to lead this country and I will continue to raise it . ""
Romney 's charge that McCain 's attacks were "" Washington - style old politics "" also met a stern rebuttal from McCain , who countered that , "" Your negative ads , my friend , have set the tone for this campaign . ""
Although the exchanges did not become as heated as the sparring between the Democratic nominees in recent weeks , it served to enliven what might otherwise have been an anodyne rehearsal of policy positions .
The tiff between McCain and Romney left the other two candidates on the stage feeling distinctly left out .
Mike Huckabee , in particular , expressed his feeling of exclusion , telling moderators , "" I did n't come here to umpire a ball game between these two . ""
When talk turned to the conservative credentials of the candidates , Huckabee pitched in to point out that he could match and possibly better both McCain and Romney . ""
This is a two - man race , "" he said .
"" There 's another guy down here on the far right of the table .
You want to talk conservative credentials ?
If we 're going to talk conservatism I 'd like to be in on the discussion .
"" But that discussion too was dominated by the two leading candidates , with Romney accusing McCain of being outside the conservative mainstream . ""
He 's a good Republican , "" Romney said of McCain .
"" I would n't question those credentials at all , but there are a number of pieces of legislation where his views are outside of the mainstream ... of conservative Republican thought ...
If you get endorsed by the New York Times , you 're not a mainstream conservative . ""
McCain replied that he had also been endorsed by two newspapers in Romney 's home town "" who know you best "" .
Unlike most other Republican debates , the words Hillary Clinton were not uttered .
Instead , unsurprisingly given the venue , the candidates and their interlocutors mentioned the name of Ronald Reagan with remarkable regularity .
McCain noted several times that he was a "" foot soldier of the Reagan revolution "" , and it took Huckabee to bring the discussion down to earth .
Asked to comment on President Reagan 's appointment of abortion rights supporter Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court , Huckabee replied : "" I 'm not going to come to the Ronald Reagan library and say anything about Ronald Reagan .
I 'm not that stupid . """
"What can Arnold Schwarzenegger 's endorsement of John McCain mean ?
Is this the end of Mike Bloomberg ?
Has the campaign carelessly lost not one mayor of New York City but two - in the same day ?
Not so long ago , Arnold was jollying around with his best friend Mike B , extolling the virtues of green energy and going all gooey whenever anyone asked if the thing was , you know , serious .
But now , Mr Bipartisan ( that 's Arnie ) is off looking at something wonderful and green and going all gooey with his new best friend , John McCain .
So where does that leave Mike , Arnold ?
Did you ask yourself that , huh ?
Didya ?
Or did Mike know ?
Maybe he told you to do it .
Now there 's a theory ."
"California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger today formally endorsed John McCain for the Republican nomination for president , adding his considerable popularity to a virtual sweep of top level Republican support for the Arizona senator .
Flanked by McCain and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani , who endorsed McCain yesterday as he abandoned his own campaign for the nomination , Schwarzenegger said , "" He is a great American hero and a great leader .
That is why I am endorsing him to be the next president of the United States . ""
Schwarzengger 's endorsement was to be joined later today by the endorsement of another leading Republican , Texas governor Rick Perry .
McCain , who represents Arizona , now commands the support of all the Republican border governors ahead of Super Tuesday next week .
The support of Florida governor Charlie Crist on the eve of that state 's primary was seen as crucial to McCain 's victory .
Acknowledging the support of his old friend and ally , McCain praised Schwarzenegger as the embodiment of the American dream , calling him "" the great American success story "" . ""
He came to this country with nothing very much except for his talents , his strength and his ambition ...
He is a role model and a guide to millions of Americans and people across the world . ""
The endorsement should buoy McCain 's standing among independents and liberal Republicans in California , where the Arizona senator is ahead in the polls .
But Schwarzzengger is unpopular among conservative republicans in the state , and his endorsement could move some Republicans to other candidates .
McCain today denied that the image of the three liberal republican amigos standing together - McCain , Schwarzenegger and Giuliani - might hurt his standing among conservative Republicans , a key element of the broad coalition the Arizona senator intends to build .
McCain said his "" big tent "" would embody the principles of Abraham Lincoln , Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan .
"" I will never be anything but honoured by the presence of these two heroes , "" he said .
"" You will see a flood of endorsements from liberals and conservatives in the coming days .
I am confident that for the majority of the conservatives in my party the number one priority is the threat of extremists .
"" The three Republicans appeared together during a visit to a solar roofing company in Los Angeles , a fact that gave Schwarzenegger an opportunity to indulge his Austrian sense of humour .
Looking out at the banks of cameras and the more than 100 journalists in the warehouse on an industrial corridor near downtown LA , Schwarzenegger declared : "" This is the proof of how much excitement solar energy can create . ""
He said he had decided to support McCain after Giuliani had ended his candidacy .
Until recently , Schwarzenegger had insisted that he would not endorse any of the Republican candidates .
"" It 's all Rudy 's fault , "" he said .
Both of them [ McCain and Giuliani ] are friends of mine and this is why I did n't want to endorse .
I thought it was better to stay out of it . """

"California is a big state .
It has a population of 35 million and is more than twice the size of Great Britain .
However , when it comes to US presidential primaries it has long been a minnow or , as governor Arnold Schwarzenegger put it , "" an afterthought "" .
That changes tomorrow , when whomever wins in California , the state that awards the most delegates nationally , will likely be deemed to have gained the most "" momentum "" from Super Tuesday .
Given the fluid nature of this race , some states must be regretting moving their primaries forward into Tuesday 's log jam .
Not California .
This week , it 's the golden ring everybody wants .
And about time .
If California were a country , it would be the world 's sixth - biggest economy .
Its production of ideas and technology is a large part of what 's been keeping America afloat in recent years .
Simple democratic and economic principles mean its people deserve more electoral grunt than the corn - growers of Iowa and a few Cuban - Americans in Florida .
The race thus far has played into California 's hands , not just because of timing , but because on both sides it has become a genuine battle for delegates , and California hands out around 20 % of the total needed to win the Democratic nomination and over 15 % of those needed to win the GOP nomination .
For Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , 441 delegates out of a national total of 4,049 are available ( compared to 22 in New Hampshire ) .
Each of the state 's 53 congressional districts offers between three and six delegates , depending on how many Democrats live in that district .
What 's seldom discussed is that , put together , that equals just 221 delegates .
Where do the others come from ?
Another 129 are still doled out proportionately , among elected leaders , but 66 are superdelegates .
The Democrats ' superdelegates do n't get much air - time , but they could be crucial in this race .
They 're party leaders , politicians and activists who get to vote any which way they want .
As the Washington Post has reported : "" Of the nearly 300 superdelegates who have committed to a candidate , out of a total of 796 , Clinton leads Obama roughly by a 2-to-1 ratio , according to numerous counts .
The lead is so substantial , her campaign asserts , that even if Obama pulls ahead in pledged delegates after Feb 5 , Clinton will probably retain a modest edge in the overall delegate tally . ""
The catch is that they could change their mind at any time , but it 's worth noting all the same .
On the Republican side , 173 delegates out of 2,380 will be won in California , and unlike most of the GOP primaries on Tuesday , the winner does n't get them all .
They 're divided proportionately by district , apart from 11 who go to the statewide winner and three that are "" at large "" .
But in this case it 's three delegates per district no matter how many Republicans live there .
So there 's as much to be won in working - class Oakland as in super - rich Orange County .
Given how much is at stake , the contest for votes here , while short , has been intense .
The economy is the big issue statewide , along with anti - immigration anger in the south and anti - war anger in the north .
House foreclosures have shot up and house prices slid down .
The state is carrying a $ 14.5bn deficit , and Schwarzenegger 's new budget requires virtually every state government department to cut spending by 10 % .
Picking a winner is tough .
The positive for Obama is that independents do n't get to vote in the closed Republican primary , so they can turn out for him .
Polls suggest he 's closing on Clinton .
The positive for Clinton is that Californians are more than comfortable with women leaders - evidenced by senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer and House majority leader Nancy Pelosi - and she has strong support among Latino voters .
What 's more , Californians love Bill .
He carried the state twice and made more than 70 trips here as president .
The positives for McCain are that as an Arizonian , he has a western demeanour and is a more moderate , California - like Republican .
The positives for Romney are mostly from McCain 's negatives - those in the south concerned about immigration , the super - wealthy and the religious right have little time for McCain .
Make of that what you will , but do n't fall into the trap of judging California by its stereotypes .
Too many pundits do .
Everyone talks about "" San Francisco values "" , the left coast and Hollywood liberals , and writes it off as nothing like the rest of America .
The real America is always in the interior , they say .
The truth is much more complicated .
This is the state , remember , that launched Ronald Reagan and has twice elected Republican Schwarzenegger , however moderate he may be , as governor .
One point that often gets missed is that many of the social liberals are also economic liberals ( especially in Silicon Valley ) , so their politics ca n't be dismissed as left - wing .
The Wild West spirit still has cachet here .
In the past few days , I 've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles down the I-5 , the state 's inland freeway .
Tourists stick to the coastal road , but this is California 's working vein .
Truck after truck after truck , from Wal - Mart , Costco and Target , pumped consumer goods along the inside lanes .
Canals fed the farms and ranches in the central valley , which is ( a little known fact ) the world 's largest single food - producing region .
The flat , mostly fertile land stretches on for mile after mile , hour after hour .
This is a huge land that toils for its living , and there 's nothing liberal about it .
My wife and I had dinner in an Applebee 's restaurant in Bakersfield the other night .
Bakersfield is famed for its country music , and if I did n't know that already , the guy on the radio singing that "" the lonely bone 's connected to the drinkin ' bone "" made it purty darn clear .
It 's also one of the fastest - growing cities in the nation , with dozens of housing developments reaching out into the ranchland .
The first time I ate at an Applebee 's - one of my favourite things about America , by the way - was in Tennessee .
And this felt similar .
At the table behind us , an elderly man was talking about "" the grandchild I pray most for "" .
The women beside us were debating what they 'd seen the night before on Nancy Grace .
At the bar , the large guy in his late 20s was making fun of Barack Obama 's name .
As I listened , another large man walked in with his petite wife .
She was wearing a home - knitted jersey featuring the American flag .
I 'm not making a word of this up .
All the way along the I-5 , travel plazas have sprouted , with petrol stations , fast food joints and discount department stores all in full bloom .
As we got closer to LA , near Santa Clarita , we could n't tell the difference between the industrial parks and the prisons .
All this is to say that California is more representative of America than people give it credit for .
And if there 's doubt about how indicative it is of America today , there 's none about how representative it is of America tomorrow .
Here in California , the minorities are in the majority , and demographic trends have the rest of the country following in that direction .
So whatever the pundits say about America being found in the cornfields of the mid - west or the drawl of the south , if you want to understand where this country is going , pay close attention to the results and trends coming out of California 's primaries .
This week , California matters .

"Today 's US news will be California this , New Jersey that , with John McCain high - fiving Arnold Schwarzenegger and Hillary Clinton beseeching Alabamians to give her campaign a second look .
It 's Super Duper Tuesday , the day that 24 states ( as well as American Samoa ) head to polls and vote on their party 's candidate for November 's presidential election .
As Hillary Clinton jockeys against Barack Obama , Mitt Romney against John McCain , we thought it a good time to summarise the issue that really matters : who do American musicians endorse ?
On the Republican side ... there are not very many famous activist musicians .
Ted Nugent , he who once said "" We should Nagasaki [ Iraq ] "" has turned out in favour of conservative Mike Huckabee , while moderate John McCain will have Burt Bacharach tickling his ivories .
Libertarian long - shot Ron Paul is backed by Krist Novoselic , formerly of Nirvana .
Country - singer Pat Boone has loaned his septuagenarian twang to the campaign of Mitt Romney , who can also count on the help of fellow Mormons Donny and Marie Osmond .
Among Democrats there are several choirs to preach to .
Lefty singer - songwriters flocked to Dennis Kucinich and John Edwards , but now that those candidates have dropped out it 's unclear where Ani DiFranco , John Mellencamp and Willie Nelson will head .
The real battle is obviously between Hillary Clinton , the meticulous former First Lady , and Barack Obama , the shiny and inspirational Illinois senator .
True to form , Clinton 's got much of the establishment music biz in her corner : Madonna , Carly Simon , Tony Bennett , Jon Bon Jovi , Melissa Etheridge and Carole King have all endorsed or donated to the Clinton campaign .
Obama is meanwhile the candidate of choice for the R&amp;B and hip - hop community , counting Will Smith , Babyface , Macy Gray , Stevie Wonder , Ne - Yo and Usher among his supporters .
( See yesterday 's story on a will.i.am-led Obama video . )
But it 's not so cut and dry .
Crooner Harry Connick Jr has broken for Obama , while Janet Jackson and Quincy Jones side with Clinton .
Though Obama can count on the Grateful Dead , Clinton won the unlikely backing of one - time Bush fan 50 Cent , who told journalists that electing her "" is a way for us to have Bill Clinton be president again , and he did a great job during his term "" .
However one demographic has made its choice clear .
American indie rock is firmly in Barack Obama 's camp .
There was a time when ( pro - Clinton ) Elvis Costello could represent for the underground , but today he 's on the opposite side of the fence .
Wilco 's Jeff Tweedy , Bright Eyes ' Conor Oberst and Arcade Fire 's Win Butler have all stumped for the big O. Even Joanna Newsom , cousin to San Francisco mayor ( and Clinton supporter )
Gavin Newsom , is siding with the Illinois upstart . ""
He has a more liberal voting record , more progressive , than Kucinich even ! ""
she pronounced at a concert .
Ani DiFranco and Willie Nelson take note !
Although a Pew Research Center study last year found that celebrity endorsements have little impact on voter preferences , they remain a great vehicle for conceiving of musical collaborations .
Want to see Will Smith get jiggy with Arcade Fire ?
Your only hope is to vote Obama .
Prefer the idea of 50 Cent and Tony Bennett ?
Vote for Hillary and perhaps come November
we 'll hear a new version of Fly Me To the Moon , with added gunshots ."
"' Something remarkable is beginning to stir , something revolutionary , historic and transformative , ' Arnold Schwarzenegger told UN heads of state . '
California is mobilising technologically , financially and politically to fight global climate change . '
By 2006 , the specialist consultancy Next 10 says , California was already employing 22,000 people in clean technology and had claimed more patents than any other state in the field .
And the sector is growing fast .
Last year , by some estimates , venture capital into ' clean technology ' in California doubled to nearly $ 1.8bn ( £ 917 m ) .
Many , including Schwarzenegger , are convinced clean tech will prove the next big driver of California 's economy . '
The brightest scientists ... and smartest venture capitalists are racing to find new energy technologies and the solution to global warming , ' Schwarzenegger said . '
Do not believe doom and gloom and disaster are the only outcomes .
Humanity is smart and nature amazingly regenerative .
I believe we can renew the climate of this planet . '
William Reilly , affiliated to venture capitalists Texas Pacific Group , thinks California 's governor consistently sees climate change as an opportunity for investment , for innovation . '
He speaks of broad new horizons in solar , low - carbon fuels , and energy - saving , not of lowering thermostats , putting on sweaters or turning off lights , which would play into the negative stereotype of conservation . '
Examples of this ' can do ' outlook are easy to find .
Texas Pacific Group led the $ 45bn buyout of energy firm TXU - then axed eight planned coal - fired power stations , promising instead efficiency savings and wind farms .
Google.org , also in California , made clean tech account for two parts of its five - point plan for tackling global problems .
Last month , the German engineering firm Siemens chose California for the launch of its rebranded ' Mobility ' division , offering to solve environmental and economic problems simultaneously . '
We see a growing need for what we call complete mobility solutions , ' said division CEO , Hans - Jörg Grundmann .
The optimism could be the key to success as the world aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 60 - 80 per cent . '
If you can make this into a politics of opportunity you 're winning ; if it 's a politics of cost and burden sharing you 're not , ' said John Ashton , the UK Foreign Secretary 's climate change spokesman .
What business and politics want to know is whether clean technology really is the solution , and , if so , how nations can emulate California .
HSBC reports that globally more than $ 100bn ( £ 51bn ) was invested in clean energy last year , and firms in the field showed average returns on investments of more than 26 per cent in the first three quarters .
The Stern report of 2006 suggested global calls for low - carbon products and services would reach $ 500bn a year by the middle of this century .
Drawing the investment is a consensus on the science of global warming , with governmental pressure and consumer and business demands , finds a recent Lehman Brothers report .
Little sense of opportunity is apparent in much of the European debate on climate change , dominated by targets , limits , and rows on emissions .
A looming recession , budget deficit in California , falling R&amp;D funding in the US , and warnings of a tech ' bubble ' , do not help .
Others say techno solutions distract green policy makers from cutting emissions or rely on polluting and high - energy manufacture .
Yet consultant McKinsey estimates that clean technologies could deliver ' up to half ' the emissions cuts required .
Innovation and future technologies could deliver the other half , thinks Mindy Lubber , director of Investor Network on Climate Risk .
According to Tom Burke , founding director of sustainable development group E3 G , clean tech must take the lead : ' If you think 6.5 billion people are going to arrive at a stable planet by voting for voluntary simplicity you 're in the religion business , not the environment business . '
Pioneering spirit California 's lead in clean tech is down to several factors : Arnold Schwarzenegger 's leadership , tough carbon laws , solar tech investment , a massive reservoir of venture capital , entrepreneurial vigour , and a supportive , rich population .
This was shaped by history : the pioneers , a political system which empowers governors to go it alone , and the success of draconian energy efficiencies in response to the 1970s oil crises .
Oliver Hauck , head of Siemens ' US transport division , believes you can not discount California 's natural beauty , which sustains public support .
For the UK the most frequent call for change looks at long - term carbon limits that force firms to invest or pay for emissions , plus standards for buildings and vehicles , and support for R&amp;D. These policies need bold political leadership .
Tom Burke of E3 G says : ' If you have a clear political leader , sooner or later you 'll come across one who 's green too . '"
"Arnold Schwarzenegger will not thank me for linking him with the disgraced MP Derek Conway , but the governor of California has a relevant lesson to impart .
There was n't meant to be a gubernatorial election in California in 2003 , but the voters had decided that they did n't want the incumbent , Gray Davis , any more .
He had n't done anything criminal or contravened any ethical rules ; but he had turned out to be a governor who no longer had the support of the voters who had given him the job .
So barely a year after he 'd won a landslide victory , the Californians got rid of him and held an election which Schwarzenegger won .
Contrast this with the Derek Conway story .
Discredited over his cavalier approach to House of Commons rules , guilty of misusing his MP 's allowances to benefit members of his family , Conway 's punishment was an absurd 10-day ban from the House of Commons .
True , he announced that he would not contest Old Bexley and Sidcup at the next general election .
But that may be more than two years away .
Until then he intends staying on , and nothing , it seems , can be done to dislodge him - however strongly his constituents , including many from his own party , might wish to see the back of him .
If Conway had been convicted of a criminal offence and sentenced to 12 months in prison , he would automatically have been expelled from the House of Commons and a by - election would have followed .
But any behaviour less than criminal , however dodgy and unacceptable , leaves its perpetrator minusculely punished and safe in his seat .
In his speech to the Liberal Democrat conference on Saturday , Nick Clegg called for a "" Derek Conway clause "" under which , if an MP is suspended for serious misconduct , there would be an automatic recall ballot so that people can indicate whether they want a byelection .
Clegg has the right idea , but how would it work in practice ?
The recall process in California requires the signature of 12 % of the number of voters who took part in the previous gubernatorial elections ; that meant around 900,000 signatures in 2003 .
There is then a ballot in two parts , the first asking whether they wish to unseat their present governor ; if yes , the second part is activated , the election for a new governor .
There need be no specified event - for instance , a criminal conviction - triggering the recall process .
In Britain we would need one .
We can not leave it for a group of , say , Eurosceptics to decide to plot the mid - term downfall of their Europhilic MP .
But who would decide on Clegg 's "" serious misconduct "" criterion ?
If left to a Commons committee , members might fight shy of such a finding , out of solidarity with a colleague , or do the opposite , using a majority on the committee to try to get rid of a political opponent .
And what of public dissatisfaction over an MP 's alleged misconduct outside parliament , concerning his private life ?
Instead of making a ballot automatic , as Clegg suggests , should we leave it to the dissatisfied constituents to demand one , with a high number of signatures required , so that fanatical interest groups do n't have a dominant say ?
"" What about John Wilkes ?
"" a friend roared back at me when I presented my views to him .
Wilkes
it was who , in 1769 , won four elections to serve as MP for Middlesex , each time to find his victory denied by parliament on the grounds that he was an outlaw , or in prison .
His argument - which has become a fundamental constitutional principle - was that it was for the people , the voters , to decide whom they wanted to represent them , and not for parliament to decide otherwise .
But Wilkes did not say that voters had to put up with their MP for an entire parliamentary term , however badly he has behaved , however passionately the electorate who had voted him in wanted him out .
A way must be found to deny the Conways of our parliament the luxury of being entitled to misbehave seriously and yet keep their jobs , contrary to the wishes of the people they are supposed to serve .
Yesterday was the 30th anniversary of the death of Claude François , known as "" Cloclo "" , electrocuted by faulty wiring while changing a light bulb in his bathroom .
Hardly known in Britain , he was one of France 's most popular and idolised pop singers of the 60s and 70s .
But he did one thing of international significance .
He composed My Way ; or rather , he composed the song that was turned into My Way .
Herein lies my rant .
François wrote a sad , very French , love song called Comme d'Habitude - As Usual .
The singer tells how , every day , he 's behaving just as usual ; it becomes poignantly obvious that he 's doing so in the throes of a love that is ending .
The Canadian singer and songwriter Paul Anka hears it and writes completely new lyrics in English , with Frank Sinatra specifically in mind to sing it .
A delicate French song about love , loss and regret turns into a crass hymn to selfishness , an excuse not to care for anyone else 's feelings and a justification for bad and boorish behaviour .
The rhythm of the music , too , has changed , from sentimental to aggresive , from "" I 'm so sad "" to "" Screw you "" .
I would like to think that Cloclo was angry at the metamorphosis of his song , but I remember reading somewhere that he was not averse to the large royalty cheques that consequently flowed in ( and continue to replenish his estate ) .

"Schwarzenegger takes flight .

The green governator Arnold Schwarzenegger is attracting criticism from environmental groups for his daily commute .
In order to avoid moving from Los Angeles to Sacramento , the Californian governor has been commuting the 360 miles by private yet .
Schwarzenegger joins the ranks of other public figures whose rhetoric on climate change does n't appear to extend to their own daily life .
Prince Charles is currently touring the Bahamas on a yacht , the 11-day expedition has an estimated carbon footprint of 200 tons of CO2 , "" enough to fly the average passenger from London to New York 260 times "" .
Sienna Miller , a spokeswomen for Global Cool - who seems to be endlessly pictured sunning herself in foreign climes - famously told the Today Programme that she could n't stop flying ( work you know ) but she was willing to take fewer baths .
Celebrities everywhere seem to be willing to talk the talk but less willing to walk the walk .
What are the best examples you came come up with of green hypocrisy ?"
"Clint Eastwood is said to be planning to reprise his role as the maverick , Magnum - toting cop from Dirty Harry .
Rumours suggested that his first victim was likely to be Arnold Schwarzenegger , who last week showed a ruthless streak Eastwood 's character would be proud of when he terminated the star 's contract as a California park commissioner .
But the California governor can relax : Eastwood does not have him in his sights , using an interview today to play down the row over his firing .
The official line from the governor 's office is that Eastwood 's tenure has expired and it is time to give someone else a chance .
But environmentalists claim the real reason is because of his opposition to Schwarzenegger 's plan to push a six - lane toll road through the San Onofre state beach .
Eastwood told the Los Angeles Times that he had been a friend of Schwarzenegger before he became governor and would continue to be his friend .
"" I 'm a grown person .
I 'm not a kid , "" said Eastwood .
"" I 'm going to continue being in the movie business , same thing I 've been doing .
The parks is a voluntary job , and it 's just a job you do when they need you .
It was fun …
They make changes , and that 's their prerogative .
It 's not like I need a day job . ""
Schwarzenegger has a reputation as a champion of the environmental movement and has taken steps at state level to reduce carbon emissions .
But he is pushing through the toll road , claiming that it has to go somewhere and this is the least destructive option .
The relationship between Eastwood , 77 , and Schwarzenegger , 60 , whose best - known role as an actor is The Terminator , is based partly on their acting background but also on shared politics .
Both are Republicans .
But they are at odds over the toll road , with Eastwood having campaigned prominently against it .
Eastwood recalled that he had surfed at the beach after arriving in California as a young man in the 1950s .
Schwarzenegger 's ruthlessness extended to his own family : he dropped his wife 's brother , Bobby Shriver , who is also opposed to the toll road .
Eastwood , who had held the post since 2001 , said he had joked with Shriver about the dismissals .
"" I talked to him the day we were not reappointed , or as Donald Trump would say , ' You 're fired , ' "" Eastwood said .
"" So we laughed about it
and I said , ' Me ?
But you 're his brother - in - law ! '
And he said , ' But you 're his friend and longtime mentor ! '
""
The Los Angeles Times said Eastwood did an impression of Schwarzenegger 's Austrian accent to produce a Dirty Harry meets the Terminator effect .
Shriver joked that Schwarzenegger would have to employ a food taster when they gathered for family meals .
Eastwood was initially informed of his dismissal by the governor 's office , and when Schwarzenegger called him later , Eastwood told him not to worry .
He said it was over and he did not "" want to keep a dead horse flying "" ."

"The Californian corrections agency got a new boss this week , its fourth in five years .
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger was forced to make the appointment after the last chief jailer bowed out on health grounds , exhausted , perhaps , by overcrowding .
The agency 's $ 12bn budget will soon exceed that for higher education , but somehow the money is never enough .
Such is the misery of the cramped conditions that federal judges could soon impose early release .
But the Terminator has - at last - started to cut the prison population .
By contrast , Britain 's Labour government plans for a continuing rise .
The crisis on this side of the Atlantic is not , it is true , yet on an American scale .
With roughly half the British population , California has roughly twice the number of prisoners .
But overcrowding in England and Wales is at the point where even those inmates lucky enough not to be crammed into court cells , or doubled up in a space built for one , nonetheless feel the effect .
Managers have avoided breakouts - so far - but have maintained security only by cutting back on activities and courses that encourage the mending of criminal ways .
The past decade has seen great progress in drug treatment and assistance with resettlement - two services that can make all the difference in determining whether an inmate will reoffend .
That valuable work , however , is in jeopardy because staff are so overstretched in dealing with the immediate problem of containment .
Recidivism figures take a long time to turn round , but it hardly requires a doctorate in criminology to anticipate that the community will pay a price if it fails to rehabilitate offenders .
Inside the jails there are more immediate threats .
The independent inspector has recently warned about the spread of gangs and extreme Islamist sects .
These are complex problems at the best of times ; a system stretched beyond capacity will struggle to find solutions .
Over the past 15 years , the prison population has doubled to stand at 82,000 today .
Throughout most of that time ministers have been building jails to try to keep up .
But the new cells are always jammed before long .
The criminal justice system has filled empty cells in the same predictable way that air fills a vacuum .
Faced with the current crisis , however , the government has latched on to Patrick Carter 's proposals for an increase in capacity to 96,000 .
It is not five years since the same Patrick Carter was advising them on how to stabilise the population at 80,000 instead .
Some extra building may be inevitable , given pressures already in the pipeline .
But the plans offer bricks and mortar in place of fresh thinking .
Instead of pointing this out , the Conservative opposition insists it would build even more .
There is another way , and - frustratingly - the justice secretary , Jack Straw , seems to appreciate this .
He has appealed to magistrates to use community sentences instead of short prison spells that almost no one believes do any good .
He points out , quite reasonably , that the situation is hard to turn round , when the current rate of increase is the equivalent of each of the 350 independent magistrates courts in England and Wales sending just one extra person to prison each week .
His stance is frustrating , however , because the law gives him the power to start to turn things round .
Under 2003 legislation , he could require that short sentences be largely served out under probation in the community , a scheme known as custody
plus .
It is never been implemented , however , for no other reason than lack of probation funding .
But this is a crystal clear case of investing in probation to save on the prisons - which are always the costlier option .
In welfare - to - work , similar logic has won out : part of the benefit savings made when a claimant moves into work can now be ploughed back into employment training .
In criminal justice , however , the thinking remains rigid , imprisoned by the accounting conventions ."
"Good morning , one and all , and welcome to our live coverage of Joe Calzaghe v Bernard Hopkins .
This has the air of a major occasion .
The ringside presence of Sugar Ray Leonard , Amir Khan , Sylvester Stallone , Catherine Zeta Jones , Whitney Houston , Arnold Schwarzenegger and a host of other sporting and showbiz luminaries says as much .
More pertinent , though , is the over - riding sense that a defining moment awaits for two of modern boxing 's greats .
After 18 unbeaten years as a super - middleweight , 11 of them as world champion , this is Calzaghe 's first foray into the light - heavyweight division .
At 36 , he is seven years younger than Hopkins , and remains unbeaten after 44 fights .
But age can not wither Hopkins , whose fitness and pedigree are beyond question .
Calzaghe may start as favourite , but , lest we forget , Hopkins ' decade - long reign as world middleweight champion has been punctuated by triumphs over the likes of Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad .
It promises to be a nailbitingly close contest .
"" You 're going to see effective , punishing , precise execution in this fight , "" said Hopkins in the build - up .
"" I do n't waste anything .
I do n't flick out punches for the sake of it .
I 'm not giving you all flair .
I shower damage on my opponents physically . ""
Calzaghe , meanwhile , a fighter of greater talent and spontaneity , favours a more mobile style , preferring to work the angles and use his speed .
It should make for a fascinating contrast of styles .
Countdown to the bell Calzaghe emerges from his dressing room looking incredibly calm and relaxed .
That 's no mean feat when Tom Jones is serenading you onto the stage with the Welsh national anthem .
Ray J then sings the star spangled banner as a hooded Hopkins makes his way into the ring .
At last , the talking is over and the battle is about to commence .
Round one :
And it 's a sensational start !
After a minute or so of trading fairly innocuous blows , Hopkins follows up a left - hand jab with a thunderous right - hand shot that floors Calzaghe for only the third time in his career .
The Welshman is quickly up , but it 's a major blow for Calzaghe , who - in contrast with Hopkins - is traditionally a quick starter .
Not this time : the knockdown will translate into a 10 - 8 round for Hopkins on the judges ' scorecards .
Advantage America .
Round two : Calzaghe opens with some solid body shots , but Hopkins quickly strikes back , catching the Welshman with another good right before complaining that he has been caught by a low blow .
That was a closer round , but Hopkins probably shaded it again .
Round three :
Hopkins was hoping for a cagey fight , one in which he could use his defensive skills as the platform for accurate , economical counter - punching , and that 's pretty much what 's unfolding .
Whereas Calzaghe loves his opponents to come at him , Hopkins , ever the wily strategist , is carefully keeping his distance .
Round four :
Calzaghe is struggling to find his range , while Hopkins remains content to bide his time and accumulate points with swift , precise counter - blows .
The referee was forced to intervene midway through the round after things became a little untidy - not a good sign for Calzaghe .
Round five :
A much better round from Calzaghe , who suddenly looks busier and less cautious .
The solid right with which he caught Hopkins at the midway point was his best shot so far , and although Hopkins continues to look impenetrable in defence , that was surely the Welshman 's round .
Round six :
Calzaghe starts the round strongly but is then caught by Hopkins ' head , right under the nose of referee Joe Cortez , who takes no action whatsoever .
With his hands high and his chin low , Hopkins ' defence is formidable as the round ends with Calzaghe stumbling to the canvas .
Round seven :
Hopkins continues to dictate the tempo of the fight , but that was better from Calzaghe , who caught his opponent with a shuddering left hook .
The round ends with another clash of heads .
Round eight :
Calzaghe is struggling to get close enough to Hopkins to cause any real damage , but he worked his jab well in the early stages of the round before catching his opponent with two decent lefts .
None the less , he has been playing catch - up since the opening round , and Hopkins - who delivers a stinging body shot on the bell - is surely ahead .
Round nine : ""
Morning Les , "" says fellow insomniac Andrew Kelly .
"" That knockdown has forced Calzaghe to change his game plan and he 's being pushed into fighting Hopkins kind of fight .
"" I could n't agree more , Andrew - this is n't going as planned for Calzaghe .
Still , there are signs of Hopkins slowing here as Calzaghe forces him onto the ropes and the American resorts to holding .
Round 10 : Boos and whistles from the crowd as Calzaghe catches Hopkins with a low blow - which , it should be said , the American appears to milk for all it is worth .
Officially allowed five minutes to recover , Hopkins re - enters the fray in about two - and then returns to holding , spoiling and catching Calzaghe with his precise counters .
Round 11 :
Is Calzaghe 's extraordinary unbeaten run finally nearing an end ?
There 's no question that he has the greater zip at this stage , but Hopkins has put together the perfect fight .
I should say anti - fight , because the American has shown little inclination to go forward - and a distinct talent for slowing the pace .
As if to prove my point , Hopkins protests that he has been caught by another low blow ; no one sees it , but the enraged American briefly opens up before resuming his defensive tactics .
Round 12 : A round that started with Calzaghe 's corner imploring their man for a knockout ends with a strong flurry from the Welshman , but will it be enough ?
It 's close , but Calzaghe was put down in the first round and Hopkins never allowed him to get near enough to show his talents to their best advantage .
For me , it 's Hopkins ' fight , with the best that Calzaghe can hope for a split decision .
Verdict : Unbelievable !
Forget my pessimism , Calzaghe has indeed won by a split decision , the judges - Adalaide Byrd , Ted Gimza and Chuck Giampa - respectively scoring it : 114 - 113 Hopkins ; 115 - 112 Calzaghe ; 116 - 111 Calzaghe .
That 's a victory for Calzaghe 's positive approach , because the judges could easily have had eyes only for Hopkins ' dour accumulation of points . ""
He caught me in the first round -
I think I slipped , "" jokes Calzaghe .
"" I knew it was n't going to be pretty , but I 'm so happy right now .
It was one of the toughest fights of my life . ""
Hopkins is in less magnanimous mood , however . ""
The world knows , and the fans know - other than the Brits - that I won this fight , "" says the American .
"" I controlled the pace like a true veteran .
It was an execution of old - school technique . ""
Be that as it may , Calzaghe will probably face Ray Jones Jr in Cardiff later this year , while retirement beckons for Hopkins .
Thanks for your emails and good night ."
"He did say he would be back , but whether he can combine being the 38th governor of California and a relentless killing machine is another question .
For when three new outings of the Terminator series were promoted at Cannes this week the makers refused to say whether Arnold Schwarzenegger would feature .
Production of the next instalment in one of the most successful science fiction franchises began three weeks ago , with Christian Bale starring as John Connor in his ongoing quest to save humanity from the machines .
But are the rumours true that Schwarzenegger will return ? ""
Unfortunately we ca n't tell you , "" said the producer , Victor Kubicek .
Does that mean he could be ? ""
Sorry .
I really ca n't tell you . ""
Terminator 4 - 5 - 6 co - producer Derek Anderson added : "" At the moment we 're keeping everything under lock and key , we want the fans to be really excited and surprised . ""
So the surprise is that he will be back ?
Silence .
Kubicek and Anderson are the Halcyon Company , which has not only bought the rights to the Terminator franchise , but has secured first option on filming the still largely untapped 44 novels and 120 short stories of the science fiction writer Philip K Dick , already adapted into movies such as Blade Runner , Minority Report and Total Recall .
Kubicek was previously the youngest person to hold a seat on the US stock exchange , while Anderson 's background is advertising and marketing .
"" We were both big Terminator fans which is why we acquired the franchise .
We 're approaching it as real fans - what would make us really happy to see in the next Terminator movie , "" said Anderson .
The first movie , Terminator Salvation : The Future Begins , is due to be released this time next year , complete with online and offline games .
The budget would be around what was spent on Terminator 3 , they said , which , given it was reportedly the most expensive independently produced movie at $ 187 m , is quite a sum .
The return of Terminator carries on the Hollywood tradition of reviving successful franchises , but the producers are adamant that there is fresh life in the humans versus machines movies .
"" If you think of where Terminator 3 left off , there 's still a lot of potential story to be told , "" said Anderson .
"" Being huge fans , we wanted to know the rest of the story . ""
Anderson and Kubicek met three years ago and realised they shared a love of sci - fi and games .
Neither appears to be a stereotypical movie mogul .
"" We came from the outside in , which has allowed us to do things differently , "" said Kubicek .
Winning first option on Dick 's writing was a coup . ""
Philip 's daughters have never allowed anyone this kind of access before , "" said Kubicek .
"" Until we closed the deal we did n't realise how coveted the library was in Hollywood . ""
The early plans include two movies , a major animation and two games based on Dick 's work ."
"In 1990 , Arnold Schwarzenegger was driving in the American north - west , where he was filming Kindergarten Cop , when a convoy of 50 Humvees - the US military 's rugged , wide - bodied transport vehicles - rumbled past .
Among soldiers , the Humvee , short for High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle , was far from glamorous : it was a boxy , 1970s - era workhorse with uncomfortable seats , canvas doors , and an engine so poorly insulated that riders tended to swelter .
But Arnie was captivated .
"" I stopped my car and said , ' I 've got to have this car ' , "" he recalled , years later . ""
I saw myself driving in the mountains in this car .
I saw myself driving in the desert in this car . ""
Schwarzenegger contacted the Humvee 's manufacturer , AM General , to demand one , but the firm said no : as an army vehicle , it did n't meet regulatory standards for sale to the public . ""
I said , ' Wait a minute .
Are you telling me , the Terminator , that I ca n't have something ?
That 's impossible ' .
"" As the journalist Keith Bradsher relates in High
And Mighty , his book on the rise of the sports utility vehicle , Schwarzenegger launched a months - long campaign to pester AM General into creating a civilian version of the Humvee .
He won , and in 1992 , the Hummer H1 was born : a seven - foot - wide behemoth , capable of climbing over boulders , or fording water two feet deep - and so unashamedly militaristic that the engine start - button was originally going to be labelled "" fire "" .
( The company 's lawyers overruled that plan at the last minute . )
Schwarzenegger bought the first one that rolled off the assembly line .
But times change : Schwarzenegger is now the governor of California and , his fleet of seven Hummers notwithstanding , an unlikely hero of the fight against global warming .
The militarism that surged through US veins in 1992 - just after the Gulf war , in which Hummers played a starring role - is gone , replaced by pessimism and anger over Iraq .
And this week , faced with plummetting sales , General Motors , which has owned the Hummer name since 1998 , announced a "" strategic review "" and possible sell - off of the brand that had come to symbolise America 's love affair with the gas - guzzling mega - car .
Among campaigners who had labelled the Hummer "" the most anti - environmental vehicle in the history of the world "" , there was an air of celebration - as there also was , presumably , among those who had targeted Hummers for acts of apparently ecologically motivated vandalism . ""
Mission Accomplished ! ""
read the headline on FUH2.com , a website devoted to photographs of people giving one - fingered salutes to Hummers and their owners .
"" Let 's just say they 're not selling like they used to , "" says Neil Kopit , director of marketing at Criswell Hummer , a dealership in Maryland .
Sales of the Hummer H1 's successor , the slightly smaller H2 , were down 27 % in 2007 on the previous year , and GM , which had come to rely on its sales of what the industry terms "" large vehicles "" , has announced the closure of four SUV - manufacturing plants in the US , Canada and Mexico .
Nor is the decline confined to Hummers , or to America .
British registrations of 4x4 vehicles fell by more than 18 % last month , it was reported yesterday .
The drop is part of a Europe - wide collapse in the gas - guzzler market : as a proportion of cars sold in France and Spain in the first half of this year , SUVs fell by 50 % and 35 % respectively .
The reason , of course - as manufacturers and analysts all agree - is rising fuel prices as opposed to , say , some kind of environmental crisis of conscience among buyers .
Critics of the SUV tend to assume that those who drive them would be constitutionally incapable of such selflessness , which would be an annoyingly smug point of view if it were n't for the fact that market research conducted for the automakers themselves backs it up .
The average SUV owner , according to studies cited in Bradsher 's book , is "" apt to be self - centred and self - absorbed , with little interest in their neighbours or communities . ""
In addition , they are "" insecure and vain .
They are frequently nervous about their marriages and uncomfortable about parenthood .
They often lack confidence in their driving skills ...
they tend to like fine restaurants a lot more than off - road driving , seldom go to church , and have limited interest in doing volunteer work to help others . ""
In the case of the Hummer , the researchers reached another telling conclusion .
Hummers , the GM researchers found , "" tended to appeal to people who never performed military service , but wished they had .
"" The first Hummers sold at the rate of about 1,000 a year .
Their enormous weight and cost - five tons , and $ 140,000 (
£ 71,000)- made them a highly specialised market , and a subculture soon developed among owners .
Hummer clubs formed quickly , bringing enthusiasts together for weekend adventures in "" extreme "" landscapes , and remain active today . ""
The H1 , man , that was an off - road machine that was just unstoppable , "" says Jim Bushart , parts director at Lynch Hummer in Missouri , the world 's largest dealer in the original model .
"" The percentage of people that took an H1 and took it off - road and used it for what it was designed for was very , very high ...
I 've been in the deepest mud , on the biggest boulders ; I 've been sideways , just defying all the laws of gravity .
If you were in any other vehicle , you 'd be rolling down the mountain .
But you 're as stable as a cat in this thing . ""
As sales of other SUVs were beginning to demonstrate , however , the real money was to be made not among off - roaders but those for whom their vehicles ' mountain - clambering potential would remain just that : potential .
"" There are people who will use this vehicle to its fullest capability , "" says Kopit .
"" But then there are people for whom it 'll never even see the grass on their front yard .
They use it to buy groceries , but their personalities are bold and brash .
Not in a bad way .
They 're just larger - than - life people . ""
Accordingly , GM developed the H2 and the current flagship vehicle , the H3 - a foot narrower than the H1 , and about half as heavy - and ploughed money into developing the Hummer 's brand image .
( The H1 was discontinued in 2006 . )
The company tightly controls the layout of its dealerships , all brushed - metal and glass , as dictated by Detroit - "" every light , every type of tubing , literally everything , even the requisite big - ass fan , "" says Kopit , pointing to the ceiling .
Hummer - branded merchandise includes coats , hats , laptops and Hummer fragrance for men ( "" masculine with rugged and adventurous attributes "" ) .
Asked what they like about the vehicles , owners are as likely to mention the feeling of security as they are to refer to mountains or deserts .
Oddly , given how relatively vulnerable soldiers are in the standard - issue unarmoured Humvee , the Hummer 's military bearing accounts for much of the sense of safety .
"" I 've always said I 'd like to drive a tank , "" one Detroit advertising executive and Hummer - owner told Bradsher .
"" There are lots of nutty people on the road , including myself - I 'm a very absent - minded driver , so safety was important to me . ""
In fact , statistics demonstrate that SUVs , including Hummers , are no more safe than other cars for those inside them ; for those hit by them , they are several times more likely to prove lethal .
The danger they pose on the roads was only one of the reasons that an anti - Hummer movement emerged , with campaigns led by the US environmental group the Sierra Club and the women 's activist organisation Code Pink .
Their main objection was the vehicle 's legendary fuel inefficiency .
The H1 and H2 are so heavy that they qualify under American law as trucks , and are therefore not required to publicise their miles - per - gallon figures , but reports suggest that it lies somewhere between 9mpg and 11mpg , barely half that of the original Model T Ford .
( The H3 gets around 18mpg . )
New fuel efficiency regulations signed into law in the US next year will make it harder for heavier vehicles to evade the rules - another motivation behind GM 's decision to review the product line .
Just as much , though , what galls the Hummer 's critics are the ironies of its appeal .
It is sold as a safe vehicle , but relatively speaking , it is dangerous ; it is sold as a vehicle for exploring the great outdoors , while contributing disproportionately to environmental damage and its purchasers believe owning it to be an expression of patriotism and support for the military , even though - as the anti - Hummer website FUH2.com argues - "" while our brothers and sisters are off in the Middle East risking their lives to secure America 's fossil fuel future , [ Hummer ] drivers are pissing away our ' spoils of victory ' during each trip to the grocery store .
"" Not all objectors have limited themselves to verbal abuse .
In Washington last year , in a neighbourhood full of Prius hybrids , 32-year - old Gareth Groves parked his new $ 38,000 Hummer on the street .
It endured withering looks from neighbours for five days until , one night , two masked men broke every window with a baseball bat , slashed each tyre with a knife , and scratched "" FOR THE ENVIRON "" on the bodywork before running out of space .
"" I 'd say one in five people who come by have that ' you got what you deserve ' look , "" a friend of Groves told a reporter .
GM has attempted to defend Hummers and has sometimes adopted a pose of defiance .
In 2006 it seemed to try , confusingly , to do both at once , with a commercial that showed a man at a supermarket checkout buying tofu and vegetables .
The man behind him is buying enormous hunks of meat ; the tofu - buying man looks embarrassed .
He rushes out to buy a Hummer H3 , driving off proudly while munching a carrot . ""
Restore the Balance , "" read the tagline .
SUV - owners are used to the suggestion that their car might be a manhood - substitute , but hearing it from the manufacturer must have come as a shock .
The latest ads , entitled Hummer Heroes , boast of how the vehicle has been used in emergency situations from hurricane Katrina to wildfires in California .
Still , there was a sense among dealers and critics in the US this week that the Hummer 's moment as an iconic vehicle had passed .
"" Fourteen years ago , we were driving Hummers in parades , and people would stand to attention and salute , "" says Bushart .
"" Now , it 's come to mean something else . ""
In 1999 and 2000 , Bradsher notes , Hummers featured in 32 films .
Now you 're as likely to see stretch
Hummers serving as limousines for bachelorette parties ; the brand is growing tacky .
Fashions come and go .
Then again , precisely because fashion is fickle , it might be premature to declare the death of the Hummer , he argues .
"" It 's possible that the next time there 's a terrorist attack , or a war that prompts Americans to rally round the flag , there 'll be a renewed burst of enthusiasm for Hummers . """
"Arnold Schwarzenegger and David Beckham are the emblems of the end of an American economic era .
Each owns at least one Hummer , the giant SUV designed around the army 's Humvee personal troop transporter .
But the Hummer has fallen out of favour and was last week put on the block by General Motors .
It is little wonder .
Who would want to buy a beast that does nine miles to the gallon and costs more than $ 100 - £ 50 at the pump is a small fortune to Americans - to fill up ?
GM also closed four SUV assembly plants as it put Hummer up for sale .
But these drastic moves by GM are more significant than they at first seem .
The desire to own big , thirsty motor vehicles with V6 and V8 engines , capable of transporting families over vast tracts of asphalt - covered prairie and mountain range , was a defining tenet of the American economic model of the past century .
Building roads and making cars to drive on them was a central plank of the New Deal , the economic plan devised by President Roosevelt to drag the country out of the Great Depression .
A network of state parkways was conceived and built in the 1930s and 1940s by Robert Moses , the father of American urbanism .
His blueprint for a society dominated by the car spread until , by the 1960s , the entire nation was covered by a web of interstate highways .
This was the American Dream .
But today , with oil above $ 130 a barrel and stories on the news every night about commuters who can not afford to commute and hauliers who can not afford to haul , the dream is over .
David Cole , director of the Centre for Automotive Research in Detroit , believes that America is on the threshold of a new technological era and in the next five to 10 years advances in bio - fuels - using material such as algae , sewage and waste - will enable Americans to drive big cars at a fraction of the environmental and economic cost .
GM has invested heavily in two companies who claim that their bio - engineering and genetic modification methods can produce alternatives to petrol costing about $ 1 a gallon .
But a bold government move may also be required .
Cole , who fears that the oil price will take a tumble , is calling it to set a $ 50 floor for the price of a barrel of crude .
If oil becomes too cheap , he believes , the impetus to invest in new technology will be lost .
It may be that Arnie and Becks will be able to keep driving their dinosaurs , but with bio - fuel in the tank instead of petrol ."
"California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger yesterday announced what he called a plan to prevent oil spills such as the one in San Francisco bay last year - but ignored a package of bills developed by bay area lawmakers after emergency public hearings .
Schwarzenegger said in a statement that his plan provides "" the tools we need to prevent another devastating oil spill of the magnitude we saw last fall "" .
California Assemblywoman Loni Hancock , a Democrat , called the plan nothing but "" window dressing "" on serious shortcomings in the state oil spill prevention and response efforts .
Last November , a Cosco Busan cargo ship struck the bay bridge , spilling 58,000 gallons of thick oil into the bay , fouling waters and killing wildlife .
The Republican governor 's plan will make changes in agencies ' administrative procedures , as well as support two bills that deal with inland oil spills and another that ensures first - responder training .
His plan also requires little funding - unlike bay area Democrats ' bills .
Hancock 's bill increases the maximum oil spill prevention and administration fund fee from five cents to eight cents on imported barrels of petroleum products to support and improve the state 's oil spill prevention and response programme .
The bill narrowly passed the state Assembly last month and moved to the state Senate .
Republican lawmakers argued that customers would end up paying more at the pump , but bill supporters said the hike was too small to be felt by consumers .
The augmentation is particularly important , Hancock said , because Schwarzenegger intends to borrow from the oil spill fund to help close a multibillion - dollar state budget gap .
Hancock said "" he left out the substantive response to the Cosco Busan oil spill and the package of legislation that was developed after hearings that actually prevent future oil spills and enable a faster and better response "" .
Schwarzenegger spokeswoman Lisa Page said the governor does not consider the matter closed . ""
He will continue working with all interested legislators on additional solutions to the problem , "" Page said .
The governor 's plan does contain one bay area lawmaker 's bill : legislation from state Senator Joe Simitian , aimed at ensuring that first responders are adequately trained for oil spills ."
"As George Bush lands in Paris this afternoon , he might be relieved that he 's not doing a goodbye tour with his old nemesis Jacques Chirac .
Instead the US president will be welcomed by his new friend "" Sarko the American "" .
The French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , happily ate burgers with Bush at his Texas ranch , wears Rayban sunglasses and NYPD T - shirts while jogging , publicly flaunts his admiration for Elvis , Tom Cruise and Arnold Schwarzenegger and has declared the US a "" moral and spiritual "" model .
Washington is styling the Paris visit as a celebration of the reconciliation between France and America after the fallout over Iraq and the stubbornness of the "" cheese - eating surrender monkeys "" .
Last night , Bush said Sarkozy was a "" friend "" and relations were "" excellent "" even if the two countries still had their differences .
But the skies are n't all blue for what the French are calling "" le bye bye de Bush "" .
Even if the French public is enjoying a surge in affection for American culture - line - dancing clubs are booming , country and western and rodeos are the new craze - on the political front , deep suspicions remain .
To America 's delight , Sarkozy has boosted troops in Afghanistan and is preparing France for a return to Nato 's integrated command .
This sparked Sarkozy 's political opponents in France to rise up against what they warn is an "" alignment "" with Washington .
Current topics of friction between Paris and Washington include Turkey 's entry to the EU - Washington supports this
but France continues to put spanners in the works - and climate change .
Another awkward point is Sarkozy 's warming of relations with Syria , which has already met a cautious reaction from the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice .
The Élysée palace announced this week that France has invited the Syrian president , Bashar al - Assad , to attend the July 14 Bastille day celebrations after a Mediterranean summit in Paris next month .
The French press and the public are largely treating Bush 's visit as an annoying irrelevance by a hugely unpopular "" yesterday 's man "" .
A recent poll showed 84 % of French people would vote for Barack Obama in the US presidential election and that France more than any other nation believe American policy will "" change for the better "" when a new president is elected in November . ""
George who ? "" asked an editorial in La Dépêche du Midi , saying France ca n't even be bothered to hate Bush any more .
This afternoon , Bush will deliver a speech to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development , commemorating the 60th anniversary of the start of the Marshall Plan , the US aid program to rebuild Europe after the second world war .
He will talk about US - European relations that have never been so good , call for unity and say : "" Dividing democracies is one of our enemies ' goals and they must not be allowed to succeed . ""
The press will no doubt focus on a private dinner at the Élysée with Laura Bush and Carla Bruni .
The US first lady , who arrived early in Paris for the Afghan donors conference , has already tucked into a three Michelin - starred meal at a top restaurant in Paris 's Bois de Boulogne .
After a meeting with Sarkozy tomorrow morning , Bush will end his French visit on a traditional sombre note for US presidents with a visit to American war cemeteries of soldiers from the two world wars ."
"Coming soon to a cinema near you : Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone on screen together for the first time .
What 's more , it 's brought to you in association with Bollywood .
The two titans of 80s action movies have famously never appeared on screen together before , but are now scheduled to appear in the Bollywood movie Kambakkht Ishq ( Incredible Love ) alongside star Akshay Kumar .
News of the casting has already been interpreted as the advent of Bollywood as a global player in the movie industry , despite the fact that Stallone and Schwarzenegger will only take cameo roles .
"" We have signed Sylvester Stallone to be a part of Kambakkht Ishq .
We have a certain vision for our production house , "" producer Sajid Nadiadwala said .
"" Since the film is based in Hollywood ...
It made perfect sense to appoint casting agents in Hollywood and cast mainstream Hollywood stars .
This film is one of our most ambitious ventures to date and we did n't want to leave any stone unturned . ""
The news comes just days after Indian company Reliance Entertainment , owned by finance magnate Anil Ambani , began negotiations to invest up to $ 600 m in Dreamworks , the studio founded by Hollywood luminaries , Steven Spielberg , Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen .
Negotiations are said to have been prompted by Dreamworks ' desire to escape from its current arrangement with Paramount Pictures but also , and more intriguingly , a feeling amongst India 's biggest investors to move beyond their domestic market .
To be produced at Universal studios and with a budget of more than £ 11 m , Kambakkht Ishq is set to be one of the most expensive Bollywood films of all time .
It follows the adventures of an Indian stuntman who moves to Hollywood and has to juggle the demands of avoiding onrushing freight trains with finding love in the Californian metropolis ."
"California has gazumped New Mexico to land the new plant that electric car company Tesla Motors will build to manufacture its upcoming zero emissions sedan , the Model S.
While the company 's much - acclaimed first car , the two - seater Roadster , is being built in the UK by Lotus – with the lithium batteries added in America , Tesla always intended to build entirely its follow - up five - seater vehicle in the US .
It looked like New Mexico would get the 400-employee plant when it came up with $ 7 m ( £ 3.51 m ) in incentives and Tesla last year announced with much fanfare it would relocate to that state .
But the California governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , trumped that on Monday with some creative financing and millions in sales tax exemptions that had the Tesla management U - turning .
Under the new deal , the San Francisco Chronicle reported , California would finance the purchase of an estimated $ 100 m worth of manufacturing equipment .
The equipment would be leased to Tesla , whose payments to the state would be used to pay it off .
The company could then buy the equipment from the state at the end of the lease term but would not have to pay sales tax on the purchase .
That would save Tesla as much as $ 9 m .
"" I myself bought one of the first Tesla cars , so for me to see this company build a plant in New Mexico drove me absolutely insane .
My administration , of course , does not like to lose , "" said Schwarzenegger , who is still awaiting delivery of his Roadster .
Lotus is building only about five a week in Norfolk but has plans to increase that number of 40 a week by the end of the year .
While that car costs more than $ 100,000 in the US , the Model S will retail initially at $ 60,000 .
The company said on Monday that it has plans on the drawing board for a $ 30,000 model .
New Mexico was understandably miffed at Tesla 's change of heart and intimated that the company 's much - publicised management problems were a factor .
Tesla 's co - founder Martin Eberhard was replaced acrimoniously as CEO last summer as manufacturing delays affected credibility . ""
This decision by Tesla is not surprising given the recent instability of its management .
Still , it is unfortunate that Tesla backed away from its commitment to the state , "" said New Mexico Economic development secretary , Fred Mondragon .
On the UK front , Tesla in late June appointed Automotive PR to handle the UK launch of the Roadster .
The car will be on view at the Salon Prive in London on Wednesday and later this month at the British International Motor Show in London and at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in Chichester .
The cars will be left - hand drives ."
"Just after Andy Murray had played his first Australian Open night match in the Rod Laver Arena last year , and pushed Rafael Nadal hard for the best part of four sets before losing in five , he vowed that within 18 months he would be able to match the Spaniard physically .
A current comparison between their respective serving arms might lead anyone to suppose that today 's Wimbledon quarter - final was still the equivalent of Arnold Schwarzenegger versus Russell Brand .
Nadal is a beast , an ogre , a phenomenon .
Rod Laver 's left forearm was twice as thick as his right , but the Spaniard 's lamp - post of a left arm would not be out of place in any body - building gym .
It looks as if he might be able to fell a Scots pine with one blow , and three and a half weeks ago on the clay of Roland Garros it reduced Roger Federer , the world No1 , to matchsticks , the Swiss managing just four games in the French Open final .
For Scots pine read Scottish Andy .
Yet this would be to ignore the huge physical strides forward that Murray has taken , particularly during the last six months when he set up Team Murray , which includes fitness coaches Matt Little and Jez Green .
Now , after hour upon hour of training in the gym and on the track , Murray has complete confidence in his ability to stay the full course of a two - week grand slam , and consequently entered this , his third Wimbledon , with the aim of going deep into this second week .
Murray believes , as he must , that he can beat Nadal in today 's quarter - final , even though the 22-year - old Mallorcan , the four times French Open champion , has lost only two of his last 23 matches on grass , both against Federer , and both in the Wimbledon final .
It is a level of success unmatched by anybody but the Swiss , and highlights the task facing Murray .
Unlike Richard Gasquet , Nadal will not choke , so Murray will have to play at the very top of his game , for everybody is agreed that Nadal 's grass - court game has risen to another level this year , with a much greater variety on the backhand and serve .
Murray knows he must serve well against Nadal .
However , the Spaniard dealt superbly with the varying serves of the towering Ivo Karlovic , Andy Roddick , and Novak Djokovic when he won his first grass - court title at Queen 's last month .
Murray has hit 55 aces to date , level with Federer , but his first - serve percentage was 50 % and below in the first two sets against Gasquet , and he can not afford to let that happen against Nadal . ""
Rafa is obviously a great player and he 's going to be one of the best players ever , that 's for sure .
It 's not really that hard to come up with a game plan against him because it 's quite obvious : do n't leave the ball in the middle of the court to his forehand .
If you do then you 're going to do a lot of running , "" said Murray .
Murray 's aim will be to keep the points short wherever possible , despite his natural inclination to extend rallies .
The two have met three times before , Nadal winning them all .
The last was this year , Nadal beating him with accustomed ease on clay .
But having pushed him in Melbourne last year , Murray also forced a first set tie - break on the Madrid indoor courts last autumn .
Few players want to trade ground - strokes with the Spaniard for obvious reasons , though Murray surprised everybody with the power of his shots in Australia , and that power has increased in direct proportion to his muscle development .
Nadal frequently piles into the pasta after a match , while Murray was whirling the chopsticks over a bowl of Japanese food after Monday night 's triumph over Gasquet . ""
Andy is a huge fan of sushi and that helps his recovery after long matches because it 's a perfect mix of protein and carbohydrates , "" said Green .
"" His diet has become more and more important , especially in increasing his body weight .
Protein bars and the odd steak have helped him put on five kilos of muscle .
Equally important is Andy 's hydration on and off the court , which takes the form of water and specially formulated sports drinks .
This helps minimise the risks of fatigue and cramp . ""
Murray can be expected to serve and volley more against Nadal than Gasquet , and keep the ball away from his forehand as much as is reasonably possible .
Many have tried and many have failed , with Federer only just clinging on in last year 's five - set Wimbledon final .
Murray knows he must be the aggressor and believes - more than at any other time - that he has the strength to impose his own game .
Should he manage it would be the equivalent of downing a tablespoon of wasabi in one go without his eyes watering .
Head - to - head Nadal leads 3 - 0 January 2007
Australian Open Nadal won 6 - 7 , 6 - 4 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 1 A near - four - hour match that has the pundits purring and Nadal extremely relieved to make it out alive .
Murray takes the first set on a tie - break after two Hawk - Eye decisions go his way and , playing his best tennis to date , storms into a 4 - 1 lead in the second .
Nadal overturns that before Murray wins the third ; then fitness tells and the Scot 's challenge falls away .
"" I 'm definitely not disappointed , "" he says .
"" I hope we can play against each other a lot . ""
October 2007
Madrid Masters Nadal won 7 - 6 , 6 - 4 Another hard - court meeting and another match in which Murray out - serves but does not outplay Nadal .
"" I learnt one or two things , "" says Murray after sending down nine aces to two ( compared to 15 to 5 in Melbourne ) but struggling to win points when the world No2 manages a return .
"" Maybe the next time I will get even closer . ""
May 2008
Hamburg Masters Nadal won 6 - 3 , 6 - 2
The next time , unfortunately for Murray , is on clay in the run - up to the French Open and he does not get closer to the undisputed world leader on the surface after pushing him in the first games of the first set .
Again he serves more aces than the Spaniard , again he is broken more often .
"" He 's a very talented player , "" says Nadal .
"" He 's very complete .
"" He 's also of age - the match takes place on Murray 's 21st birthday ."

"Arnold Schwarzenegger , California 's governor , has threatened to cut the pay of hundreds of thousands of public employees to below the state minimum wage in an attempt to balance the budget of the world 's seventh largest economy .
A substantial drop in earnings is on the cards today for 200,000 California employees should Schwarzenegger deliver on his threat to cut their wages to the federal minimum of just over $ 6 ( £ 3 ) an hour .
The move was made last week by the governor ahead of a budget impasse that has seen California 's leaders unable to agree on a formula to resolve the state 's chronic $ 15bn ( £ 7.5bn ) deficit .
In a draft executive order leaked last week Schwarzenegger instructed the administration to pay non - essential state workers the federal minimum wage - which is below California 's minimum pay - to clamp down on hiring and overtime , and to fire 21,000 part - time employees .
The governor is due to sign the order today .
His ploy to help resolve California 's annual budget impasse brought an immediate response .
The following day state employees held a protest outside the state 's seat of government in Sacramento .
Speakers denounced Schwarzenegger and fellow legislators for their intention to make some of its lowliest employees shoulder the burden .
Schwarzenegger was repeating tactics he has used most years since being elected governor in a recall vote in 2003 .
California rarely agrees a budget by the July 1 deadline .
In the past , Schwarzenegger has tried to shame legislators into compromise , to ridicule them - hence the infamous "" girlie - men "" remark - or outmanoeuvre them by going directly to the voters .
The tactics , however , have not always proved successful .
And as he repeats the trick every year , there are growing complaints that he is playing games instead of performing the hard work of negotiation .
Instead of uniting legislators across the aisles behind his political project , he has managed to unite Democrats and Republicans against him . ""
He uses gimmicks , "" said Democratic strategist Bob Mulholland .
"" The one thing Schwarzenegger ca n't do is get votes from the Republicans .
He is not up to the job .
"" Put simply , the state faces two ways of resolving the budget impasse : by raising taxes or cutting spending .
And while Schwarzenegger has hovered between the two , disillusion with his governing style among legislators in his own party means he has been unable to persuade them to help him fashion a solution ."
"The strongest earthquake to strike Southern California in more than a decade rattled windows , made buildings sway and sent people running into the streets on Tuesday .
But there were no immediate reports of serious injuries or major damage .
"" I think we were very lucky with this one , '' California 's governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said .
The moderate 5.4-magnitude quake at 11.42am local time ( 7.42pm BST ) was felt from Los Angeles to San Diego , and as far east as Las Vegas , 230 miles away .
Nearly 30 aftershocks quickly followed , the largest estimated at 3.8 .
California 's office of emergency services received scattered reports of minor damage , including broken water mains and gas lines .
"" Nothing serious enough to be an immediate threat to lives , but there is some disruption to utility service , '' spokesman Kelly Huston said .
The damage was in the greater Los Angeles area .
Minor structural damage was reported throughout Los Angeles , along with five minor injuries and people stuck in elevators .
The quake was centered 29 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles near Chino Hills , a San Bernardino County city of 80,000 built mostly in the early 1990s with the latest in earthquake - resistant technology .
Near the epicenter , all the customers of a Chino Hills Starbucks ran outside and bags of coffee beans fell off shelves , worker Jamie Saleh said .
"" It was very , very strong .
It was rolling and ... there was n't a pause , '' said Saleh , 24 .
"" It came on really strong and just kept going . ''
Buildings swayed in downtown Los Angeles for several seconds , leading to the evacuation of some offices .
"" I 'm still shaking .
My knees are wobbling .
I thought the building might collapse , '' said Rosana Martinez , 50 , who works in a fifth - floor office at the California National Bank in downtown Los Angeles .
As strong as it felt , Tuesday 's quake was far less powerful than the deadly magnitude 6.7 Northridge earthquake that topped bridges and buildings on January 17 , 1994 .
That was the last damaging temblor in Southern California , though not the biggest .
A 7.1 quake struck the desert in 1999 .
The earthquake had about 1 % of the energy of the Northridge quake , said Thomas Heaton , director of the earthquake engineering and research laboratory at the California Institute of Technology .
"" People have forgotten , I think , what earthquakes feel like , '' said Kate Hutton , a seismologist at Caltech .
""
So I think we should probably look at it as an earthquake drill ....
It 's a drill for the big one that will be coming some day . ''
Attractions at Disneyland and Disney 's California Adventure theme parks and at the Knott 's Berry Farm theme park were temporarily closed for inspections after the shaking .
The California department of transportation and California Highway Patrol were assessing freeways to check for damage .
Traffic appeared to be flowing easily , however .
The jolt caused a fire but
no injuries at a Southern California Edison electrical substation in La Habra , about 12 miles southwest of the epicenter , spokesman Paul Klein said .
Damage there and to other equipment led to some power outages in Chino Hills , Chino , Diamond Bar and Pomona , he said ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger , the governor of California , delivered on his threat to lay off thousands of state employees on Thursday when he signed an executive order in an attempt to solve the state 's budget crisis .
The move , dismissed by critics as a gesture to force legislators to reach a compromise on how to resolve the state 's $ 15bn budget deficit , left more than 10,000 part - time and temporary employees without work yesterday .
The order also reduced the pay of up to 200,000 state employees to the federal minimum wage of $ 6.55 an hour , below California 's minimum .
"" I have a responsibility to make sure that our state has enough money to pay its bills , "" the Republican governor said as he signed the order at a press conference in the state capital , Sacramento .
"" It is a terrible situation to be in .
I do n't think any governor wants to be in this situation ...
But this is really the only way out at this point . ""
Critics , including the state controller John Chiang , a Democrat , disagree .
Chiang , the state official who issues pay cheques , has said he will pay employees normally , arguing that Schwarzenegger does not have the legal authority to summarily reduce employees ' pay .
Referring to the employees as "" the innocent victims of a political struggle "" , Chiang declared : "" The state of California , the elected leadership , can not put the important public servants of California in harm 's way .
We put people first , we make sure we protect their interests , and that 's why I have to tell the governor , with all due respect , I am not going to comply with this order . ""
Unions also declared their intention to challenge the order in court .
California , one of the world 's largest economies , regularly fails to agree a budget by the annual July 1 deadline .
Officials from the governor 's office claimed the lay - offs could save the state up to $ 100 m a month , while the pay cuts would save up to $ 1.2bn a month if applied to all 200,000 eligible workers . ·
This article was amended on Tuesday August 5 2008 .
We originally said that California was the biggest state in the US .
This is incorrect ; Alaska and Texas are bigger .
This has been corrected ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger has sacked thousands of temporary California state workers and slashed the pay of full - time civil servants in a bid to halt a fiscal crisis .
California 's governor signed an executive order terminating 10,300 part - time jobs and reducing the pay of 200,000 state employees to the federal minimum wage until a state budget is approved .
He said the unprecedented action was to avoid a "" full - blown "" fiscal crisis and that he had been left with "" no easy choices "" .
"" This is not an action that I take lightly .
I understand that this will affect people at a time when they are already struggling and so I want to apologise to all the state employees for having to do that , "" he said .
Officials in California 's legislature see the governor 's decision as an attempt to expedite the approval of the state budget , which has yet to be agreed one month after the state 's fiscal year began .
This has left the state unable to pay contractors , higher education workers and legislative employees .
Schwarzenegger 's emergency measures are expected to save the state coffers £ 1bn - still a fraction of the $ 15.2bn ( £ 7.7bn ) state deficit .
The layoffs and a freeze on hiring and overtime , which took effect immediately , will save about $ 80 m .
The administration has not said which employees will be exempt .
Those in the essential services , such as public safety and emergency medical care , are expected to be spared the layoffs .
The governor 's minimum wage order , due to take effect in September , is likely to be challenged by employee unions .
The state 's comptroller , John Chiang , who has the job of issuing pay cheques , has vowed to ignore the pay cut .
If a budget is not in place by the end of August , Chiang said his office would be forced to forgo more than $ 3bn in payments to schools , rural hospitals , health clinics , nursing homes other organisations that provide state services .
Democratic and Republican assembly members remain divided over whether to plug the gap with tax increases or spending cuts ."
"If there 's one man the producers of the new Terminator film want to get on board , it 's Arnold Schwarzenegger , who starred as various incarnations of the cyborg from the future in three films between 1984 and 2003 .
Unfortunately , it appears the current California governor is not exactly playing ball : according to the LA Times , the makers of Terminator Salvation , which is being directed by McG of Charlie 's Angels fame , arranged for a private screening of early footage from the new film , which stars The Dark Knight 's Christian Bale and Spider - Man 's Bryce Dallas Howard .
And he was hardly gushing in his verdict .
"" I still do n't know how it will play out with this one , "" said Schwarzenegger .
"" They showed me some footage , but I do n't have a feel for the movie .
I did n't see enough .
I was n't sure who the Terminator was .
I do n't know if there is one or if he 's the star or the hero .
These are the things that determine the success and how strong the movie will be . ""
A separate montage of early scenes , known as a "" sizzle reel "" proved popular with fans at America 's Comic - Con convention last month , but Schwarzenegger , who was also shown it , remained equivocal .
"" I 've seen very little footage so I do n't really have a feel for it , "" he said .
"" I hope they do well , and I hope it is a huge hit .
I do hope it creates a spectacle on the screen .
That is what James Cameron created . ""
The new Terminator film is set in a post - apocalyptic 2018 , in which John Connor ( Bale ) is leading the human resistance against their machine overlords .
He must decide whether a mysterious stranger , Marcus Wright , who has lost his memory , has been sent from the future , or the past , to provide aid .
Schwarzenegger does not appear in the film , being a little busy in his current job ."
"In 1995 , Jackie Chan finally conquered Hollywood .
The Chinese star was already the world 's second most bankable movie star ( after Arnold Schwarzenegger ) but , for decades , Chan had been unable to captivate American multiplex audiences with his charms .
Then came Rumble in the Bronx - or Hung Faan Aau as it was known in Cantonese .
Admittedly , the rumble was filmed in Vancouver , but that did n't matter .
Chan became an overnight star in the US : critics compared him to Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd ; the American box office adored him - the film made over $ 9 m in its first weekend and more than $ 32 m in total .
Not bad for a Hong Kong action flick re - edited and dubbed into English for US audiences , and unprecedented for an Asian film .
The US love affair with Chinese cinema and Chinese influence began in earnest , an affair that recently reached its zenith - or nadir , depending on your taste - with Kung Fu Panda .
The first and most obvious result was that Chinese action stars like Chan , Michelle Yeoh and Jet Li could make successful second careers in Hollywood . ""
Do n't dwell on the acting , "" counselled influential Chicago Tribune critic Roger Ebert of Chan 's picture . ""
Any attempt to defend Rumble in the Bronx on rational grounds is futile .
The whole point is Jackie Chan - and , like Astaire and Rogers , he does what he does better than anybody .
There is a physical confidence , a grace , an elegance to the way he moves .
"" They never compared Jean Claude van Damme - the Muscles from Brussels - to Ginger and Fred .
Hang on
( you might well be saying ) :
surely it was the master of balletically stylised movie fisticuffs , John Woo , who brought Hong Kong martial - arts values to the US ?
It should have been , but it was n't .
Despite the great influence of Woo on western film - makers - led by Quentin Tarantino ( whose Reservoir Dogs purloins Woo 's trademark Mexican standoff , among other things ) and the Wachowski brothers ( whose 1999 blockbuster The Matrix is inconceivable without Woo - like chop - socky ) , the Hong Kong director struggled to ring - fence his cool , violent aesthetics from studio bosses when he embarked on his Hollywood career .
Woo 's first US picture , directing Van Damme in 1992 's Hard Target , was depressing for those who had been thrilled by Woo 's Hong Kong masterpieces starring Chow Yun - Fat - The Killer and Hard Boiled .
His new bosses reportedly dictated to him each scene 's body - count and the number of bullets Van Damme could use .
Later , the studio took over production of the film ( a director 's rough cut is reportedly available ) .
Even Woo 's second Hollywood film , Broken Arrow , with Christian Slater and John Travolta , was mired in studio interference .
Only with the supremely silly Face / Off and , to a lesser extent , Mission : Impossible II , did we really get some sense of what Woo could do .
He has since returned home , reportedly hurt .
By contrast , Rumble in the Bronx was not hamstrung by Hollywood .
Chan 's violence had balletic grace , the editing was breathtakingly swift .
Better yet , Chan had a likable comic personality .
He had cut his teeth working as a stuntman on Bruce Lee pictures such as Enter the Dragon and , while Lee 's films played well with western audiences , Chan was never to be a stern dispenser of pain .
He was enjoying himself too much .
How did Chan manage to break the US with Rumble in the Bronx ? ""
Two reasons , "" says Scottish - born Hollywood scriptwriter Miles Millar , who has written several US films for Chan , including Shanghai Noon and Shanghai Knights , and who also co - wrote The Mummy : Tomb of the Dragon Emperor .
"" Rumble was just a great movie that , significantly , was set not in Hong Kong but on American soil , which made it easier to market in the US .
Jackie had tried to break the US before and failed . ""
Quite so : 1980 's The Big Brawl and the 1985 picture The Protector were flops . ""
Jackie hated these films and vowed never to come back .
But he did , and he established a great career . ""
The bigger reason for Rumble 's success is that at the time , Hollywood action movies had become extremely boring and formulaic , "" says Millar .
"" It needed fresh ideas and viewers demanded fresh thrills .
"" For the next 13 years , Hollywood plundered China for fresh ideas , while not really delivering many thrills .
Some critics argue Chan 's Hollywood sojourn has seen a decline in his work .
The Rush Hour films with Chris Tucker have been derided as Lethal Weapon rip - offs , and the fight sequences dismissed as pale imitations of Chan 's former glories .
It is true that in these films Chan never had the creative freedom he had in Hong Kong .
It could be argued that Hollywood has taken the enviable purity of much Chinese cinema and diluted it in a series of martial arts - influenced comedy buddy movies .
Chan has betrayed not just himself , but his heritage .
Millar argues otherwise .
"" Jackie 's Hollywood films should be judged on the basis of what they are - which is balls - out entertainment , often with lots more laughs than you traditionally get in the Hong Kong martial - arts cinema of which , let it be said , I 'm a great admirer . ""
Millar cites the two comedies he and his co - writer Alfred Gough wrote for Chan and Owen Wilson , namely Shanghai Noon and Shanghai Knights , released in 2000 and 2003 respectively .
In Shanghai Noon ( in which Chan plays a character called Chon Wang - which sounds like John Wayne ) , Millar says he and his partner took a "" dead genre , namely the western , which apart from Clint Eastwood 's films , is a foreign language for kids now , and made it live again by giving it two new elements "" .
What were they ? ""
An interracial buddy relationship that works : Jackie is so avuncular and Owen , who 's playing a southern California surfer dude transposed to the wild west , is such a blast .
That film broke Owen and cemented Jackie as a Hollywood regular , even though it was a million miles from what Jackie had done in China .
And the second thing , obviously , is Jackie 's balletic martial - arts skills .
"" Shanghai Knights was a sequel set in Victorian London .
"" We wrote a little homage to Singin ' in the Rain .
Jackie just takes that reference and riffs with it . ""
By which Millar means that Chan holds an open umbrella à la Gene Kelly , but uses it to beat up the bad guys in elegant ways that Kelly might well have enjoyed .
In another scene , Jack the Ripper gets his arse kicked by Chan .
Thus , only a few short years after Rumble in the Bronx , the evolution of Sino - Hollywood relations was such that Chinese performers were the go - to guys when a cinematic franchise needed revivifying with fast - handed violence .
It was n't just Chan whose skills were in demand .
Michelle Yeoh helped give the kiss of life to an expiring franchise when she played Wai Lin in the 1997 Bond flick Tomorrow Never Dies , as did Jet Li with his performance in Lethal Weapon 4 ( co - written by Millar ) .
Why has Chinese cinema been so influential ?
Why , say , did n't Hollywood and US audiences become besotted with Bollywood ? ""
Good question .
I guess with Bollywood , the mix just was n't right , "" says Millar .
"" The balletic action sequences of Hong Kong could just be used more readily to retool existing Hollywood cinema . ""
Something similar , to be sure , is the case when considering the success of Japanese horror movies in the US , and the influence of Japanese yakuza film aesthetics on the likes of Tarantino and Jim Jarmusch . ""
The other factor is the great mainland - China art movie , whose saturated colours and art direction I really admire , "" says Millar .
He 's referring to Chen Kaige 's Cannes - winning Farewell My Concubine and Zhang Yimou 's Raise the Red Lantern , not to mention the director 's later , more commercially successful "" Wuxia "" films ( both chivalric and filled with martial - arts sequences ) such as Hero and House of Flying Daggers .
( Zhang , incidentally , has temporarily set aside directing to work on today 's opening ceremony for the Beijing Olympics ) .
"" Those films gave Hollywood a lesson in beautiful cinematography .
As of course did Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon . ""
That picture , made by Taiwanese director Ang Lee in 2003 , may well be the most sophisticated , artistically satisfying Chinese film to have triumphed in the US .
Certainly it was the most profitable .
Shot on a budget of $ 15 m and yet grossing more than $ 128 m in the US , this Mandarin - language Wuxia film was once described as "" Sense and Sensibility [ which Lee and Emma Thompson earlier adapted for the screen ] with added martial arts "" .
Such was the cross - fertilisation between Hollywood and Chinese cinema by this stage that the choreographer of the martial arts sequences in Crouching Tiger was Yeun Woo - Ping , who had worked on The Matrix in 1999 after being noticed by the Wachowski brothers for his work on Jet Li 's 1994 Fist of Legend and , earlier , Chan 's Snake in the Eagle 's Shadow .
Millar argues that one of the reasons The Mummy : Tomb of the Dragon Emperor was given a Chinese storyline was because of the potent influence of these beautiful Chinese films .
Was n't the decision to set the third Mummy film in medieval China just a cynical exercise to capitalise on the looming Olympics ? ""
No , it was just serendipitous .
We started work on this four years ago , but very quickly thought about using the first emperor legend and the notion that , under the Great Wall of China there was another army that had been buried - an evil one - that might come to life .
"" It may sounds like hokum , but no matter .
With the third Mummy film and with the animated picture Kung Fu Panda , Hollywood is still looking east for fresh ideas .
Millar , though , suggests Hollywood - cinema 's great sucking vampire - needs new Chinese blood to keep itself alive . ""
Jet and Jackie are both getting old , "" he says .
"" There needs to be a new generation of Chinese movie stars and some new artistic influences .
I look at some Hong Kong directors , particularly people like Stephen Chow [ director of Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle , whose latest film A Hope , aka CJ7 , is released on Friday ] and see that they have a future in the US .
Hollywood is n't done with China yet . ""
Nor , perhaps , is China done with Hollywood ."
"And here is the man himself , or at least slices of his career - long masterclass .
It stretches over four decades , from Truffaut and Buster Keaton , through Arthur Miller , James Cagney and Lotte Lenya , to Ian McKellen and Arnold Schwarzenegger ( "" I have emotions , "" the latter announces , terrifyingly ) .
There is also Terkel 's own bracingly denunciatory review of The Deer Hunter ( "" It has succeeded admirably in denigrating the American working man as well as the Vietnamese people "" ) , and a jaw - dropping scene chez Eugène Ionesco , who makes his daughter cry by criticising her interpreting skills .
As with all good interviews , you are left to make up your own mind about the subject .
So Gary Wills , in his introduction , says Terkel 's interview with Marlon Brando reveals the actor 's "" pretentiousness "" : I say fiddlesticks .
Brando already made his splendid rebuttal : "" Each of us in his own small way contributes to the aggregate pretension : national pretension .
Nobody likes to admit it .
He would much rather say : I am always right . """
".Last month on this site
we reported that Arnold Schwarzenegger was less than impressed with footage from the forthcoming McG - directed Terminator Salvation , which stars Christian Bale as the human resistance leader John Connor .
It 's always been understood that the Governator would not be appearing in the film , given his rather busy schedule running California .
Now Latino Review has shaken things up a little with this photograph and this video showing Schwarzenegger chatting to Bale on the set , and an email purporting to be from an insider on the shoot which suggests Schwarzenegger may yet make an appearance .
"" I have various contacts in Warner Bros and from what I 've been told the fans are in for a treat , "" writes the source .
"" The premise of Arnie 's involvement is to have a fully rendered digital face of Arnie replacing the recently cast Roland Kickinger ( the younger version of Arnie ) .
It seems the director McG will in no doubt try all he can to ensure the Governator has some sort of involvement and as a result Arnold was on set providing key ADR ( voiceover ) for the visual effects guys
… "" All of this may well be just hearsay , but there 's no doubt that the makers of the new film would benefit hugely from getting Schwarzenegger on board .
Whether it would make much difference is another matter .
The most recent film , 2003 's Rise of the Machines , managed to be a fairly tedious affair despite the presence of America 's favourite musclebound Austrian .
And just because Bale is currently on Hollywood 's most - wanted list following the success of The Dark Knight , does n't mean that everything he touches is going to turn to critical gold , as anyone who has seen Equilibrium or Reign of Fire will agree .
Your thoughts on this one , please ."
"California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger risked further political isolation yesterday when he announced that he would veto a budget deal reached by Republicans and Democrats in the state legislature .
The deal aimed to put an end to an 80-day impasse over the state 's $ 15.2bn ( £ 8.4bn ) budget gap .
But Schwarzenegger rejected the compromise dubbing it a "" tax increase with a smoke screen on it "" , and saying that it would push the problems into next year .
"" It kicks that can down the alley , "" Schwarzenegger told a press conference in Sacramento .
"" I say enough is enough .
Californians have been through this roller - coaster ride too many times
and so this is why , when they send me a budget , I will veto it . ""
But legislators from both parties promised to oppose a veto and immediately return the budget to the governor 's desk .
Assembly leaders professed confidence that they could muster the two - thirds majority necessary to challenge the governor .
In turn Schwarzenegger said he would respond by sending "" the hundreds of bills that sit on my desk back to legislators with my veto "" .
Senate leader Don Perata , a veteran Democrat who has been both ally and foe of Schwarzenegger , described the governor as "" a leader with no followers "" .
"" I do the best I can in the Senate to develop compromise .
It 's the art of doing what 's possible .
The governor takes a position that it 's going to be his way or no way , and he looks for somebody to blame if he does n't get his way , "" Perata said .
With Schwarzenegger recording an approval rating of just 38 % in a poll released this week he plans to reprise a tactic he used earlier in his administration by going on the road to raise popular opposition to the solution proposed by the legislators .
The governor 's staff is reported to be organising rallies for the end of the week , as well as meetings with newspaper editorial boards to push his opposition to the compromise .
Schwarzenegger had called for a 1 % sales tax increase , but legislators chose instead to propose a temporary increase in income tax coupled with earlier payments , which would boost the state 's coffers .
Income tax overpayments by individuals and businesses would subsequently be paid back .
Schwarzenegger also objected to the absence of more stringent controls on access to the state 's rainy day fund in the proposal .
"" We 've got to look forward and say , ' How do we fix this system once and for all ? ' "" he said .
"" I will not sign a ' get - out - of - town budget ' that punishes taxpayers , pushes the problem into the next year and includes fake budget reform . """
"FBI investigators are examining an email account belonging to the vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin , after hackers broke into it and posted contents on the internet .
Screenshots and photographs taken from the account — which was hosted by Yahoo — were put online yesterday after being sent to the whistleblowing website Wikileaks .
The images showed a sequence of messages between Palin — the governor of Alaska and surprise choice as Republican vice - presidential nominee — and her state government aides , as well as a draft letter to the California governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Although some of the emails — from the address gov.palin@yahoo.com
— appeared to be private , Wikileaks defended its decision by saying that Palin was violating standards on keeping public records by sending official emails through a private account . ""
Governor Palin has come under criticism for using private email accounts to conduct government business and in the process avoid transparency laws , "" the website said .
"" The list of correspondence , together with the account name , appears to reinforce the criticism . ""
The hack has been attributed to an activist group known as Anonymous , a loose grouping of internet pranksters , vigilantes and anarchists that has previously locked horns with scientologists and internet paedophiles .
Federal investigators are believed to be examining details of the hack to determine the identities of those responsible — though forensic experts have said this could take some time .
Last night the Wikileaks website appeared to have gone down , though the reason was unclear .
A spokesman for the Republican presidential campaign said the attack was invasive and unwarranted .
"" This is a shocking invasion of the governor 's privacy and a violation of law , "" said Rick Davis , the McCain - Palin campaign manager , in a statement .
"" The matter has been turned over to the appropriate authorities and we hope that anyone in possession of these emails will destroy them .
We will have no further comment . ""
The use of non - government email services to conduct official business has been strongly criticised in the past .
Official government communications are required to be preserved under federal law , but without using official communications channels , it remains unclear whether emails from private accounts are being correctly preserved .
Last year the issue came to the fore after it emerged that the Bush administration had been using private accounts to conduct White House business .
Some senior Bush advisers — including the former political strategist Karl Rove — had used private accounts , contrary to accepted practice .
Documentation lost as a result included email conversations discussing the controversial dismissal of a number of United States attorneys , which critics claim was done because they were unsympathetic to the Republican cause .
The attack by Anonymous is also reported to have stemmed from recent speculation about Palin 's decision to fire the Alaska public safety commissioner in July .
An independent investigation is under way to examine allegations that she governor sacked Walter Monegan because of his refusal to dismiss a state trooper , Mike Wooten — who was locked in a custody battle with Palin 's sister at the time .
"" Where you 've got a governor apparently using a Yahoo account for state business , that 's kind of a complete inversion of what ought to be happening in terms of public records , "" Charles Davis , executive director of the National Freedom of Information Coalition , told the Anchorage Daily News this week ."
"California legislators are to vote today on putting an end to a standoff that has left the state without a budget for nearly three months .
After 81 days of failure to reach agreement over how to address the state 's $ 15.2bn shortfall , party leaders and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger came up with an acceptable compromise after just two half - hour meetings yesterday .
The agreement builds on a deal worked out between legislators for the two main parties earlier in the week while satisfying the governor 's concern that the state 's rainy day fund be protected .
It also removes a proposal to collect taxes from residents earlier in the financial year .
The agreement allows all sides to claim a partial victory , although it dents California 's image as the face of "" post - bipartisanship "" in politics .
The game of brinksmanship saw Schwarzenegger threaten a veto earlier in the week when Democrats and Republicans first drafted a compromise solution .
That prompted a threat from Democrats that they could muster enough votes to counter his veto and return the legislation to his desk .
Schwarzenegger then threatened to veto "" hundreds "" of other bills awaiting his approval .
But with all sides aware that unseemly negotiations were damaging their credibility with voters , and Democrats mindful that they might not muster sufficient votes to counter the governor 's veto , a compromise was reached .
Instead of taking early tax payments from residents , the compromise agreement proposes increasing penalties on corporations that underpay taxes .
Other elements of the agreement retain proposals agreed on earlier in the week .
"" I do n't think anybody is celebrating , "" assembly speaker Karen Bass , a Democrat , said .
"" I do n't believe there will be a happy signing ceremony .
But everybody recognises that we need to end 80-plus days of pain in the state of California . ""
That pain was real for many as the budget impasse stopped billions of dollars in payments to schools and colleges , healthcare providers and suppliers who do business with the state .
But critics argued that the deal merely pushes the problems into the next financial year , an argument that Schwarzenegger had used against the version of the agreement reached at the beginning of the week .
"" The reality is , it does nothing for next year except it fails to bring in the real revenue we need to make progress , "" Jean Ross of the California Budget Project told the Sacramento Bee .
The roots of the impasse lay in a stark difference between Democrats , Republicans and the governor over how to address California 's structural deficit .
Democrats wanted to raise taxes on high - income earners , Schwarzenegger proposed a one - cent increase in the sales tax , while Republicans opposed any tax increases and advocated cuts in services .
Despite this week 's agreement , those differences are likely to persist into next year 's budget negotiations ."
"If one was ever in any doubt that men have rigid ideas about what types of employment they 're prepared to sully their lily - white hands for , one only has to think back to Arnold Schwarzenegger in Kindergarten Cop : a movie entirely dedicated to the premise that the job of nursery teacher was intrinsically demeaning for a red - blooded male , even if the actor playing him did resemble Stretch Armstrong nervously arriving at his first gay disco .
Almost 20 years on ,
and it 's not that guys are just as picky - they 're getting worse .
According to the General Teaching Council , there are no young ( under 25 ) males currently working in state - run nurseries .
Elsewhere in the state sector , female teachers still outnumber men three to one , and it remains rare for a man to teach in primary school .
One of the reasons given for this centres on men saying they find it hard to counter the gender stereotypes inherent in working with young children - that it has become such a female stronghold , males are put off by the thought of being perceived as ' unmanly ' , out of place , even ' suspicious ' .
Reading this , one might surmise that there is a barrier unfairly stopping men from making genuine headway in such careers .
That , in this professional area , it 's men who have become the oppressed minority - quivering in the corners on parents ' evening , holding placards reading : ' I 'm not a paedophile . '
Really ?
Or could it be that the real reason there are so few men in nursery and primary teaching , arenas where strong male role models are sorely needed , is that the money is n't great , while the work is demanding , but low - status - all hallmarks of that widespread , though still barely acknowledged , phenomenon , ' chick - work ' .
What is chick - work ?
It is many things , but basically it is any field of employment in which men do n't fancy participating , and therefore allow women to dominate .
In this way , classic chick - work would be anything low - paid , gruelling , most probably relating to cleaning , small children or ' the caring professions ' : hence the comparative rarity of ' mannies ' , male nurses , or guy - cleaners .
My brother , a male rarity , has managed state care facilities for the elderly and the homeless , and , by his account , women willing to work in this twilight sphere generally outnumber men by at least five to one .
Is n't this the real reason men shy away from teaching small children ?
That it falls into the category of jobs they do n't feel ' become ' them ?
Nothing to do with some bizarre borderline sci - fi concern about how their penis - decked persons are not welcome on Planet of the Female Nursery Teachers .
After all , since when did that ever bother them ?
One of the most screamingly funny sights of recent years has been the way men have muscled in on cooking - sorry chef - ing - since it started to look profitable and fun .
Amazing how , with a few rings of Gordon and Jamie 's cash tills , scrambling an egg went from something sissy and domestic your mum and Delia did , to an act of high - grade machismo .
What happened to worrying about looking ' unmanly ' then ?
See also the astonishing number of males prepared to wriggle their booty on The X Factor , or even enter model shows .
Just a few examples of how when men want to pursue a profession , even change its ' gender ' , as it were , they 're generally not shy about doing it .
And good luck to them , so long as they do n't try to pass off their lack of interest in areas such as nursery education with cries of sexist-'wolf ' .
In truth , men in female - dominated fields have little in common with women in male - dominated fields .
Only last week the Chartered Management Institute reported that , at the current rate , women in management positions should achieve equal pay by 2195 .
( Wow .
Only 187 years to wait - should we feel spoiled ? )
By contrast , education continues to fall over itself to attract men .
Just a wild guess ,
but I 'm thinking it was never going to take 187 years to get men paid equally in the female - dominated profession of teaching .
Indeed , maybe Kindergarten Cop said it all .
After all , it was n't the children raising objections to the new guy , or the mainly female staff , or the parents , it was Arnie 's character himself who seemed to fear that his very maleness came under threat the more he got his hands dirty with chick - work .
The only difference being that at the end of Kindergarten Cop , Arnie tearfully realised he 'd ' learned something ' .
In real life , what 's the betting he 'd have been tearing open his wage packet , and sneering : ' Is this all you dopey bitches get paid ? '
Honestly , these golf Wags really are the thin end of the wedge How adorable were the golf Wags ( Gags ? ) of Europe 's Ryder Cup players when they lined up for their group photograph in Louisville , Kentucky ?
With their outfits co - ordinated by designer Paul Costelloe , any Ferrero Rocher - style ' ambassador 's reception ' would have been proud to have them .
Still , the question has to be asked - where is it going to end ?
Now that the Wag - virus appears to be spreading across all sports , should we start looking forward to the snooker version ( Snags ? ) , or even darts ( Drags ? ) .
On second thoughts , perhaps this would n't be a good idea .
My dad once threw a mean ' arrow ' , but I 'm not sure how my mum would have felt being paraded in front of cameras as she was trying to quietly sink a few rum and blacks .
It 's like I always say : he chose to seek fame as Rutland Darts Champion , summer league , 1979 - why should she suffer ?
Still , I 'm glad to see everything returning to normal after the Olympics silliness , what with all that determination and endeavour , and mere women winning medals and everything .
This photograph of the golf Wags shows that ' the ladies ' are now back where they belong in sport - reductively defined by their men , dressed up to the nines , and only competitive about their hair and make - up .
It would seem that , in golf as in life , fairways are one thing , ' fair ' quite another .
Forget this near - death guff .
Give me a ghost , any day One hears that there is to be a ' serious ' , ' medical ' study into near - death , out - of - body experiences .
Dr Sam Parnia , leading the study at the University of Southampton , has spoken sternly of ' the need to be open - minded ' .
And , one hopes , more original ?
I think I speak for all of us when I say we 're a bit ' over ' tunnels , white lights and floating above beds .
I 've long thought it would be nice to hear something a bit different - flames , horned creatures , perhaps a peek at eternal damnation .
Everything else has been done to , well , death .
Indeed , if all we get is going to be the usual ' tunnel / white light / oxygen - starved ' guff then perhaps we should forget ' serious ' , ' medical ' studies , and just invest in some boxed sets of Ghost Whisperer Ghost
what ?
You say .
Well , everyone has a secret Sky Plus shame , and Ghost Whisperer is mine .
For the uninitiated , it depicts a busty yet ethereal psychic ( Jennifer Love Hewitt ) , who has a ' gift ' for seeing spirits .
Poor Jen , pictured below , is never believed by the living until she says something like ' He 's asking about the blue sock ' , and then the relative starts wailing : '
Oh my gahhhd , there 's no way you could have known about the blue sock . '
But this is n't all .
At the end of each episode , Jen helps the troubled spirit ' cross over ' .
At which point the spirit goes all misty eyed , and starts gasping : ' A beautiful light ... drawing me towards it . '
Then they walk off , smiling , into ' the light ' , leaving Jen splashing empathetic tears into her lovely bosom .
Moving stuff .
Granted , it 's a bit maudlin , and the Christian imagery is so unsubtle it makes CS Lewis 's Narnia resemble an atheist call to arms .
However , after a few glasses of wine , there 's a certain beauty to death , the Ghost Whisperer - way .
It makes it look benign , fun , like free entry to a top nightclub .
And what 's wrong with that ?
It seems to me that intellectuals had their chance to explain the death thing , and blew it .
All we got was Woody Allen bleating like a 13-year - old : ' We 're all going to die ! ' and making increasingly unwatchable films .
So forget Allen , ' serious ' , ' medical ' studies into near - death experiences , and all that palaver .
When we already have great shows such as Ghost Whisperer to lie to us about death , why depress ourselves with the truth ?"
"In my head Arnold Schwarzenegger speaks with a French accent .
So do Sly Stallone and Harrison Ford , and often they sound the same .
In France , most film fans never get to hear the speaking voices of Hollywood stars as dubbing is the preferred method of rendering non - French language movies releasable in the republic .
Subtitled fare is only seen in some cinemas - usually in the bigger cities - and is hardly ever shown on television , unless it 's on a speciality film cable channel .
In fact , one gets so used to Hollywood actors speaking in one 's own language that listening to the real deal can be unsettling .
The first time I watched Arnie in the original
I thought I was watching a comedy piss - take .
Was the Terminator supposed to come from a futuristic Austria ?
He sounded better in French .
The same tends to apply across the continent , certainly in Spain , Italy and Germany .
I found this out the hard way in Berlin , at the European premiere of Peter Jackson 's King Kong .
As the lights dimmed , my excitement turned to frustration as I realised the movie was dubbed in German - alas , a tongue I have n't gotten my head around .
I had assumed a concession would have been made for a European premiere .
The next three hours were spent ruing my mistake .
Of course , there are some exceptions to the rule .
In the Nordic countries , subtitled films are the norm in cinema and on TV as most locals speak perfect English .
After all , subtitling is cheaper ; dubbing is only used for children 's movies .
But in general , European film fans who want to see Al Pacino lose his rag in English rather than in German or Turkish have to resort to an illegal download , wait for the DVD ( more subtitles options than you could ever possibly need ) or ( for the truly desperate ) move to the UK .
I used to hate dubbing .
It was a crime against art , an outrage against all the actors who slaved away on set to get their performance just right .
It was particularly bad for comedies : all that rhythmic timing went down the drain the moment voices were translated .
But some translations can be great fun ( like this French clip of Four Weddings and a Funeral ) ; others are predictably awful .
Yet some of the best classic films were dubbed .
Visconti 's Il Gattopardo starred Burt Lancaster , Alain Delon and Claudia Cardinale in a mishmash of original and translated voices .
Visconti initially refused to have a "" cowboy "" play a Sicilian aristocrat , but it is now hard to see how anyone but Lancaster could have played the part – even if it meant the movie had to be dubbed .
Another great thing about dubbing is that it makes foreign - language films more accessible .
Many British cinemagoers balk at the idea of watching a film with subtitles as they associate it with difficult arthouse fare that will bore them witless - that would be adding insult to injury after coughing up an extortionate amount just for admission .
Maybe dubbing it in English would sweeten the pill .
The problem is that British audiences are not used to dubbing : terrestrial TV stations only show English - language films and the occasional subtitled movie .
A dose of dubbed Jean - Paul Belmondo might be just thing the doctor ordered ."
"Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a $ 103.4bn ( £ 55.8bn ) general - fund spending plan yesterday in his office with little fanfare , officially ending the state 's longest - ever budget delay at 85 days .
The Republican governor vetoed $ 510 m in line - item expenditures , boosting the state 's reserve but slashing social service programmes .
Schwarzenegger 's budget signature ensures the state will begin paying nursing homes , community colleges and state vendors for services .
Schwarzenegger plans to maintain his July 31 executive order terminating about 10,000 temporary and part - time state employees and eliminating overtime until at least next July 1 , according to the state 's department of finance director Mike Genest .
The state anticipates saving $ 340 m from the order .
"" It 's very important that great things were accomplished in this budget , "" Schwarzenegger said .
"" I think that we have a historic budget reform in place .
We did a $ 12.5bn rainy - day [ fund ] that we start now accumulating . ""
"" But what is wrong is to drag out the budget process for three months , "" he added .
"" And what is also wrong is to not be able to go and resolve , and solve , the most important issue , which is the structural deficit . ""
The governor 's biggest line - item veto was his elimination of the $ 150 m Senior Citizens Renters ' Tax Assistance programme , which provides cash rebates to low - income elderly residents of up to $ 347.50 each year .
He also eliminated a $ 41 m tax - related rebate program for low - income seniors who own their homes .
"" I think in particular , the vetoes of the senior tax programmes were unconscionable , because if you look at the amount , it 's in the tens of millions of dollars , "" said Assemblyman John Laird , a Santa Cruz Democrat and chairman of the assembly budget committee .
"" So seniors are going to be paying higher taxes next year , both renters and homeowners . ""
Other social service programmes took hits as well .
The California Work Opportunities and Responsibility to Kids ( CalWorks ) programme suffered $ 78 m in last - minute cuts .
The Department of Alcohol and Drug Programmes was cut by $ 27 m , including $ 3 m for drug court programmes and $ 2.3 m for pregnancy - related substance abuse treatment .
Genest said the governor sought to cut spending that was not legally protected , and that the line - item vetoes were not intended to suggest that Schwarzenegger did not value certain programmes .
Still , Genest acknowledged that Schwarzenegger did not further slash the University of California or California State university budgets even though he could have legally done so .
The finance director said the governor tried to prioritise public safety programmes ."
"Over the past five years Tesla Motors has gained some high - profile fans including George Clooney , Arnold Schwarzenegger and the founders of Google .
But the Californian company – which makes electric cars , including a £ 63,000 convertible which can reach speeds of 125 mph – yesterday admitted it was losing money and said it would be cutting jobs and scaling back expansion .
The announcement came after the company said it had failed to attract a further $ 100 m investment because of the worldwide financial crisis .
In a statement released on the Tesla website , the company said it was reshuffling its management team and making "" modest "" staff cutbacks .
Elon Musk , the South African entrepreneur who was an early investor , will take control of day - to - day operations as the company 's new chief executive .
"" We have decided that the wise course of action is to focus on our two revenue producing business lines , "" Musk said in the statement .
"" Our goal as a company is to be cashflow positive within six to nine months . ""
Richard White , a clean technology analyst at research company Library House , said : "" The investment Tesla are looking for is quite significant , and it does n't surprise me that they are finding it tough . ""
Overall , if the company survives - which it probably will , given the backers - this will slow their growth .
They will be forced to be in the black very quickly which is tough , but will make them a sustainable company .
Tough times can lead to tough companies . ""
Musk insisted that the rollout of Tesla 's flagship product , the $ 109,000 Roadster sports car , would continue — but admitted that a parallel scheme to produce a lower - cost mass market car would be affected .
Industry observers had been closely watching the development of the $ 60,000 ( £ 34,600 ) saloon , known as the Model S , but Musk admitted that production would be delayed until at least 2011 .
He also confirmed that the company planned to close its offices in Detroit — America 's car - making capital — but would continue with a scheme to open a new $ 250 m , 89-acre base at San Jose in California .
Musk said Tesla needed to adopt a "" special forces "" attitude , but would not confirm how many staff would lose their jobs — though reports that up to half of the company 's 250 staff could be axed have been denied .
It is not clear whether an operating deal with UK sport car company Lotus , which assembles the Roadster at its headquarters outside the Norfolk village of Hethel , will be affected . ""
One of the steps I will be taking is raising the performance bar to a very high level , which will result in a modest reduction in near - term headcount , "" he said .
"" I believe Tesla must adhere more closely to a special forces philosophy at this stage of its life if we aspire to become one of the great car companies of the 21st century . ""
It is only a year since the company 's last boardroom reshuffle , which brought in Ze'ev Drori as chief executive .
However Musk , a 37-year - old South African serial entrepreneur who made his fortune by selling internet payments service PayPal to eBay for $ 1.5bn , said he now had more time to spend on the company .
He even appeared to offer his personal wealth — estimated at some $ 300 m — as collateral . ""
The Tesla investors and I are unequivocally dedicated to ensuring the success of Tesla .
If you have bought a car from Tesla or are thinking of doing so , please know that I personally stand behind delivering a product that you will love . ""
"" I will do whatever is needed to ensure that Tesla has more than sufficient capital to get there . ""
Named after the father of modern electrical systems , Nikola Tesla , the company has become a poster child for the electric vehicle movement since being founded in 2003 by two engineers .
Along the way the Californian outfit has scooped awards for its high - performance electric sports car , as well as winning over both environmentalists and Silicon Valley grandees with its cutting - edge technology .
The company has already raised more than $ 100 m in funds from investors including Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin , as well as former eBay president Jeff Skoll — but so far has only delivered 27 vehicles to willing buyers .
However , despite a slow start its backers believe that Tesla has the possibility of challenging the giants of the American car industry , particularly with increasing public concern about the environmental impact of cars and sharp increases in petrol prices .
Robert Evans , chief executive of Cenex , the government - backed company that promotes the development of low - carbon vehicles , said Tesla 's difficulties could have resulted from the company overstretching itself , trying to introduce several cars at once into a market where even established players are finding life difficult at present , But he said Tesla 's problems did not set the tone for the future of electric cars . ""
The main car companies are taking electric vehicles increasingly seriously and a number of them are saying to us that they need high - fuel - efficiency , low carbon vehicles in their product range because the traditional money - earners are struggling . ""
A string of other companies , including US - based Fisker Automotive and French maker Venturi , are also building electric or hybrid vehicles .
Leading Japanese manufacturer Toyota , meanwhile , announced earlier this year that it had sold more than 1 million of its market - leading Prius hybrid cars .

"He 's been a body - builder , a movie star and leader of the most populous state in the US .
But could Arnold Schwarzenegger , now nearing the end of his days as California 's governor , be offered a place at Barack Obama 's side in Washington ?
Speculation is swirling that Schwarzenegger will be offered the role of energy czar in the incoming Obama administration .
There has been Beltway chatter about the prospect ever since he was named as a contender for the job by the authoritative politico.com website .
At first blush , this seemed an unlikely prospect .
Schwarzenegger likes to live large : he has the Hummers ( although he cut down the size of his fleet ) , the Harley Davidson that he likes to ride along the Pacific coast at weekends , the private jet he takes several times a week from his home near Los Angeles to his office almost 400 miles away in Sacramento .
And then he has the high - emission cigar habit .
And he has not been kind to Obama .
Appearing at one of John McCain 's final rallies in Ohio , he derided Obama 's "" skinny legs "" and "" scrawny arms "" , adding that the Democrat needed to put some muscle on his policy ideas .
He also dismissed Obama 's tax policies as "" Soviet spread - the - wealth policies "" .
This summer he criticised his wife Maria Shriver , a member of the Kennedy clan , for her support of the now president - elect , saying that she was "" absolutely wrong with that Obama fellow "" .
But the chatter has refused to go away .
It stems from an interview Schwarzenegger gave in July to ABC 's George Stephanopoulos .
"" I 'm always ready to help in any way I can , "" he replied when asked if he would be willing to fill the role .
"" I 've committed myself to be a public servant . ""
The speculation resurfaced this week in the Wall Street Journal in a piece by Keith Johnson , lead writer for the paper 's environment blog , who cited the California governor 's impressive record on green policy , from support for renewable energy to running one of his Hummers on biofuel .
Obama and Schwarzenegger also oppose increased offshore drilling and they share targets on reducing emissions , an area where California has led despite opposition from the Bush administration .
Back in May , Schwarzenegger even issued a press release praising Obama for introducing a national version of California 's low carbon fuel standard ."

"The news earlier this week that Sylvester Stallone is to team up with Jason Statham on a new self - penned movie titled The Expendables got me thinking about how Hollywood has become so short of bonafide action heroes these days that the likes of Sly and Bruce Willis are still sought after .
Hell , you know if Arnold Schwarzenegger was n't being tapped by Obama to solve America 's energy crisis , he 'd still be cashing $ 20 m paycheques for performances phoned in from somewhere near Alpha Centauri .
Worse still , I read that James McAvoy , an actor singularly ill - equipped for action star status ( dodgy attempt at American accent aside ) has been signed up for a second instalment of Wanted , the summer hit which was very loosely based on Mark Millar 's excellent graphic novel about a league of assassins .
And who can blame Hollywood , when , Statham aside , there is still no obvious inheritor to the last action hero mantle once worn so proudly by Schwarzenegger ?
A few years ago the likes of The Rock and Vin Diesel were being talked up .
But both seem to have graduated straight from tough guy roles to the sort of mid - period quirky comedy fare adopted by the Austrian oak in the late 80s and early 90s .
The difference is that by the time Arnie decided to send himself up with Kindergarten Cop and Junior , he had a slew of cheesy but brilliant 80s action classics under his belt , stretching all the way from 1982 's Conan the Barbarian to 1990 's Total Recall .
In short , there was actually something to send up .
By the time the artist otherwise known as Dwayne Johnson and Diesel played against type in Be Cool and The Pacifier , their best known action hits were probably XXX and The Scorpion King , neither of which comes anywhere close to the likes of , say , Predator , or Running Man for sheer bombastic musclebound insanity .
Any schoolkid ( OK , boy ) in late 80s Britain could mimic Arnie 's flat teutonic vowels , intoning the immortal line :
"" I 'll Be Back "" .
I challenge anyone to remember one single word of dialogue from any of Johnson or Diesel 's films .
Diesel seems to have belatedly recognised that sending himself up so early in his career might not have been the smartest of plans when your core audience is 14-year - old boys that have n't yet discovered the meaning of irony .
But Johnson 's next film is Tooth Fairy , in which he plays a hardnut minor league ice hockey player who commits a mean deed and is sentenced to spend one week as a real life ...
yes , you guessed it .
You can just see the bigwigs round the table planning this one : ""
Hey , I know , instead of greenlighting a sequel to Serenity , let 's put The Rock in a dress ! ""
All of this means that Statham finds himself as pretty much the only old school action star left .
To give you an idea of how bad things have become , Hollywood 's current policy seems to be to take actors who would never have considered , or been considered for , action roles and forcefeed them Weightgain 4000 until they find themselves having to buy jeans and shirts from High and Mighty .
Looking back at the early careers of Robert Downey Jr , Matt Damon and James McAvoy , one could never have imagined they would graduate to being three of the world 's most celebrated action stars .
Downey Jr , although he looks really , really weird with drum - tight pecs and that silly ' tache , I will just about accept , because Iron Man was such a yummy slice of good - hearted escapist Americana .
And Damon , despite being about as scary as an episode of Rentaghost from the neck upwards , has certainly proved himself in the Bourne franchise .
But the day I sit down , anticipating a decent blast - fest , with the obligatory six - pack of Fosters , copy of What Car and nice juicy rump steak , to watch the utterly unterrifying McAvoy blow stuff up in Wanted , is the day I smash my tattered VHS copy of Universal Soldier to smithereens .
Where 's Dolph Lundgren when you need him ?
Speaking of the Swedish karate maestro , former co - star Jean - Claude Van Damme revealed recently that he had tried and failed to get his Scandinavian pal signed on to a planned third instalment of Universal Soldier ( inexplicably , I seem to have missed the second film in the series ) .
"" I told them , guys bring in Dolph !
They said there 's no more value [ to cast him ] , "" said Van Damme , a tear , perhaps , dribbling gently down one sinewy cheek .
"" I said , ' it will have value with me ! ' ""
Quite right .
It is inconceivable that Lundgren can be out of work while McAvoy gets hardcase roles .
Does n't Hollywood realise that we do n't want real actors in our action movies ?
Give us lunk - headed martial artists and supersized bodybuilders .
Give us impenetrable , utterly incongruous continental accents .
Give us dumb catchphrases and even dumber storylines .
Do not give us Mr Tumnus the faun with a six - pack ."
"One question going around Washington is what Obama plans to do with the 10m - odd people on his list of campaign supporters and donors .
In an early indication , the Obama campaign staff said they 're going to put a plea on the campaign website , barackobama.com , asking for donations to relief efforts in California .
The announcement came today after Obama spoke with California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Los Angeles Mayor Tony Villaraigosa about the situation .
The headline of the request : "" Together We Can -- Help the victims of the southern California fires "" .
The site links to a a state office that coordinates the volunteer relief effort"
"Wildfires , fuelled by high winds and soaring temperatures , raged across southern California over the weekend causing thousands of residents - including some Hollywood stars - to flee their homes .
Less than a month after the area was swept by fires propelled by fierce Santa Ana winds , another series of blazes moved through neighbourhoods from the celebrity enclave of Montecito , outside Santa Barbara , to the suburbs of Los Angeles and south to Orange county .
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency in the region as the three main fires consumed around 29 square miles .
More than 30,000 people were evacuated from their homes as 800 homes were destroyed , including 200 in Montecito and 500 mobile homes in the Sayre fire north of Los Angeles .
Main roads were closed and more than 100,000 residents were left without power on Saturday .
In some areas people were warned to boil water amid fears that the water supply had been contaminated .
Residents remained indoors as specks of ash were blown by the winds .
Warnings over air quality were issued from the mountains to the beaches of southern California , and the Pasadena marathon , due to be held yesterday , was cancelled .
A 98-year - old man died on Friday while being evacuated in Santa Barbara but no further fatalities were reported .
Eleven people were reported injured , including six firefighters .
The fire treated the rich and famous of Montecito with the same disdain as it did the residents of mobile home parks .
Celebrities including Oprah Winfrey , Rob Lowe , John Cleese , Jeff Bridges and Christopher Lloyd all have homes in the small suburb south of Santa Barbara .
Speaking on Winfrey 's TV show on Friday , Lowe described how he had helped neighbours as he fled his own home . ""
The next door neighbour 's house , they were trapped behind their gates and could not get out , "" Lowe said .
"" Their daughter was lost on the property and so another gentleman and I pried the gates open ...
Embers were raining down .
They were in our hair , they were in our shirts .
The wind was easily 70 miles an hour and it was absolutely Armageddon .
"" Firefighters were aided by calmer winds on Sunday , and by mid - morning Montecito 's Tea fire was 75 % contained .
The hot winds had lessened from highs of 85 mph on Friday and Saturday to 30 mph on Sunday .
However new fires continued to break out to the south , with Diamond Bar , south of Los Angeles , covered in a fresh plume of smoke in the early morning .
Investigations were launched into the causes of the fires , although authorities said there was no evidence of foul play .
Five people were arrested on Saturday , two on suspicion of looting in the Sylmar area north of central Los Angeles .
Veteran firefighters said that the devastation wrought by the fires was as bad as any they had seen .
"" I 've been 31 years in the city of Los Angeles and have not seen anything like this , "" Michael Bowman , a battalion chief for the Los Angeles fire department , told the LA Times .
He described combing through the mobile home park as the fire approached , waking residents to warn them of the danger .
With three colleagues he helped a 300 lb ( 136 kg ) disabled woman trapped in her mobile home to escape . ""
Between the four of us , we were able to take the woman out of the house as fire was breaking the glass , "" Bowman said .
Schwarzenegger toured the area around Santa Barbara on Saturday , commenting : "" When you walk around the area that was destroyed , it looks like hell .
I feel awful for the people whose homes were destroyed . """
"California utilities , already struggling to meet a law requiring more renewable energy , saw the bar raised even higher yesterday .
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed an executive order calling on utilities to provide one - third of their power from renewable resources by 2020 .
"" This will be the most aggressive target in the nation , "" he said .
Increased reliance on renewable energy conceivably could hike future rates , however , because of higher production costs and the need to upgrade transmission facilities .
Schwarzenegger 's order came on the eve of today 's international summit on global climate change in Los Angeles .
California law currently requires utilities to produce 20 % of their power from renewable resources by 2010 .
It has n't been easy .
Only about 12 % of all California 's electricity last year came from wind , solar , geothermal , biomass , small hydroelectric and other renewable resources .
Schwarzenegger 's new order raises the target to 33 % by 2020 and orders state agencies to lay the groundwork through planning and permitting .
Legislation is being drafted to put the tougher standard into state law , consider penalties for noncompliance and bolster the cost competitiveness of renewable energy , gubernatorial aides said .
The incoming California senate president pro tem , Darrell Steinberg , a Democrat , predicted that the incoming legislature will pass such legislation within 90 days after returning in January .
"" When we meet these standards , we will not only be creating our own energy independence , we will also be providing the pathway to high - wage jobs and economic growth for California , "" Steinberg said .
The push toward renewable energy is part of a much larger strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to lessen the state 's dependence on imported fossil fuels .
Schwarzenegger also signed a separate agreement yesterday in which the California energy commission and the department of fish and game will work jointly to cut in half the time spent processing applications for renewable energy projects .
Schwarzenegger said his goal is to expedite the permitting process while maintaining key environmental protections ."
"This morning Barack Obama delivered a video - taped address to the Bi - Partisan Governors Global Climate Summit in Los Angeles .
The message reiterates the environmental policy ideas he outlined during the campaign , and repeats his "" one president at a time "" theme .
Attending the two - day event , which is hosted by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , are Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich , Florida 's Charlie Crist , Jim Doyle of Wisconsin , Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas and "" representatives of approximately 22 other states ; government officials from Australia , Brazil , Canada , Chile , China , India , Indonesia , Mexico , Poland , the UK and others .
"" The summit is intended to make some headway on climate issues before the UN conference in Poland next month .
Script after the jump ...
Let me begin by thanking the bipartisan group of U.S. governors who convened this meeting .
Few challenges facing America – and the world – are more urgent than combating climate change .
The science is beyond dispute and the facts are clear .
Sea levels are rising .
Coastlines are shrinking .
We 've seen record drought , spreading famine , and storms that are growing stronger with each passing hurricane season .
Climate change and our dependence on foreign oil , if left unaddressed , will continue to weaken our economy and threaten our national security .
I know many of you are working to confront this challenge .
In particular , I want to commend Governor Sebelius , Governor Doyle , Governor Crist , Governor Blagojevich and your host , Governor Schwarzenegger –all of you have shown true leadership in the fight to combat global warming .
And we 've also seen a number of businesses doing their part by investing in clean energy technologies .
But too often , Washington has failed to show the same kind of leadership .
That will change when I take office .
My presidency will mark a new chapter in America 's leadership on climate change that will strengthen our security and create millions of new jobs in the process .
That will start with a federal cap and trade system .
We will establish strong annual targets that set us on a course to reduce emissions to their 1990 levels by 2020 and reduce them an additional 80 % by 2050 .
Further , we will invest $ 15 billion each year to catalyze private sector efforts to build a clean energy future .
We will invest in solar power , wind power , and next generation biofuels .
We will tap nuclear power , while making sure it 's safe .
And we will develop clean coal technologies .
This investment will not only help us reduce our dependence on foreign oil , making the United States more secure .
And it will not only help us bring about a clean energy future , saving our planet .
It will also help us transform our industries and steer our country out of this economic crisis by generating five million new green jobs that pay well and ca n't be outsourced .
But the truth is , the United States can not meet this challenge alone .
Solving this problem will require all of us working together .
I understand that your meeting is being attended by government officials from over a dozen countries , including the UK , Canada and Mexico , Brazil and Chile , Poland and Australia , India and Indonesia .
And I look forward to working with all nations to meet this challenge in the coming years .
Let me also say a special word to the delegates from around the world who will gather at Poland next month : your work is vital to the planet .
While I wo n't be President at the time of your meeting and while the United States has only one President at a time , I 've asked Members of Congress who are attending the conference as observers to report back to me on what they learn there .
And once I take office , you can be sure that the United States will once again engage vigorously in these negotiations , and help lead the world toward a new era of global cooperation on climate change .
Now is the time to confront this challenge once and for all .
Delay is no longer an option .
Denial is no longer an acceptable response .
The stakes are too high .
The consequences , too serious .
Stopping climate change wo n't be easy .
It wo n't happen overnight .
But I promise you this : When I am President , any governor who 's willing to promote clean energy will have a partner in the White House .
Any company that 's willing to invest in clean energy will have an ally in Washington .
And any nation that 's willing to join the cause of combating climate change will have an ally in the United States of America .
Thank you ."
"Barack Obama yesterday renewed his promise to make a decisive break with George Bush on the environment , using a summit convened by Arnold Schwarzenegger to promise a "" new chapter in America 's leadership on climate change "" .
The video appearance by Obama confirmed the Californian governor 's role as a global leader on climate change , a position shored up only hours earlier when Schwarzenegger set a bold new target for his state to get a third of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020 .
In his address , the president - elect accused Bush of failing to show leadership on the issue of climate change .
"" That will change when I take office , "" said Obama .
He went on to lay out an ambitious agenda , beginning with targets aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 .
Obama also reiterated a campaign pledge to invest $ 15bn ( £ 10bn ) a year in clean technology - including clean coal and nuclear power . ""
This investment will not only help us reduce our dependence on foreign oil , making the United States more secure .
And it will not only help us bring about a clean energy future , saving our planet .
It will also help us transform our industries and steer our country out of this economic crisis by generating 5 m new green jobs that pay well and ca n't be outsourced . ""
Obama added : "" Now is the time to confront this challenge once and for all .
Delay is no longer an option .
Denial is no longer an acceptable response .
The stakes are too high .
The consequences too serious . ""
Schwarzenegger 's targets for electricity generation as well as Obama 's appearance at the conference confirmed the governor 's leadership in efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions at a time when there has been a vacuum at federal level .
In his remarks to the conference yesterday , Schwarzenegger said Obama 's election means that he would now be "" in synch "" with the new administration in taking action to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions .
"" Five years ago when we talked about yes we can protect the environment and we can protect the economy on the same time , there were a lot of doubters , "" he said .
"" We have also faced obstacles on the federal level with the federal government . ""
But he added : "" Our revolution now does have soldiers and it is spreading around the globe . ""
He said the conference was intended to advance negotiations on a sequel to the Kyoto protocols in Poland in two weeks , and in Copenhagen next year .
Yesterday 's summit comes at a pivotal time amid expectation of a dramatic shift in US environmental policy once Obama is in the White House .
As Obama noted in the video address , he will not attend the meeting in Poland but had asked members of Congress who will be there to report back to him . ""
Once I take office , you can be sure that the United States will once again engage vigorously in these negotiations , and help lead the world towards a new era of global cooperation on climate change , "" he said .
"" When I am president , any governor who 's willing to promote clean energy will have a partner in the White House .
Any company that 's willing to invest in clean energy will have an ally in Washington .

Schwarzenegger 's meeting brought together European , Indian and Chinese officials , oil firm executives and environmentalists , along with a handful of Schwarzenegger 's fellow governors from Florida , Illinois , Kansas and Wisconsin .
Representatives from Michigan , Colorado , Utah and Washington state were also on hand .
The summit was said to be carbon - neutral , with emissions associated with the conference offset by giving money to global environmental causes .
And there were other eco - touches , with room keys , name badges , lunch boxes and coffee cups made from recycled material ."

On Monday , Schwarzenegger signed an executive order committing California to produce one - third of its electricity from renewable sources .
"" I am proposing we set the most aggressive target in the nation for renewable energy , "" he told reporters .
The state legislature still must pass the goal into law .
Even before Monday 's order , California was already committed to producing 20 % of its power from wind and solar power by 2010 . ""
Today is all about changing our goals and raising the bar , "" Schwarzenegger said .
The summit in Los Angeles comes at a crucial time , ahead of the United Nations climate change talks in Poland next month and amid expectation of a dramatic shift in US environmental policy once Obama is in the White House .
As Obama said in the video address , he will not attend the meeting in Poland but had asked members of Congress to report back to him . ""

Schwarzenegger 's meeting brought together European , Indian and Chinese officials , oil company executives and environmentalists along with a handful of Schwarzenegger 's fellow governors .
Schwarzenegger invited his 49 fellow governors to the summit , but only four — from Florida , Illinois , Kansas and Wisconsin — were expected to make an appearance .
Representatives from Michigan , Colorado , Utah and Washington state were also on hand .
Although California is unable to sign international treaties on climate change , Schwarzenegger has built a reputation because of his efforts to cut emissions in California and abroad .
He set up a cap - and - trade emissions market between western US states and Canadian provinces .
The governor is expected to follow up on those efforts at the summit with a declaration in which participating leaders will pledge to work together to reduce emissions .
"" This declaration will help advance efforts being undertaken by our national governments for the next global agreement on climate change , "" Schwarzenegger 's office said in a statement .
Schwarzenegger is also expected to sign agreements with Indonesia and Brazil making it easier for Californian companies to invest in reforestation projects in those countries ."
"Though it did n't seems to make an enormous splash in the press , the deal reached this week between three US states , Indonesia and Brazil seems like a fairly big deal in terms of rainforest protection .
The agreement was brokered at the climate summit convened by California 's ecosavvy governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Along with fellow governors from Illinois and Wisconsin , Schwarzenegger signed an agreement that could see carbon credits earned from forest protection in Indonesia or Brazil incorporated into US emissions trading schemes .
Partly , this is significant simply because there have n't been very many large - scale international efforts to protect the world 's dwindling rainforests – despite the huge climate change impact of tropical deforestation .
The Brits and Norway have launched a big project in the Congo basin , but there are few other examples .
( One looked promising last year when Guyana offered to hand over the protection of its forests to the British government , but that has so far come to nothing . )
Mainly , though , this deal is significant because it 's the first time – or
at least the first I 'm aware of – that carbon credits earned by protecting existing forests could be incorporated into large - scale emissions trading schemes .
It means , in the simplest possible terms , that Indonesian or Brazilian forestry schemes will be able to get funded by American companies who want to produce carbon dioxide .
This could be the first step towards forest - protection carbon credits – known as REDD ( Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation ) – becoming tradeable in forthcoming US - wide climate laws and even the follow - up to the Kyoto protocol .
It 's exactly the kind of thing envisaged in the UK government 's recent Eliasch Review .
Though everyone agrees that the world must find a way to save its rainforests , there is disagreement about whether it 's wise to combine forestry and fossil fuels in the same carbon - trading system .
Some experts are concerned that doing so could bring about a massive crash in the carbon price , while others are worried that any such scheme would provide a means for rich countries to buy their way out of climate trouble instead making cuts at home .
As Bryony Worthington of Sandbag recently pointed out to me , there 's also the fact that rainforests are due to be affected by the warming climate .
It would be ironic if a company in Europe or America could increase emissions in return for protecting a forest that may itself disappear ( thereby releasing even more emissions ) due to global warming .
Forests protection and fossil fuel emissions are n't "" fungible "" , the argument goes .
That is , they 're not interchangeable .
Those arguments aside , it 's refreshing to see the US taking rainforest protection seriously .
Something clearly needs to be done on a large - scale to protect tropical forests and even if they does n't end up in the world 's carbon trading systems , the new agreement could help develop valuable carbon accounting methodology in addition to protecting some of the world 's most precious and endangered forests .
A European - American strongman helps save a huge swath of exotic jungle .
It could almost be the plot of a Schwarzenegger movie …"
"Officials in California have unveiled ambitious plans to turn the San Francisco Bay Area into one of the leading centres of electric vehicles in the world .
If it succeeds , the strategy announced yesterday will see billions of dollars poured into a new power infrastructure that will turn the region away from fossil fuel and to renewable energy – and convince millions of people to switch to green technology .
The plan , which will see the Bay become the first region of California to switch its transport systems entirely away from traditional fuel , is being supported by local government as well as the state 's governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger .
"" California is already a world leader in fighting global warming and promoting renewable energy , "" he said in a statement .
"" This partnership is proof that by working together we can achieve our goals of creating a healthier planet while boosting our economy at the same time . ""
At least $ 1bn is expected to be spent on improving green infrastructure to make the Bay area – which encompasses more than 7.6 m people in the cities of San Francisco , Oakland and San Jose and throughout Silicon Valley - the leading centre for electric vehicles in America , and potentially around the world .
The scheme involves a number of ground - breaking proposals to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles , including speeding up the installation of electric vehicle charging outlets on streets and in homes , and offering incentives for companies to install charging stations in the workplace .
Local government will also work to harmonise standards across the region so that drivers of electric vehicles can travel the length and breadth of the Bay Area – roughly equivalent to the south - east of England – without being concerned that they can not find the right charging station .
Speaking at the launch of the scheme yesterday , leading politicians said it was time to start turning their words into real action . ""
Forty percent of our greenhouse gas emissions state - wide come from transportation , but in cities like San Francisco
it 's substantially higher , "" said Gavin Newsom , the mayor of San Francisco .
"" If we 're going to get serious about advancing our local climate action plans , we 've got to get serious about getting into the business of alternative transportation . ""
The strategy is a partnership with private businesses including Better Place , a project to introduce new standards across the automotive industry that can convince people to move away from petrol - fuelled cars and into electric vehicles powered by renewable energy .
Officials say the plans will put California on a footing with other countries leading the attempt to switch away from dependence on oil , such as Israel , Denmark and Australia . ""
What happens in San Francisco and in Oakland and in San Jose results in what happens in California - and what happens in California affects what happens in the rest of the nation , "" said Jared Blumenfeld , director of San Francisco 's department for the environment , who has helped make the city one of the greenest in the US ."

"" This partnership is proof that by working together we can achieve our goals of creating a healthier planet while boosting our economy . ""
Globally , cars generate about 20 % of the world 's output of carbon dioxide and California 's cars account for 40 % of the state 's greenhouse gas emissions .
Replacing around 1 m petrol cars with electric cars by 2015 , as is proposed under the new plans , will make a big difference .
At least $ 1bn is expected to be spent on improving green transport infrastructure to make the bay area - encompassing the cities of San Francisco , Oakland and San Jose , as well as Silicon Valley - the leading centre for electric vehicles in America , and potentially around the world .
The electric transportation company Better Place will build a network of kerbside charging points across cities in the area and create the equivalent of filling stations , where electric car owners will be able to replace their flat batteries for fully charged ones .
With a full charge on one of Better Place 's batteries , a typical car will be able to travel 100 miles , ideal for commuting around urban areas .
The local government will also work to harmonise standards across the region so that drivers of electric vehicles can travel the length and breadth of the bay area without worrying about finding the right kind of charging station .
Most users of the Better Place system would pay a monthly subscription for unlimited access to the company 's services .
Visitors with electric cars could also use the charging points for a one - off fee .
"" You can plug in any car , "" said Jason Wolf , the California business manager at Better Place .
"" In California , everyone who 's bought Teslas , everyone who has bought plug - in hybrids or electric cars that are not in tight relationship with us , will be able to plug into our network . ""
Speaking at the launch yesterday , Gavin Newsom , the mayor of San Francisco , said : "" If we 're going to get serious about advancing climate - action plans , we 've got to get serious about getting into the business of alternative transportation . ""
California , the world 's eighth largest economy , has some of the most progressive climate - change legislation .
The state aims to reduce greenhouse gas levels to 80 % below 1990 levels by 2050 .
The plans will put California on a footing with other countries leading the attempt to introduce electric cars , including Israel , Denmark and Australia .
Last month , the Britain pledged £ 100 m to speed the commercial introduction of electric and low - carbon road transport to the country .
Wolf said the first cars in the California scheme would be deployed in 2010 ."
"California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a fiscal emergency today and called lawmakers into a special session to address the state 's $ 11.2bn ( £ 7.5bn ) deficit .
The state 's revenue gap is expected to hit $ 28bn over the next 19 months without bold action .
The emergency declaration authorises the governor and lawmakers to change the existing budget within the next 45 days .
Without quick action , the state is likely to run out of cash in February .
Schwarzenegger and Democrats have proposed a combination of tax hikes and spending cuts , but Republican lawmakers are steadfast in their refusal to raise taxes .
Lawmakers failed to reach a compromise during the special session Schwarzenegger declared last month , pushing the problem to a new state legislature that was being sworn in today .
The crisis worsens each week , so the Republican governor did not want to waste any time in declaring a special session , said his spokesman , Aaron McLear .
"" It 's important that we start on day one so the new legislature can start immediately to solve our fiscal crisis , "" he said .
There appeared to be little reason to believe that Republican lawmakers would budge on their opposition to tax increase .
"" If anything , I think our resolve ( against raising taxes ) is deeper than it has ever been because of the economic realities , "" California senate minority leader Dave Cogdill said today .
Democrats do n't have the two - thirds majority in either the state 's assembly or senate that is required to pass tax increases or a state budget ."

"TV merchandising began by accident .
In 1982 , Mattel brought out a line of toys to accompany Arnold Schwarzenegger 's movie Conan the Barbarian , only to find the sex , slavery and slaughter motifs too strong for a family audience .
Desperate to flog the plastic , they created an animated TV show - He - Man and the Masters of the Universe - which ran for two 65-episode series with countless re - runs and spin - offs .
Job done .
Since then , merchandising has been at the core of children 's TV .
According to Neil Ross Russell , MD of BBC Worldwide 's children and licensing division , in some cases children 's TV shows around the world are given to broadcasters for free to allow the producers to mop up on the merchandise revenue .
"" You might even find deals where TV networks insist on a share of the merchandising money before they put a show on air , "" he says .
It is this sort of relationship that has hit Entertainment Rights , which owns kids ' favourites from Postman Pat to Basil Brush .
ER is seeking a bailout after failing to secure dwindling slots on US commercial TV .
"" Children 's TV is less lucrative in ad revenue terms than adult TV , "" explains Sean Moore of the Cambridge Strategy Centre .
"" With the networks pushing such programming on to pay TV where a host of Cartoon Network and Disney properties dominate , it 's hard to build an audience and secure shelf space in Wal - Mart . ""
So powerful is children 's TV merchandising that the BBC children 's controller , Richard Deverell , has mooted plans for a CBBC / CBeebies theme park after a fact - finding mission to Belgium , where the producer Studio 100 operates three such parks .
They attract more than 1.5 million visitors a year .
Similar schemes have been tried in the past with varying degrees of success - the Noel Edmonds - licensed Mr Blobby parks were short - lived , while Granada 's Studio Tour and Coronation Street visit proved more popular but closed when the company re - occupied the theme park 's studios .
And this winter , as the cold winds of recession blow through Shepherd 's Bush and Gray 's Inn Road , broadcasters are enviously eyeing the kids ' toys stacked under the Christmas tree - and are now starting to see TV merchandise for adults as a potential lifesaver .
As cash - strapped ITV sheds staff , it has been recruiting heavily around the merchandising arm of its newly formed commercial arm , ITV Global Entertainment .
The broadcaster hopes that by exploiting mass - appeal shows such as Coronation Street , Emmerdale , Britannia High , Hell 's Kitchen , Dancing on Ice
and I 'm a Celebrity ...
Get Me Out of Here !
it can mitigate falling ad revenues .
Last month , Global Entertainment appointed Aysha Kidwai - whose career spans the ad agency JWT and retail consultancy Watermelon - as director of merchandising and licensing .
"" My job is to create products for Corrie , Emmerdale , Hell 's Kitchen and the like that can appeal to all age groups , "" she explains .
"" Next year I 'll be pushing the soaps heavily - gardening features strongly in Emmerdale , for instance , so we 'll be looking at a range of gardening products .
For Hell 's Kitchen there 's various kitchen items that you could sell - marketing the complete kitchen solution to bachelors , for instance . ""
First out of the traps , however , is Britannia High - the Fame - style musical modelled on Disney 's uber - hit High School Musical - which has spawned watches , luggage , bedding , bikes and perfume among other products .
ITV Global plans clothing , DVDs , books , dance mats and household items , and will organise live tours of the show .
With the drama recently sold to HBO , MBC , Seven and Nickelodeon , ITV is hoping to emulate Disney 's merchandising success - the release of High School Musical 2 , for instance , saw Disney 's consumer products unit record a 29 % rise in sales .
But Global is a long way behind BBC Worldwide , which - according to licensing magazine License Global - is the 27th richest licensing body in the world , above the NHL , WWE and Coca Cola .
Russell points to
In The Night Garden and Charlie and Lola as his key kids properties , but is also pushing into the more adult world with shows such as Top Gear .
Last year , an unprecedented joint venture between Worldwide , Top Gear 's executive producer and Jeremy Clarkson turned over £ 8.6 m with products ranging from Scalectric sets to
I Am The Stig T - shirts .
Clarkson earned £ 317,000 - which he sadly invested in AIG .
This autumn , Top Gear Live began a £ 20 m world tour that will act as a template for other BBC superbrands to hit the road .
"" America took to licensing far quicker than any other country , "" Russell says .
"" It still accounts for 50 % of the world 's merchandising spend .
But the UK is going that way .
We 're drifting to that side of the Atlantic . ""
He insists the BBC would never commission a show based on the merchandising possibilities , but says that all aspects of a show 's exploitation will be considered at every stage . ""
As downloads increase and people consume more TV online , you 're going to see a time where merchandising becomes part of the marketing for a show as well as a revenue stream , "" he says .
Kidwia arrived at ITV after Britannia High was commissioned , but believes merchandising was not the driving force in that decision .
Even so , if it took barely 20 years for kids ' TV to move from Mattel 's happy accident to a world where TV producers give shows away free to sell toys , how long will it take before struggling channels book a cooking show on the basis of a lucrative saucepan range ?
Ready Steady ... Sell .

This article was amended on Wednesday 17 December 2008 .
In an article about television merchandising we quoted the managing director of BBC Worldwide 's children and licensing division , Neil Ross Russell , as saying that the vast majority of children 's TV shows around the world were given free to broadcasters to allow producers to mop up on the merchandising revenue .
In fact he said that was true in some cases .
This has been corrected ."
"It 's been a long time coming , but former eBay chief Meg Whitman now appears to be preparing to run for the post of governor of California .
Whitman seems to be planning a future as Arnold Schwarzenegger 's successor , and she 's spent the past year getting her credentials in order .
Her ties to the Republicans are tight : she was a co - chair of John McCain 's failed election campaign and before that an adviser to Mitt Romney 's failed campaign to win the Republican nomination .
With such a startling record of political success , I quite hope she gets the nod - but I also hope that people start to question her period in charge of eBay .
After all , yes , she guided the company from a small outfit to worldwide success .
She made it through the dotcom bust and came out the other side .
But then things started to go awry : when eBay turned into a massive struggling bureaucracy that needed a bit of direction and oomph , she decided to buy Skype ( which the company had to write down by $ 1.4bn ) and then , this time last year , got the hell out of Dodge .
And just a few months after she bailed , the company laid off 10 % of its workforce .
California 's got plenty of problems already .
Still , record aside , Whitman would n't be the first technology executive to try her hand at politics .
Although in recent years Bill Gates has wielded the greatest political influence of any technology supremo ( he once told me that he regularly phoned Tony Blair and Gordon Brown to check on the progress of the NHS 's troubled IT upgrade ) in the end he preferred to exercise his muscle for the company , not the country .
In recent American history , that means the most famous example of a technologist - turned - politician is Ross Perot , the founder of Electronic Data Systems who ran as an independent presidential candidate in 1992 and 1996 .
At his most successful , Perot received as much as 19 % of the popular vote .
Crikey .
Sidenote : Whitman 's political links have also led some to speculate that she could be lined up as a potential secretary of commerce under Barack Obama .
But despite another high - profile vacancy under the new White House administration , there 's no whisper that she could be up for the job of America 's CTO ."

Representing a small college town in the Wisconsin state legislature is a champion air guitar player , featured in the 2006 movie Air Guitar Nation .
Gordon Hintz , a 35-year - old budget analyst and former instructor at the University of Wisconsin
- Oshkosh was just reelected to a second term in the Wisconsin state assembly .
What 's air guitar ?
I ca n't explain it any better than this youtube clip of 2003 Air Guitar World Champion C - Diddy , who defeated Hintz at the 2003 USA finals in California .
Hintz , a life - long rock fan , was a 29-year - old budget analyst for the city of Long Beach , California outside Los Angeles , when he came to air guitar .
Some friends heard about a competition held at a prominent Los Angeles nightclub , and urged Hintz to enter .
"" I really had very little idea of what I was getting into , "" he told me about his 2003 leap into air guitar stardom . ""
At worst case scenario it would be a pretty fun night out with my friends . ""
But Hintz , in character as "" Krye Tuff "" , wowed the audience and judges with his performance of David Lee Roth 's "" Yankee Rose "" .
He was crowned "" west coast "" champion and advanced to the final round . ""
He was a great performer , "" said C - Diddy , known to his mother as David Jung .
"" He really understood how to relate to the audience , and he was having a lot of fun out there .
He just let it go . ""
The episode was filmed for Air Guitar Nation , which chronicled the birth and growth of American air guitar in 2003 .
In the film , Hintz is shown thrashing about and hamming it up on stage in a black wig , red and black striped shirt , a checkerboard wristband , skin - tight black pants with a hole in the left knee , and what appears to be eye makeup .
He looks to be having a swell time , and the audience clearly loves the spectacle .
Following his defeat by C - Diddy , Hintz hung his air guitar on an air rack and returned to his native Oshkosh , Wisconsin , to enter politics .
He ran for state assembly in 2004 , lost , but won in 2006 , defeating a 19-year incumbent Republican .
The entire incident would probably have faded like a hangover into memory were it not for the movie , which debuted during Hintz 2006 race .
He was terrified the film would capture him in a negative light and damage his campaign .
It did not , he says : "" I did n't do anything too ridiculous "" .
Hintz said his opponent never made an issue of his air guitar stardom , and though some of his older colleagues "" do n't get it "" , it has n't gotten in the way of his work as a lawmaker .
Figures in the world of air guitar and politics agree that as pure showmanship , air guitar and politics demand confidence and personal style , and that one not take one 's self too seriously . ""
To have somebody who is more imaginative , is capable of a bold vision and is willing to take a risk is precisely what we need , "" Wisconsin Lieutenant Governor Barbara Lawton told me . ""
And it is those characteristics in Gordon that position him to be a leader among his peers "" .
Hintz agreed that an extroverted personality helps both air guitar and when running for public office .

This idea of preserving freedom is very important .
Freedom to be wrong as well , you know ?
Freedom to do the wrong thing , elect the wrong people .
Look at California .
Arnold Schwarzenegger is the governor of California .
There 's a perfectly ordinary English sentence .
How the fuck did that happen ?
You know how that happened , how he got that job ?
By lifting things .
Now , you and me , we avoid lifting things .
It 's unpleasant .
A five - year - old child looks at a heavy thing and goes , "" I do n't think so , I 'd rather shove Lego up my arse .
I 'm not gon na lift that . ""
He took a totally different approach .
He lifted things .
He did n't even move them anywhere .
He put them back down in the same place .
And then said to the people who were gathered , "" Look how good I am at lifting things ... in my underpants . ""
And all the people who 'd bothered to stop and watch , they 're the really stupid ones cos they said , "" You 're the man .
You 're the one we want to control taxes and water rates and immigration and all that shit . ""
Russell Brand on the Sun ( 2006 )
I wanted to talk to you about the Sun and that a bit , really .
You know , cos I like ...
I like the Sun a bit .
I 've read it all my life
and I sort of have an odd relationship with The Sun newspaper .
I kind of think of it as a friend , but ...
Do any of you have a friend that you , like , fucking hate ?
That has infiltrated your life and is trying to surreptitiously make you be a bit racist with the offer of a £ 1 day trip to France . ""
Come on , come on , it 's all right , £ 1 day trip to France .
It 'll be well all right
, it 'll be pukka , it 'll be pukka !
There 's too many asylum - seekers coming in the country . ""
What , what ?
What ?
"" Nah , just saying £ 1 day trip to France .
It 'll be pukka ! ""
You said something about asylum - seekers .
"" I fucking never !
Come on , do a Sudoku .
Be fucking brilliant ! ""
Sarah Silverman on Aids ( 2006 )
I 'll be honest , I woke up
and I really just had the blahs .
I woke up with the blahs .
I really needed some good news so I got an Aids test .
Because I do n't have fucking Aids .
And they go through a questionnaire and they ask you a bunch of questions .
That 's what a questionnaire is .
And about halfway through , I realised ...
oh , my God , I have fucking Aids !
I have Aids .
The worst part and kind of the best part , um ... was when she said , "" Have you ever had a blood transfusion in the 80s ? ""
And I said , "" Oh , my God , yes . ""
And she said , "" You did ?
You had a blood transfusion in the 80s ? ""
And I was like , "" Oh , my God , no !
I misheard you .
"" I thought she said in Haiti .
So that was a relief .
Frank Skinner on Heather Mills ( 2008 )
I was in a club
and I was talking about Heather Mills .
Heather Mills McCartney as was .
And I was talking about how people hate her , right .
And I said to this bloke , you know I was talking , and he said , "" Oh I really hate her . ""
And I said , "" Have you ever met her ? ""
He said , "" No . ""
I said , "" Well that 's crazy , is n't it , to hate someone you 've never met ? ""
Not that I 've ever met Heather Mills .
Something I 'm sure will be remedied in a couple of years ' time when we both arrive to disappointingly lukewarm applause at the Big Brother house .
But I was , you know , I was trying to stick up for her .
He said , "" I love Paul McCartney , I ca n't understand ... ""
He said , "" He could have had anybody ; I dunno why he married a one - legged woman . ""
And then his mate said , "" Well , people will do anything for a parking space . """
"The martial arts star Jean - Claude Van Damme , who for years has been performing low - grade Arnold Schwarzenegger - style roles , here returns to his native Brussels to follow Arnie 's example in Last Action Hero by going postmodern and playing a version of himself .
Strapped for cash through a child custody case , a desperate JCVD goes into a suburban post office that is being robbed by three armed crooks .
The cops mistake him for the perpetrator , local fans gather and a siege ensues .
Van Damme emerges with credit and gets to deliver straight to camera a five - minute speech on his difficult life - probably off the autocue but seemingly from the heart .
It 's fun , and moderately well handled by a young French director ."
"After Gray Davis ran up enormous debts as governor of California , Arnold Schwarzenegger and others challenged him in a 2003 recall .
Davis was ejected from office and Schwarzenegger parachuted into Sacramento with high hopes .
Today , that recall looks pointless : California is in worse shape under Schwarzenegger than was under Davis .
A steady stream of bad news reports about the Golden State trickle out from the media : Despondent Californians are moving out of the state in large numbers , the state 's treasury has been empty for months , tax refunds are on hold , etc .
Has Schwarzenegger governed worse than Davis ?
It is arguable .
In one sense he has certainly been more dangerous than Davis :
Many of his questionable proposals , had Davis advocated them , would never have gotten passed .
Schwarzenegger , owing to his celebrity and his stealth status as a Republican , has been able to advance dubious legislation much farther than the unpopular Davis ever could .
Billions , for example , have been spent under Schwarzenegger for controversial embryonic stem - cell research .
Had Davis proposed such spending , Republicans would probably have cited it as an additional reason to recall him from office .
But since a "" Republican "" proposed the legislation , it was suddenly acceptable .
This is why , at the time of the 2003 recall , some savvy Democrats had let Davis twist in the wind .
They saw the potential of Schwarzenegger as a Republican Trojan Horse for their liberal ideological interests .
They sensed that he would at once neutralise his own party while pushing proposals indistinguishable from their own .
Republicans only won a Pyrrhic victory in tossing Davis out .
They essentially replaced an unpopular liberal with a popular one .
That Schwarzenegger ended up hiring Gray Davis 's former chief of staff confirmed this farce .
The meaningless character of the recall , from a conservative point of view , is particularly obvious on issues like global warming .
Look at the ease with which Schwarzenegger has advanced legislation on that issue .
The auto industry , already reeling from the aftershocks of the market collapse , is quaking under the Terminator 's most recent move : to ratchet up fuel - efficiency standards in California so that they are higher than the existing national standard .
This requires a usually - denied waiver from the federal government , and it looks like Schwarzenegger will obtain one from the Obama administration .
Should that stiffer regulation come to pass , car companies will have to comply with two standards , and that will ultimately translate into another blow to California consumers , as the auto industry is sure to pass on the additional costs to them .
An energy economist at the Heritage Foundation told the Los Angeles Times that the new regulations will "" cost them more "" .
He added : "" The upfront cost of buying a car could be $ 5,000 addition per car , once you consider research and development and manufacturing cost . ""
Other economists predict that consumers will simply avoid new purchases and keep driving their old , sootier cars for as long as possible .
The Republican business community , had they been paying attention at the time of the recall , could have anticipated such legislation .
Schwarzenegger , after all , let it be known that Robert Kennedy Jr was one of his chief environmental advisers , and he had boasted of his environmentally - friendly Hummer .
Republican apologists for the pro - abortion rights Schwarzenegger had tried to reassure conservatives that he would at least uphold their "" economic conservatism "" .
This has proven bogus .
He has favoured as many new regulations and taxes as Gray Davis .
Now Schwarzenegger , scrambling for cash anywhere he can find it , hopes to tax a new group , this one non - polluting : golfers .
This tax could cost California 's duffers up to 10 % in additional fees for rounds , golf carts and driving - range fees .
A few of them are even grumbling about organising a possible recall of the governor .
The ironies here are rich .
Perhaps the same group of country - club Republicans that catapulted Schwarzenegger into office will now try and remove him from it ."
"California legislative leaders and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger have reached a tentative deal to close the state 's projected $ 40bn ( £ 28.1bn ) budget gap on the backs of virtually every Californian , from taxpayers to state workers to welfare recipients , according to sources close to the negotiations .
The plan includes $ 15.8bn in spending cuts , $ 14.3bn in taxes and $ 10.9bn in borrowing , according to a budget outline obtained by the Sacramento Bee newspaper .
The state also anticipates billions in federal stimulus money , which would reduce each component of the solution if California receives more than $ 9.2bn .
Staff members are still drafting bills , but sources said the legislature plans to vote tomorrow .
It remained unclear whether leaders could corral the votes necessary for approval .
Under proposed spending cuts , state workers would lose two bank holidays and face ongoing furloughs through June 2010 , while prisons would face a 10 % reduction to their medical budget .
Welfare recipients and low - income disabled , blind and elderly individuals would not receive cost - of - living increases .
The deal discussed by legislators would not significantly reduce projected programme cuts by schools over the next 17 months , more than $ 5bn in real cuts , but it could affect what programmes are chopped , said Kevin Gordon , a veteran education lobbyist .
The plan would raise sales taxes by 1 cent on the dollar and place a 2.5 % surcharge on income taxes across the board – 5 % if federal stimulus money does not reach $ 9.2bn .
Drivers would pay more through a 12-cents - per - gallon fuel hike and an increase in the vehicle licence fee from the current 0.65 % of vehicle value to 1.15 % .
The proposal also would cut the state 's dependent credit from $ 309 down to $ 99 .
As a trade - off for new taxes , Republicans demanded a limit on future state spending .
Under the tentative agreement , the restriction would require the state to place money into a rainy - day fund after reaching a limit determined by state revenues over a 10-year period .
Voters would have to approve the spending limit , likely in a special election later this year , and it is particularly controversial among education groups who constantly seek more state money for schools .
Concerned that the state 's powerful teachers ' union would try to kill the spending restriction at the ballot , budget negotiators included a provision that would extend the major new taxes by one to three years if the spending cap passes .
The vast majority of legislative Republicans have signed pledges not to vote for new taxes .
California senate Republican leader Dave Cogdill said he could not guarantee votes , but told his members that the deal is as good as they 're going to get .
"" I 've negotiated it to the point where I think it does n't get any better , "" he said today , emerging from a private GOP caucus .
"" We 're waiting to see all the language and all of that
so I 'm not ready to commit who the votes will be at this point .
"" The Republican governor himself pledged opposition to taxes in 2006 , but he has since said he believes the state 's problem is not solely overspending .
For him , backing an increase in the state 's vehicle - licence fee is a symbolic reversal after he famously slashed the same fee upon entering office .
Schwarzenegger already has unilaterally ordered two furlough days per month , shutting down most of state government on the first and third Fridays of each month .
The budget deal allows flexibility to soften furloughs should public employee unions reach agreement with the Schwarzenegger administration .
Schwarzenegger threatened this week to send 20,000 layoff notices to state employees , on top of the other cuts , if lawmakers do not commit to a budget deal by then .
Asked if large - scale layoffs could be averted , senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg , a Democrat from Sacramento , said at the Sacramento Press Club , "" Things are moving in a positive direction . ""
While businesses were unable to obtain rollbacks in labour provisions related to meal breaks and overtime pay , they would score victories on tax code changes if the deal is approved .
A shift in how the state calculates each company 's sales could save businesses $ 650 m in state taxes .
Businesses also would receive a $ 3,000 tax credit per each new employee hire .
Education cuts would reduce funding for dozens of programmes targeting specific purposes , such as summer school or assisting gifted students .
Special education and a programme for English learners would be exempted , and penalties would be reduced for districts that raise class sizes , Gordon said .
Schwarzenegger has dropped a proposal to eliminate a week of instruction next year in California 's public schools , but the issue may be re - evaluated this spring .
State leaders are counting on voters approving a plan to borrow $ 5bn this year against future California Lottery revenues .
The state would obtain another $ 5.5bn in costly short - term loans with no defined way to pay it back by 2011 .
California would first use federal stimulus money to eliminate that borrowing .
California would then use federal stimulus dollars to build a reserve .
If the state obtains more than $ 9.2bn in federal aid , it would cut the income tax hike in half and eliminate $ 950 m in planned spending cuts to several programmes , including in - home care and the medical assistance programme Medi - Cal .
Voters would also have to approve the state shifting existing special funds for mental - health services ( Proposition 63 ) and early childhood development ( Proposition 10 ) to help balance the budget .
Under the tentative deal , Schwarzenegger would score wins on changes to stimulate construction .
The proposal gives the state unlimited authority to use public - private partnerships for state transportation projects through 2017 .
It also authorises a limited number of projects to combine the design and construction phases , a change opposed by the public engineers ' union .
And the proposal exempts eight major state highway projects from environmental review while allowing for an expedited permitting process ."
"California remained locked in a budget impasse today despite a night - long negotiating session aimed at resolving the state 's $ 42bn ( £ 29.5bn ) budget deficit .
California senate Republicans , in defiance of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , continued to hold out against the compromise deal , which would see the deficit addressed with a combination of spending cuts , borrowing and tax increases .
Early this morning the state 's Republican senators ousted their leader , who had supported the compromise , replacing him with a more conservative senator who has pledged to resist any attempt to raise taxes .
California 's peculiar legislative system dictates that the package must win a two - thirds majority to pass , meaning that Democrats need the support of three Republicans to reach the necessary 27 votes .
Two Republicans , including ousted leader Dave Codgill , support the measure , leaving the vote one short of the required majority .
The majority Democratic leadership of the state senate has piled pressure on the Republicans to support the measure .
Last night 's all - night session was presaged by a threat from the Democrats that lawmakers should bring a toothbrush , and that nobody would be allowed to leave until a vote had been passed .
But Democrats have also sought compromise , granting many measures to pacify the Republicans .
Outgoing Republican leader Codgill said that he felt the concessions won from the Democrats were as good as it would get .
But many of his colleagues , including new leader Dennis Hollingsworth , have pledged not to raise taxes under any circumstances .
"" I do n't want to see a tax increase passed , "" Hollingsworth told the Associated Press .
"" I think the majority of my caucus does n't want to see a tax increase passed in the package .
We 'll see what happens in the next few hours , next few days . ""
The bipartisan package , negotiated by Schwarzenegger and two leaders from each party , includes $ 15.1bn in cuts , including $ 8bn to the education budget , $ 14.4bn in temporary tax increases , and $ 11.4bn in new borrowing .
With no budget , the state , under Schwarzenegger 's direction , has begun taking drastic action to address the shortfall .
Yesterday notices were sent out to 20,000 state employees telling them they might be fired .
Infrastructure projects valued at $ 3.8bn have been put on hold , and income tax refunds are to be delayed .
Many counties have not received funds from the state to make welfare payments .
"" We 're used to dealing with dead - beat dads , but we 've never had to deal with a dead - beat state before , "" San Diego county official Greg Cox told Bloomberg news .
The annual ritual of California 's budget impasse has become more critical this year due to the worsening global economy , with state revenues falling by billions of dollars .
The failure to reach a budget deal recently led to a decline in the state 's credit rating .
The most populous state in the union and the seventh largest economy in the world now has the lowest credit rating of any US state ."
"One of my favourite stories from the shooting of Predator revolves around the intense competition between the various musclebound cast members .
So determined were the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger , Carl Weathers and Jesse Ventura to maintain the upper hand in the beefcake stakes that they would apparently work out as early as 3 am before the day 's gruelling shoot in the Mexican jungle .
Weathers even admitted that he would deliberately avoid training with the other actors in order to appear as if his physique was God given .
One has to hope that the cast of Sylvester Stallone 's forthcoming action thriller
The Expendables take it a little more easy when they begin shooting later this year .
After all , they are getting on a bit .
Stallone has assembled a who 's who of 80s kick - ass moviedom , including himself , Dolph Lundgren and Mickey Rourke .
Jean Claude Van Damme was approached but apparently turned down the chance to star because the project had no script or storyline ( something which , it has to be said , never seemed to bother him much before ) .
Jason Statham and Jet Li add some much - needed ( if relative ) youth .
Nevertheless , everyone had assumed that the star who truly epitomised 80s action would be missing out on this meeting of the meatheads .
Arnold Schwarzenegger was , after all , a little busy in California .
Not so , reports Ai nt
It Cool News , hinting it has a cast - iron source ( and given that Stallone has been known to phone up editor Harry Knowles in the past to consult on title changes to his films
, you might be able to guess his identity ) who 's revealed that Arnie has been lured back to play himself in the film .
One assumes this is only a cameo , but even so , it 'll be good to see the Austrian oak back on the big screen again .
I 'm fully expecting The Expendables , with its vigilante plotline about a group of mercenaries charged with bringing down a south American dictator , to be the best kind of super - strength , so - bad - its - good action trash .
Will you be watching ?
Or would you rather dig out those fading videos of Running Man and First Blood instead ?"
"Fraser Nelson anticipates the hell awaiting a Tory government : Chancellor Osborne 's set of choices will be hideous .

"The young stars ' eyes shone as they reeled off the list of parties they planned to attend :
Elton 's charity do , Prince 's after - show gig , Arnold Schwarzenegger 's Governor 's Ball .
For the cast of Slumdog Millionaire , the rags had truly become riches as they celebrated a near - sweep at the 2009 Academy Awards .
"" It feels unreal .
This is the best day of my life , man , "" Madhur Mittal , who plays the wayward Salim , said at the party thrown by the film 's US distributor , Fox Searchlight .
"" I come from India and I never in my wildest dreams thought I would be at the Oscars , much less be part of the movie that sweeps the Oscars . ""
All around him , there were reminders of the distance between the film and its destination at the heart of Hollywood .
Designer - clad starlets sipped glasses of "" The Slumdog "" cocktail , a mix of vodka , raspberries and lime not normally served on the streets of Mumbai .
Close by , another , younger star of the film was sticking to Coca - Cola .
"" It 's unbelievable , "" said eight - year - old Ayush Mahesh Khedekar , who plays the youngest Jamal .
"" I never thought I would get an Oscar .
Daniel [ Danny Boyle ] told us : ' If you work hard , the Oscar will come to you . '
And it came . ""
At the Governor 's Ball , the first stop in the post - Oscar celebrity waltz , his young co - star looked up from his video game console to weigh up the Oscar statuette . ""
Danny !
This is so big !
This is very heavy ! ""
Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail , who plays the youngest Salim , exclaimed to the film 's director .
The not unexpected victory of Slumdog , which approached some sort of British Oscar record , winning one more Academy award than Shakespeare
In Love but failing to match the nine given to The English Patient , threw up a succession of unlikely moments .
Making their way into the Kodak theatre in Hollywood , the film 's stars subverted the norms of the celebrity ritual .
Instead of preening and posturing , the young actors rushed about , gawping at the Hollywood royalty arrayed before them .
Was that Meryl Streep ?
They rushed over and got her autograph .
James Bond actor Daniel Craig ?
Another autograph in the book .
"" Oh my god , "" Mittal said later , "" is that Adrien Brody ? ""
For Tessa Ross , head of Film4 , which produced the film , the lavish celebrations produced a different sensation .
"" I tripped on to the Fox party and smiled at a lot of people , "" she said .
"" Then I walked to the Vanity Fair party and did a circuit .
All those beautiful people beautifully dressed , it made me feel shorter and older .
I had a doughnut and left . ""
Vanity Fair , an Oscar night tradition , returned to the fray this year after taking a break last year due to the screenwriter 's strike .
Amid all the glitz , the celebration attempted to make a nod to these recessionary times , offering its humble guests humble fare , including not only doughnuts but bagels , egg and bacon sandwiches and fastfood burgers .
Best actress winner Kate Winslet had other things on her mind , namely pickled onions .
"" My mum won a pickled onion competition in her local pub before Christmas and that was a big deal , "" she said backstage after receiving her award .
"" They had her picture in the paper .
Reading Evening Post - there 's your next Winslet picture , "" she said , holding up her statuette .
All was not celebration , however .
Outside the theatre demonstrators opposed to gay marriage held up placards , drawing the ire of Sean Penn , who caused one of the night 's minor surprises by winning the best actor award for his portrayal of gay rights icon Harvey Milk .
"" I 'd tell them to turn in their hate card and find their better self , "" he said .
"" It 's very sad in a way , because it 's a demonstration of such emotional cowardice , to be so afraid of extending the same rights to your fellow man as you would want for yourself . ""
By contrast , after weeks of controversy , India finally laid claim to Slumdog .
News channels broadcasting live commentary of the Hollywood event called the presentation of the best film award a "" victory for India "" .
Celebrations erupted in the family homes of AR Rahman , the composer who took home two golden statuettes , and Resul Pookutty , the Bollywood sound engineer who was part of the winning sound mixing team .
For the young stars the next step is one they are approaching with some trepidation .
Dev Patel , the Londoner who plays the older Jamal , has signed on to star in Sixth Sense director M Night Shyamalan 's next film , The Last Airbender .
Patel 's co - star , Mittal , is taking things more slowly .
He is looking to buy a house in Los Angeles , and has spent his time rejecting offers .
He is determined , he said , to "" try not to do crap "" .
There was almost universal praise for Slumdog Millionaire 's director Danny Boyle for choosing to capture , in the words of Bollywood lyricist Gulzar , "" the spirit of Mumbai .
I am thrilled and happy ...
Danny and Rahman helped to capture the spirit of this city , "" said the songwriter who penned the lyrics of Slumdog 's winning song , Jai Ho ."
"Unless you 've been hiding under a stone , you 'll be aware that the long - awaited adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons 's graphic novel Watchmen is finally being released in cinemas tomorrow , after a little studio difficulty .
Directed by Zach Snyder , whose previous form includes the controversial Frank Miller adaptation 300 , this represents a triumph of persistence , if nothing else .
Directors as eminent as Terry Gilliam ( himself no stranger to apparently unfilmable books ) , Darren Aronofsky and Paul "" Bourne "" Greengrass had all tried , and failed , to bring the novel to the cinema , with actors rumoured to star including Jude Law , Tom Cruise and – potentially catastrophically –
Arnold Schwarzenegger as one of the book 's most fascinating characters , mild - mannered scientist turned blue demigod Dr Manhattan .
So far , the film has split critical opinion , with the vocal element that demanded a more or less literal adaptation of the novel delighted and those who might have preferred a looser , more obviously cinematic experience disappointed .
But its very existence as a ( relatively ) compact piece of cinema seems almost unbelievable .
Gilliam , having tried to come up with a satisfactory means of condensing it , commented : "" I keep thinking it would be better as a miniseries – a five - hour miniseries . ""
The graphic novel attracted a huge amount of critical praise , and was featured in Time 's list of the best 100 English - language novels from 1923 to now , for the way in which Moore and Gibbons moved on from the straightforward good / bad dichotomy that had dominated comic books and graphic novels in favour of a looser , more discursive meditation on history , society and man 's capacity for evil .
All of this was depicted in a manner that owed as much to modernist novels as it did to comic books , with the sprawling narrative encompassing countless plot strands , most of which would pass the reader by until a subsequent reading – in some cases , many subsequent readings .
Watchmen , however , is far from the first apparently unfilmable novel that has made it to the screen .
Over the past couple of decades , the likes of Naked Lunch , The English Patient , Perfume and even Ulysses have been adapted for the screen – with vastly varying amounts of artistic success , but with at least good intentions from talented directors .
( Amazingly , Philip K Dick is practically a house author in some studios . )
The days when Hollywood could take Patrick Hamilton 's nuanced , psychologically fascinating Hangover Square and cheerfully turn it into a grand guignol shocker , which climaxed with the deranged protagonist playing a piano concerto on top of a bonfire incinerating the body of the woman he has murdered , are , thankfully , over .
Mass - market taste , in the form of such initiatives as Oprah Winfrey 's book club , has ensured that books that might once have been called "" too difficult "" for cinema are now allowed to keep at least some of their quirks intact .
There are still books that have defied the adaptors , despite years of work and millions of dollars spent on attempts .
It may be that JD Salinger 's Catcher in the Rye will eventually be filmed after his death , but this has not stopped fevered speculation for decades as to who would be perfect for the role of the disaffected Holden Caulfield – a role so central to the narrative that even the slightest miscasting would be disastrous .
Likewise , the long - mooted adaptation of John Kennedy Toole 's A Confederacy of Dunces creates such a vivid protagonist that putting a mainstream comic in a fat suit would represent a betrayal of the original material .
Given the sacrifices involved in its publication , it is surely better that no film ever be attempted than a substandard one be made .
On the other hand , some books that seem to be ideal for filming have never quite made it to the screen .
Donna Tartt 's The Secret History – which surely represents a brilliant chance to make a ballsy , suspenseful version of the middlebrow "" inspirational teacher "" pap that Hollywood has churned out for years – still sits in development hell , perhaps scaring off potential producers with its complex literary allusions and theme of student murder .
Yet in a world where the allegedly difficult work of Ian McEwan and Cormac McCarthy can be adapted into Oscar - winning cinema , and where "" the Citizen Kane of comic books "" seems poised to clear up at the box office , one has to hope that the persistent rumours linking Gwyneth Paltrow with an adaptation of Tartt 's novel are true , and that she can divert herself away from her new website long enough to become involved with what could be another triumph for imagination and success against the odds .
Watchmen took 22 years to bring to the screen ; let 's hope that The Secret History may yet appear before 2014 ."
"If the Terminator franchise can carry on without Arnold Schwarzenegger , why not Mad Max without Mel Gibson ?
According to reports , plans are now afoot to bring a fourth instalment of the dystopian saga to the big screen , but without its most famous face .
George Miller , the man who directed the first three Mad Max films , told MTV that a new movie is planned , but it will be a 3-D animated piece .
He refused to confirm who would voice the postapocalyptic road warrior , but when asked about Gibson , he said : "" We 'll probably go a different route . ""
The plot for Mad Max 4 will be lifted from a planned live - action version which was abandoned in 2003 when financing fell through .
Miller said the project would now be in the Japanese anime style .
"" I 've always loved anime , in particular the Japanese sensibility , "" he said .
"" It 's something I 've always wanted to do . ""
The director has some form in animated films , having found box - office success with the 2006 family comedy Happy Feet , which featured a talking penguin as its central character .
As yet there 's no release date for Mad Max 4 .
"" We 're in the early stages of writing and designing , "" said Miller .
Gibson , meanwhile , will be returning to the big screen in due course .
After an eventful few years in which he directed two successful films , The Passion of the Christ and Apocalypto , and caused controversy with his widely publicised antisemitic remarks to a police officer , the actor has signed to take the lead role in a film adaptation of the classic BBC drama series Edge of Darkness ."
"Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger did n't hesitate to throw some elbows yesterday while stumping for a May special election ballot measure package he says is crucial to California 's fiscal health .
Speaking to an audience of 400 to 500 hosted by the Commonwealth club of California - and thousands more listening to a live radio broadcast - the governor said people can use their votes to end the volatility that has plagued the state budget process for so long , leading to crises like the $ 42bn deficit lawmakers finally addressed last month .
Cutting the deficit by spending cuts alone would 've meant closing the state university system , cutting off all welfare assistance and shutting down all mental health services , he said ; even firing the state 's 200,000 workers "" would n't have come close to balancing the budget "" .
"" Those who say we could have balanced the budget through spending cuts alone are guilty of political cynicism at its worst .
Those are not serious people , "" he said , but "" those who say we could balance the budget through tax increases alone reveal their total economic ignorance and lack of math skills .
Their grasp of economics must come from living on a hippie commune or something like that "" .
The six ballot measures voters will consider on 19 May are part and parcel of the deal that settled the months - long deadlock over that enormous deficit .
The measures would impose a spending cap based on the previous decade 's revenue while creating a rainy - day fund ; alter the state 's voter - approved education funding law ; borrow from future lottery earnings ; take money from voter - created funds for early - childhood and mental - health services ; and deny pay raises to state - level elected officials when the state has a budget deficit .
Some oppose the spending cap saying it would tie future officials ' hands in addressing the state 's needs ; some say future lottery revenues probably wo n't pay off the bonds Schwarzenegger wants to sell against them now ; some oppose taking money from the state 's most vulnerable ; and some oppose the whole plan simply because it involves the tax hikes to which the legislature agreed last month .
But Schwarzenegger said it 's all intertwined , and voters must approve it all if it 's going to work .
"" I feel good about the change this budget reform will bring to our state , "" he said .
"" Ladies and gentlemen , Sacramento may be an immovable object , but together we can be an irresistible force .
With this reform , we can regain control over our budget . """

"Three renaissance paintings taken from a Jewish couple by the Nazis in 1935 have been returned to their grandchildren by the state of California , in a ceremony attended by governor Arnold Schwarzenegger .
The Nazis forced Jakob and Rosa Oppenheimer to close their Berlin art gallery and , after passing through many owners , the paintings were bought by William Randolph Hearst and ended up at Hearst Castle , owned by California state .
The family asked for them back and Schwarzenegger said that as soon as the truth was known the state set things right : "" But a wrong can not be fully righted when victims have long since passed away . """
"Old action movie franchises do not die , they just get "" rebooted "" .
Robert Rodriguez is to write and direct a new film based on the long - running Predator series , whose 1987 debut featured Arnold Schwarzenegger 's rumble in the jungle with a mandible - sporting extraterrestrial intent on hunting human beings as big game .
Predator has been the subject of four feature films , although the departure of Schwarzenegger and director John McTiernan after the first movie heralded what many would see as a drop in quality for the subsequent sequels .
Rodriguez has long been rumoured to entertain an interest in bringing Predator back to the big screen .
The announcement that the project is now moving forward may have something to do with the slow progress of Sin City 2 , the planned sequel to the 2005 comic - book adaptation which Rodriguez co - directed with the book 's creator Frank Miller .
The Hollywood Reporter said earlier this week that Miller 's representatives were shopping rights to the followup around studios , suggesting that Dimension films , which oversaw the first movie , might have let its option lapse .
The Predator revamp does n't yet have a cast or start date , however .
Rodriguez is likely to turn first to Machete , based on a character who featured in a fake trailer screened as part of the director 's ill - fated Grindhouse project with Quentin Tarantino .
Rodriguez has written the script and will co - direct with longtime editor Ethan Maniquis .
Trejo looks set to reprise the titular role of a Mexican ex - Federale with a gift for wielding a blade who sets out to exact revenge after being conned by a corrupt state senator .

"On Tuesday 28 April , 2009 , California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced a widespread state of emergency in response to the H1N1 "" swine flu "" outbreak .
His official proclamation mentions "" conditions of extreme peril to the safety of person and property "" , which sounds pretty scary : the sort of language you might associate with a disaster movie scenario of police - enforced curfews and wholesale community lockdowns , or - at the very least - the mandatory wearing of surgical masks in public places .
Longtime residents of California , however , did not feel unduly spooked by their governor 's proclamation , because states of emergency are comparatively common - they are basically a way to cut through red tape and free - up all of the available resources needed to tackle any situation that merits concern .
Catastrophic fires destroy entire neighbourhoods on an annual basis in the Golden State , floods knock houses off hillsides with equal frequency .
Nature 's dark side is part of the daily reality here , and the phrase "" state of emergency "" is usually greeted not with a sense of shock , or panic , but one of familiarity .
In May 2008 , Gov. Schwarzenegger announced a state of emergency in Santa Cruz and Santa Clara counties on account of the Summit Fire ( named after Summit Road , where the blaze started ) .
And on 27 February this year , the former action movie hero declared a full - blown , state - wide state of emergency to deal with the current water shortage : California is currently suffering its third consecutive year of drought ( 2008 delivered the driest spring and summer on record ) .
On the streets of Los Angeles , the day after the proclamation , it 's pretty much business as usual .
Opportunist labourers wait for offers of day work on Beverly Boulevard ; the Range Rover - driving mothers of Beverly Hills drop their kids off at school ; California highway patrolmen write citations to motorists who have run stop signs - and there 's not a surgical mask in sight .
Nicolas , originally from Mexico , is not especially worried .
"" I do n't know anyone who 's sick , thank God , "" he says .
Fishing off the Santa Monica Pier , he 's more concerned with the fine he could pick up if he tries to sneak home an under - sized halibut .
Nearby , there 's a man wearing a protective face mask , but only as a defence against emulsion — closer inspection reveals he 's giving the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. restaurant a fresh coat of paint .
At Venice Beach , a mile or so down the coast , there 's no hint of alarm in the ocean - view tattoo parlours and T - shirt shops .
Bare - chested joggers with skin the colour of walnuts go about their fitness regimes , the body - builders on Muscle Beach flex a bicep or two , and pale - legged tourists take photos .
Mexican - born Rocio , who runs a stall , is taking the situation more seriously . ""
No shake hands , no kiss , no hugs , "" she says , when asked how her friends and family are reacting to the virus .
She sells colourful hand - painted seeds in the shape of animals .
"" The seeds are from Mexico but the animals are made here in LA - which is good , because people are worried about germs .
I carry a mask .
I wear it if I go to a store and there are lots of people . ""
Just for the purposes of demonstration , she puts on her mask , then puts it back in her pocket .
Inland , in the mainly Hispanic East LA neighbourhood of Echo Park , not far from Downtown , the evening brings out its usual mix of lackadaisical skateboarders , kids in skinny jeans , and families shopping en masse ... but not a hint of emergency .

"" I 've seen no masks , "" he says , as Sunset Boulevard lives up to its name in a final burst of glorious light before nightfall .

"Arnold Schwarzenegger said yesterday he is open to debate the merits of taxing marijuana but does n't support the idea of legalising the drug .
The California governor was speaking at an event to raise awareness about wildfire safety when a reporter asked him if it was time to legalise and tax the use of marijuana in an effort to ease the state 's budget woes . ""
No .
I think that it 's not time for that , but I think it 's time for a debate , "" Schwarzenegger said .
"" I think all of those ideas of creating extra revenues , I 'm always for an open debate on it . ""
The governor urged caution on the legalisation issue saying : "" I think that we ought to study very carefully what other countries are doing that have legalised marijuana and other drugs , what effect it had on those countries , and are they happy with that decision ? ""
California currently allows using marijuana for medical reasons .
Do you think California should completely legalise and tax pot ?

"The California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency in Santa Barbara today after a blaze thought to be under control suddenly turned into a wildfire that consumed dozens of mansions and led to the evacuation of almost 14,000 people .
About 1,400 firefighters were in action last night , with prison inmates working alongside them , to try to bring it under control .
Fire officials said the blaze had damaged or destroyed 75 homes , and had grown to more than 2,700 acres .
"" We are in a state of extreme emergency , "" said David Sadecki , a spokesman for the Santa Barbara County fire department .
"" We 're running very , very thin . ""
He said deployment of firefighters was dangerous as a location that one minute appeared to be safe could pose a threat a minute later .
The fire was hopscotching through neighbourhoods , setting some homes on fire and bewilderingly leaving others alone .
It is the first major fire in California this year .
Santa Barbara has about 90,000 residents , many of them wealthy , living in mansions above the coast .
The town suffered late last year from a fire that destroyed more than 200 homes .
The present fire , named Jesusita , after a nearby trail , started on Tuesday .
Up until this afternoon , firefighters were expressing confidence that they had it under control .
Helicopters had been dousing the fire for more than 24 hours and fire officials declared the blaze to be tame .
But strong winds raced down through the canyons above the town to whip up the blaze .
Tim Steele , president of a residents ' association , told the Los Angeles Times the area now looked like a moonscape . ""
I thought we had this one under control .
I underestimated Mother Nature . ""
Schwarzenegger , who had spent the last few days touring the state promoting steps to reduce such wildfires , visited the firefighters and declared a state of emergency , releasing federal funds .
He said dozens of homes had been destroyed .
Thousands of others were still at risk .
About 10 firefighters were injured .
Three suffered serious burns but the hospital said they were stable and their condition was improving .
The police said 5,430 homes were under mandatory evacuation , affecting an estimated 13,575 people .
Another 13,000 had been warned to be ready for evacuation .
Some of those ordered to evacuate their homes ignored the authorities and stayed , needing to be rescued by the fire services .
Others had returned home later in the day .
The US weather service forecast for tomorrow is bad news for the firefighters : more high winds .
Among those forced to evacuate , Howard Schiffer , said he had been told by friends that they had witnessed the destruction of his home .
Schiffer , who founded in 1994 a group called Vitamin Angels Alliance which hands out nutritional supplements to the poor , told the Los Angeles Times he had visited a refugee camp in Kenya last week . ""
These people had nothing at all , "" he said .
"" They had no resources .
They were sick .
They had to deal with losing their homes to violence and hate - which , I believe , is tougher than losing one to a natural disaster .

"Thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes in the southern Californian resort of Santa Barbara after a wildfire raged out of control .
The blaze , which ignited in the dry brush on Tuesday and was being investigated as arson , blackened some 500 acres around picturesque Santa Barbara by nightfall , leaving behind smouldering , burned - out husks where multimillion - dollar mansions once stood .
As the governor of California , Arnold Schwarzenegger , declared a state of emergency , Santa Barbara officials said 5,430 homes housing over 13,000 people had been evacuated .
Neighbourhoods remained under threat as more than 900 firefighters struggled to make headway against flames whipped up by hot , dry winds through steep and sometimes inaccessible canyons .
"" We are in a state of extreme emergency , "" Santa Barbara county fire spokesman David Sadecki said .
"" We 're running very , very thin . ""
Sadecki said the blaze was difficult to fight because of "" extreme weather "" ‑ temperatures over 32C
( 90F ) and winds gusting at up to 50 mph .
Three firefighters suffered burns and respiratory injuries when their engine was engulfed in flames , its hoses burned through , as they tried to protect a home .
They were taken by helicopter to a Los Angeles - area burn centre for treatment .
In a city that has experienced a number of wildfires , officials said this one was as close to the city centre as any they had seen .
Less than six months ago a fire destroyed more than 200 homes in Santa Barbara and neighbouring Montecito , and in 1990 , a blaze killed one person and destroyed 641 homes , apartments and other structures in the county .
Santa Barbara , which has about 90,000 residents , is a tourist destination about 100 miles west of Los Angeles ."
"Firefighters continued to battle the raging wildfire that threatened to engulf the town of Santa Barbara , California today as 30,000 residents evacuated the area .
The fire come amidst a budget crisis threatening to cripple the state government , but Arnold Schwarzenegger , California 's governor , has promised money to fight the blaze .
About 2,500 firefighters were in action today , with prison inmates working alongside them , had brought about 10 % of the fire under control .
Fire officials said the blaze had damaged or destroyed 75 homes , and had grown to more than 3,500 acres , stretching for five miles .

"This week sees the premiere of Terminator Salvation , the fourth in the Terminator film franchise and the first in which Arnold Schwarzenegger does not appear .
Instead , the responsibility for blockbuster box - office falls on the tense shoulders of the 35-year - old British - born actor , Christian Bale .
Despite a career that already stretches back over 20 years , and includes top billing in two Batman films , Bale is perhaps best known for a performance that never made it on to screen .
While shooting a key scene in Terminator Salvation , Bale let rip at the film 's cinematographer , Shane Hurlbut , who had unwittingly wandered into the actor 's eyeline .
The tirade lasted almost four minutes and was decorated with range of expletives , including 37 uses of the F - word .
It also contained a threat to walk out on the film , which caused the film - makers to consult the insurers .
It has been suggested that someone at the insurance company was responsible for the subsequent leaking of an audio recording of the rant on to the internet .
Whoever was guilty , they brought a jaw - lowering pleasure to millions of listeners .
Connoisseurs of the form quickly confirmed Bale 's entry into the pantheon of epic meltdowns , alongside Alec Baldwin 's phone call to his daughter where he called the 11-year - old "" a rude , thoughtless little pig "" and Basil Fawlty 's attack on his Austin 1100 .
Bale has described the outburst as "" out of order beyond belief "" , by way of apology .
That 's as maybe , but one of its more impressive and yet unsettling qualities is that the diatribe was delivered in an American accent .
As the film 's director , the diminutively named McG , recently noted , Bale remained "" very much in character "" throughout the onslaught , threatening to kick the director of photography 's "" fucking ass "" and "" trash "" his "" fucking light "" .
And here , perhaps , is the clue to why Bale is favoured by so many directors and why McG , the creative visionary behind Charlie 's Angels , calls Bale "" the most credible actor of his generation "" .
Not for him the easy recourse to the familiar vulgarities of his homeland .
For even in the depths of what to the casual observer might resemble a psychotic episode , Bale is determined to stay focused on his character .
It 's this kind of dedication that caused Mary Harron to fight for Bale to play Patrick Bateman , the yuppie monster in American Psycho .
The financial backers wanted Leonardo DiCaprio , who wisely opted for The Beach .
Somehow , the boyish DiCaprio never seemed the appropriate choice to run around naked while chasing a prostitute with a chainsaw .
By contrast , Bale , all pumped up and preening , took to the job like a complete natural , as if this was what he did in his downtime .
Bale has acknowledged that sometimes he takes the roles home .
How his wife , Sibi Blazic , coped with this habit during the shooting of American Psycho is not known .
But as a former assistant to Winona Ryder , Blazic must presumably have been aware of the psychic toll that acting can take on even the most stable of personalities .
Four years later , in 2004 , Bale played a disturbed factory worker in The Machinist , a role for which he lost 63 pounds in weight in just a few months .
Hardly anyone saw the film , but the story of Bale 's almost suicidal physical transformation - he was so weak and emaciated he could scarcely walk - travelled far and wide .
It 's that kind of extreme statement of intent that can earn an Oscar nomination .
On this occasion , it did n't but Bale was instead rewarded with the role of the Caped Crusader .
Having played Bateman , he was now Batman , both gothic visions of , respectively , an American psycho and an American hero .
Yet Bale was born in Haverfordwest in south Wales , in 1974 .
His family seem to have been dreamt up as characters from a Sarah Waters novel .
Bale 's grandfather was a ventriloquist and magician , apparently , as well as a boxer and jockey .
His mother was a circus performer and his father a pilot , animal rights activist and peripatetic entrepreneur .
Bale was the youngest of four children and the family moved around during his childhood , finally settling in Bournemouth , via Oxfordshire and Portugal .
He took ballet lessons and learnt to play the guitar .
When he was eight years old , he landed a part in an advert for Lenor fabric softener .
A couple of years later , he acted with Rowan Atkinson in the West End production of The Nerd .
Then at 13 came an international breakthrough , when he starred in Empire of the Sun , Steven Spielberg 's grand adaptation of JG Ballard 's autobiographical novel .
Showing early signs of a career - long discomfort with journalists , he spent the course of one press junket for the film sullenly stabbing an orange with a pen .
Judging by many of the interviews that have since been published , those holding the tape recorder give the impression of closely identifying with that harmless citrus fruit .
Back at school , he resented the attention he now received .
The girls , he recalled , were "" all over me , boys wanted to fight me
and I was being asked to open fetes when all I wanted to do was ride my BMX bike in the woods "" .
As a result , he became withdrawn and self - conscious , only able to relax when he was being someone else .
Around the time of Empire of the Sun , his parents split up and at 17 Bale moved to Los Angeles with his father , David .
"" My entire life , "" Bale once observed , "" has been kind of just moving on ... to somewhere else , changing and adapting to whatever situation I find myself in . ""
Despite this ability to adapt , Bale has nevertheless maintained an uncompromising streak , a characteristic he seems to have inherited from his father . ""
He was never like any other parents that I came across , "" Bale has said .
"" He just kinda never accepted situations as they were if he did n't like ' em . ""
His father died of brain lymphoma in 2003 , but not before marrying the celebrated feminist Gloria Steinem .
After his father 's death , he was cast in Batman Begins and suddenly he had moved into another league .
In between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight , Bale appeared alongside Russell Crowe , the assertive Australian star , in the western 3:10 to Yuma .
Playing a Civil War veteran who 'd lost part of his foot , Bale got to try out a limp , which , since Midnight Cowboy , has been seen as benchmark in method acting .
Better still , he got to wear a 19th - century prosthetic device - not something Dustin Hoffman can ever claim to have done .
None the less , Crowe stole the show .
"" Acting with him , "" said Bale , "" certainly makes things simple .
You do n't have any unnecessary distractions .
"" We can only imagine why .
Still , it has n't all been enlarged trailers and nervous cinematographers .
On Rescue Dawn , he worked for Werner Herzog , the infamously demanding German director who is said to have once pulled a gun on Klaus Kinski . ""
He does n't give a damn about what anybody else is doing , "" said Bale , approvingly , of Herzog .
The film , shot on location in the Thai jungle , could easily have been the inspiration for the spoof Vietnam movie Tropic Thunder .
Bale spent a lot of time eating fried insects and pigswill and managed to shed another 35 pounds from his slender frame .
Then in Harsh Times , he played an army vet suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder who kills several gangster , ends up paralysed and then dead .
It 's the kind of role in which screenplay writers have come reflexively to envisage Bale .
The charming lead in a romantic comedy , the hesitant lover in a drama of social manners , these are parts that are simply not marked with his name .
If Bale ever was interested in that line of work , and it 's not an ambition he 's publicly voiced , then he had to forget it after the Dorchester incident .
In July last year , he was called to a London police station , following an allegation that he had assaulted his mother , Jenny , and sister , Sharon , during an argument at the Dorchester hotel .
The actor denied the allegation , was bailed and later all charges were dismissed .
None the less , the merest suggestion , however wrong , that he might have mixed it with his mother is one that rules out "" cuddly "" and "" warm "" as adjectives that could be applied to Bale .
Following the recorded rant , Bale 's mother said : "" People might now realise that is his temper : they might understand a bit more . ""
And we do .
The question is , will this understanding lead to a greater appreciation of Bale as a large , risk - taking talent or overshadow his career ?
Will it terminate his attraction or prove its salvation ?
"" My father admired troublemakers , "" Bale once recalled . ""
He always said to me , ' The greatest sin is being boring . '
By this measure , at least , the son is undoubtedly more sinned against than sinning .

"Arnold Schwarzenegger faces a moment of truth in his six - year tenure as governor of California tomorrow , hoping against hope that voters will approve a rescue plan to help dig the state out of a $ 21bn budget hole and give a much - needed boost to his dwindling political credibility .
The once boundlessly confident action movie star turned politician finds himself a much chastened man as he turns once more to the voters to try to overcome a political stalemate in Sacramento , the state capital .
The polls suggest , however , that the voters are not interested in helping him out and will more than likely reject a package of ballot propositions designed to free up extra revenue and introduce some modest tax increases .
That , in turn , spells big trouble for California , which has been hit so hard by the recession it can not raise enough taxes to keep basic services like schools and public health facilities going .
Tens of thousands of teachers , policemen , firefighters and other state employees are likely to lose their jobs .
It also spells big trouble for Schwarzenegger , who once dreamed of running for the US Senate – or even the White House , if a constitutional ban on foreign - born candidates could be overturned .
With his approval ratings now languishing in George Bush territory – close to 30 % – he has already abandoned aspirations to continue his political career when his second term as governor ends next year .
His best hope is that a ballot victory tomorrow would give him the political boost he needs to craft a comprehensive budget deal – the package of six measures would raise only $ 6bn , or one - third of the overall deficit – and leave him in a position to build some sort of legacy in his final 18 months .
"" We are at a crossroads , "" he said in a rally speech at an African - American church in Los Angeles over the weekend .
"" Do we want to go … down the road of financial disaster or do we want to get up , dust ourselves off and slowly march back towards prosperity ? ""
The voters , though , seem in no mood to indulge him .
Conservatives do n't like the idea of tax increases , especially since Governor Schwarzenegger has , until now , made it a point of principle not to advocate them .
Liberals , meanwhile , are uncomfortable that he wants to end spending mandates for mental health and early childhood education .
Not so long ago , Schwarzenegger was having the time of his life as governor of California .
He enjoyed movie - star popularity ratings , regularly invited legislators into his custom - built smoking tent for cigars , and declared everything to be "" fantah - stic "" .
No more .
By most accounts , the reversal of fortune is largely out of his hands .
Three decades of anti - tax activism have made California 's budgetary fortunes – and the political fortunes of its leaders - dangerously dependent on the business cycle .
Even a charismatic governor has to struggle to win the required two - thirds majority in the state assembly to get a budget passed , and almost always hits a brick wall because of hardline Republican refusal to contemplate tax increases of any kind .
The reason Schwarzenegger is going to the people at all is because California 's political system has , in his words , become a "" poster child for dysfunction "" .
He and leaders from the two parties made big compromises to reach agreement on the wording of the six ballot propositions , risking considerable ire in their parties ' rank and file .
But the voters appear to be tired of the constant calls to the polls , the constant budget emergencies ( this is the third of the decade ) , and the constant promises of wide - ranging political reform that never seem to arrive .
"" I 've never been able to see the money go to where they say it 's going , "" one voter who heard Schwarzenegger speak yesterday , retired loan officer Jo Evelyn Payne , told the Los Angeles Times .
"" I 'm not entirely convinced that if we pass it , that the money 's going to go where they say it 's going to go . ""
And so the Terminator appears close , politically speaking , to being terminated .
As his options dwindle , Schwarzenegger has offered up ever more alarming suggestions , including an auction of some of the state 's most recognisable property holdings - among them San Quentin prison , home to California 's death row , the Del Mar racetrack near San Diego , familiar to fans of pulp fiction and films like The Grifters , and the Memorial Coliseum sports arena in Los Angeles .
It is unlikely any such fire sale will take place immediately – the legislature has turned down the chance to sell off San Quentin four years in a row , most recently earlier this year - but something in this crisis is going to have to give , somewhere .
"" There are thousands of buildings and land parcels throughout California that represent billions of dollars of equity , "" the governor 's office argues .
After tomorrow 's vote , it may be only a matter of time before the bidding begins ."
"Voters in California yesterday resoundingly rejected Arnold Schwarzenegger 's latest effort to dig the state out of a $ 21bn ( £ 14bn ) budget hole and boost his dwindling political credibility .
It was his third attempt at rescuing the state 's economy , and he passed only one measure ; freezing the pay of elected officials .
Schwarzenegger 's latest effort was a package of budget - balancing measures that he promised would provide a short - term patch for the current financial crisis and prevent future problems .
Instead , he now faces a $ 21.3bn budget deficit and a budget system that has not changed since he took office nearly six years ago .
"" I think he 's discovered that this job is a lot harder than he anticipated in a state of economic downturn , "" Treasurer Bill Lockyer said yesterday of the governor who came into office in 2003 promising to "" end the crazy deficit spending "" .
The Republican governor faces another tough round of budget negotiations after months spent haggling with politicians to close the state 's first budget shortfall , which was initially $ 42bn until June 2010 .
Schwarzenegger will be forced to spend much of his final year - and - a - half in office struggling with the same financial woes that led to the recall of his predecessor , instead of enacting the sweeping policy changes he once envisioned .
"" The biggest loser would be Arnold , "" said Dave McCuan , a political science professor at Sonoma State University .
"" It 's time to start looking for a cabinet post in the Obama administration or an ambassadorship someplace warm . ""
Lockyer said Schwarzenegger and politicans will have to reach a new budget agreement quickly , with tax revenue coming in far below projections .
Unless a compromise is struck by the end of June , the state could have trouble paying its bills by the end of July .
Political observers say Schwarzenegger and lawmakers will have little choice but to go after even politically sacred programmes such as schools .
An unusually high two - thirds vote threshold in the legislature for passing budgets and partisan polarisation could combine for a painful summer .
Last week , the governor said he will consider shortening the school year by seven days , laying off up to 5,000 state employees and taking money from local governments , which likely would translate into cuts in police and firefighting services .
Tens of thousands of teachers also face the prospect of redundancies .
Schwarzenegger 's warning did not sway voters , many of whom said they did not trust that the ballot propositions would do much to solve California 's budget trouble .
The majority of registered voters did not bother to vote at all .
Partial results from nearly 70 % of precincts reporting late yesterday showed only 19 % of voters had cast a ballot , according to the secretary of state 's office .
Chris Almanza , 55 , of Sacramento was among those who chose not to vote , in part because she was angry and frustrated at state lawmakers .
"" I 'm not going to vote because I do n't think it 's going to matter , "" Almanza said .
Schwarzenegger reiterated yesterday that he wanted to be remembered as a fighter for budget reform and said he would not be dissuaded by the overwhelming repudiation from voters ."
"America 's gas - guzzling automobiles were heading towards extinction yesterday as Barack Obama set strict limits on car exhaust emissions and directed producers to make a more fuel - efficient vehicle fleet .
The policy requires US auto makers to produce cars and trucks that achieve an average 35.5mpg by 2016 , and will reduce America 's carbon dioxide emissions by 30 % . ""
For the first time in history we have set in motion a national policy aimed at increasing gas mileage and decreasing greenhouse gas pollution for all new trucks and cars sold in the United States , "" Obama told state governors , including California 's Arnold Schwarzenegger , car industry executives and environmentalists in the White House rose garden .
Obama said America had paid a high price for its dependence on imported oil , and the change was long overdue .
"" What is all the more tragic is that we 've known about these costs in one way or another since the gas shortages of the 1970s .
And yet all too little has been done .
Calls for action rise and fall with the price of a barrel of oil , "" he said .
Environmentalists said the policy , which will be put in force by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transport , would do more to reduce global warming pollution than any of the other measures taken by Obama so far .
It would also lead to the overhaul of the US car industry .
Cars and trucks are responsible for about a quarter of America 's greenhouse gas emissions .
Obama said the change , which will improve today 's average 25mpg performance , was the equivalent of shutting down 194 coal plants or taking 58 m cars off the roads for a year .
It will cut greenhouse gas emissions by 900 m metric tonnes , and save the equivalent of last year 's imports of oil from Saudi Arabia , Venezuela , Libya and Nigeria combined .
The plan is the product of months of negotiations between the White House , struggling vehicle makers and the state of California .
America 's auto makers had spent years resisting efforts by California and 13 other states to set more stringent rules on car emissions .
The Bush -administration had also blocked California 's efforts to regulate car exhaust .
Schwarzenegger hailed yesterday 's deal as an historic compromise .
"" Three or four other presidential administrations have tried to do this and were n't successful , "" he said .
"" This president , after 120 days in office , has created the action that brought everyone together . ""
The deal was also a measure of the weakened state of America 's auto industry .
GM and Chrysler took a $ 25bn ( £ 16bn ) bailout last year .
The compromise was sweetened with further funds : on Monday Democrats held out the prospect of a further $ 50bn in loan guarantees under the climate change bill making its way through Congress .
In return , the car makers will drop a number of law suits against California and other states .
Yesterday 's plan will require auto makers to improve fuel efficiency by 5 % every year , starting in 2012 .
It does not bring a definitive end to America 's affair with the automobile – but passions are cooling .
While the new -standards in themselves offer no incentives for buying smaller cars , environmentalists said the move to cleaner and more efficient cars – across all vehicle classes – was an important landmark .
"" Even if people do n't change their driving habits , they will still be using a lot less gas , "" said Dan Becker of the Safe Climate Campaign .
"" In the meantime we can dramatically cut emissions and signal to the rest of the world that the US gets it and is getting serious about doing something about the thing we do worst , which is cars . ""
A senior administration official estimated it would cost an extra $ 1,300 to produce each car .
But Obama said yesterday that the car would pay for itself within three years through lower prices at the petrol pump .
He also praised hybrid cars – saying he was happy with the hybrid Ford SUV he drove in Chicago .
Yesterday 's move comes as the Obama administration tries to act on climate change on several fronts .
In Congress , Democrats face a dogged attempt by Republicans to stop or delay a climate change bill .
The Republicans say they plan to introduce some 400 amendments to the draft , which would put a cap on carbon emissions and compel electricity companies to get a proportion of their power from renewable energy sources ."
"For a man who is already enjoying his third incarnation - bodybuilder , movie star , politician - Arnold Schwarzenegger has been remarkably consistent about his approach to public life .
He set out his work philosophy in the 1977 documentary film Pumping Iron , in which he revealed how he managed to cultivate such gigantic , some would say grotesque , muscles . ""
Going through the pain barrier , that 's what makes the muscles grow , "" he says in his trademark glutinous Austrian accent .
"" There 's this pain , this aching , and going on and on and on .
That 's what divides a champion from a non - champion - having the guts to go through the pain barrier . ""
He carried this approach to success - repetitive masochism , you might call it - into his career in Hollywood .
In The Terminator , the 1984 film that elevated him into megastardom , he essentially plays himself in robotic form .
The poor old cyborg is shot at and bombed , mangled in a motorbike crash , run over by a lorry and incinerated before being torn in half at the waist .
Yet after each seemingly terminal disaster , he calmly gets up , dusts himself down and sets off again towards his ( very violent ) goal .
It 's all about going through the pain barrier , stupid .
And now , in his current role as governor of California , the pattern repeats itself again .
Schwarzenegger is the T-800 of American politics .
He has suffered knockbacks that long ago would have finished off a lesser mortal .
In 2005 , he was floored by a disastrous attempt to take on the public - sector unions that was roundly defeated in a referendum .
What did he do ?
He calmly got up , dusted himself down , and reinvented himself as an eco - friendly , post - partisan bridge - builder - the prototype , some people think , of Barack Obama 's presidency .
The ploy worked .
Within a year he was back ( just like he promised in all those films ) , trouncing his Democratic challenger at the polls to hang on to the governorship for another four years .
He was , it seemed , indestructible .
But not any more .
In the last few days , an element of doubt has started to attach itself to Arnie in a way that appears qualitatively different from previous setbacks .
The pain barrier ahead is now so daunting that close observers are questioning whether , this time , he has the guts to go through it .
As the governor of the most populous state in the US , Schwarzenegger is partially responsible for the wellbeing of 37 million people .
He has the burden of the world 's ninth - largest economy on his still muscular shoulders .
Until a year ago , he also had the benefit of California 's lavish wealth , which filled the state 's coffers and gave him the luxury to pursue his equally lavish ambitions .
But since then the California economy has tanked , dragging his budget - and potentially his entire reputation - down with it .
The figures are hideous .
By this summer the state 's budget deficit is expected to reach $ 21bn ( £ 13bn ) and by next , an astonishing $ 40bn ( £ 25bn ) .
Drastic cuts in state services look inevitable .
That could see tens of thousands of teachers and firefighters losing their jobs , almost 40,000 prisoners released early from jail , and benefits slashed for some of the poorest and most vulnerable in California society , including children and battered wives .
Schwarzenegger 's popularity rating , which used to be as healthy as his Hollywood box - office takings , has plummeted to a George Bushian 33 % .
"" This time it 's pretty much over for him , "" says Schwarzenegger 's biographer , Laurence Leamer . ""
He says that everything he has learned in life , all his metaphors , came from bodybuilding : the attitude that you do n't stop , you never give up , push on and you are always going to win in the end .
But it just does n't work any more .
The scale of the crisis is way beyond him now .
"" To be fair to Schwarzenegger , his current misery can , in large part , be put down to the peculiarities of this part of the world that make California notoriously difficult to govern .
The "" Golden State "" tends to amplify the peaks and troughs that are felt in other , less extreme regions of the US .
It is , as the stereotype suggests , the epitome of the American dream : when times are good they are , as Arnie would say , fantastic ! -
but when times are bad they are bloody awful .
California 's bureaucracy does not help .
The state 's obsession with referendums - known locally as "" propositions "" , and the sort of scheme currently being discussed by British political parties desperate to give power back to the disgruntled electorate - has , in fact , tied its finances up in knots .
Since the late 70s , property taxes have been capped , forcing public services to rely instead on revenue from personal income taxes .
That is fine when the economy is buoyant and jobs plentiful ; it is a recipe for budgetary disaster in a recession .
Ironically , it was one such downturn , and the $ 35bn budget gap that accrued , that gave Schwarzenegger his initial entree into politics .
The crisis helped unseat his Democratic predecessor , Gray Davis , in a special recall election in 2003 .
That Schwarzenegger has now fallen into precisely the same black hole as the man he ousted is perhaps poetic justice - but it also underlines a structural problem he is largely powerless to correct .
Schwarzenegger has , nonetheless , looked uncharacteristically impotent over the last few weeks .
In the past he has always managed to extract himself from troubles by leaning on his legendary charm , while also making powerful use of a machiavellian ability to spot an adversary 's weak spot and ruthlessly exploit it .
Once again , the skill is abundantly on display in Pumping Iron .
Dressed in uber-70s burgundy trousers and striped T - shirt , Schwarzenegger is asked how he has managed to win so many competitions ( he was Mr Olympia , the highest bodybuilding accolade , seven years in a row ) .
"" You have to do everything possible to win , no matter what , "" he begins with a huge grin .
"" On the day of the competition , if [ my rival ] comes to me in equally good shape as I am or , let 's say , 50 % better than I am , I spend with him one night .
I book us together in a room , to help him for tomorrow 's contest .
That night he will never forget .
I will mix him up .
He will come so ready , so strong .
But by the time the night is over , he will be ready to lose . ""
The striking thing today is that very little of this chilling killer instinct has been in evidence .
His tactic for dealing with the budget gap was to present voters with a raft of new propositions that he argued would begin to solve the crisis .
He argued for increased taxation , a reduced budget deficit , ring - fenced money for schools and reforms to the state 's discredited financial system .
Yet when it came to selling these ideas to an already disgruntled electorate , Schwarzenegger suddenly went awol .
He was nowhere to be seen in the TV and billboard advertising that pleaded with Californians to vote through the changes .
Although he personally fundraised half of the money lavished on the campaign , he let teachers and firefighters do the talking .
"" This is about California 's future and California 's legacy .
It is not about me , "" he said .
For Bill Whelan of the Hoover Institution , who advised Schwarzenegger in his early political career , such unprecedented diffidence from the governor speaks volumes .
"" With a 33 % approval rating , he realised that he was not the best spokesman for his own initiatives .
That was tough - a celebrity politician keeping himself off TV . ""
Not surprisingly , Schwarzenegger 's proposals were trashed by the voters last week : they rejected all but one of his six propositions .
Tellingly , the one reform they did sign up to was a pay freeze for top state officials .
The defeat leaves the governor 's budget , his plans and his potential legacy in tatters .
It is akin to The Terminator 's final scene , when Arnie the cyborg is finally crushed into a slither by a hydraulic machine , its electronic lifeforce apparently spent .
Schwarzenegger still has 18 months to go before he comes to the end of his term limits in January 2011 .
What time he has left now looks certain to be taken up with swingeing cuts that will inflict misery on millions - the governor himself almost certainly among them .
When the governor finally leaves his post , however , he will still be able to claim that he helped to put environmental issues on the US agenda .
In 2006 , this car fanatic who is said currently to own 12 vehicles - including a Hummer converted to run on biodiesel - was named as one of Vanity Fair 's green heroes .
And he has been seminal in pushing solar power , ocean protection measures , new regulations on toxic chemicals and tighter rules on car emissions that only last week Obama adopted nationwide .
His most futuristic idea , though , to create an infrastructure of hydgrogen fuel stations dubbed the "" hydrogen highway "" , has not moved forward at quite the clip he predicted .
With oil prices low again , the impetus behind hydrogen - powered cars has dissipated .
California has only 250 of the vehicles , while he had envisaged 2,000 by 2010 , and there are just 26 fuelling stations .
But he still gets top marks for trying .
Schwarzenegger 's hopes of rounding off the legacy with a push for universal healthcare and a deal over the water supply - California 's great looming catastrophe - are now all but dead .
He has even begun talking about allowing drilling for oil off the coast near Santa Barbara , a move so out of kilter with his eco - message that it reeks of desperation .
"" Oil companies are dangling big dollars in front of a cash - strapped state .
It 's very , very tempting for him , "" says Dan Jacobson of the campaign Environment California .
With the legacy in trouble , Schwarzenegger can probably also kiss goodbye to any thought of moving on to higher political echelons .
Rumours of a switch to the US Senate have circled for years ; indeed , after his electric speech to the Republican National Convention in 2004 , there was even talk among a select circle of party bigwigs of amending the constitution to allow this foreign - born American to stand for president .
But all that seems academic now .
Schwarzenegger himself has pooh - poohed any such intentions , saying he is keeping an open mind about his next reincarnation .
He may write a book , dabble in bodybuilding once more , engage with further environmentalism .
Whalen sees him starting a foundation or an initiative in his own name , or perhaps working for the Obama administration in some capacity .
There might even be a return to movie - making .
Schwarzenegger recently told a radio interviewer that he was up for anything , as long as the public wanted it . ""
Just say , ' Hey , Schwarzenschnitzel !
I think you should go back into movies and do True Lies 15 . '
"" This month he did make a celluloid comeback , of sorts .
His likeness makes a brief appearance in the new Terminator film , Terminator Salvation .
Schwarzenegger said he was too busy with his day job to actually join the shoot , so in the end he was digitally recreated , looking no older than he did in 1984 .
He spent not a minute learning his lines nor posing to camera .
He never saw the set .
Yet he enjoyed all the benefits of having his youthful image beamed down on audiences from the silver screen .
Given his present lot in life , that is the kind of hassle - free labour he might find appealing . '
This state is ungovernable '
How Californians rate Arnold Schwarzenegger
He 's not living up to any expectations , but I do n't know what the expectation was .
I do n't know what people were thinking they were going to get from him besides a film - star governor .
But right now the state of California is completely screwed .
We have a $ 21bn deficit , we 're seeking federal aid that we 're not going to get , and they 're cutting services all over the place , mostly for poor people .
If there was a politician or a governor who had built the relationships over time and worked within the system , they would have had a better understanding of how to make the machine run .
He does n't have that experience , nor does he have the desire .
For him , it 's a part that he 's playing for eight years .
It feels like he 's doing a part - time job , and to me it does n't seem like it 's really important to him .
It 'll be over soon and he 'll be able to move on to the next thing .
Jacob Davis , 32 , video producer , Los Angeles California is ungovernable .
It would n't matter who you put in there , the results would be the same : it would be deadlocked .
He 's done a reasonably good job with an impossibility .
He was swept into office when there was discontent with Gray Davis , but mainly with the energy crisis and the new car tax .
He campaigned on the repeal of the car tax , which he did , but now it 's back in effect .
So right there , that 's his obituary .
I did n't have any hopes for him - I do n't think most people did .
I 'm not too fond of him .
I 'm looking forward to having his signature on my diploma , but that 's about it out of that man .
Brendan White , 28 , law student , Davis I 'm disappointed
but , on the other hand , I do n't think it 's him .
It is the corrupt political machine , our system , that does n't work .
It 's tying his hands .
I 'm not a Schwarzenegger fan .
I admit I did vote for him , because I thought he was going to come in and clean house .
He offered change , he was going to make sweeping reforms that were going to make the state fiscally responsible .
No matter who it is , whether it 's Schwarzenegger or whoever it is , every politician comes in with high hopes .
Even Obama thinks he 's going to do grand things , but when you get in there , the system is n't going to allow it .
Somebody needs to clean the mess up .
It wo n't be him .
Hugh Cruickshank , 55 , fireplace construction and sales worker , San Anselmo
When he came into office , I remember I was staunchly opposed to the whole recall .
I think that Gray Davis was basically a scapegoat for the entire Enron thing that ended up screwing California .
I was n't a fan .
I 'm not really one of those people who thinks that actors can come in and fill these roles in politics and that their celebrity will somehow cure their defects .
I think that he 's done an OK job of being somewhat bipartisan on things , but he 's dropped the ball significantly with regard to education in California , and especially the housing issues .
At the same time , it 's wrong to put it entirely on him .
The California legislature is ridiculous .
California is a country .
We 're the fifth largest economy in the world .
To shake up California is to shake up a big country
and I do n't think he 's done that .
Kevin Saman , 26 , attorney , Los Angeles
I do find it hard to point to things that he really has substantively done differently from other politicians .
He has n't done a good job of reining in the government , but I want to be careful about how much blame I put on him .
I do n't necessarily blame him for the mess we 're in .
He did n't cause it , but he did n't fix it .
I 'm from New York , and I had pretty low aspirations for how I wanted my state to be run , but I think California met those expectations .
Like all politicians , he 's try to bend the will of the state to do his bidding .
But unlike some of our national politicians , he has n't tried to panic people .
He 's tried to bring to our attention the severity of what we 're going through .
He 's actually been very patient and responsible about how he 's asked us to confront the problems that we 're facing .

"In the first Terminator movie he tried to extinguish all human life .
Now , as governor of California , Arnold Schwarzenegger wants to make textbooks history in favour of digital formats .
Schwarzenegger , trying to plug a budget hole of $ 24.3bn ( £ 15bn ) , thinks he can make savings by getting rid of what he decries as expensive textbooks .
The governor is serious about an idea that might make Gutenberg turn in his grave .
He appeared in class yesterday to push an idea he set out in the San Jose Mercury News newspaper .
"" It 's nonsensical and expensive to look to traditional hard - bound books when information today is so readily available in electronic form , "" Schwarzenegger wrote .
"" Especially now , when our school districts are strapped for cash and our state budget deficit is forcing further cuts to classrooms , we must do everything we can to untie educators ' hands and free up dollars so that schools can do more with fewer resources . ""
Schwarzenegger points out that California last year set aside $ 350 m for school books and argues that even if teachers have to print out some of the material , it will be far cheaper than regularly buying updated textbooks .
Schwarzenegger plans to launch the scheme in August next year when California 's high - school pupils will have access to online maths and science texts .
They would also use a digital textbook such as Sony reader , which can hold the same information as up to 160 books .
Ebook readers are gaining in popularity .
Yesterday , Apple presented an upcoming application for its iPhone , that allows users to buy books , including textbooks , on their phones and also copy and email large chunks . ""
Basically kids are feeling as comfortable with their electronic devices as I was with my pencils and crayons .
Textbooks are outdated , in my opinion , "" Schwarzenegger told pupils.""For so many years , we 've been trying to teach the kids exactly the same way . ""
Holding up four large books he joked : "" I can use these for the curls , "" in a nod to his bodybuilding days before he became one of Hollywood 's biggest stars .
But some teachers wonder whether Schwarzenegger 's idea of getting rid of textbooks might end up costing more not less , with digital textbooks going for $ 300 .
Kristina Fierro , a high school teacher in Bakersfield , said it would be expensive to get the materials , train the teachers and train the students to use the materials properly .
She was also worried about the students once they are out of the classroom .
"" I would say out of a class of 30 , maybe 10 or less ... have a computer at home .
The governor has n't given many details about the programme , but so far the digital addition is n't looking like a subtraction for California 's budget , "" she told KGET , a local TV station .
In an effort to cut the state budget deficit , Schwarzenegger has signed an executive order to scrap funding on contracts from 1 March , and bar state agencies from entering into new ones .
Between 2005 and 2008 , the state of California signed an average of 65,000 contracts a year , which ranged from peanut butter for prison inmates to consultants for computer system upgrades .
This year the number stands at about 36,000 .
Schwarzenegger said : "" Every state agency and department will scrutinise how every penny is spent on contracts to make sure the state is getting the best deal for every taxpayer dollar . """
"Arnold Schwarzenegger plans to drop traditional textbooks in favour of online material .
But is it a good idea ?
No , according to Professor Chris Husbands , the dean of the culture and pedagogy faculty at the University of London 's Institute of Education , who says the plans are little more than a "" cheapskate attempt to reduce costs under the guise of modernising resources "" .
While the web is brilliant for collecting information , scanning and picking out facts , he says , it is less good for higher - level skills such as evaluation and critical understanding .
"" I was taught to precis text at school and I 'm not sure that children are taught to critically evaluate the information they can easily find on the web , "" he said .
"" There 's something about print that 's a more efficient way of pulling together and preserving text that people can access in a democratic way . ""
Seb Schmoller , the chief executive of the Association for Learning Technology , said the move could be discriminatory .
"" If students have an entitlement to text books but are instead required to access books online , this may distance or exclude them from the content , "" he said .
"" Online content might be more up - to - date and more cheaply available , but not everybody will have a device or Internet connection to access it .
Books and online content each have their own different flexibilities .
You can dip into pages , read them anywhere and write in notes .
On the other hand you ca n't easily search them or cut and paste from them . ""
He said the online support that some publishers provide with textbooks is itself costly to produce , as is the basic content of text books and their updating .
Claiming that putting text books online will save money is probably an oversimplification .
Previous attempts by British ministers to advocate the use of modern technology in the classroom have come unstuck .
In 2007 the former education secretary , Alan Johnson , came under fire for recommending children use the free online encyclopedia Wikipedia for schoolwork .
But things have changed since .
Information and communication technology replaced science at the heart of the revamped primary curriculum unveiled earlier this year , which decided that children should be able to use Google in their first year of school and publish websites and podcasts by the age of 11 .
•
This article was amended on Wednesday 10 June 2009 to correct some quotations from Seb Schmoller of the Association for Learning Technology ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger has suggested replacing textbooks with digital formats .
The governor of California , who announced the plan in a classroom yesterday , argues : "" It 's nonsensical and expensive to look to traditional hard - bound books when information today is so readily available in electronic form . ""
He goes on : "" Especially now , when our school districts are strapped for cash and our state budget deficit is forcing further cuts to classrooms , we must do everything we can to untie educators ' hands and free up dollars so that schools can do more with fewer resources . ""
Do you agree ?
Is this just about trying to save money – the governor has a budget hole of $ 24.3bn to plug – or a sensible education policy that will really benefit children ?
Should the idea be adopted in the UK too ?"
"During his lengthy announcement about replacing text books in California 's public schools with online ebooks Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger only made one brief reference to the environmental benefits this would bring .
Until just recently such a seemingly obvious opportunity to seize a piece of the environmental high ground would not have been missed .
But instead Schwarzenegger focused on the financial benefits , and merely briefly mumbled something about saving a few trees in the process .
The big man 's eco - shyness may be more than an oversight but part of the growing awareness among policymakers of e - missions –
the greenhouse gases incurred by the internet .
When you take into account the additional energy used to make the computers used to read the ebooks , the data servers supporting the services and the internet infrastructure , the truth is that it 's far from clear whether there is any environmental benefit at all .
True , millions of trees may well be spared the axe , not to mention the environmental damage caused by the pulping industry – it is the third largest consumer of fossil fuels and uses 10 litres of water to make just one piece of A4 paper .
Yet even in the face of such waste this still does n't necessarily make ebooks a greener option .
Take the newspaper industry for example .
Given that in the US alone Sunday newspapers are responsible for more than half a million trees being felled each week , you might think that by reading the Guardian online you are reducing your environmental impact .
But it turns out it may in fact depend on precisely what you 're reading this on .
An optimist may choose to cling to research which suggests that reading your newspaper via a wireless palmtop computer produces up to 140 times less CO2 and 67 times less water than a paper version .
But before you start congratulating yourself consider another more recent , and arguably more thorough , study which took account of the energy that goes into manufacturing devices and the e - missions entailed through regular downloading .
According to this Swedish study , reading a newspaper online for 30 minutes a day produces more emissions than reading a paper version .
The reverse is true if you read them for just 10 minutes .
Quite apart from suggesting that it 's greener to read faster , it 's a reflection of the e - missions entailed by having a computer plugged in and downloading .
In other words , when reading a paper online , it 's the electricity used by the computer that is the biggest carbon contributor .
In light of this the study ( funded by the Swedish newspaper industry ) goes on to show that by far the greenest option is to switch to dedicated e - reader devices like the Amazon 's Kindle DX , and Schwarzenegger would do well to do the same .
That 's because devices like this not only allow content to be downloaded wirelessly without needing to go through a PC as well , but also because their novel electronic - paper displays use so little energy .
Once an image is displayed on the screen it requires almost no power to keep it there , thus their operational energy requirements miniscule compared to other devices .
So California , by all means roll out the ebooks .
But if you want to save the environment as well as money then you may want to roll out e - readers in the process ."
"Pearson , the educational publisher which also owns the Financial Times , is among the day 's biggest FTSE 100 fallers .
Its shares are down 14.5p to 622.5p , with traders attributing some of the fall to events in California .
The Terminator himself , Arnold Schwarzenegger , has apparently decided to cut back on school text books in the state where he is governor , to help fill a big hole in its finances .
Pearson is the world 's biggest educational publisher and so is likely to be hit if this decision is a ) implemented and b ) followed elsewhere .
But Pearson does have a strong online presence too , so any effects would surely be limited .
Even so , the company is the second biggest loser in the leading index .
The FTSE 100 itself is managing to stay in positive territory so far , up 15.47 points at 4420.69 despite a hesistant start on Wall Street .
Thomas Cook is leading the way , up 17.5p to 231.75p on hopes that the insolvency of 52 % shareholder Arcandor will lead to a more secure owner of the stake , or even a full bid for the business .
Among the mid - caps housebuilder Berkeley is now down 53.5p at 771.5p as Citigroup placed 16.1 m shares at 701p each on behalf of the troubled Saudi group Saad , around 15 % of the company .
There is also talk that another 4 m shares have been sold in a separate deal .
Saad - which before the sales owned just over 28 % - refused to comment on individual investments , but a spokesman for Berkeley said the company understood it was the Saudi firm which had sold the shares ."
"They have weighed down satchels , been hurled across classrooms and defaced with lewd graffiti by schoolchildren across the ages .
But the humble textbook looks to be going the way of the Walkman – in California at least .
Arnold Schwarzenegger has announced that pupils will soon only be learning from digital texts , and experts in the UK said yesterday the paperless classroom is becoming a reality here too . ""
Today our kids get their information from the internet , downloaded onto their iPods , and in Twitter feeds to their cell phones ...
So why are California 's public school students still forced to lug around antiquated , heavy , expensive textbooks ? "" asked the Terminator actor , in his capacity as state governor .
The move will substantially reduce the $ 350 m ( £ 216 m ) California spends on school books and other instructional materials each year .
Where California leads , others have often followed .
The sunshine state added avocado to sushi rolls , popularised jogging , and , in Silicon Valley , revolutionised the world of computing .
Graham Taylor , director of educational and academic publishing at the Publishers ' Association , in the UK , said : "" In this country , even more than in the US , there 's a 25-year history of making learning resources available digitally .
I would estimate that 20 % of learning resources delivered to primary and secondary schools in the UK are already purely digital . ""
That has probably been achieved mostly in the past 10 years .
Ever since Tony Blair came in and talked about ' education , education , education , ' at least £ 2bn has been invested in learning technology , and if things carry on in the same vein , perhaps 40 % of educational resources will be digital in 10 years time . ""
Publishers such as Hodder Education already offer a range of online resources alongside conventional textbooks , and Pearson sells electronic versions of most of its textbooks , either in interactive form , or as a straight portable document format ( pdf ) .
Last year , Pearson earned £ 960 m revenue from its digital products and services – around a fifth of its total revenue .
Many teachers also like the idea of not spending hours photocopying worksheets , and not teaching from old books annotated with pupils ' scribbles .
One electronic believer , writing on the TeachPaperless blog , wrote : "" I 've spent my entire academic career – both as a student and as a teacher – in the humanities and social sciences .
The reason I do n't need a textbook in English class or in history class is because I can grab anything I need from the internet or the library ; the reason I do n't need a textbook in teaching a foreign language is because of the vast resources of the web and the resourcefulness of my own experience working with the language . ""
But the textbook is n't about to die a sudden death – especially not in the UK , where many children still do not have access to the internet at home and thus have every right to utter the postmodern excuse of not being able to download their homework .
"" There 's this perception that everyone has a computer and internet access these days , but that is not the case .
There are still one million children who do n't have a computer at home in England and Wales , which works out as over 30 % of the school population , "" according to a spokeswoman for Becta , the government agency which promotes the use of IT in schools .
Although all UK schools now have broadband connections , IT provision is still nowhere near good enough to cope with a 100 % paperless classroom , according to Citigroup analysts . ""
Technology architecture will have to be upgraded to ensure that speed of response in testing is equal for all students .
The financial investment in this current economic environment would be a heavy burden .
"" Becta says that schools currently average one computer between three students .
But according to Ros Sutherland , professor in education at Bristol University , who co - authored a book called Improving Classroom Learning with ICT , schools really need one computer per child if they are all using all digital resources .
Plus , she says , books offer something that digital resources just ca n't replicate .
"" You can flick back and forth in them quickly , you can scribble in them , it 's easy to share one between a number of students , "" she said .
"" Though theoretically electronic textbooks can be much more interactive , the current reality is that a lot of them are little more than pdf versions of the paper book , "" she added .
"" A colleague of mine the other day got it right when he said that if you could invent anything that 's as powerful as the book in the next hundred years we 'll have done well . """
"It is hard to envisage a no - entry sign tagged to a towering redwood tree .
But the recession – writ on an epic scale in California 's proposal to close 220 state parks – is forcing the American public to confront the closure of the great outdoors .
Arnold Schwarzenegger , California 's governor , is trying to make up a $ 26bn ( £ 16bn ) budget shortfall , and has suggested that California can no longer afford to run its parks .
Conservationists are meanwhile arguing that California can not afford not to .
And this week the federal government appeared to partly agree , with the National Parks Service threatening to seize some of the sites if Schwarzenegger goes ahead with the closures .
The proposed shutdown of the parks would affect 80 % of California 's nature reserves , historic sites and recreation areas , and restrict access to 30 % of the state 's coastline .
Affected areas would stretch from the mountains of the Sierra Nevadas to the beaches and wetlands of Big Sur , and to the deserts of San Diego , where some of the last peninsular bighorn sheep roam .
California is not alone .
The crisis has also exposed hitherto hidden casualties of the economic downturn , with states from Oregon to Illinois , and New York to Tennessee , struggling to stretch resources .
Other states have proposed budgets that would put closed signs on parks and historic sites , though none so far has adopted measures as extreme as those being put forward in California .
Pennsylvania presented a budget proposal last month that would shut 35 of its 117 state parks .
Several states have been forced to scale back opening hours and services , and dismiss rangers , faced with cuts to budgets – ranging from 39 % in Georgia to 57 % in Idaho .
The federal government does not have the resources to save more than a handful of California 's parks , let alone all of those across the US .
Nonetheless , the National Parks Service issued a letter warning Schwarzenegger that it would use protection clauses under the original land deeds to the states , so as to take control of six parks in the San Francisco area , the dunes around the Big Sur and elsewhere .
"" We really are just looking for ways we can keep those places open , "" said David Siegenthaler , the National Parks Service 's manager for the state of California .
"" In these economic times it is probably even more important that people have access to good places . ""
Conservationists believe parks can withstand a year or so of closure without lasting harm .
But fewer ranger stations will mean increased risk of vandalism , and less maintenance will lead to environmental degradation .
"" If it is a year or two I do n't think the damage will be a long lasting situation , "" said Philip McKnelly , director of the National Association of State Park Directors .
"" But ultimately it is going to show as damage to resources . ""
A survey of state park directors in mid - May suggested most states had cut spending on parks by 15 % in their 2008 budgets , and were considering steeper cuts in the next fiscal year , which started on 1 July for many .
In California , the loss will be immediate , conservationists say , putting some of the state 's most visited sites off - limits .
Critics also fear the closures could be irreversible . ""
Once those places are closed it becomes very difficult to re - open them , "" said Traci Verardo Torres , of the California State Parks Foundation , which is protesting against the proposal .
The impact would be felt from the northern limits of the Sierra Nevada mountains -- with the proposed shutdown of a park in memory of the doomed members of the Donner party , stranded travellers who resorted to cannibalism during the winter snows -- to the deserts south of San DiegoSchwarzenegger 's proposal forces the closure of the only camp grounds inside the giant redwood forests to the north , and it blocks access to Lake Tahoe , though the site is shared by California with Nevada . ""
All of the parks in Lake Tahoe are proposed for closure , "" said Verardo Torres .
""
If [ they ] close there would not be a way legally for the public to access the lakes .
"" The order would also shutter urban tourist attractions such as San Francisco 's Angel Island -- the Ellis Island of America 's Pacific Coast , where the barracks where Chinese migrants were quarantined are preserved .
It is not immediately clear , in any case , how California will put vast tracts of land off - limits . ""
They would have to fence it and guard it to keep people out , and the effort they would have to extend to keep people out would cost just as much to run the park , "" said Siegenthaler .
California could be digging itself into a yet deeper financial hole by its actions , some say .
Many of the parks are a source of revenue for state and local communities . ""
Each visitor to a state park is worth $ 57 per visit .
The parks have generated millions throughout California , "" said Tim Gibbs , programme manager at the National Parks Conservation Association .
"" It 's almost as if they are shooting themselves in the foot . """
"The easiest way to evaluate the achievement of one Arnold Schwarzenegger , the son of a Styrian police chief who went on to become the world 's beefiest movie star and governor of California , is to note the travails of those who tried to emulate him .
Dolph Lundgren 's acting career has barely kept beating after a succession of vapid straight - to - DVD action flicks , while Jean Claude van Damme 's most notable recent performance was playing himself in the confessional JCVD , in which he pitifully reflects on his desperate fall from grace in a six - minute single take .
Steven Seagal , meanwhile , finds himself in a similar position to Lundgren .
Although , unlike the Swede , he has become so out of shape that a stunt double does the honours in many of his fight sequences .
None of the above can honestly be said to be in any huge demand , although Lundgren may be set for a brief comeback in Sylvester Stallone 's forthcoming action romp The Expendables .
Schwarzenegger , on the other hand , is so badly missed in the movies since his shift into politics that the producers of the latest in the Terminator franchise felt the need to shoehorn a CGI version of him into their film .
Meanwhile , recent comments in the New York Times from the Governator 's friend and former colleague Tom Arnold suggesting that a new film featuring Schwarzenegger is being planned have been immediately seized upon by eager bloggers hoping to see an Arnie comeback .
It 's easy to see why .
Between 1982 and 1994 , Schwarzenegger succeeded in inventing himself as an entirely new type of movie star , a Herculean figure perfectly positioned to stride the Hollywood stage in the larger - than - life 80s , an era in which the action movie reached its zenith ( and arguably , its nadir ) .
Never a fabulous actor , Arnie , like Clint Eastwood before him , cruised along almost wholly on the strength of a captivating screen presence .
For fantastical fare such as Conan the Barbarian or Total Recall , his unlikely physical proportions and idiosyncratic , cheeky charisma combined to allow audiences to suspend their disbelief : once they had accepted that an 18-stone , 6 ft 2 in behemoth could make a decent leading man , gaping plotholes seemed to wither into insignifance .
Since Schwarzenegger - who , do n't forget , won the Mr Olympia contest seven times - exited , there have been attempts to cook up a worthy replacement , with little success .
The Rock , aka Dwayne Johnson , emerging from the equally unlikely field of professional wrestling , and Vin Diesel , a former bouncer , both made claims to the Austrian Oak 's action hero crown , but each seemed to zoom through remarkably short - lived purple patches and move straight to the sort of family - orientated comedic roles that Schwarzenegger took in later years , playing babysitters and , in Johnson 's case , the Tooth Fairy .
Schwarzenegger is currently ineligible to run for president , as he was not born in the US .
He must step down as California governor after two terms later this year .
While there remains the possibility that he could run for the US Senate in 2010 , Arnold 's suggestion that his friend might be up for a True Lies - style action tale with James Cameron on board as director does not sound too far - fetched .
Arnie would no doubt find himself in some considerable demand , but a return to action fare at the age of 62 might be inadvisable .
On the other hand , Harrison Ford , 67 , recently enjoyed considerable box office success in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull , while Sylvester Stallone , 63 , is enjoying something of a comeback following a return to the roles of Rocky and Rambo .
If Schwarzenegger does return to acting , expect him to make wise choices .
The actor has always been an astute picker , and worked hard in his mid - period to ensure that he was involved with the right people .
It was he who got hold of the rights to the Philip K Dick novellette
We Can Remember It for You Wholesale and brought Paul Verhoeven in to direct it as Total Recall in 1990 .
And he was bright enough to realise that a move into comedy might prove a wise move in the latter part of the 1980s , long before his physical prowess really began to fade .
Even so , there is the risk that a comeback might prove to be the first serious mistake of Schwarzenegger 's career .
Trading off past glories is never a wise move , and he would risk becoming a caricature of himself if he chose the wrong roles .
It 's also arguable that Arnie was long past his peak period as an acting star by the time he replaced recalled Democratic governor Gray Davis in 2003 .
True Lies is probably the last of his films that won plaudits from the critics , and that was way back in 1994 ( though it 's still getting people talking ) .
What 's your view on a potential Schwarzenegger comeback ?
Would you love to see him return to the screen to show Christian Bale and Daniel Craig how it really ought to be done ?
Or would you rather be left with memories of bombastic 80s and 90s classics such as Predator , Total Recall and the two Terminator films ?
If he does return , what sort of films do you think late - period Arnie would be suited for ?"
"Eunice Kennedy Shriver , founder of the Special Olympics , younger sister of former president John F Kennedy , and mother - in - law of California 's governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , has died at the age of 88 .
A statement from her family said she died in the early hours of this morning in hospital in Hyannis , Cape Cod .
She had suffered a number of strokes in recent years .
The town of Hyannis is closely associated with the Kennedy family and it has a museum commemorating JFK .
"" We have always been honoured to share our mother with people of goodwill the world over who believe , as she did , that there is no limit to the human spirit , "" her family members said in a statement .
Shriver was noted for her charity work with children , and launched the Special Olympic Games in 1968 , in which 190 countries now participate .
Her interest in working with people with learning difficulties was attributed to her closeness to her sister Rosemary , who underwent a lobotomy at the age of 23 – a then fashionable supposed remedy for mood swings and depression – that left her incapacitated for life .
Rosemary died in hospital aged 86 , four years ago , with her sister by her side .
Shriver was awarded her country 's highest civilian honour , the Presidential Medal of Freedom , in 1984 , and was still working daily at the head office of the Special Olympics into her late 70s .
In 1953 , she married Robert Sargent Shriver , who became ambassador to France , the first director of the Peace Corps and an unsuccessful vice - presidential candidate in 1972 .
Shriver was the fifth of nine children of the formidable Boston Irish politician and businessman Senator Joseph Kennedy , and his wife Rose .
Her siblings included John , the president who was assassinated in 1963 , and Robert , who was assassinated five years later .
Her youngest brother , Edward , is still a serving senator 47 years after he was first elected , despite battling a brain tumour .
Her sisters include Jean Kennedy Smith , who served as US ambassador to Ireland under Bill Clinton , and her daughter Maria is married to Arnold Schwarzenegger .
So many tragedies befell her family that some nicknamed it the Curse of the Kennedys .
Her elder brother Joseph , a pilot , was killed in the second world war ; her sister Kathleen , who married into an aristocratic English family , the Devonshires , was widowed at 24 and died in a plane crash aged 28 ; Edward 's career was overshadowed by the 1969 scandal when the car he was driving ran off a bridge at Chappaquiddick , drowning his passenger , Mary Jo Kopechne .
John F Kennedy Jr , son of the president , died in 1999 when the plane he was flying crashed into the sea on the way to a family wedding at Hyannisport .

"If you could combine their features into one specimen of supreme manliness , their biceps would be as big as the forelimb of an ox and their neck as wide as an oak tree .
The fusion of Sylvester Stallone , Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis would be truly impressive to behold .
They are not , yet , being genetically welded into one ; but the three actors are being brought together into one film in what is being billed as the action hero dream team .
The Expendables , scheduled for release next summer , will see Stallone lead a team of mercenaries on a mission to overthrow a South American dictator .
The film will see the three actors brought together for the first time since 1991 , when they attended openings of their ill - fated restaurant venture , Planet Hollywood .
Speaking at the Venice film festival , where he is receiving a special award , Stallone explained the thinking behind the movie .
"" I wanted to do a film that was more about men , just doing things that we did back in the 80s and 90s with films that were a little bit more men on men . ""
Schwarzenegger confirmed he would be making a cameo appearance in The Expendables .
In an interview with a fan website , he described the scene , poking fun at his and Stallone 's trademark verbal dexterity .
"" I walk out of a hotel or out of a office building and [ Stallone ] will walk up and we will bump into each other and there will be some mumbling and then we will walk off . ""
Stallone said his ambition was "" to find certain personalities that never would ever work together normally and put them altogether .
It 's like a dream team "" .
He certainly has built the ideal lineup for anyone who likes their actors to be built like prize bulls .
In addition to the big three , Stallone has also brought on board Mickey Rourke , flush from his success in The Wrestler , the Ultimate Fighting Championship star Randy Couture and the Chinese martial artist Jet Li ."

"Voters will be given the right to demand the recall of MPs , Gordon Brown announcedtoday , as he outlined a series of constitutional reforms designed to symbolise a fresh approach to politics in the wake of the expenses scandal .
Hereditary peers will eventually lose their seats in the House of Lords , and a referendum to abolish Britain 's first - past - the - post electoral system will be introduced under plans to win back disillusioned Labour voters tempted to support the Liberal Democrats .
In an echo of the Californian system , which allowed Arnold Schwarzenegger to become the state 's governor , the prime minister pledged to introduce a new law that will allow constituents to launch a petition to challenge their MP .
Declaring that some MPs from all parties , including Labour , had "" let our country down "" , Brown said : "" Never again should it be said of any MP that they are in it for what they can get ; all of us should be in parliament for what we can give . ""
And so where there is proven financial corruption by an MP and in cases where wrongdoing has been demonstrated but parliament fails to act , we will give constituents the right to recall their MP .
"" There has been nervousness among some ministers about introducing this measure amid fears that it could encourage hardline activists to move against MPs on flimsy evidence .
Ministers cite the example of Julie Kirkbride , the Conservative MP for Bromsgrove , who was forced to agree to stand down at the height of the expenses scandal after falling victim to a campaign run by an activist from the Respect party .
But Brown made clear that voters would only be able to trigger a recall of their MP if there is evidence of wrongdoing .
This is likely to mean that the cross - party Commons standards and privileges committee would have to uncover wrongdoing .
The committee then recommends a punishment which is voted on by all MPs .
The recall would probably be triggered if MPs voted against punishment .
A long - held dream of constitutional reformers was heralded in Brown 's speech when he said Labour 's election manifesto would include a pledge to hold a referendum on electoral reform .
"" There is now a stronger case than ever that MPs should be elected with the support of more than half their voters – as they would be under the alternative voting system , "" the prime minister said .
"" And so I can announce today that in Labour 's next manifesto there will be a commitment for a referendum to be held early in the next parliament , it will be for the people to decide whether they want to move to the alternative vote . ""
Aides said Brown himself would campaign for the change .
Under this system , Westminster 's current 646 parliamentary constituencies – 650 at the next election – would be retained .
Instead of placing a cross against one candidate 's name , voters would rank candidates in order of 1,2 , 3 and so on .
This would mean that MPs in each constituency would be elected on a more proportional basis .
Purists will say this does not amount to proportional representation because there would not be multi - member constituencies , elected for example on the single transferable vote , or a top - up list to ensure the Commons as a whole better reflects the national share of the votes .
The late Lord Jenkins of Hillhead recommended a system in his landmark 1998 report which combined this final top - up element with AV .
This was known as AV Plus .
Hereditary peers will also be phased out , the prime minister announced , "" to make the House of Lords an accountable and democratic second chamber for the very first time "" .
Brown was careful not to say whether a reformed second chamber would be fully or partly elected ."
"Harriet Harman today urged movie star and California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to "" terminate "" a website which allows people to rate prostitutes .
The Labour deputy leader told delegates at the Labour conference : "" There is now a website … where pimps put women on sale for sex and then men who 've had sex with them put their comments online .
It is PunterNet and fuels the demand for prostitutes . ""
Harman said the site was based in California but had "" pages and pages "" of women for sale in London .
"" I 've raised it with the US ambassador to London and I 've called on California 's governor , Arnie Schwarzenegger , to close it down . ""
Harman said it should not be difficult for the star to "" terminate PunterNet "" . ""
And I 've got news for him :
if he does n't , I 'll be back , "" she quipped .
Harman said the British government had made "" determined progress towards equality "" in the past 12 months .
"" It 's been a year of promises made and promises kept , "" she said .
"" For us , for Labour , equality is not just a slogan
it 's what we 're about .
"" It 's a way of life …
It 's about the right of a disabled person to work on equal terms .
It 's about the right of a woman who works part - time not to be excluded from the pension scheme .
Its about the right not being written off as too old .
Equality matters to us because it 's a fundamental human right to be treated fairly . ""
Harman said the 22 % pay gap between men and women was "" just not acceptable in this day and age "" .
"" We will make every employer publish on average how much they pay their women and how much they pay their men , "" she said .
"" I know this is controversial but good employers will have nothing to fear and bad employers will have nowhere to hide .
"" The government remains committed to extending maternity rights from six months to a year , she said .
And the party was fighting back against the British National party .
Turning her fire on the Tories , Harman accused David Cameron 's party of "" pretending to be progressive "" but warned it would actually turn the clock back . ""
They opposed gay rights , they opposed tax credits and the plan to cut childcare .
They oppose the new equality bill , "" she said .
"" We 've built up support for families – do n't let the Tories wreck it . ""
Harman branded this Labour 's "" fightback conference "" and vowed the party would fight for fairness and equality "" and – most importantly – fight to win "" ."
"For sale : one dystopian science fiction franchise .
Remains financially lucrative , but has seen better days from a critical perspective .
Arnold Schwarzenegger not included .
Think you can do a better job of reviving James Cameron 's man versus the machines series than McG managed on recent effort Terminator Salvation ?
Well you now have the chance - provided
you have a spare $ 60 m ( £ 37.7 m ) with which to buy the rights .
Terminator is currently owned by Hollywood producers Derek Anderson and Victor Kubicek , under the suitably sci - fi moniker Halcyon , who engaged the services of McG to work on the critically derided fourth outing in the series , starring the very shouty Christian Bale .
The movie has so far conjured up $ 371 m worldwide , easily making back its $ 200 m budget - and that 's before the DVD has even been released .
However , according to a report in the LA Times , Halcyon and a couple of associated companies are facing bankruptcy over a dispute with one of the hedge funds that financed their initial purchase of the rights .
Hence the fire sale .
For those of you who did not enjoy Salvation , this is probably good news , especially since McG has been talking up a prospective sequel , set in London in the present day , and possibly exploring the time travel aspect of the series more closely .
While that sounds like an intriguing prospect , it 's likely that any new owners would want to bring in their own man , and possibly their own ideas .
On the other hand , Halcyon reckon Sony , which distributed the film outside of the US , might be interested in stumping up the cash , and the Japanese firm would presumably have some interest in maintaining the continuity of a movie which made it more than a few greenbacks .
However things pan out , it seems to me that this is a series which needs to restore its basic aesthetic if it 's to go much further .
Give us a relentless Terminator destroying everything in its path in order to track down and eliminate a hero or heroine we actually care about , and the chances are we 'll flock to see the movie .
And by the time the next film is made , Arnie himself might just be available again to play the T12 , a really old and knackered version of the T800 , which struggles just to get out of bed in the morning , let alone go chasing young resistance fighters through the streets of LA .
Elsewhere this week , could this be our first glimpse of Seth Rogen as the Green Hornet ?
Splash TV provides this pap video footage of the shoot that 's currently taking place in LA .
Rogen , who 's also written the screenplay with regular partner Evan Goldberg , has promised to slim down to play the masked avenger , but I 'm sceptical over whether that 's really him in the video .
It could just be a stunt double - he looks more like his normal self in this recent snap as Britt Reid , the Hornet 's alter ego .
Keened - eyed observers will remember that this is a project that has experienced all sorts of problems already .
Kung Fu Hustle 's Stephen Chow was originally on board to play Kato and direct the movie ; he then stepped down from the director 's role ( to be replaced by Michel Gondry ) but agreed to continue in the role made famous by Bruce Lee in the 60s TV series .
And then he was gone altogether , to be replaced by little known Taiwanese star Jay Chou .
I 'm still excited to see what Rogen and Gondry have come up with here , however .
Finding the right line between comic book camp , an absorbing storyline and believable action sequences is never an easy task , but if Rogen and Goldberg are on Superbad form , we could yet be in for a treat .
The great news is that Christoph Waltz , so outstanding as the "" Jew Hunter "" in Quentin Tarantino 's Inglourious Basterds , has been drafted in to play the villain .
Nicolas Cage apparently dropped out at the last minute because he found the character , a Los Angeles crime lord , too one - dimensional .
Ahem .
That 's it for this week .
Would you pay $ 60 m for Terminator Salvation ?
And would you continue with the current timeline , try and reboot it again , or put the T800s in the can for good ?
And what do you reckon to the Green Hornet ?
Can Rogen and co cut it ?"
"Imagine what it is like to open the bonnet of your car , stand on top of the engine and be hoisted 85 m above the North Sea on a perilously narrow pole .
The view on a clear day is breathtaking , but when the wind is blowing so hard the whole contraption swings 4 m from side to side , it is grim – even for Leif Bolther .
This 51-year - old Swede , with forearms that would shame Arnold Schwarzenegger , is a seasoned technician in the wind industry .
Blooded in the Norwegian offshore oil sector , Bolther has worked in the remotest parts of China and India , but still admits : "" It can be hard up there in the terrible cold and freezing rain . ""
The tough but affable Swede is part of a burgeoning workforce promising a renewable revolution far out to sea .
It will replicate the earlier North Sea oil industry , except that it is carbon - free and a vital tool in the battle against global warming .
Bolther works for the turbine manufacturer Siemens in Danish and Swedish waters , where much of the early running has been made in the offshore wind industry .
Lillgrund , located 10 km off the coast close to the median line with Denmark , is Sweden 's biggest wind farm .
The 48 turbines produce 110MW of power , enough to light 60,000 homes .
But this week Britain will unveil much more radical plans for this side of the North Sea .
The Crown Estate on Wednesday will give briefings on what is known as Round Three ( R3 ) licensing awards , which will take the industry out into much deeper waters .
Shortlists have been drawn up and the Crown Estate will soon announce which companies and consortia have been chosen .
Nine areas , including the Dogger Bank , acreage off Norfolk and the Firth of Forth , have been designated for development .
The third licensing round is a step change for the UK offshore industry , offering developers the chance to build 25GW of new power .
Under rounds one and two , which started in 2000 , 8GW can be developed .
Combined , the total of 33GW would represent more than 10 times what is produced from wind power today .
That would help Britain meet its European Union - agreed targets of producing 20 % of electricity from renewable sources by 2020 .
Today it is a tiny fraction of that , while 20 % of the power produced by Denmark is from wind .
Deep water areas are convenient in that they are far from centres of population and so free in theory from the kind of opposition that has dogged onshore wind farms .
But there are still planning issues because of birds and radar , while putting turbines up in the North Sea is costly and time - consuming .
They need specialist floating cranes , cable - laying vessels and even platforms to support them .
The Carbon Trust , a government - funded agency set up to promote clean technology , has predicted that a successful R3 could propel Britain towards a £ 70bn wind and wave market that would support 250,000 jobs . ""
These technologies are not green ' nice to haves ' but are critical to the economic recovery of the UK , "" says chief executive Tom Delay .
Butwhile R3 is needed to help the government meet its carbon emission targets , developers are wary about the economics .
The London Array , much closer to shore off Kent , has been dogged by worries that it can not be commercial even with enhanced public subsidies .
There are also concerns about who will develop and pay for the grid connections and whether the whole enterprise will be undermined by ministerial commitment to nuclear .
Siemens is keen to build one new turbine manufacturing plant in Europe , but has not decided where .
René Umlauft , chief executive of its renewable energy division , says the successful launch of R3 is vital to the decision - making process .
"" We are looking at two locations [ for factories ] in the UK , one in Denmark and one in Germany .
Great Britain has the advantage of R3 , which could result in a huge market , "" he told the Guardian .
GE and Mitsubishi are also considering a turbine plant in Britain , while Clipper has just been awarded a government grant to develop a new generation of blades at a factory in Blyth , in the north - east of England .
Siemens claims it is already involved in commercially competitive wind farms in New Zealand and expects to do the same in Mexico and Brazil .
Umlauft says parts of Scotland could see a similar situation unfold in eight years ' time , depending on the relative cost of oil and other fuels .
But that is onshore .
For offshore wind to thrive , certainly without state support , there needs to be a lot of technological innovation .
That is why Clipper , Siemens and others are working flat out to find ways to cut operating costs .
There is also a need for investors .
The green energy sector has been hit harder than most by the credit crunch , with stocks seen as speculative and uncertain .
The big utilities can develop wind farms out of their own balance sheets , but the smaller independents are heavily dependent on banks that have retreated from what they see as riskier schemes .
New figures out last week suggest a bounceback in confidence , however , for the wider clean technology sector .
The London - based consultancy New Energy Finance says $ 26bn of new investment was made in the three months to September 30 , double the amount seen in the first quarter of 2009 .
The WilderHill New Energy Global Innovation index , a basket of stocks covering wind , solar and fuel cells , has risen by 40 % this year .
The renewed optimism comes as global leaders prepare for the Copenhagen climate change talks in December .
This should pave the way for a wider successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol , which started the ball rolling for Co2 cuts and the development of low - carbon energy programmes .
The squabbling about who pays what goes on but the world 's biggest carbon polluters , China and the US , are playing far more constructive roles than they have in the past .
In the meantime the wind industry continues with its work .
Dong Energy of Denmark , one of the companies hoping to win R3 licenses , has just started up its 91-turbine Horns Rev 2 scheme in the North Sea .
This is the biggest offshore wind farm in the world , but it is a measure of the pace of the sector that it will only hold that record until the 100-turbine Thanet offshore wind farm comes on stream off Britain 's Kent coast next year .
And after that it will be 140 turbines at Greater Gabbard and 340 turbines on the London Array .
This has brought contracts for Siemens and is all potential work for Bolther , even before R3 kicks in .
Despite having to climb those 85 m towers , the Swede is happy : "" It 's relatively well paid and it 's better than the oil rigs .
I like to think I am doing something worthwhile : working on clean energy . ""

"Arnold Schwarzenegger , the governor of California , has signed a law setting aside a day to commemorate Harvey Milk , a gay San Francisco politician who was shot dead three decades ago .
Under the measure , 22 May will be declared Harvey Milk day in California , coinciding with Milk 's birthday .
While it will not be a state holiday , schools will be encouraged to hold lessons "" remembering the life of Harvey Milk , recognising his accomplishments and familiarising pupils with the contributions he made to this state "" .
Milk is only the second Californian , after naturalist John Muir , to receive the honour .
One of the first openly gay people elected in the US , Milk and the San Francisco mayor , George Moscone , were shot and killed by Dan White , a disgruntled former supervisor , at city hall in November 1978 .
In signing Harvey Milk day into law , Schwarzenegger reversed his position from last year , when he vetoed the measure .
The decision by President Barack Obama to award Milk the presidential medal of freedom and an Academy award - winning film about Milk 's life , starring Sean Penn , persuaded Schwarzenegger to change his mind , his spokesman , Aaron McLear , said .
"" Harvey Milk symbolises the importance of the gay community in California , "" said McClear . ""
And the governor wanted to honour that community .
A well - known film brought awareness of him . ""
Mark Leno , a Democratic state senator , who wrote the bill to honour Milk , said he was pleased about the governor 's decision . ""
In light of his veto message on the same bill last year , "" he said , "" he clearly evolved in his thinking .
"" The day for Milk will be the fourth special day of recognition in the state , joining days for Muir , teachers and the California poppy .
Schwarzenegger signed the measure late on Sunday along with new laws to help gay and lesbian people in California .
One of the new laws will give same - sex couples legally married in other states all the rights of marriage in California .
The former Hollywood star has approved more legislation in favour of gay rights than any governor in US history , despite his vetoes of bills to extend marriage rights to same - sex couples .
Conservative groups ‑ especially those who campaigned successfully to end same - sex marriage in California ‑ strongly opposed the new measures signed by Schwarzenegger .
The Campaign for Children and Families called the Harvey Milk law "" the strongest impetus yet for loving parents to remove their children from anti - family public schools "" .
On the same day that Schwarzenegger signed into law Harvey Milk day , Obama reaffirmed his campaign pledge to end the ban on homosexuals serving openly in the military in a speech to America 's largest gay group , although he offered no timetable for implementing his promise ."
"California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is trying to ban big - screen TVs because they use too much energy , reports the Daily Mail .
The proposed law would affect TVs with a screen size of more than 40 inches , and according to estimates a quarter of current sets would have to be pulled from the shops .
Is Arnie planning to terminate offenders personally ?"
""
"Being head of the 2012 Olympic organising committee comes with many perks but getting up in the darkness of a cold Canadian morning and slipping into an iridescent tracksuit to play a bit part in an Arnold Schwarzenegger production is probably not one of them .
Still , Sebastian Coe is nothing if not a loyal Olympian and a polite man , so he was waiting patiently at the Lighthouse Point in Vancouver 's Stanley Park shortly after seven o'clock todayas the governor of California – and his motorcycle outriders , his trailing motorcade , an overhead helicopter or two , a dozen television cameras and thousands of star - struck Canadians – made his steady way towards the most - trailed , most - talked - about torch exchange of the 2010 Games .
Seb , meet Arnie .
Arnie , meet Seb .
Talk about star power .
Talk about incongruity .
So what exactly did they talk about ?
"" I invited him to come to the London Games , "" Coe said .
As a torch bearer ?
"" Well , we have n't quite got as far as working out who the torch bearers will be yet , '' he said , showing the fancy footwork and diplomatic skills that have marked him in the eyes of some as a future head of the International Olympic Committee .
Mind you , Coe could do a lot worse than let Schwarzenegger take the torch for a jog through Regent 's Park , not least because as he proved yesterday he can still pull a crowd .
"" Why am I am here , '' said Ron Hillman , who owns a Vespa scooter dealership in Vancouver and who , along with his wife Barbara , was among the thousands who made it out to Stanley Park . ""
Because it 's Arnie .
You do n't get to see Arnie Schwarzenegger every day of your life .
"" You do n't , although it is also true to say that some Canadians are more - than happy with that .
IndeedThe decision to ask Schwarzenegger to take part in the torch relay here and to give him a prime slot – and at the most picturesque spot on the final day 's route , just in time for the breakfast television shows – was a controversial one .
Serving politicians are seldom granted the honour ; nor are former bodybuilders with a history of steroid use .
Schwarzenegger may have won the Mr Olympia title seven times but the Olympics run to a rather different set of rules .
Nonetheless celebrity counts for something and , at an occasion which has fashioned itself as the "" green "" Games , so does a strong record on green issues during his term as governor of California – a record cited by John Furlong , the head of Vanoc , the Games ' organisers , in defending the invitation . ""
He has taken an extraordinary position on the environment and has developed a great relationship with the province of British Columbia , "" he said .
Certainly it proved to be a hugely popular decision with the Vancouver public , whose enthusiasm for the Olympics , and desire for the 2010 Games to be seen around the world as a success , seems to be building with every passing hour .
With the prelude almost complete , attention switched to last night 's opening ceremony and the identity of the person who would light the Olympic flame .
Most of the speculation centred on the former ice hockey player Wayne Gretzky , a beloved figure in Canada , although Furlong was being coy to the end .
"" We made a decision that , if it got leaked , for some reason , we would change it .
We would n't allow the surprise of the Games to be ruined by something like that , "" he said .
As for the identity of the British flagbearer at the ceremony , there was no surprise at all .
Shelley Rudman , Britain 's only medallist from the Turin Winter Games four years ago , was the obvious choice and her selection was made official at a team reception in downtown Vancouver on Thursday evening .
"" It 's a huge honour for me to have been chosen to represent our team , and ultimately our country , in this way , '' she said .
"" There are some wonderful athletes here and I will be so proud to be the person who leads them into the stadium . """
"Since being handed the Olympic torch by Arnold Schwarzenegger last Friday , London 2012 chairman Seb Coe has had plenty to ponder as Vancouver 's Winter Olympics fights a daily battle to shed its "" troubled "" tag .
Some of the issues that have plagued the games ' organisers – such as the warm weather that led to convoys of lorries ferrying snow from higher ground and prompted refunds for 8,000 spectators – have been ( largely ) out of their hands .
Others , such as the glitches that beset the opening ceremony , the home team 's brazen mission statement to "" own the podium "" , and the creaky transport system , have not .
And then there is the furious debate surrounding the death in training of Georgian luger Nodar ­Kumaritashvili .
The repercussions for both Vancouver and the International Olympic Committee could be severe .
Estimates put the cost of the games at CAN$6bn ( £ 3.6bn ) , and the race to host the 2018 edition features just three bidders , the lowest number since 1988 .
The host broadcaster , NBC , stands to lose $ 200 m on televising these games , so future sponsorship could suffer .
The twin spectres of the Montreal Olympics of 1976 and the 1996 Atlanta games hang over Vancouver .
Montreal was left bankrupt , facing financial ­repercussions that lasted three decades .
The Atlanta games , often cited as the worst in history , are remembered for a bomb attack , compounded by a host of other logistical problems .
Things are not quite that bad yet .
But while London 2012 organisers ­insist they are planning for every eventuality , what they have seen in ­Vancouver will surely have made them redouble those efforts ."
"A new technology that its creator claims can be an off - grid source of cheap , clean electricity in a device the size of a loaf of bread is about to get its close - up .
The formal debut of Bloom Energy 's much - hyped fuel cell , known as the Bloom Box , will take place at eBay 's headquarters in California on Wednesday , and will reportedly attract figures from the former secretary of state , Colin Powell , who is on the company 's board , to the state 's governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger .
The anticipation can be gauged by a segment on the CBS network 's flagship television programme , 60 Minutes , on Sunday which talked about the "" holy grail "" of clean energy technology .
A clock on Bloom Energy 's website – which contains little information bar an inspirational video of astronauts and of winning runners cresting the tape at the finish line – counts down the minutes until the launch .
Venture capitalists have reportedly poured $ 400 m into Bloom Energy 's project since founder KR Sridhar began his work eight years ago .
Twenty companies , including Wal - Mart and Google , are trying out the device .
Sridhar has also attracted the high - profile support of Powell , who proclaimed last year : "" I have seen the technology and it works . ""
But industry watchers say they remain unsure exactly how it works .
They also say Sridhar has aroused suspicion with his secretive approach , which includes working in an HQ with no sign outside .
Scientists and entrepeneurs have been trying for years to create a low - cost option for generating and storing fuel .
Sridhar has told reporters his work draws on his research on generating oxygen for Nasa 's missions to Mars .
The Bloom Box allegedly reverses this process , using natural gas or plant waste as fuel while producing relatively little carbon dioxide .
Sridhar gave CBS the first glimpse of the technology , explaining that the boxes are produced from stacks of ceramic plates .
The plates , which are made of sand , are painted with special green and black inks .
He declares that one such stack , or cell , can power a light bulb ; 64 can power a coffee shop .
Nasa has been using similar devices aboard its vehicles for years but Sridhar 's achievement was to make the technology affordable , he told the Atlantic magazine last December .
He has been running a pilot project of the technology at the University of Tennessee for the last two years , where the Bloom Box reportedly proved twice as efficient as traditional power sources and produced 60 % fewer emissions .
But its real potential lies in its claimed ability to use any fuel source – gas , plants , wind , solar , etc – to generate power , which would theoretically enable the Bloom Box to operate entirely off the electricity grid .
That would offer developing countries , such as Sridhar 's native India , the chance to provide cheap , clean electricity to remote villages .
"" I want to open up access to energy the way that PCs and the web opened up access to information , "" Sridhar told the Atlantic . ""
So people can live where they want , and still be connected , without someone telling them when they can do their laundry . """
"Not every company can boast Arnold Schwarzenegger , Colin Powell and the heads of Google and Walmart at its launch .
Even more unlikely , the firm in question makes what some may regard as a less than sexy clean energy device .
But such was the razzmatazz that accompanied the unveiling of Bloom ­Energy 's eagerly awaited "" energy server "" today at the California headquarters of one if its first customers , eBay .
A mini power station containing fuel cells that can run on anything from natural gas to the more renewable stuff , Bloom 's device has received the level of hype in Silicon Valley normally reserved for a new product from Apple .
For the past week , newspapers and websites have been filled with rumours about Bloom boxes , as the devices have been nicknamed , invented by former Nasa scientist KR Sridhar .
Fuel cells , which convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity by an electrochemical process , are a promising source of energy while emitting less CO² and other pollutants , as well as being much more efficient , than burning .
But most modern designs use expensive materials , such as platinum , or corrosive chemicals that shorten their lifespan .
At the heart of Sridhar 's device is a thin fuel cell made from a plentiful resource , sand .
The size of a floppy disk , it is painted with proprietary inks that allow the fuels to react with oxygen from the air , a chemical process that produces electricity .
According to Sridhar , a single cell can produce about 25W , enough for a low - energy lightbulb , and a stack of cells the size of a brick will power an average home .
A single Bloom box , a unit the size of a chest freezer and which contains several stacks of fuel cells , will produce 100KW , enough for 100 homes . ""
Compared to the US national grid , this is about twice as efficient , "" said Sridhar .
"" So your carbon footprint is about half .
If you use a renewable fuel , you 're carbon neutral .
"" Sridhar has spent eight years developing the fuel cells and has already sold the first units : the first customer was Google , which uses a Bloom box at its headquarters . ""
Bloom fuel cells are powering a portion of Google 's energy needs at our headquarters here in Mountain View
—
this is another on - site renewable energy source that we 're exploring to help power our facilities , "" said Jamie Yood , a Google spokesman .
"" We have a 400kW installation on Google 's main campus .
Over the first 18 months the project has had 98 % availability and delivered 3.8 million kWh of electricity . ""
Other customers include Walmart , Federal Express and Coca Cola .
The former US secretary of state , Colin Powell , sits on the board and Bloom has received $ 400 m from venture capitalists .
Not everyone has been converted .
Richard Miller , an innovation platform leader at the UK 's Technology Strategy Board , said Bloom Energy had yet to provide data to allow a fully informed decision on the value of its technology . ""
Certainly , fuel cells are a hot prospect , but to make them a reality you have to make them reliable and perhaps this is what Bloom have done ?
Perhaps it 's an engineering breakthrough ?
But there are already fuel cells on the market and for the home , notably from Ceres Power in the UK .
I look forward to finding out more about Bloom Energy 's product . ""
Keith Pullen , co - director of the centre for energy and the environment at City University in London , said : "" Although Bloom Energy cites four advantages over existing technology – low material costs , high efficiency , multiple fuel sources and reversibility – these are attributes that all fuel cell developers seek to achieve .
So , whether the technology is worthy of the hype will depend on further data emerging through future testing and deployments . ""
He added that , in niche markets such as off - grid power , fuel cells can now out perform other generator types , including internal combustion engines . ""
But this depends on the power demand being steady , as well as the unit size being a minor concern .
Therefore , it will be interesting to see how Bloom Energy can move the technology away from these smaller markets and scale it to meet the more rigorous demands of business and domestic users . ""
Martin McAdam of renewable energy company Aquamarine Power was more sceptical .
He said living off - grid with the Bloom Box would still require an infrastructure to move the fuels around .
"" It still produces CO2 – it may be more efficient but that 's the question that needs to be asked , how much CO2 is emitted per MWh ?
If it 's using natural gas , it 's no different to a gas power station , even if it is more efficient . ""
So far , the Bloom Boxes cost around $ 700,000 but this is expected to fall as more of the units are built at commercial scale .
Sridhar said that customers with should expect to see a payback time of 3 - 5 years through electricity .
And he already has plans for the future boxes in the home . ""
In a few years , how we will use it is as a home energy server of the future - it simply has a solar panel and [ Bloom Box ] , it will provide electricity day and night and also charge your automobile , you do n't need a grid .
This is a product of the future , a decade or so away . """
"It has achieved notoriety as the mother of all petrol - guzzlers , first developed for the US military , then taken up by celebrities such as Arnold Schwarzenegger before he renounced it on environmental grounds .
But the Hummer has run out of road .
General Motors , the struggling car company , announced that it will wind down production of its Hummer SUV line after a deal to sell the brand to China 's Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery fell through .
"" We have since considered a number of possibilities for Hummer along the way and we are disappointed that the deal with Tengzhong could not be completed , "" said John Smith , GM 's vice - president of corporate planning and alliances .
"" GM will now work closely with Hummer employees , dealers and suppliers to wind down the business in an orderly and responsible manner . ""
Hummers were originally built by AM General .
GM bought the brand from AM in 1999 .
They became a status symbol of the road when Schwarzenegger became the first owner of one in 1992 after persuading manufacturers to make a civilian version .
Six years later , the actor - turned - governor ditched his $ 950,000 ( £ 615,000 ) fleet of Hummers because they hardly conformed to his new image as eco - warrior .
Hummers emit three times more carbon dioxide than a normal car and eke out just 14 miles to the gallon in city driving .
Other Hummer owners have included David Beckham and Paris Hilton , but Schwarzenegger in particular could hardly be seen to own one after the state of California decided to sue Toyota , Nissan , Ford , Honda , Chrysler and GM over emissions .
Hummer is the second brand after Saturn that GM has failed to sell as part of its restructuring .
GM sold Swedish brand Saab to Dutch carmaker Spyker Cars NV earlier this year and is discontinuing Pontiac .
The Detroit company is concentrating its efforts on its four remaining brands : Chevrolet , GMC , Cadillac and Buick .
Hummer 's military version , the Humvee , may have reached the end of the desert track as well .
The US army provided no new money for the Humvee in its recent budget proposal ."
"You have to hand it to Mickey Rourke .
Since almost grabbing the best actor Oscar last year for his neo - autobiographical turn in Darren Aranofsky 's The Wrestler , he has been snaffling up the plum roles like Hollywood 's about to go out of business .
The forthcoming remake of Conan the Barbarian is the latest project to which the actor is attached , with Rourke in talks to play dad to Robert E Howard 's iconic warrior .
Unfortunately , that 's pretty much the only good piece of news surrounding the new film , which the Hollywood Reporter says will start shooting in Bulgaria in March .
Arnold Schwarzenegger , then best known for his supremely confused , unintentionally hilarious performance in 1970 's Hercules in New York , must have looked like a pretty duff choice to play the muscular Cimmerian in John Milius 's superbly atmospheric 1982 origins tale .
But the film , with a sinister James Earl Jones as villain Thulsa Doom , turned out to be the project which made the Governator 's name .
That does n't , however , detract too much from my concern upon hearing that Hawaiian - born actor Jason Momoa , best known for turns in Stargate Atlantis and Baywatch Hawaii , is to play Conan this time around .
I have to say that I 'm not particularly
au fait with either TV series - readers may want to enlighten me - but Momoa looks a mite too pretty to play Howard 's famous barbarian .
Even more worryingly , Conan will be directed by one Marcus Nispel , a German director whose two most recent films are last year 's poorly received Friday 13th remake and the equally brainless Vikings vs Native Americans romp Pathfinder from 2007 .
The film company which now owns the rights to Howard 's short stories , Millennium , fails to make a better case for the project : it worked on the desperately disappointing Al Pacino - Robert De Niro team - up Righteous Kill , and last year 's knuckleheaded Sylvester Stallone outing , Rambo .
The screenwriters are Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer , who wrote the rather unfortunate 2005 Matthew McConaughey adventure caper Sahara , with the pretty much unknown Andrew Lobel having carried out a recent revision .
Once again , it seems the sludge - like sense of urgency over at Warner Bros is responsible for the failure of Hollywood to bring Conan back to the big screen in a format worthy of Milius 's film , which the director co - wrote with a young Oliver Stone .
The firm had the rights to the character until fairly recently , and oversaw script rewrites by the likes of the Wachowski brothers and Robert Rodriguez .
While I 'm not sure either is quite right for Conan , those names certainly sound a lot more appetising than the ones on board the version being planned by Millennium , who acquired the rights in 2007 following seven years of Warner dithering .
What 's strange about the failure to deliver Conan to theatrical audiences is that Howard 's stories are almost uniformly cinematic .
While the Texan writer never conceived a spectacular backstory for his universe to rival that of JRR Tolkien 's Lord of the Rings , his low fantasy tales are far leaner and more action - packed than those of the British writer .
He was also intensely prolific , turning out dozens of stories in the four - year period between conceiving Conan in 1932 and his death in 1936 .
Other writers , such as L Sprague De Camp and Lin Carter , have successfully used the character in their own stories set in Howard 's Hyborian age – a fictional antediluvian era set before the Bible 's great flood .
Frankly , there is enough raw material in the books for a trilogy of trilogies , which ought to satisfy Hollywood 's desire for endless sequels .
What are your thoughts on Millennium 's Conan ?
Could the film see Momoa embark on a Schwarzenegger - like rise to Hollywood 's top table , and does Rourke 's involvement add a touch of quality ?
Or are you expecting a cheap and cheerful knock - off aimed mainly at the DVD market ?"
"In the grand pantheon of sci - fi heroes , Sigourney Weaver 's Ellen Ripley stands alone on the tallest plinth , staring down at her rivals from on high , safe in the knowledge that none of them could manage more than one decent movie before the law of diminishing returns kicked in .
Arnold Schwarzenegger 's Terminator might have been in with a shout , had he not started out as a villain , and Sharlto Copley 's Wikus van
de Merwe surely has a chance , if Neill Blomkamp does a half - decent job of his planned District 9 sequel , District 10 .
Vin Diesel 's Riddick ?
Despite a strong start in Pitch Black – bizarrely critically reviled at the time but now seen as a minor sci - fi classic – the muscular criminal with the weird contact lenses managed to balls it all up with Chronicles of Riddick , a sprawling wannabe blockbuster that ended up being little more than an epic mess .
Nevertheless , there have been persistent reports of a third movie being in the works , and with Diesel 's star on the rise again following the success of the fourth The Fast and the Furious movie , it looks as if he and series creator
David Twohy might be given one more bite of the intergalactic cherry .
Coming Attractions has a script review for the terribly - titled Dead Man Stalking , and it looks like a return to the stripped - down , linear narrative of Pitch Black – no more Necromongers , Star Wars - like prophecies of rebalancing the universe or Dame Judi Dench .
The film begins with Riddick crawling on an alien world , battered and bloody , as the planet 's indigenous predators circle , waiting for him to weaken .
Later , he discovers he 's being hunted by two crews of bounty hunters , both set on claiming the scalp of the universe 's most - wanted criminal .
With luck , Twohy may just have finally worked out that Riddick 's appeal is in his nature as an antihero .
Make him too much of a good guy , and he 's weirdly out of his comfort range : he needs to be unpredictable , and we need to be not entirely sure whether we want him to succeed .
That was the formula which worked so well for Pitch Black , a startlingly original slant on the Alien idea , benefiting from a simple storyline that allowed Twohy to build a wonderful sense of menace around his main character and set up a visually sublime depiction of a formidable alien world .
If Coming Attractions is to be believed , there 's a similar feel to the new venture .
Elsewhere this week , the official website for Predators has some more sneak previews as we prepare for the sci - fi romp 's arrival on 22 July .
For those who have n't been keeping an eye on this one , it 's the Robert Rodriguez - scripted sequel , which sees a group of killers deposited on an unknown planet as bait for its mandible - sporting extra - terrestrials .
New on the site is an introduction to Topher Grace 's Edwin , a speccy chap with a secret , who seems weirdly out of place among all the psychopaths and murderers .
Finally , Heat Vision reports that Sharlto Copley , everybody 's favourite South African overnight success story , is in talks for Dreamworks ' I am Number Four , an aliens - among - us tale , centring on a group of young extra - terrestrials posing as human high - school students after escaping their doomed planet .
If that sounds suspiciously like Superman 's origin story , you wo n't be surprised to learn that Smallville 's Al Gough and Miles Millar wrote the screenplay .
Copley would play the adult guardian of the aliens , and the story is based on a soon - to - be - published series of young adult science - fiction novels .
This one sounds as if it 's aimed at the Twilight crowd , particularly with Disturbia 's DJ Caruso on board as director , but we 'll have to wait and see .
It 's certainly good to see Copley taking on a role which does n't involve him having to channel the spirit of Dwight Schultz , aka The A - Team 's Murdock , a part which was surely beneath him .
What are your thoughts ?
Can Riddick regain his place at sci - fi 's top table ?
How is Predators shaping up ?
And will I am Number Four be strictly a tween - only affair ?"
"My first encounter with an American Christian evangelist began to turn sour when he urged me to throw away all my heavy rock albums .
It was around 25 years ago and I had been persuaded to attend by friends who thought it might change my life , though , being merely 21 , I was still just getting acquainted with my bad habits and was n't about to abandon them so early in our relationship .
The American had a jaw like Arnold Schwarzenegger and a GI haircut .
A shiny suit jacket was clearly having difficulties clinging to his gridiron shoulders .
Like many of his kind , this otherwise blameless college jock was having a daily and exclusive conversation with his own Jesus who had given him a message for Scotland 's feckless youth .
Led Zeppelin , Black Sabbath , Judas Priest … none was spared as the big chap laid into them with a witch - finder 's zeal .
This was the Devil 's music and infamy would engulf those beguiled by their sinister charm .
If you slowed down some tracks or played them in reverse , he insisted , you would hear diabolic chanting .
My immediate thought was that simply by playing them normally you could easily hear these vile incantations .
Songs such as Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter and Children of the Grave tended to give the game away .
The Lord himself only knows how many tons of vinyl were collected by the bin lorries in Glasgow that week .
I felt it was churlish not to join in and took the opportunity to jettison some of my more unwise purchases such as April Wine , REO Speedwagon and Molly Hatchet .
But Deep Purple , Led Zep and AC / DC were the real babies and so the road to perdition rose to meet me .
Special scorn was reserved for those old vaudeville rock'n'rollers , Kiss , which the young Yank claimed was an acronym for "" Knights in Satan 's Service "" .
Until then , I had naively believed them merely to be four , nice , middle - class lads from New York who had perhaps dropped some acid on a visit to a paint factory .
Had they not also penned a song called God Gave Rock'n'Roll to You , a short exegesis influenced by themes from the Book of Genesis ?
Indeed they had .
Tonight Kiss are in Glasgow for a sell - out show and I shall be there .
I must decide , though , whether to have my face painted in the style of Gene Simmons 's demon or Paul Stanley 's star child .
I shall also raise a glass to my young evangelist and hope that he stopped having the nightmares .
A hymn - free kirk is heaven
You will most certainly not hear the music of Kiss or that of their infernal brothers in rock among the homesteads of the Highlands and islands where the writ of the Free Church of Scotland runs .
I have a great admiration for those whom we disparagingly call the Wee Frees .
I like their style and if Rome had not claimed me at birth and held me in her jealous embrace , as she continues to do , then the Free kirk is the church I would have chosen .
The Free church favours a lean and stripped - down Christianity , shorn of the gaudy accoutrements that adorn the Catholic church .
As such , it is in perfect harmony with the wild and barren splendour of the surrounding terrain in which this faith was forged .
This is most apparent in their 100-year tradition of Sunday worship which does not permit hymn singing or musical accompaniment of any kind .
Instead , what you will hear is the elemental beauty of 100 voices singing the psalms of David , raw and unspoiled .
This , though , may be about to change .
There are moves afoot to relax the ban on music and hymns .
This would be a great shame .
The Catholic tradition of worship has been despoiled in many parishes by the introduction of guitars , tambourines and an assortment of other types of percussive vandalism .
The hymn books are full of vacuous doggerel which seems to have been penned by strumming hippies who have spent too many dawns gazing at a Pictish stone while waiting for the Sun to come up .
Of reverence and majesty there is little .
I fear the Free church will regret any decision to ditch its noble tradition , for who knows where it will end ?
Harry , a prince among men On a sunny morning in Cambuslang , hundreds of us gathered to salute the passing of Harry Conroy , a Scottish newspaper legend and past president of the National Union of Journalists .
Harry was a beautiful man who spent his entire adult life helping others on the newspapers in which he laboured and in the NUJ .
The memorial card for Harry 's requiem mass included the following accolade : "" He was relentlessly forgiving . ""
He also believed fervently in the nobility of Labour and in the sacred right of trade unions to protect workers from ruthless consumerism and dehumanising hours and conditions .
He was one of the most skilled and feared negotiators in the British trade union movement .
On one occasion , during a particularly testy set of wage negotiations , he leaned across the desk and invited his pinstriped adversary to kiss him on the lips .
The alarmed executive asked him to explain .
"" It 's just that I like some foreplay before I get shafted , "" said Harry .
Requiescat in pace , big man ."
"Many environmentalists are celebrating California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger 's recent decision to end his support for offshore oil drilling .
After seeing the damage unleashed by the gulf oil spill , he looked at the risk posed by plans in his own state and , well , terminated them .
"" You turn on the television and see this enormous disaster , you say to yourself , ' Why would we want to take on that kind of risk ? '
"" he said .
Since the plan was only likely to get off the ground because of his support , Schwarzenegger 's volte - face will likely mean the end to offshore drilling there in the near future .
But the Republican governor 's attempts to establish a green legacy in the US 's largest economy are now coming under attack on another front .
Opponents to his landmark 2006 Global Warming Solutions Act , also known as AB32 , have announced they collected enough signatures to put an initiative on the ballot this November to delay implementation of the law until unemployment falls to 5.5 % for a full year .
Under the law , California must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 % by 2020 , an aim which would be achieved through a range of measures , including making energy producers and other polluters reduce emissions or pay penalties .
Unemployment is currently above 12 % , and so a successful referendum would delay the country 's most far - reaching climate change bill for quite some time , changing green economy politics in the US .
In the run - up to the vote , "" California will be the national battleground for the future of climate change regulations in the United States , "" Debbie Cook , former mayor of Huntington Beach , a conservative California town , told Guardian Sustainable Business . ""
The state will be flooded with not just dollars , but thousands of climate activists from around the nation .
"" The debate is centring on the effects of AB32 on the state 's economy .
Badly affected by the recession , California is in fiscal and political crisis , and John Kabateck , executive director of the National Federation of Independent Business , California , said going ahead with AB32 now would be a "" death knell for many small businesses "" .
Mr Schwarzenegger cast the opposition as the action of self - interested big business : "" The effort to suspend AB 32 is the work of greedy oil companies who want to keep polluting our state and making profits , "" he said in a statement .
Pro -
AB32 groups argue the bill has attracted , and will continue to attract , thousands of green - energy jobs to the economy .
In the very short - term , it 's likely the bill will cost the state money .
This is the case with most climate change legislation – if the desired green option was currently the cheapest , no law would be required .
Providing incentive for the economy to rely less on fossil fuels is an investment in the future , whose cost in the present is justified , supporters say .
Rising fuel costs and anticipation of future national or international legislation – not to mention the threat of ecological catastrophe – make it worthwhile to get a head start on developing cleaner energy sources .
"" Our days of cheap hydrocarbon fuel are ending whether we like it or not , "" said Andy Ball , president of Webcor Builders , a commercial construction company in California .
"" It may be painful now , but every year we wait is going to create more pain downstream . ""
Legislation of this type creates winners and losers .
Traditional manufacturing sectors are hurt more , relatively , while green technology businesses and venture capitalists receive a boost .
Some critics say Schwarzenegger 's decision to ban offshore drilling has little global environmental impact , since the state 's sizable fossil fuel needs will still have to be met by drilling somewhere , so the effect of the move is to "" foist that off on the unseen global oil market , "" says David Hughes , geoscientist and fellow at the Post Carbon Institute .
""
If you can make someone else assume the risks and still enjoy all the benefits why would you undertake to roll the dice and undertake those risks and responsibility yourself ? """
"As the clean - up of the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico continues , the US may finally begin to rethink its position on off - shoring drilling .
As usual , change is frustratingly slow , and almost imperceptible : environmental groups like the Centre for Biological Diversity have criticised the Mineral Management Service , the US agency that oversees oil extraction , for its "" business as usual "" approach during the disaster , and expressed concerns that the Obama administration has waived environmental reviews of more than 20 new off - shore drilling projects even as the Deepwater Horizon spill continues .
Still , a glimmer of environmental hope has come from the unlikely source of Californian governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , who withdrew his support to expand off - shore exploration off California 's coast in the wake of the BP oil spill .
It may be hard for climate - change activists to admit , but Schwarzenegger 's move seems impressive , particularly considering the pressure he faces to ditch environmental concerns to save California 's flailing economy .
The governor 's turnaround on off - shore drilling comes as he faces increasing pressure to abandon California 's commitment to the 2006 Global Warming Solutions Act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 % by 2020 .
Opponents have collected enough signatures to put an initiative on November 's ballot to delay the implementation of the act until unemployment falls below 5.5 % .
In this political climate , Schwarzenegger 's change of heart on off - shore drilling could bolster environmental campaigning efforts to reduce offshore projects nationwide : if recession - suffering California can do it , so can the rest of the country .
The problem comes if California shifts its consumption of oil to a more carbon - intensive source .
David Hughes of the Post Carbon Initiative has noted that , even if offshore drilling is banned in California , it will have little positive environmental impact if the state 's current demand for oil is just met from other sources .
One likely source in particular will only worsen the situation : oil from the Canadian tar sands are already the biggest source of US oil imports , and Alberta 's recoverable reserves are now estimated to be the second - largest worldwide after Saudi Arabia .
And unlike oil from Saudi Arabia , Albertan oil is literally in the sand itself , so refining it is up to five times as energy - intensive as refining crude oil .
Alberta premier Ed Stelmach wasted little time visiting Washington to promote Canadian oil sands as a "" safer "" option in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico disaster – referring to the oil sands as an "" unconventional "" source , as though one of the most destructive variants of fossil fuel extraction was merely a friendly alternative .
This is the moment that Canada 's prime minister Stephen Harper has presumably been waiting for .
While the US has , at least so far , resisted a complete dependency on Albertan sand oil , this environmentally disastrous from of petrol is widening its share of the global market .
Despite the recession 's impact on Albertan oil production , Albertan oil company Enbridge Inc is going ahead with its plans to build a 1,200 km oil sand pipeline to supply Asian markets .
Canadian oil companies have begun to actively court China , whose consumption of Albertan oil has increased dramatically in the last five years : the Canadian government recently approved a £ 1.5bn investment giving PetroChina a 60 % stake in two new Albertan oil sand projects .
Canadian oil is also reaching European markets : the new Greenpeace report revealed that Albertan tar sands oil has been indirectly entering the EU 's petrol supply unbeknown to consumers , and indicated that this is likely to become more widespread .
Defenders of Canada 's deals with China – hardly known for its environmental record – argue that it was a reasonable response to the decline in American interest in Albertan oil .
The Obama administration in particular has shown itself to be ambivalent about Canadian oil .
Harper 's government and Albertan politicians seem to have made it a priority to win America over to Albertan oil – and are being lent support for this from surprising quarters .
Amid the popular ( if characteristically understated ) patriotism stoked by the Vancouver Winter Olympics , heightened scrutiny of Harper 's environmental policies ( if "" policy "" is the right word for a man who dismissed the Kyoto protocol as a "" socialist scheme "" and then did his best to undermine a successor agreement ) received a defensive response even from Harper 's Canadian critics : now was n't the time to tolerate "" Canada bashing "" abroad .
Similarly , when in 2009 Canada came last on a WWF scorecard of G8 countries ' environmental policies , and the Obama administration 's clean energy and security bill looked set to disproportionately harm the Albertan oil trade , Canadians were quick to note America 's hypocrisy , and perhaps understandably resented being lectured by the world 's largest and most profligate consumer .
The problem is , none of the arguments that Canada is being somehow unfairly maligned actually contradict the point that the Alberta tar sands are evidently an unmitigated disaster for the environment , or that Canada 's carbon emissions are estimated to have increased by 26 % since the Kyoto Protocol .
With Alberta 's premier happily capitalising on the Deepwater Horizon disaster to win the US over to Albertan oil , and Schwarzenegger backtracking on offshore oil drilling , recession - hit California and ambitious Alberta would be a match made in petrodollar heaven : Alberta would once again be secure as the dominant petrol supplier to the US , and the deal is far more palatable for America than its main alternative of tar sand oil , Chávez 's Venezuela .
For America as well as for Europe , Albertan oil is increasingly the best option from a political point of view – but never from an environmental one .
The Gulf of Mexico disaster could trigger a wider environmental catastrophe if the US 's search for new petrol sources points it back in the direction of Alberta ."
"Shell yesterday pushed ahead with plans to drill in the Arctic Sea this summer , defying calls for a moratorium on offshore exploration in the pristine wilderness following the Gulf of Mexico disaster .
California 's governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , this month scrapped plans to allow offshore drilling in the state for the first time in more than 40 years and environmentalists have called for a halt in the Arctic after President Obama opened up the area to drilling for the first time last month .
However , Shell today refiled its drilling programme with the US authorities after being required to review its safety procedures following the Gulf spill and awaits final permits .
The industry will drill the first - ever large wells in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas in the Arctic , which are estimated to hold 27bn barrels of oil and gas .
Shell chief executive Peter Voser told shareholders at the company 's annual meeting that it would only drill there if it thought it could be done "" safely and responsibly "" . ""
The characteristics of the offshore fields are different to those in the Gulf of Mexico – we go less deep
so there is less pressure , "" he said .
"" The world needs these fossil resources in the longer term . ""
Voser said Shell had spent $ 2bn ( £ 1.38bn ) to secure the permits .
Shell also managed to beat off a sizeable rebellion over its controversial oil sands operations in Canada .
Nevertheless , one in 10 shareholders either voted for or abstained on a resolution calling for Shell to carry out a full public audit of the environmental and financial impact of the operations .
The Shell board , which was criticised for placing the resolution at the end of the six - hour meeting 's agenda , had urged shareholders to vote against it .
Oil sands projects result in three times as many carbon emissions as conventional oil production and also require vast amounts of water to process .
They are also very expensive , requiring oil prices of at least $ 70 a barrel to be economic .
The coalition of investors who had tabled the special resolution , led by investment charity FairPensions and Co - operative Asset Management , say that oil sands are not financially viable as environmental regulations will grow , adding to production and possible clean - up costs .
They also argue that high oil prices are not sustainable because they will encourage the world to use alternative forms of energy instead .
After the resolution was tabled , Shell responded by publishing a report in March pulling together information already in the public domain about the operations , which will almost double production in several years .
Proceedings were marginally enlivened when one environmental investor who was asking a question broke out in song : "" A world running for profit takes us to the edge , stop now think ahead . """
"Billions of dollars are being poured into hotly contested midterm elections across the US , putting them on course to become the most expensive in American history and raising questions about the link between politics and special interests seeking influence .
Records are being broken in California where two multimillionaires have spent between them $ 100 m ( £ 69 m ) in a battle for the Republican nomination for the governorship , to replace Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Voters went to the polls today in a series of primaries in California and elsewhere round the country .
The full elections will be on 2 November .
David Levinthal of the Centre of Responsive Politics , a Washington thinktank which tracks election spending , estimates that spending in the Congressional elections will exceed $ 3.7bn .
"" This goes well beyond inflation , "" he said .
"" We think the 2010 election will be the most expensive in US history . ""
Much of the spending is on seemingly endless television ad runs , and it is being driven not only by the unusually competitive contests but also by an anti - incumbency mood in the US .
It also reflects the close links between politics and big corporations , trade unions and wealthy individuals .
"" It is legalised corruption , "" according to Bill Buzenberg , executive director of the Centre for Public Integrity in Washington , which tracks campaign contributions .
He said that , although members of Congress insist they vote independently , it was a matter of debate how much they are influenced by big campaign contributions .
Such contributions can be decisive . ""
Every election cycle has been much larger than the last one , and those spending the money tend to win .
"" There are a lot of examples of someone rich who does not win , but , generally , those who raise the most money tend to be the winners , "" Buzenberg said .
"" That is an indictment of democracy . ""
All 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for election , as will be 36 of the 100 Senate seats .
Barack Obama 's ability to get through legislation depends on the outcome .
In addition , there are 39 governors ' races on 2 November .
The battle to get the Republican nomination for the Californian governorship is the one that has attracted media attention in the US , partly because of the eye - popping amounts spent so far .
Voters went to the polls today to choose between Meg Whitman , the former eBay chief executive , and Steve Poizner , also a former Silicon Valley executive .
She has so far spent $ 81 m , of which $ 71 m is from her personal fortune , to Poizner 's $ 20 m , and that is before the election proper , against the Democratic nominee , Jerry Brown .
Whitman has said she is prepared to spend $ 150 m in total to secure the governorship .
Most of it has gone on television advertising , with Californian newspapers reporting that viewers are already fed up with the seemingly saturation coverage .
And there are the chartered jets , hotels and political consultants , one of whom , Mike Murphy , charges $ 90,000 a month .
While California stands out as the highest - spending state , millions are being spent on almost every other race too .
Levinthal said the five highest - spending Senate races were : Connecticut , $ 20.4 m so far : California $ 18 m ; Nevada , where the Democratic leader Harry Reid is up for re - election , $ 17 m ; Arizona , where the Republican is the past presidential candidate John McCain also up for re - election , $ 16.8 m ; and Arkansas , $ 11.8 m .
The spending could also be increased as a result of a supreme court ruling earlier this year that allows corporations , unions and others to spend unlimited amounts on campaign advertising .
Congress is considering a bill to reverse the ruling , but may not get it passed by November .
Levinthal said that his thinktank aimed to be non - partisan and non - judgmental , but he believed that it was important voters were made aware of the money from big corporations and special interest groups , and that "" these do not always have the interest of the public in mind "" .
The figures involved dwarf the estimated $ 1bn cost of the 2008 presidential election , and makes the British general election look extremely modest ; the UK ministry of justice estimates its cost at £ 82.1 m .
Tom Mann , a Brookings Institution specialist on politics , said that one difference between the US and the UK , apart from size of population and geography , was that political advertising in Britain was free .
US history is full stories of the insidious links between politics and money , with presidents doing favours worth millions for companies which backed them .
Mann said that these days such linkage was harder , with a greater degree of transparency and restrictions in place .
In a report this week , the Centre for Public Integrity found that the Republican leader in the Senate , Mitch McConnell , had spent $ 47 m over the past 26 years on campaigning ; the Democratic leader in the Senate , Harry Reid , $ 42 m ; the Democratic leader in the House , Nancy Pelosi , $ 20 m ; and the Republican leader in the House , John Boehner , $ 30 m .
The centre lists the politicians ' backers : telecoms companies , lawyers , unions , tobacco companies and others .
Buzenberg said that such politicians tended to vote the way that suited their backers ' interests , though this was not always the case .
McConnell got money from the tobacco companies and tended to vote their line , but Reid , who also got money from the firms , was staunchly anti - smoking and generally did not ."
"Wonderful news .
The Expendables – the deliriously stupid - looking film about Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham and Jet Li and Eric Roberts and Mickey Rourke and Arnold Schwarzenegger and Dolph Lundgren punching things until they explode – will not be toned down to appease the censors .
There had been a rumour from the film 's producer himself that a more family - friendly edit could be tested with audiences , but that has now been officially dismissed by Lionsgate .
It means that , if you go to see The Expendables , you 'll basically be subjecting yourself to a constant barrage of bullet - holes and broken bones and pointlessly macho full - volume swearing .
This is n't just good news for anyone with high hopes for The Expendables , it 's good news for everyone who makes action films .
Hopefully it 'll even spark a resurgence of the preposterously violent mainstream action film .
You know the sort .
A one - man army .
A consequence - free bloodbath every couple of minutes .
A series of profane non - sequiturs masquerading as dialogue .
A title that refuses to make sense no matter how hard you stare at it .
Films like The Running Man or Bloodsport or Cobra .
If you were a child growing up in the 1980s , these were more than just films .
These were rites of passage .
In my school , for example , you were a boy until you knew how to convincingly perform a playground mime of the acid death sequence from Robocop from memory .
That 's the point where you would become a man .
Yes , this sort of action movie does still exist , but it 's been marginalised .
All the modern - day examples tend to star minor WWE wrestlers , go straight to DVD and appear to have a budget of about 12p .
For a film to reach the mainstream it either has to be watered down beyond all recognition ( like Die Hard 4.0 ) or smothered with a protective layer of irony ( Crank , most of Robert Rodriguez 's work ) .
But with The Expendables , that looks set to change .
We can thank Stallone for this , obviously .
The first signs of his renaissance came not with Rocky Balboa – which contained a worrying amount of actual human emotion – but with his 2008 Rambo sequel .
After years spent in a wilderness that saw him variously host reality TV shows , hamfistedly remake Michael Caine classics and sell tins of chocolate pudding , it was clear he had a point to prove .
The red - band trailer that leaked onto the internet before Rambo 's release is still shockingly violent –
it 's essentially three minutes of Stallone , brimming with fury and human growth hormone , hacking people apart in the most graphic way possible .
Branches of Odeon would n't even show it .
That 's how good it was .
And , better still , the comeback looks set to continue .
Not only do we have The Expendables to look forward to , but Predators is also coming this summer .
Then there 's Die Hard 5 on the horizon – and Bruce Willis is apparently eager to make it just as violent and sweary as The Expendables .
And then , as the cherry on the blood - soaked cake , there 's the possibility of Arnold Schwarzenegger returning to the fold after his stint in office .
We could well be witnessing the resurrection of the gloriously moronic action film , and you 're right to be excited ."
"The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Saturday 19 June 2010
The article below flipped the order when it said Arnold Schwarzenegger first intoned "" I 'll be back "" in The Running Man , before saying it in The Terminator .
Running Man came out in 1987 , after Terminator , released in 1984 .
Minority Report was not the first film to predict accurately what technology would look like in years to come .
We asked readers to suggest the other films that best predicted our future .
2001 :
A Space Odyssey ( 1968 ) Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C Clarke collaborated to create the film that is still , more than 40 years on , regarded as the finest cinematic exposition of realistic hard science .
And even when the astronauts were just sitting eating , they were looking at video playing on iPad - like devices on their desktops .
Masterful .
Pity we missed their schedule – a crewed mission to Jupiter is n't on the cards this century .
Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy ( 2005 ; TV series , 1981 )
You could argue that author Douglas Adams foresaw the iPad ( has nobody started making iPad covers with DON'T PANIC on them ? )
but what HHGTTG , as it 's known , really foresaw was a resource that would be endlessly updated : that 's surely Wikipedia , which was only five months old when Adams died prematurely .
And , as Brendan Cooper points out , the series/ book / film also predicted the mobile web – though in this case , one which would work across galaxies ( imagine the roaming charges ) .
Fahrenheit 451 ( 1966 ) As Catinthegrass points out , the film of Ray Bradbury 's book ( about firemen whose job is to burn books ) gave us a vision of a world of wall - mounted TV sets – and , arguably , a time when people do n't read books , but instead get all their knowledge and entertainment purely from screens .
With books heading e - wards on to Kindles and iPads , can we be sure that the physical objects themselves will survive ?
Terminator ( 1984 )
The second film in which Arnold Schwarzenegger solemnly intoned "" I 'll be back "" ( the first was Running Man ) features scenes in which you 're looking through the eyes of the robot sent to kill someone from its past .
That includes a form of "" augmented reality "" – overlaying the scene with extra information such as the names of people , distance away , and other information .
Nowadays , you can get augmented reality apps on your Android phone or iPhone ; it 's even added to magazines ( for you to view with a webcam ) .
However , time travel , particularly for murderous robots , remains uninvented ( as far as we know ) .
Blade Runner ( 1982 ) As mike65ie points out , this included "" retinal scanning "" – looking at the pattern of blood vessels on the back of your eye ( like your iris , a unique pattern ) .
But it also included ideas such as creating organisms from artificial DNA ( something just achieved by the US biologist Craig Venter ) .
And despite the inevitable flying cars and interplanetary exodus from an exhausted Earth – so far not sighted – when Philip K Dick , who wrote the story ( Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? ) on which it was based , saw an early screening , he turned to director Ridley Scott and said : "" How did you know ?
It 's just as I imagined it . ""

""" Sometimes I feel like I 'm in a dream world , "" says director - producer Robert Rodriguez , "" because it does n't always seem too logical how things work out . ""
Indeed , this year the film - maker is feeling a distinct case of deja vu .
His first release this month will be a sequel to Arnold Schwarzenegger 's 1987 film Predator , helmed by Hungarian director Nimród Antal , produced at his Troublemaker Studios outfit in Texas , and based on a script Rodriguez wrote as a writer for hire during a brief production hiatus in the mid-90s .
The second is Machete , a self - directed ( with Ethan Maniquis )
"" Mexploitation "" flick about a Latin hitman who takes revenge on the gringos who double - crossed him . ""
I came up with them both in the same year , "" Rodriguez marvels , "" and now they 're coming out within months of each other , 15 years later .
It 's pretty surreal . ""
At 42 , Rodriguez is coming back to public life with a vengeance .
His last film , the children 's comedy Shorts , was a disappointment , and after the debacle of the Grindhouse double - bill project , made in tandem with Quentin Tarantino , it seemed the pioneering one - man band of US indie cinema might have finally lost his mojo .
But , just as Tarantino bounced back with Inglourious Basterds , so Rodriguez has been taking time to regenerate , with a bunch of projects that , as well as the aforementioned , include the long - delayed sequel to Sin City and , most curious of all , another reboot : a whole new instalment of Spy Kids , the kid - flick fantasy franchise he launched in 2001 .
This reinvention of sorts begins with Predators , a bloody horror sci - fi thriller based on the only script Rodriguez ever wrote to spec .
"" I thought , ' If I only have to write it , I can make it as big as I want , ' "" he recalls . ""
Twentieth Century Fox just wanted a script that would entice Arnold back into the mix .
I knew Arnold personally , and I knew he liked the first film 's jungle setting , so I decided to write something with a jungle setting but set on another planet .
I wanted to make it more of a sequel to the first one , pretending the real Predator 2 did n't exist . ""
As James Cameron 's Aliens was to Alien , "" he continues , "" this would be Predators to Predator .
So I just wrote it – wrote it big , wrote it crazy – and it was completely undoable , especially back then .
The CGI just was n't available like it is today .
So I turned it in and kinda forgot about it .
Arnold decided he was just not interested in doing another Predator and moved on to other things and so , because my script was all Arnold and they could n't just get someone else in without changing it considerably , Fox went the route of the Alien Versus Predator films . "" '
To put these ideas forth and then have the script disappear , not knowing if it was gon na get made was like getting pregnant , having a baby then giving the baby away ! '
Fast - forward over a decade , and Rodriguez was surprised to find this long - lost work back on his desk .
"" Fox came to me and said , ' Would you take on the reins of bringing this franchise back for us ? '
Now , I was n't able to , because I was committed to another directing job at the time .
However , I did say that I could produce it at Troublemaker Studios with my crew and oversee it , because I did n't want it to slip away again . ""
He sighs : "" It was always a strange feeling .
That 's why I did n't take another writing job afterwards .
To put these ideas forth and then have the script disappear , not knowing if it was gon na get made or get changed or made without me , was almost like getting pregnant , having a baby then giving the baby away ! ""
This reboot , which Rodriguez insists stands alone as its own entity , is now an ensemble piece , in which Adrien Brody ( Arnold was "" too busy doing his governor stuff "" ) heads up a band of killers who find themselves stranded in a strange world . ""
My original draft was about the dual meaning of the title .
The ' predators ' were also the humans ; you have all these killers on this planet who could very easily do each other in before they even meet one of the creatures !
Adrien plays a mercenary , but the others are even more hardcore .
There 's a yakuza , somebody from death row , a serial killer , a sniper and a cartel enforcer , and they 're all picked for a reason : this is how the predators evolve , basically , by training on these different types of prey .
Not just humans but other creatures too . ""
Rodriguez remembers the 1987 original with fondness and a perverse awe .
"" I saw it at the theatre , "" he laughs , "" and audiences did n't really know what to make of it at the time
; people thought they were going to see an Arnold , Commando - type movie , and then it turned into more of a sci - fi film .
Arnold does n't even kill it –
it kind of blows itself up – and Arnold is left in a helicopter looking completely shell - shocked , like he 's off to the loony bin !
People enjoyed it but they did n't quite know what to make of it .
But it caught on later and became a cult movie , because it does have that unique mix of genres , which I 've always loved to do .
Films like From Dusk
Till Dawn
that mix genres , I find them more entertaining .
Also , I think the Predator itself is such a great character .
It 's more humanoid than the Alien creature .
You can identify with it , because he looks very human .
He 's badass and he makes total sense ; he 's just a hunter , doing what he does best .
"" It 's a theme that recurs in Rodriguez 's next film , Machete , a full - length version of the fake trailer that preceded Grindhouse . ""
All the stuff from the fake trailer is in the movie , "" Rodriguez enthuses .
"" That was a bizarre way to do it , but , creatively , it was a great challenge .
It was like , ' OK , he 's in a pool with two nude girls ; how did we get there ? '
I had to work backwards , to put him in there in a way that you would n't expect . ""
Then after Machete comes Spy Kids , his first film in digital 3D , then ( possibly ) Sin City 2 , and then – though Rodriguez claims he has no immediate plans to work with Tarantino again – there 's every chance of a QT / RR rematch ( "" We do something every 10 years , "" he grins ) .
In the meantime , he insists , life is very sweet indeed .
"" What could make my life better ? "" he ponders .
"" Oh , if I could only find that magic bottle that lets you never have to sleep .
I have so much stuff I wanna do , but ... ""
He sighs .
"" That six or seven hours you have to be in bed with your eyes closed .
What a waste ! """
"A few months back , California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger let it be known that if the state 's legislators could n't agree a budget by 1 July , state employees would be placed on the federal minimum wage , $ 7.25 per hour .
Their pay would n't ultimately be lost , but would be withheld , paid back months down the road once a budget was agreed on .
A handful of banks and credit unions responded by promising to front their customers the lost wages , so that they would n't personally feel the pain ; but many other banks have said they wo n't do so .
To his credit , John Chiang , the state 's comptroller – essentially the man responsible for writing the state 's checks – announced that he would refuse to implement Schwarzenegger 's change unless courts ordered him to do so .
Now , July has rolled around .
Predictably , the state 's stalemated legislators have n't come up with a viable budget , and equally predictably , Schwarzenegger has announced that up to 200,000 workers will have their salaries slashed to minimum wage for the July pay cycle .
Over the coming weeks , a power battle will play out between Schwarzenegger and Chiang over whether and how to implement the pay reduction .
Governor Schwarzenegger argues that he is only following the law ; and he 's doing so because , he says , without a budget , California simply does n't have the money to pay its workers ' salaries .
On Friday , the governor won round one , when an appeals court ruled in his favor in a judgment about a 2008 case ; Chiang , however , let it be known he 's in no hurry to comply .
But there is a twist .
Six of the smaller public - sector trade unions have already agreed to significant reductions in pension benefits , to increases in their pension contributions and to other rollbacks .
Members of those unions , Schwarzenegger announced , will not see their pay slashed to the minimum wage .
Members of the other six big unions that have yet to sign off on a new contract with the state , on the other hand , will have their pay reduced .
Once they come to contract agreements , their members will no longer be subjected to the minimum wage .
In other words , this is n't really about the state having or not having the money in its coffers to pay workers ; instead , the state 's budget impasse and the resultant opening it gives the governor to impose temporary pay cuts on state workers are being used tactically , to fashion a battering ram with which to bludgeon contract concessions out of trade unions .
Given the fact that tens of thousands of workers and their families now face imminent financial hardship – and , in some cases , ruin –
that 's beyond callous .
It 's stupid , it 's irresponsible and it 's extraordinarily unfair : tens of thousands of workers , who have n't gone out on strike or walked off the job , are being told they have to turn up for work each day but that they are going to be paid a fraction of what they are normally paid .
In another other era , such a staggering display of hubris by a political leader would have been called , quite simply , "" class warfare "" .
Were a private - sector company so openly to breach labor contracts , it would be ruled illegal ; and if , somehow , it was n't , it would spark an almighty labor confrontation .
And yet , in modern - day America , where distrust of public officials and , by extension , public - sector workers runs so deep , state workers have become punching bags upon which society unleashes its more general economic and political frustrations .
Schwarzenegger is banking on this public fury being potent enough , irrational enough , to allow him to out - tough the unions .
On that point , Schwarzenegger may or may not be right .
But on the deeper points – on the moral propriety and the pragmatic impact of his actions – he is utterly wrong .
Morally , the proposed action is a disgrace .
Pragmatically , in its further erosion of the public sector and in its turning the state into a dishonest , shoddy , cut - rate employer , it is a disaster .
The public sector has to retain the ability to attract skilled , educated , motivated employees to staff its increasingly complex operations .
If the state behaves like this today , why on earth would tomorrow 's engineers , architects , wildlife experts , water conservation specialists , earthquake predictors , fire trackers and the like want anything to do with the state tomorrow ?
There is nothing statesmanlike in Schwarzenegger 's plan , nothing noble or brave .
It is a shabby maneuver by a governor who has , over nearly seven years , signally failed to fix California 's daunting economic challenges and as daunting political woes ."

The notion that Miley Cyrus will play Carol Thatcher is rather fanciful ."
"Rioters trashed parts of Oakland , California , today in protest against the verdict in a controversial court case in which a white policeman shot dead an unarmed African American .
At least 100 people were arrested after looting and confrontations with police in Oakland last night and early today .
The protesters ignored a plea for calm by the governor of California , Arnold Schwarzenegger .
The policeman , Johannes Mehserle , 28 , was found guilty yesterday of involuntary manslaughter .
The jury rejected the prosecution case that it was murder .
YouTube showed footage of Mehserle 's shooting of Oscar Grant , 22 , who had been lying on the platform in a railway station on 1 January 2009 , surrounded by police after a fight .
Mehserle claimed he had thought he had reached for an electric Taser rather than his gun .
The case became a cause celebre in the US , with its echoes of the treatment of Rodney King , a black man whose severe beating by police in LA in 1991 was captured on video .
The subsequent acquittals of four LAPD officers sparked the 1992 Los Angeles riots .
Police deployed in Oakland in riot gear yesterdayand shops boarded up their windows in anticipation of a repeat of the rioting that took place in the immediate aftermath of Grant 's shooting .
Up to a thousand protesters took to the streets last nightand early today , some wearing masks with images of Grant 's face .
A banner was unfurled proclaiming "" Oakland Says Guilty ' .
Rioters , some dressed in black and wearing black masks , smashed shop and car windows , helped themselves to goods ranging from jewellery to groceries and trainers , and attacked police lines .
Journalists were also attacked .
The Oakland police chief , Anthony Batts , told a press conference : "" This city is not the wild , wild west .
This city will not tolerate this activity . ""
He blamed anarchists coming from outside Oakland .
"" We started taking a number of rocks and bottles .
We then made a dispersal order . ""
Grant 's family expressed disappointment with the verdict and said he should have been found guilty of murder .
The verdict means the jury thought Mehserle had been criminally negligent but had not intended to kill Grant .
"" My son was murdered , and the law has n't held the officer accountable the way he should be , "" Grant 's mother , Wanda Johnson , said .
Mehserle , who is to be sentenced next month , could face anything from five to 14 years in jail .
John Burris , a lawyer representing the family , described it as a "" compromise verdict "" .
Burris said : "" The system is rarely fair when a police officer shoots an African American male .
No true justice has been given . ""
The trial was held in Los Angeles because of the tension in Oakland and neighbouring San Francisco .
Benjamin Todd Jealous , president of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People , told Reuters : "" We are outraged that the jury did not find guilty of murder in a case that is so egregiously excessive and mishandled . """
"Back in the late 80s / early 90s , John McTiernan made his name with a trio of sharply contrasting action movies , the SF horror flick Predator , the urban terrorist thriller Die Hard , and the cold war military adventure The Hunt for Red October .
All were followed by inferior sequels , and sadly McTiernan 's own career steadily faded .
In the disturbing and oddly resonant Predator , Arnold Schwarzenegger led a punitive expedition in a Latin American jungle that becomes a fight for survival when his Special Forces team encounter an extraterrestrial creature of high intelligence and chameleon - like qualities .
The renewed franchise , the title of which promises more of the same except in the plural , starts intriguingly with a disparate group of trained killers from different areas of conflict .
They 've been parachuted into a strange jungle that is not of this world , having been abducted from their natural habitats by some mysterious force .
What lies in store for them has more shocks than real surprises and is indebted to Ernest B Schoedsack 's 1932 classic
The Most Dangerous Game ( AKA The Hounds of Zaroff ) about a rich sadist hunting human prey on his private Pacific island .
Competently directed by the aptly named Hungarian Nimród Antal , Predators is violent , confused and claustrophobic , with gore in a variety of hues ."

"The basics Back in the dim and distant 1980s , with advances in special effects and stunt art , there emerged a new type of cinema .
Figuring that audiences were younger and with lower attention spans than ever before , Hollywood directors began to turn out movies that were a cocktail of musclebound protagonists , car chases , fight scenes and epic explosions .
The Expendables is Sylvester Stallone 's attempt to crystallise all that was exciting about that format into one extreme blast - fest which counts almost entirely on our nostalgia for faded action stars such as Bruce Willis , Dolph Lundgren , Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jet Li to notch up points .
The stakes This is an important movie for Stallone .
The Italian Stallion has been enjoying something of a renaissance in recent years , but only due to his willingness to retread familiar , still - popular pathways .
He has now called time on the Rocky and Rambo franchises after one last outing in each series , so he needs a new project .
The Expendables , which centres on a group of badass mercenaries with a surprisingly moral compass , looks like a good bet .
The buzz Ever since Stallone announced his plans for a film which would bring together many of his action contemporaries , the blogosphere has been rife with stories incrementally putting together the pieces of the final puzzle which has become The Expendables .
In November 2008 it was announced that Lundgren , who played Stallone 's Russian opponent in Rocky 4 , had joined the setup , while February last year saw rumours begin to circulate that Schwarzenegger would emerge briefly from his acting retirement to shoot a cameo .
In September the movie 's trailer premiered at the Venice film festival .
Fanboy favourite aintitcool.com got so excited about the release that it began running daily interviews with Stallone in the runup to the movie 's bow in US cinemas .
There was , however , disappointment that Steven Seagal and Jean - Claude Van Damme had declined to make appearances .
The bitching Perhaps inevitably , reviews have failed to live up to the hype .
Over on the aggregator site rottentomatoes.com , the film is currently running at 43 % "" rotten "" , a long way below the most recent Rocky outing , Rocky Balboa ( 76 % "" fresh "" ) , though above 2008 's Rambo ( 36 % "" rotten "" ) .
At the New York Post , Lou Lumick called the movie an "" incoherent , inept , testosterone - drenched mess , which is very much the brain - dead male equivalent of "" Sex and the City 2 "" .
At the New Yorker , Anthony Lane described the film as "" savage yet inert , and breathtakingly sleazy in its lack of imagination "" , adding : "" Stallone , who co - wrote the movie with Dave Callaham , is also listed as the director , but since he appears to be having trouble , in the autumn of his years , getting his eyelids and lower lip to act in consort with the rest of him , I 'm hardly surprised that he had no energy left over to command the film . ""
The fawning Others , however , found themselves able to see beyond The Expendables ' aesthetic failings and enjoy the film 's sheer brazen bombast .
"" It 's not particularly well made , but the patchiness only adds to the considerable goodwill and charm the movie carries , "" wrote our own Phelim O'Neill .
"" It makes for a great time in the cinema and you should see it with the rowdiest crowd possible . ""
"" The body count is high and the personalities click in this old - school testosterone fest , "" enthused the Hollywood Reporter 's Sheri Linden .
"" Stallone and his cast of fellow action stars flex substantial ensemble muscle in this high - energy battle between good mercenaries and bad mercenaries .
An effective mix of lean and over - the - top , The Expendables is often preposterous , but it achieves the immediacy of a graphic novel without the overdone mythology .
"" The punters Having opened at the weekend in the US , where it took the No 1 spot at the box office with $ 35 m ( £ 22.4 m ) , The Expendables is also trending on Twitter .
A much - retweeted post is complex.com's list of the best one - liners from the movie , which includes joys such as Stallone 's response when asked by Bruce Willis 's character to explain why Arnold Schwarzenegger 's rival mercenary is behaving a little tetchily : "" He wants to be president . ""
Also popular is Stallone 's announcement that he 's already planning a sequel .
The prognosis The Expendables may have scored points with those who delight in the shallow but intense confection that is action cinema , but it does not – for me – really feel much like a movie in the traditional sense at all .
There is a loose plot involving the team 's return to a fictional Caribbean island to rescue a local lady who got left behind during a previous , aborted mission .
There are one - liners and fight scenes galore , including an amusing battle between the rather differently - sized Li and Lundgren , and a segue in which Statham takes out an entire team of basketball players after one of them dares to smack his ex up .
There 's a sublime moment from Mickey Rourke as a retired Expendable crying into his tattoo ink pots over a lost chance to save a ( different ) local woman while on a mission to Bosnia several years previously .
And there are some predictably preposterous detonations , as well as a whole host of enjoyably unlikely takedowns .
Yet the whole thing feels rather more like an extended compendium of those three - minute skits filmed for the MTV movie awards where famous faces promote their new films with sly and knowing banter to wild cheers from the audience .
All there really is here to get the pulse pumping is a series of recognition moments , and for those of us not aware of the likes of Steve Austin or Terry Crews , some of the in - jokes are probably going to go under the radar .
All in all , it 's exactly what you 'd expect from such a contrived concoction : the movie equivalent of a momentarily diverting puff of smoke , with nothing to ground it in the cerebrum once the final spills and thrills have been delivered .
That would n't be so bad if the whole thing did n't feel so straight - to - DVD cheap : on this evidence , it might be a blessing for cinemagoers ( though a cruel blow for Stallone himself ) if the actor continues to struggle to maintain fitness levels appropriate for taking part in such hi - octane fare .
The thought of this project becoming an extended series is , frankly , horrifying ."
"For arguably the worst film of his undistinguished career , Sly Stallone has assembled a crowd of familiar screen action men to play a band of mercenaries who go around the world gleefully wasting bad guys in large numbers with guns , knives , explosives and karate chops .
When not killing people , they grin at one another and swap self - aggrandising macho talk .
Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger have non - executive walk - on roles and Chuck Norris , Jean - Claude Van Damme , Steven Seagal and Vinnie Jones are presumably being held in reserve for the sequel .
For the record , John Ford 's They Were Expendable , one of the greatest pictures about men in battle , is indispensable .
Stallone 's Expendables is redundant , superfluous , worthless and every pejorative synonym Roget can come up with ."
"Perched on stage beside the hulking figure of Arnold Schwarzenegger last weekend , Alibaba boss , Jack Ma , looked slighter than ever .
But the entrepreneur did not need the Californian governor 's tips on keeping lean and building muscle .
In just over a decade , he has turned a tiny startup into an online titan .
Previous star turns at the two - day AliFest – the firm 's annual celebratory rally in its eastern Chinese home of Hangzhou – have included the former US president Bill Clinton , micro - credit pioneer Muhammad Yunus and the basketball star Kobe Bryant .
Such high - profile guests not only signal Alibaba 's achievements but highlight its ambitions for the future .
Having triumphed in the Chinese market , its sights are set on the world , beginning with the US , India and Japan .
In recent months , Alibaba has made its first two US acquisitions , Vendio and Auctiva .
It is pushing to expand its overseas presence with AliExpress , its new online marketplace , and executives said they would be happy to buy back Yahoo 's 40 % stake in the group ( although they are currently engaged in a spat .
Analysts see little prospect of this for now : the group is Yahoo 's foothold in China and has helped hold up its share price ) .
"" Alibaba is extremely ambitious and they want to champion China 's outbound growth , "" said Duncan Clark , chairman of the consultancy BDA China .
"" You 've got the first wave of natural resource companies ; the second wave of manufacturing , moving into hi - tech with companies like Huawei .
Now the big question is : can Chinese companies prosper and operate in managing businesses overseas and targeting overseas consumers ?
They 're going to have a crack at it
and they 're encouraged by the government to do so .
"" Alibaba may be better positioned than most .
Overseas experience ?

2007 flotation netted $ 1.5bn and Japan 's Softbank has provided additional investment .
Like other Chinese internet companies , Alibaba has already trounced a US giant at home ; cultural differences and government policy have left the west 's household names as also - rans , has - beens or never - weres on the Chinese mainland .
Baidu and Tencent run things here , not Google or Amazon .
When eBay bought a leading local customer - to - customer site in 2003 , Ma took the fight to them by setting up a rival service , Taobao – not only free to users but carefully tailored to China in everything from its colour scheme to the creation of an escrow system to counter widespread fears of being cheated .
Within two years , eBay had in effect withdrawn ; the joint venture it later launched with the Chinese firm Tom Online is now said to have a single - digit share of the market .
Success at home
Meanwhile , Taobao boasts it has more than 190 million registered users and the research firm Analysys estimates it has more than 75 % of the consumer - to - consumer market , with online transactions of 88.2bn yuan ( £ 8.5bn ) in the second quarter of this year .
The same firm estimated Alibaba controls more than 73 % of the domestic business - to - business market by income .
Its grasp of the export market is such that it now makes quarterly reports to the Chinese government .
With the world 's largest internet population – 400 million and rising
– there is plenty of room for growth .
Last month , Deutsche Bank forecast China would handle more than 1.5 trillion yuan in online transactions by 2014 , due to annual growth rates of 42 % .
Whether Alibaba can thrive abroad is another matter . ""
[ Chinese firms ] have understood the Chinese users much better than foreign companies , "" said Mark Natkin , managing director of the Beijing - based Marbridge Consulting .
"" That 's not really an advantage once you go overseas . ""
This knowledge gap appears to explain the improbable appearance of eBay 's chief executive , John Donahoe , at AliFest this year .
"" We are competitors in some ways
but we have the same dream , the same mission and the same goal to help entrepreneurs , "" Ma said .
"" I believe one day we will work very closely together . ""
The companies announced they were exploring further collaboration ; already , the online PayPal system owned by eBay is in use on AliExpress .
Alibaba aims to create a seamless chain of online transactions between suppliers , retailers and consumers .
But outside China the last link between retailers and customers is likely to come through others , such as eBay , alibaba.com's chief executive , David Wei , said in an interview .
Strategic deals could help Alibaba to grow outside its comfort zone , and aid eBay as it struggles to fight off Amazon .
Yet analysts identify potential for future conflict .
"" We think Alibaba and eBay are moving into each other 's territory , as eBay helps China manufacturers sell directly on eBay , and Alibaba develops relationships with US online merchants .
The two are effectively ' frenemies ' , with eBay at the western end of a supply chain and reaching east , and Alibaba at the eastern end and expanding west , "" wrote James Mitchell and Lisa Yuan of Goldman Sachs in a note last month .
They said Alibaba 's acquisitions of Auctiva and Vendio provide tools for about 250,000 sellers who together account for about a quarter of eBay 's business .
Those firms could one day encourage merchant partners to list products on a rival platform .
Wei insists AliExpress is a wholesale service that aims to streamline sourcing and reach smaller retailers .
Alibaba.com helps firms to find suppliers whereas AliExpress enables them to buy online .
Yet , with no minimum order controls , it has obvious appeal to individual bargain hunters .
You can buy a single memory card reader for 30 cents , plastic Halloween lanterns for 80 cents or a pair of platform shoes for under $ 10 – all with free shipping .
The homepage boasts that it offers "" small orders … from just one item "" .
"" This kind of activity … is not what we are designed for , "" said Wei .
"" I have never seen any online or offline platform that can serve both retail and wholesale customers . ""
No one could accuse Alibaba 's executives of lacking confidence .
But as they strike out for new shores they have good reason to be wary – as another of the weekend 's keynote speakers , Lenovo 's chairman Liu Chuanzhi , reminded them . ""
At home we really are leaders , "" said the boss of the consumer electronics giant . ""
But after going abroad , we found out the ocean [ between countries ] may be deeper than the rivers in China . ""

"California 's governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , has come out fighting for his green legacy , going on the attack against the oil companies and rightwing groups bankrolling a campaign to suspend AB32 , a landmark environmental law .
Schwarzenegger , who is serving out his last weeks as governor , denounced a ballot initiative called proposition 23 that is seeking to roll back AB32 to reduce California 's greenhouse gas emissions .
He said it was a cynical move by Big Oil to protect its profits . ""
Does anyone really believe that these companies , out of their black - oil hearts , are really spending millions and millions of dollars to protect jobs ?
It 's not about jobs at all .
It 's about their ability to pollute and thus protect their profits , "" Schwarzenegger said in an appearance at the Commonwealth Club in Santa Clara .
He warned that the ballot initiative would cripple clean technology – the fastest growing sector of California 's economy .
It would delay the planned 2012 launch of a regional carbon trading market until California 's unemployment rate drops below 5.5 % , and remains there for a year .
Unemployment in California is 12 % , and has fallen below 5.5 % on only three occasions since 1970 , so the measure is widely seen as a ruse to put an indefinite delay on action on climate change .
The intervention from the governor , and the release this week of the first television ads ( below ) , mark a ramping up of the debate over California 's landmark climate law .
The measure was the first of its kind in the US , in a state that stands out for its green efforts , from emissions standards on cars and power plants to a thriving ' clean technology ' industry .
A defeat would discourage other states from acting to reduce greenhouse gas emissions – especially now that Congress has dropped its climate change bill .
Two Texas - based oil refining companies , Valero Energy Corp and Tesoro Corp , have given about $ 4 m and $ 1.5 m to the campaign respectively .
The billionaire Koch brothers , who own most of Koch Insdustries , and who reportedly have helped fund the Tea Party movement , contributed $ 1 m through a Kansas - based subsidiary .
An obscure Missouri group , the Adam Smith Foundation , which reportedly ended 2009 with $ 109 profit , donated $ 498,000 .
There is no apparent relation to the Adam Smith organisation in the UK .
The group , which was established in 2007 , has made small donations to local conservative groups in Missouri .
A blog post on the foundation website said : "" In this weak economy , we can not afford stricter environmental regulations . ""
James Harris , a Republican political consultant in Missouri described as the guiding spirit of the organisation , told the Los Angeles Times : "" California has some pretty crazy lawmakers who want to attack families ' and individuals ' opportunities to provide for themselves , and these are disastrous ideas .
We want to make sure these types of ideas out west do not take hold . ""
The size of the funds flowing in from other states has attracted attention in California .
"" This is not at all routine , "" said Dan Newman , the executive director of Maplight , which works for greater transparency in political spending .
"" The level of spending is unusually high and it is also unusual in the fact that so much is from out - of - state . ""
It seems unlikely to stop .
The president of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association has appealed for even more support .
"" I am pleading with each of you – for our nation 's best interest and for your company 's own self - interest , "" wrote Charles Drevna in an email quoted in the Wall Street Journal .
A Los Angeles Times / University of Southern California poll this week suggested a tough fight over the ballot measure .
It found 40 % would support the ballot measure , and 38 % oppose it .
About a fifth of voters had yet to make up their minds .

"Meg Whitman , the Republican running to replace Arnold Schwarzenegger as governor of California , yesterday ran into a perennial minefield for US politicians : having employed domestic staff lacking legal work status .
In Whitman 's case , the former chief executive of eBay is accused of employing a Mexican woman as her housekeeper for nine years , in spite of the woman 's legal status being brought to her attention by US authorities .
Similar charges have curtailed a string of political careers in recent years , and illegal immigration remains a highly charged subject as US voters prepare to go to the polls in the midterm elections .
In a press conference hosted by celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred , the housekeeper , Nicky Diaz Santillan , recounted how she worked for Whitman from 2000 until last year , when she asked Whitman for legal help over her immigration status and was promptly fired .
"" I felt she was throwing me away like a piece of garbage , "" Diaz Santillan said , breaking into tears .
Allred claims
Whitman received a letter from the Social Security Administration on 22 April 2003 , saying the social security number provided by Diaz Santillan did not match the name on file .
Allred did not provide a copy of the letter .
The housekeeper said she saw the letter and that Whitman and her husband never asked about her immigration status after receiving it .
Whitman denied that account .
"" We never received that letter or that notification , "" she said after a campaign event in San Jose : "" I feel terrible for Nicky
…
She 's being manipulated . ""
During her campaign for governor , Whitman has repeatedly called for tougher sanctions against employers who hire illegal workers , starting with fines .
"" We do have to hold employers accountable for hiring only documented workers .
And we do have to enforce that law , "" she said during a debate with Jerry Brown , the Democratic candidate , on Tuesday night .
Whitman is locked in an expensive struggle with Brown in which the latest poll by CNN shows her trailing by 52 % to 43 % , despite outspending him by tens of millions of dollars .
Whitman 's aides released employment applications they said Diaz Santillan filled out when she was hired , indicating she was a legal resident .
The documents included a copy of a social security card and a California driving licence .
The campaign said in a statement that Diaz Santillan came to Whitman and her husband in June 2009 and confessed that she had used her sister 's documents to gain employment .
That was five months after Whitman formed an exploratory committee to run for governor .
Allred also said the housekeeper was mistreated , and said she will file a claim against Whitman for back pay . ""
She wants so much to help the other Nickys of this world who are working for the other Megs of this world , "" Allred said .
Whitman 's campaign said Allred 's claims were a blatant political stunt timed just weeks before the November election .
Latinos make up 21 % of California 's electoral roll .
Many are recent immigrants unlikely to be impressed by Whitman 's treatment of her housekeeper ."
"His last visit to Moscow was in 1988 , when he starred as a Soviet cop with the less than imaginative name of Ivan .
But two decades later Arnold Schwarzenegger was back in Russia 's capital today – only to be offered a job as the city 's mayor .
Half - asleep commuters were surprised when the governor of California got into their packed metro carriage , an unthinkable act for Kremlin politicians who invariably travel to work in a big shiny Mercedes .
Schwarzenegger posted a snap of his journey on Twitter , remarking on Muscovites ' apparent love of public transport .
( His grinning companions are the US and Austrian ambassadors ; several of his co - passengers are taking photos of the ex - Hollywood star ; others , however clearly have no idea who he is .
Or possibly do n't care . )
He later met Dmitry Medvedev , Russia 's president and fellow Twitter enthusiast .
Medvedev greeted him after his arrival yesterday with the friendly tweet : "" Welcome to Russia . ""
He later tweeted a picture of the two of them spending some quality time lifting weights .
Medvedev jokingly offered Schwarzenegger the job of Moscow 's new mayor — after he sacked the last one Yuri Luzhkov , last month , citing lack of trust .
"" If you were a Russian citizen you could come and work for us , "" Medvedev told Schwarzenegger .
Certainly Schwarzenegger would be more popular than any of the four lacklustre Kremlin and Moscow city officials who have been shortlisted to replace Luzhkov .
And he might need employment : his current gubernatorial term expires in January .
For his part , Schwarzenegger hailed Medvedev as "" one of those great visionaries "" .
He said he was thrilled to be back in Moscow , which he visited while starring as a Soviet cop in the 1988 movie Red Heat .
"" I never thought at that point that I would be back as governor , "" he said .
The Californian governor is leading a delegation of Silicon Valley business leaders and investors , repaying a visit Medvedev made to Silicon Valley in June , when the Russian president was one of the first people to lay his hands on a new iPad .
Medvedev is seeking foreign partners for his pet modernisation project , Skolkovo , a new hi - tech development 30 miles outside of Moscow that is supposed to be Russia 's answer to Silicon Valley .
Observers , however , are sceptical that the project will offer any serious competition to the US one , given Russia 's high levels of corruption and strangling bureaucracy ."

"Private Eye has a good cover this week headlined : "" Countdown to cuts â€ “ sombre mood grips nation , "" showing George Osborne smiling giddily amid a sea of grim - looking faces .
David Cameron demonstrated today that he too has his finger on the pulse of the country , with a quick quip greeting Arnold Schwarzenegger when the California governor visited Downing Street this morning . ""
He 's going to help me terminate the budget deficit , "" the prime minister joked .
PS :
I know I 'm ignoring any real news coming out of this meeting of the two great compassionate conservatives of our time .
But luckily the Press Association news agency was on hand to provide the key facts : Standing side by side , the governor , wearing a bright pink tie , was slightly shorter but also noticeably broader than Mr Cameron ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger used one of his last big moments as California 's governor to rally regional and business leaders on climate change today , saying that together they had the muscle to force national governments to act .
At the opening of his third and last climate summit , Schwarzenegger said leaders could learn from California 's example as an environmental pioneer .
"" I know that together we can usher in a new era and build a cleaner and brighter , more prosperous future , so I say : let 's do it , "" Schwarzengger told the summit at the University of California at Davis .
The two - day summit is one of his final opportunities to shore up his reputation as California 's green governor .
His successor , Democrat Jerry Brown , takes over in January .
Schwarzenegger plans to drive home the message tomorrow with the launch of his R20 partnership of regional and business leaders , which aims to function like a financial matchmaking service , finding investors from the World Bank and private corporations for renewable energy projects in developing countries .
The UN climate chief and the state department have endorsed the programme .
The governor is also expected to announce a conservation agreement covering 20 % of the world 's tropical forests in 14 US states and Brazil , Indonesia , Mexico and Nigeria .
The two - day summit , which brings together US , Canadian and international leaders along with celebrities such as Harrison Ford and Deepak Chopra , was perfectly timed to show up the fragility of green reforms : it comes just two weeks after Republican victories in the mid - term elections shut off prospects for action on global warming in Washington .
Global leaders will gather in Cancun later this month for the UN 's climate conference .
But after the collapse of last year 's summit at Copenhagen , they have warned that there is scope only for limited agreements on climate finance issues .
But Schwarzenegger told the summit to press on .
"" I 'm sure that many of you of course were discouraged and wondered , ' What does it all mean for our environmental movement here ?
Is this a vision of a clean energy future , or is it a fairy tale ? ' "" he said .
But he said California had offered signs of encouragement .
Californians voted by more than a 20 % margin last month to reject a ballot initiative that would have rolled back the state 's landmark climate law .
The scale of that victory demonstrated that climate change had outgrown the old categories of being seen as a Democratic issue or a Republican issue and was now a much broader concern .
He went on to say that the "" green revolution "" was under way from Norway to China : "" The science is on our side , the economy is on our side , the people are on our side . ""
he said .
Several of yesterday 's speakers picked up on Schwarzenegger 's main theme - that action by state governments and business leaders could make up for some of the failures by national governments .
A number also took digs at the failed efforts by Barack Obama and Democrats in Congress to pass a sweeping climate change law .
"" Maybe we do n't have to say we have got to have a big comprehensive solution , "" said George Schultz , secretary of state under the first George Bush and a key adviser to Schwarzenegger .
"" Let 's say let 's do a little of this and a little of that . """
"Arnold Schwarzenegger , David Lynch and Baz Luhrmann yesterday spoke at the funeral for the late film producer Dino De Laurentiis , who died last week at the age of 91 .
They described a larger than life figure with no fear of failure who loved life , his family , good Italian food and the movies .
Schwarzenegger revealed how De Laurentiis , who left his native Italy to pursue a Hollywood career in 1976 , gave him his first major role in Conan the Barbarian and taught him to be fearless in his career choices . ""
He never feared failure , and this is the only way you can be successful in life , "" the governor said .
"" I learned that from Dino .
"" I have unbelievable memories of the man , "" Schwarzenegger added .
"" How he inspired me , how he taught me about being courageous , to be smart and to have a big heart and to be giving . ""
The actor turned politician also described his first meeting with the man – a short one in which he learned he would not be considered for the role of Flash Gordon .
Schwarzenegger said he arrived at De Laurentiis 's office with his agent , saw a small man seated behind a massive desk and blurted out : "" Why does such a tiny guy like you need such a big desk ? ""
De Laurentiis immediately replied : "" You got an accent .
You ca n't be Flash Gordon , "" and asked the pair to leave .
The agent then berated Schwarzenegger for losing in less than two minutes a part that he had spent months trying to get him an audition for .
David Lynch , who made Dune and Blue Velvet with De Laurentiis , said the producer "" fought big "" and "" dreamed big "" .
He added : "" That 's the way he saw the cinema , as big .
Ten grown athletic men combined , on PCP , would not equal even a tiny fraction of the energy that Dino had every day ...
Dino was like a steamroller working , dreaming and thinking the movies . ""
Luhrmann , who tried and failed to make an Alexander the Great film with De Laurentiis , said the Italian "" taught me how to have fun "" . ""
Dino De Laurentiis was able to blend effortlessly , without any effort whatsoever , life , art and family , "" said the Australian film - maker .
The producer 's youngest daughters , Carolyna and Dina , also eulogised their father during the service at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles , which hosts many of the city 's most prominent funerals .
Carolyna De Laurentiis called the film - maker "" a force of life "" and a "" master of Italian guilt "" .
Many guests at the 90-minute service wore red , as it was De Laurentiis 's favourite colour ."

"It 's very nearly a wrap for Arnold Schwarzenegger , whose career as governor of California will come sputtering to an end in January with his approval rating in the 20s , the state budget shortfall at $ 25bn ( Â£16bn ) , and unemployment at nearly 13 % .
But , like the action heroes he has so often played , the man they called the governator is already working on a comeback .
In what is likely his last performance on a world stage as governor , Schwarzenegger this week launched the R20 climate network , an alliance of regional leaders who have pledged to work together to fight climate change .
Schwarzenegger is the "" founding father "" of the new venture , a self - appointed global champion in the war against climate change .
Backstage at the performance hall at the University of California , Davis , Schwarzenegger is moments away from revealing to the Guardian the formula that will jolt the world 's jaded and divided populace from their dangerous inertia in the face of great peril .
First , though , there is the basket of muffins laid out in his backstage dressing room .
"" This is where the action is .
Right here , "" he says , grabbing one .
How will he approach the fight against climate change ?
"" I always was a big believer in doing things on a global level , "" he said .
"" Everything I have ever done , I always was interested in doing it globally
â€ “ if it was the fitness , if it was the bodybuilding , if it was entertainment and acting and showbusiness . ""
Schwarzenegger has had more than 40 years of celebrity since storming the world of bodybuilding .
He conquered Hollywood .
His marriage to Maria Kennedy Shriver catapulted him into America 's elite .
But he is 63 now .
The action - hero physique is bulkier and swathed in suits and ties
â€ “ bright green at environmental gatherings like this .
Schwarzenegger said he could see a place for himself mobilising world opinion â€ “ and investment capital â€ “ in support of clean tech projects around the world that together could help reduce global warming .
"" I think that I have the talent of speaking the language in such a way so that the world understands it rather than making it complicated , "" he said .
But do n't expect to see Schwarzenegger touring an Al Gore - style scientific slideshow .
The governator 's version of environmental leadership hinges on avoiding mention of the words climate change or greenhouse gas emissions , which he thinks are a turn - off for some people .
"" People get stuck and fall in love with their slogans and with their little agendas , "" he said .
"" You 've got to make it hip .
You 've got to make it sexy to be part of this movement .
"" You 've also got to steer clear of party politics .
Schwarzenegger , a Republican , refuses to see the environment as a solely Democratic preserve .
"" People get stuck in this political crap when in fact you do n't need to , "" he said .
"" Let 's just leave politics out and find out what we can do together . ""
The vehicle for this next stage of his life is the new R20 group of city and state leaders , which Schwarzenegger conjured into being at his climate summit this week .
The group , whose name is a conscious play on the G20 club of major world economies , is devoted to putting together clean energy projects in developing countries by recruiting finance from industrialised countries .
The first wave of projects is likely to involve the installation of white roofs , which reflect the sun and keep houses cool , aides said .
After this week 's launch , the next stop is Cancun , where aides say the R20 will hold a side event at the UN climate summit .
Then there is the prospect of another star turn for Schwarzenegger , who is thinking of putting in an appearance at Davos , the talking shop of the global elite .
Then he will see where the R20 takes him . ""
It could very well be that this would be the main thing , "" he said of his new career , but just as immediately mentioned some alternatives .
"" It could also be that it would be one of five things that I would do .
It could be showbusiness .
It could be business in general . ""
Schwarzenegger admits he stumbled into the role of environmental activist when he signed California 's ambitious climate change law in 2006
â€ “ the same year
Gore came out with An Inconvenient Truth .
Four years later Schwarzenegger helped defeat an attempt to repeal the law by Texas oil companies in the midterm elections .
He would have liked to be known as an economics guru â€ “
but then California 's budget deficit just topped $ 25bn .
He would have liked to be seen as a model of post - partisan politics â€ “
but then he admits that he has little or no sway over his fellow Republicans in Washington .
That left an opening on the environment , at a time when Congress and international climate negotiations had both failed to deliver results â€ “
and Schwarzenegger says his whole life has been built on finding such openings .
"" My whole life I was always very ambitious , but I was smart enough to always look ,
what is my talent , what do I have to offer to the world ?
Then you go with that .
You never know .
Six years ago , seven years ago I did not know it would drag me into this , "" he said .
"" But you go with it .
"" It 's too early to say how R20 will fill the gap in national and international action on climate change .
This year 's climate summit , the third and last for Schwarzenegger , was a slightly shrunken affair , transplanted from the glitz of Los Angeles to the clean tech hub of the University of California at Davis .
Schwarzenegger managed to rustle up some big names .
David Cameron joined in a video satellite conversation .
Prince Charles sent a video talking about harmony .
The primatologist Jane Goodall sent a rendition of a chimpanzee greeting .
Harrison Ford and Deepak Chopra came in person , as did a couple of governors .
But those governors , like Schwarzenegger , will soon be leaving office .
Officials from China , the world 's largest emitter , were at the meeting , but did not sign on .
By lunchtime , a Dutch official , who did sign on , was telling his dining companions he thought it was another empty promise .
However , Terry Tamminen , an adviser to Schwarzenegger who will effectively run the R20 , argued that the organisation would help fill the critical gap caused by the failure of the UN to reach a global agreement on climate change .
The organisation hopes to recruit enough members to represent 20 % of the world 's economies within the next year .
"" If you start getting to that size in terms of economies of scale and greenhouse gas reductions in one organised effort , then it becomes a coalition of the willing , "" he said .
"" Then hopefully even more of the world 's economies join in and then you get to the virtuous tipping point where it 's easier for the rest of the countries in the world to join in . ""
Much of that depends on Schwarzenegger 's ability to rally celebrities , world leaders and the public .
Few personalities can command the support from global leaders that he can â€ “ or boast a global fan base many million strong .
Schwarzenegger said he has led his entire life by just waiting for the pieces to fall into place , and then making his move .
"" There is a lot of it that falls into place like that , "" he said .
"" It all unfolds and you just say , ' OK . ' """
"Arnold Schwarzenegger is willing to consider a return to the movies , he said in an interview to mark his departure from the post of governor of California on Monday .
Schwarzenegger told Variety magazine [ paywall ] he had not yet decided what to do with his future , but confirmed that acting was on the list of possibilities .
The Austrian - born former bodybuilder recently took a cameo in the Sylvester Stallone action movie The Expendables , further signalling , perhaps , his willingness to return to the big screen following seven years in political office . ""
The list is a long list of things I can do , but nothing I can concentrate on until I am literally , totally out of office , "" Schwarzenegger said .
"" For me the joy of life is not to know , and you get into it and you kind of figure it out .
I love that .
I do n't like safety nets .
I am not a believer in that â€
¦
So you go in there with an open mind and you have to learn very quickly . ""
Schwarzenegger , who ended his California tenure with a low approval rating and might struggle to continue a career in politics , said he did not think it would be a problem to return to acting .
"" It is like bicycling , or like skiing , "" he said .
"" You get on it and you feel like there is no time lapse there at all . ""
During his time out of the spotlight , no action star has emerged to challenge the eminent position Schwarzenegger won in the 1980s and 90s .
Yet at 63 he might struggle to return to high - octane fare .
On the other hand , The Expendables , headlined by a 64-year - old Stallone with support from younger stars , turned out to be one of last year 's most successful action films .
Stranger things have happened ."
"Age : 63 .
Appearance :
Treelike .
This is probably a stupid question , but I 'm still getting over New Year 's Eve .
When you say "" treelike "" . . .
Yes ?
Are we talking Leylandii or Victoria plum ?
Should I be imagining green branches or juicy fruit ?
Swollen muscles .
The "" Austrian Oak "" got his nickname in the 1970s when he was a bodybuilder .
It was a reference to his physique , rather than acorns .
Are you sure he 's not made of wood ?
I 've seen his movies .
Who has n't ?
No video collection would be complete without Terminators 1 , 2 and 3 , Predator , True Lies , Batman and Robin , Total Recall , Last Action Hero . . .
Do n't forget Pee Wee Herman 's Big Adventure .
I 'll never forget the despair on Arnie 's face when he realised his bicycle had been stolen .
He was n't in Pee Wee Herman 's Big Adventure .
That was Pee Wee Herman .
I suppose the name should have been a giveaway .
So where has Arnie been in the last few years ?
Until today he 's been governor of California .
I thought that was Jerry Brown .
It was him back in the 70s and 80s , and it is again .
But from 2003 it was Arnie , AKA the Governator .
A Republican , of course ?
One might almost think a lifetime spent blowing away villains on screen encourages a hardline approach to problem - solving .
Careful , or Clint will come round and shoot a hole in you .
Schwarzenegger gave his heart to the Republicans long before he got into films .
His heroes included Richard Nixon and George W Bush , who dubbed him Conan the Republican .
That man 's had more nicknames than hot dinners .
Is one of them Saviour of California ?
Probably not .
Having promised to put the state 's finances in order , he left it with a $ 28bn budget deficit .
What now ?
Back to movie - making ?
Like a true politician , he 's refusing to rule anything out .
There is "" a long list of things "" he can do , "" but nothing I can concentrate on until I am literally , totally out of office "" .
Do say : "" Hasta la vista , baby . ""
Do n't say : "" You are terminated . """
"Arnold Schwarzenegger has identified three screenplays that may form the basis of his return to the movie industry after serving seven years as governor of California .
Interviewed in Austrian newspaper the Krone , Schwarzenegger said a return to movies was inevitable , but added that he was waiting for the right script and director .
"" I 'm reading three scripts , "" he said .
"" One topic / script , which I considered a long time ago before governor , is delighting me particularly .
I would play an older [ German ] soldier , who gets the order at the end of the war to kill a bunch of kids .
But he does n't do it and gets them to safety at the risk of his life .
It has all kinds of adventure .
The script is based on a true story .
"" The screenplay described by Schwarzenegger sounds like With Wings
As Eagles , by Braveheart writer Randall Wallace , and is based on Ostermann 's War by James J Cullen .
Schwarzenegger became attached to the project in 1996 , when second world war films were all the rage with studios â€ “ Saving Private Ryan was made during the same period and hit cinemas in 1998 .
With Wings
As Eagles is the story of a German colonel ordered by the SS to kill thousands of American prisoners of war in the final days of the war .
He refuses â€ “ and fights against his former comrades .
Wallace 's screenplay was written with Schwarzenegger in mind , and describes Ostermann as a man with "" a muscular body of physical power "" .
The full screenplay can be read online here .
In the Krone interview , Schwarzenegger cites Clint Eastwood as an example of a former action star with a productive late - period acting career , hinting that he will choose smaller films with lower budgets on his return to Hollywood . ""
Throwing myself around the room and shooting people is no longer in there , "" he says .
"" [ But ] I 'm like a sponge that soaks up knowledge and is constantly willing to learn new things . ""
Schwarzenegger also told the Krone that taking the California job cost him as much as $ 200 m in savings and lost earnings .
He said he did not regret taking on the role , however .
He also talked about his intention to become an international advocate for environmental reform ."
"Vestas , the largest windpower company in the world , last night won the $ 1.5 m ( £ 940,000 ) Zayed Future Energy prize in Abu Dhabi .
But in what has been called an "" remarkable "" act , the Danish company gave all its prize money away to a new NGO , an impoverished Indian teacher , Arnold Schwarzenegger 's former environmental adviser , and a leading US photovoltaic company .
Having installed more windpower than any other company , Vestas turbines now generate enough electricity to provide for 21 million people .
Amory Lovins , chief scientist of the Rocky Mountain Institute , and clean energy investors E+Co
each won $ 350,000 ( £ 218,585 ) as runners - up , but Vestas chief executive , Ditlev Engel , said he was concerned that other runners - up would receive nothing .
"" We quickly decided that we should seize the opportunity to extend the influence of the prize through redistributing the cash award to others , "" he said .
The company gave $ 750,000 ( £ 468,396 ) to WindMade , a new label for products made with windpower backed by a coalition including Bloomberg , Lego Group and WWF .
It also gave $ 250,000 ( £ 156,145 ) to Bunker Roy , founder of the Barefoot College in India , Terry Terry Tamminen , former Schwarzenegger adviser and Australian founder of Seventh Generation Advisors , and thin film PV company First Solar .
Roy said he was "" delighted "" .
Barefoot is the only college in the world open only to those without any formal education , training women and the poorest to combine local knowledge with new green technologies .
Some 15,000 people have learned to become "" barefoot "" water and solar engineers , architects and teachers .
Engel chided Britain for entering the windpower race late .
"" You had the best resource , a head start on everyone else .
Now you are running to catch up . ""
But he said Britain was still in with a chance of building a new generation of large 6MW offshore turbines which would come on stream in the next few years .
Most large turbines today are around the 3MW mark .
Vestas last year had to lay off more than 3,000 people in Europe when it closed five factories because of the recession and closed the UK 's only major wind turbine plant in 2009 , but has grown significantly in the United States .
•
John Vidal 's travel and accommodation were paid for by the Zayed Future Energy prize ."
"He said he 'd be back , and now he is .
Stint as governor of California completed , Arnold Schwarzenegger has two paths open to him â€ “ one leading to the White House and one leading back to Hollywood .
But until the American constitution allows foreign - born citizens to become president â€ “ and until American voters suddenly grow fond of men who 've run entire states to the brink of irreversible bankruptcy â€ “ then Hollywood it is .
There 's just one small problem , though .
Is Arnold Schwarzenegger planning to make the films that Arnold Schwarzenegger should be making ?
The answer , it seems , is no .
In an interview with Austrian newspaper the Krone this week , Schwarzenegger claimed that he 's currently giving consideration to three scripts , one of which would appear to be Wings of Eagles , a story about a benevolent , child - saving Nazi general .
Worse still , he also singled out Clint Eastwood 's tactic of releasing small but critically lauded films on a regular basis as a model that he 'd like to replicate in years to come .
Clearly this is an error .
Just because he 's dipped his toe into politics a little does n't mean that people automatically want to see Arnold Schwarzenegger suddenly become all worthy and serious .
If he 's really going to make films again , there has to be a better direction for him to take .
Like action films , for example .
After all , Arnold Schwarzenegger is still only 63 years old and in relatively decent shape .
A little bit of training to make sure that he can still recklessly flail a broadsword or blow up a juggernaut with a bazooka , and he 'll be more than ready to hop back in the saddle .
And if it 's still commercially viable for a creaking , third - rate Schwarzenegger copyist like Steven Seagal to churn out nonsense like Driven to Kill and Born to Raise Hell every few months , then Schwarzenegger should easily be able to blast back to the top of the A - list by doing the same .
But even if Schwarzenegger does n't want to commit to a brand - new action film , he 'd still be a fool not to bring a beloved character out of retirement in return for an easy payday .
Everyone else is doing it .
Bruce Willis was well into his 50s when he made Die Hard 4 .
Sylvester Stallone was 60 when he made Rocky Balboa , and 62 when the last Rambo film was released .
And Harrison Ford was 66 years old by the time he finally decided to let Indiana Jones get inexplicably blasted across the sky in a fridge .
But which film should Arnie return to ?
Certainly not The Terminator â€ “ not only has that story moved on without him , but it 'd take an unimaginable genius to explain why Skynet attempted to defeat humanity by churning out an army of wheezing old man - booby cyborgs .
A Commando sequel could work , and James Cameron might relish the chance to ditch Pandora to make True Lies 2 .
But , of all the old Schwarzenegger movies , the public 's continuing fascination with reality TV has meant that The Running Man is most in need of a sequel .
Admittedly to accommodate his age , the film might need to be retitled The Walking Man or The Man
Who Occasionally Uses a Mobility Scooter
If He 's Been on His Feet For a While , but at least the subject matter would be timely enough .
But if Arnold Schwarzenegger really is serious about turning his back on action once and for all , what else is there ?
Comedy ?
Do n't forget that he 's always had a talent for poking fun at aspects of his personality , whether it was his hard - man image in Kindergarten Cop or his cruel inability to gestate human foetuses in Junior .
Perhaps there 's mileage in sending up his political forays , or even his place as a near - pensionable action star
â€ “ it could be like the monologue scene from JCVD , but played for laughs instead of harrowing despair .
So what do you think ?
What sort of films should Arnold Schwarzenegger make next ?
Your thoughts below , please ."
"A flurry of headlines this week hinting at the possibility of a return for Arnold Schwarzenegger in a fifth Terminator film , thanks largely to a slightly mischievous Deadline piece linking the former Governator 's announcement on Friday that he is officially back in the acting game to suggestions that studios may be interested in fronting the cash for a new film .
Of course , this is hardly surprising .
On the first day at film - blogger school , students are informed that any missed opportunities to link Arnie and future Terminator movies are likely to result in instant banishment at best , and a slow lowering into super - heated liquid metal , Ã
la the denouement of Terminator 2 : Judgment Day , at the very very worst .
Even so , I 'm not going to pour cold water on the idea because it will probably happen .
Sylvester Stallone , after all , returned for a sixth Rocky film at the age of 60 , while 55-year - old Bruce Willis still makes a pretty decent action hero , as seen in last year 's Red .
Schwarzenegger is now 63 , and after a pretty downbeat end to his career in politics just might be tempted to take the easy ego - building step of a return to his best - known role .
He surely can not need the money .
Financial concerns , however , will lie at the heart of any future Terminator outing .
The rights to the franchise are now owned by a hedge fund named Pacificor , which in turn nabbed them from another faceless monolith named Halcyon Asset Management in bankruptcy court last year .
The days of studios owning the rights to long - running series have apparently been replaced by a new era in which our best - known cultural icons are overseen by accountants .
Well , plus ca change , I guess .
Deadline reports that Universal may be interested in buying the rights to Terminator and asking Justin Lin , who has overseen the last two instalments of The Fast and the Furious , to take the reins .
This hardly bodes well for any hope the series might be set for a more cerebral direction .
James Cameron famously said , when discussing Terminator 's later instalments , that he had "" told the story "" with parts one and two , and it 's tempting to take the line that no one but its creator has the right to meddle with the series .
And yet Terminator , whether Cameron ( or the general viewing public ) likes it or not , has taken on a life of its own after Judgment Day , with two movies , a TV series and a slew of comics all arriving since that first sequel .
Christopher Nolan , I am brave enough to tell you , did not actually invent Batman , nor was his debut effort featuring the caped crusader the first to hit the big screen .
There 's no reason future Terminators can not be great , as the series ' furniture offers plenty of opportunity for comment on intriguing Asimov - esque subjects such as the nature of sentience and the machine soul , while leaving lots of room for the kind of sensual obliteration those of us who secretly love good action movies are rather fond of .
There might even be ways to include Schwarzenegger without destroying audiences ' ability to suspend their disbelief .
Who 's to say terminators do not age on the surface , even as they maintain their inner strength ?
( Some clever clogs will now no doubt correct me on this . )
After all , the best way to synthesise skin that appears human would be to use human biological architecture , which might result in an effect similar to ageing .
At the same time , if any more terminators get sent back in time during the series , easyJet is likely to start trying to get in on the action by offering a rival cut - price service .
If Arnie is going to be back , the starting points are a good story and a great film - maker to bring it to life .
Deadline reckons William Wisher , Cameron 's collaborator on Terminator 2 and an uncredited co - writer on the original , has a 24-page treatment for Terminator 5 in place , with a four - page outline of the sixth movie also in the bag .
Like the Terminator himself , we probably ca n't stop more films from coming .
Let 's hope they do n't turn out to have been sent by the enemy this time around ."
"George Clooney has declared his debauched personal history would prevent him from ever entering conventional politics .
In an interview with Newsweek he said : "" I did n't live my life in the right way for politics , you know
…
I fucked too many chicks and did too many drugs and that 's the truth . ""
Making it clear he would not be following in the footsteps of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Ronald Reagan , Clooney added if he were to stand for election his campaign slogan would be frank : "" I drank the bong water . ""
Assuming you 've never stood for office yourself , what is it that 's held you back ?
Would youthful indiscretions make it impossible for you to project the right image ?
Do you think that our political system is slowly adjusting to a new reality in which old notions of ' skeletons in the closet ' are less relevant ?
Our own PM has , after all admitted to smoking cannabis at Eton , although flatly denies he attended this acid house rave in 1988 ."
"David Cameron had his usual air of nonchalance as he strolled along the committee corridor of the House of Commons for this evening 's meeting of the Tory 1922 committee .
As he approached committee room 14 , where Tory MPs were preparing to raise concerns about Libya , the prime minister suddenly became animated .
He had a surprise for the MPs and peers gathered to listen to him answer their concerns about Libya .
Arnold Schwarzenegger would address the meeting .
Desmond Swayne , the prime minister 's jovial parliamentary private secretary , was despatched to ensure that the former governor of California would arrive safely and , most importantly , on time .
A tanned figure could be seen in the distance ambling along the corridor accompanied by a posse of bodyguards and aides dressed in black tie for Mikhail Gorbachev 's 80th birthday party at the Albert Hall .
Cameron , who first bonded with the former governor when they discussed the environment in his Cigar Tent in the grounds of his office in Sacramento , had a brief chat with the former Terminator .
The prime minister was then called into the committee room where he announced that he had a special guest .
Schwarzenegger did the business for the prime minister .
Tory MPs banged their desks with approval as he said that Cameron had shown leadership on Libya .
He left after just a few minutes â€ “ the former president of a superpower could not be kept waiting â€ “ and walked off with his bodyguards .
I caught up with Schwarzenegger who told me : I was invited by the prime minister to say a few words .
David is doing such a great job .
It was very good to pump them up , to tell them they 're doing a great job on Libya , a great job for Britain in making it live within its means and a great job with policies to protect the environment .
Downing Street , which knows that Tory MPs have deep concerns about Libya , was delighted .
A senior No 10 source said : Arnie is David 's secret weapon .
We ca n't arm the rebels but at least we have Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Cameron addressed the concerns of MPs after Schwarzenegger had left .
He told MPs : We are not dreamers .
We are Conservatives .
Tory MPs have two concerns about Libya : â€¢ The prospect that Britain could be prepared to arm rebel forces .
Edward Leigh highlighted these concerns when he told William Hague in the Commons : I urge extreme caution on [ the foreign secretary ] .
Would it not be a double win for al - Qaida , and would we not start losing support in the Arab world , if we were seen to impose a solution on Libya and at the same time to give arms to what could prove to be Islamist insurgents in the future ?
â€¢ That Britain is embarking on "" mission creep "" in which it goes beyond UN security council resolution 1973 , which authorised the military action , to remove the regime of Muammar Gaddafi .
These concerns were highlighted in the commons last week by Andrew Tyrie , the chairman of the commons Treasury select committee .
All sides seemed excited by the appearance of Schwarzenegger .
Tories were too polite to ask whether it was wise of the prime minister to pose at a time of war with the man who utters the famous words in The Terminator â€ “ ' The Uzi nine millimeter ' â€ “ as he orders a series of weapons from a gun shop .
When the owner says he ca n't buy so many weapons all at once Schwarzenegger takes what might be described as the Gaddafi approach and shoots him dead .
Tories probably forgot that detail when Schwarzenegger uttered his most famous line from the film as he departed with the words : I 'll be back ."
"David Cameron would like the world to believe he is a measured war leader who follows the letter of the law and avoids the gung - ho language of Margaret Thatcher .
So it came as a surprise to Conservative MPs , many of whom have severe doubts about the military action in Libya , when the prime minister turned up with a "" secret weapon "" at last night 's meeting of the backbench 1922 committee .
With a great flourish , Arnold Schwarzenegger marched into committee room 14 of the House of Commons , which overlooks the Thames , to endorse the prime minister 's leadership over Libya .
Schwarzenegger is an unlikely ally for a prime minister who wants to portray himself as a cautious war leader .
In The Terminator Schwarzenegger walked into a gun store to order a weapon with the words : "" The Uzi nine - millimetre . ""
At the end of his brief appearance before last night 's meeting Schwarzenegger signed off with his most memorable line from the film .
"" I 'll be back , "" he said , as he was escorted out of the meeting with bodyguards dressed in black tie as they headed to the Royal Albert Hall for Mikhail Gorbachev 's 80th birthday party .
The former Californian governor told the Guardian that he wanted to support Cameron on Libya .
"" I was invited by the prime minister to say a few words , "" he said .
"" David is doing such a great job .
It was very good to pump them up , to tell them they 're doing a great job on Libya , a great job for Britain in making it live within its means and a great job with policies to protect the environment . ""
Schwarzenegger was impressed by his surroundings .
"" It was such a historic room , they have been holding these meetings since 1922 , "" Schwarzenegger said of committee room 14 where he addressed the 1922 committee under a giant painting of Gladstone 's 1868 cabinet by Lowes Cato Dickinson .
Within two years of the painting British foreign policy was dominated by the Franco - Prussian war .
But on that occasion Britain remained neutral .
Downing Street was delighted by Schwarzenegger 's appearance , which came amid mounting concerns among Tory MPs that the government may be prepared to arm rebels in Libya .
Cameron , who usually addresses the 1922 committee in December and July , was invited to attend the meeting to address the concerns of backbenchers .
One senior No 10 source said : "" Arnie is David 's secret weapon .
We ca n't arm the rebels but at least we have Arnold Schwarzenegger .
"" The former governor hailed Cameron as a centreground leader as he quoted Eisenhower : "" I despise people who go to the gutter on either the right or the left and hurl rocks at those in the centre . """
"Champion body builder , movie star , politician : Arnold Schwarzenegger is an expert when it comes to reinventing himself , and his latest persona is one a few people might just have seen coming .
The Austrian - born actor is to appear as a superhero named the Governator in a new comic book and TV cartoon developed by veteran writer Stan Lee .
The new show , which debuts on US television next year , is inspired by the name Schwarzenegger was given by journalists after he became governor of California in 2003 .
The moniker is a play on The Terminator , one of the actor 's best - known roles .
"" When I ran for governor back in 2003 and I started hearing people talking about the governator , I thought the word was so cool , "" Schwarzenegger , 63 , told Entertainment Weekly .
"" The word governator combined two worlds : the world of politics and the movie world .
And [ this cartoon ] brings everything together .
It combines the governor , The Terminator , the bodybuilding world , True Lies . ""
Lee said the comic book and TV show would combine elements from Schwarzenegger 's real life with well - worn superhero tropes such as crime fighting and a tight - fitting , bright - coloured costume . ""
The Governator is going to be a great superhero , but he 'll also be Arnold Schwarzenegger , "" he said .
"" We 're using all the personal elements of Arnold 's life .
We 're using his wife [ Maria Shriver ] .
We 're using his kids .
We 're using the fact that he used to be governor .
Only after he leaves the governor 's office , Arnold decides to become a crime fighter and builds a secret high - tech crime - fighting center under his house in Brentwood . ""
The Governator will have a series of super - suits , each of which allows him to perform a different feat , as well as a fleet of super - vehicles to be used as part of his crime - fighting efforts .
In a nod to Stieg Larsson 's Millennium trilogy of novels , his sidekick is a young hacker named Zeke Muckerberg .
"" I love the idea of a control centre below my house with a path so that boats and submarines can go right into the ocean , "" said Schwarzenegger .
"" In the cartoon , my house is much closer to the beach than where we live , but , you know , it 's a cartoon . ""
Hollywood blogs have speculated in the months since Schwarzenegger 's tenure as governor ended that the actor might be too old to return to the action movie fray , but the cartoon character appears to have no such issues with aging flesh : in contrast to its source , the Governator does n't appear to be a day over 40 ."
"Just how will Arnold Schwarzenegger appear back on the big screen ?
As an SS officer who saves a campful of prisoners of war ?
As a structural security expert locked in a prison of his own design ?
Or as a US border - town sheriff battling a Mexican cartel boss ?
According to US reports , the final option is starting to look the most likely .
Speculation has been rife about the Austrian - born actor 's return to Hollywood ever since he finished his eight - year run as governor of California in January and announced on Twitter that he was moving back into movies .
Now a number of sites have reported that The Last Stand , Korean director Kim Ji - woon 's English language directorial debut , will most likely be the project that marks his return .
Liam Neeson was previously attached to the film but departed a few months back , leaving the door open for Schwarzenegger .
Ji - woon has described The Last Stand as "" kind of a combination of Die Hard and High Noon "" , adding that it 's an "" optimistic film ... where someone puts their life on the line to protect something that 's very important "" .
Competing for the chance to be Arnie 's first live - action movie since 2003 ( discounting an uncredited cameo in The Expendables ) is The Tomb , from director Anton Fuqua .
Variety ( paywall ) describes it as a thriller about a structural security expert who 's framed for a crime and put in a high - security prison he designed himself .
Both the above projects seem to have moved ahead of With Wings as Eagles , possibly the most intriguing film of the three , which Schwarzenegger hinted he might take on in January .
"" I 'm reading three scripts , "" he said then .
"" One topic / script , which I considered a long time ago before governor , is delighting me particularly .
I would play an older [ German ] soldier , who gets the order at the end of the war to kill a bunch of kids .
But he does n't do it and gets them to safety at the risk of his life .
It has all kinds of adventure .
The script is based on a true story .
"" Away from the world of live action , Schwarzenegger cartoon series The Governator , which draws him as a costumed crime - fighter with an array of vehicles and gadgets to help him take down the bad guys , may also get a big - screen 3D transfer .
"" You will see more action in this series than you have ever seen before , but combined with comedy , "" the actor said in Cannes earlier this week .
"" This will not be a violent show .
If you look at my movies , a lot of heads come off !
That is not what this is . ""
The Governator is expected to secure deals worldwide , including an arrangement for the BBC to show it in Britain .
Schwarzenegger is without doubt an incomparable screen presence , and people forget just how smart he was when developing some of his better projects â€ “ notably the 1990 Paul Verhoeven sci - fi romp Total Recall â€ “ as projects for himself to star in .
But I wonder whether we 'll all be champing at the bit for more onscreen Arnie once a few of these films and projects have arrived in cinemas .
Could the current fascination for all things Schwarzenegger be a simple case of absence making the heart grow fonder ?
Or will you be first in line for pretty much anything the Austrian oak decides to get involved in ?"
"Age : 63 .

Conan the Sexagenarian .
The Governator and ex - Terminator ?
Yes , that Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Although as of January this year he 's now an ex - Governator and , as of reports this week , he may soon be reawakened as a Terminator .
Brilliant !
I knew he was n't lying when he said he 'd be back .
Well , no , because he came back almost immediately .
In the same film .
Yeah ,
and then he drove a car right through the door of the police station !
He did indeed .
He also came back in both the second and third films .
Yeah ,
but in the second one he was the good guy !
Genius !
If that 's your definition of genius you 'll be positively ecstatic to hear that , according to US film industry website Deadline , a rights package for a fifth Terminator film is being shopped around Hollywood as we speak .
I 'll be glad to hear it as soon as I understand what it means .
A rights package ?
The rights to the Terminator franchise have changed hands quite a bit since James Cameron 's 1984 original .
At present they 're with a firm named Pacificor , "" a registered investment adviser that manages several hedge funds focused on high - yield debt "" .
They do n't sound like the kind of people who would drive a car into a police station .
They will if there 's money to be made by doing it , which , with Arnie attached to reprise the role he was built by computers and steroids to play , there almost certainly will be .
Although , as Schwarzenegger told website Krone earlier this year , "" In the future I have to adapt my roles to my age . . .
extreme fighting or shooting is not possible any more . ""
So at the moment there 's no title , no script and no story ?
Correct .
There 's just a handful of contracts and a man in his 60s determined to be the world 's gentlest action hero .
Do say : "" Are you Sarah Connor ? ""
Do n't say : "" Because if you are there 's an ageing politician who 's looking for you . """
"He said he 'd be back , and Arnold Schwarzenegger was n't bluffing .
After eight years away from Hollywood , the former California governor is to return to the role of The Terminator in a new film currently being shopped around Hollywood studios , according to Deadline .
Shrugging off suggestions that he may be a little old for an action hero , the 63-year - old actor is heading up a rights package which will bring the series , kicked off by James Cameron with 1984 's The Terminator , back to cinemas .
Depending on which studio wins the bidding war to make the new film , Justin Lin , currently the toast of Hollywood after returning the Fast and Furious franchise to box office credibility , could be set to direct .
Deadline reports that Universal , Sony , Lionsgate and CBS Films are all considering their options .
The return of Schwarzenegger to his most iconic role makes a fifth Terminator film a tantalising prospect for the studio bean counters , even if the series has not been at its best since Cameron 's last outing , 1991 's Terminator 2 : Judgment Day .
The first non - Schwarzenegger film , 2009 's Terminator Salvation , was the worst - reviewed so far , although it still made $ 370 m ( Â£225 m ) globally ( albeit on an enormous $ 200 m budget ) .
The rights to Terminator are currently owned by a hedge fund , Pacificor , which bought them in bankruptcy proceedings for another hedge fund , Halcyon , which made Terminator Salvation .
There is a little hope on the horizon for fans clamouring for the unlikely prospect of another Cameron - filmed Terminator film , however .
The Canadian film - maker has long signalled his disinterest in the series , but Deadline nevertheless reports that rights to the franchise are currently set to revert to him in 2018 .
Schwarzenegger is also reportedly circulating another pair of projects , either of which might arrive on screen prior to a fifth Terminator film .
The first is The Last Stand , in which he would play a bordertown sheriff who must take on the leader of a Mexican cartel , while the second is Antoine Fuqua 's The Tomb , a thriller about a structural security expert who 's framed for a crime and put in a high - security prison he designed himself ."
"He 's 63 , and without a starring vehicle in cinemas for eight years , so you might expect Hollywood to bide its time before betting top dollar on a return to box - office glory for Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Not according to industry website Deadline , which reports that the former California governor is to enjoy a spectacular $ 10m - plus ( Â£6 m ) payday for the latest in a series of new projects , the road movie Cry Macho .
Schwarzenegger 's deal includes a 25 % share of the first dollar gross for the project , an agreement that could see his wage rocketing if the film performs well at the box office .
In his heyday , the Austrian - born former bodybuilder could demand a $ 25 m salary , but the Cry Macho deal is remarkable for an actor who has been off screen for so long , and whose star was waning even before he quit Hollywood for a career in politics .
Cry Macho is based on the novel by N Richard Nash , and The Lincoln Lawyer 's Brad Furman is tipped to direct .
Schwarzenegger would play the lead , a down - on - his - luck horse breeder railroaded into travelling to Mexico to kidnap his boss 's young son from the child 's mother .
Producer Al Ruddy , who helped bring Oscar winners Million Dollar Baby and The Godfather to the big screen , hopes to shoot this summer after raising funds at the Cannes film festival .
The Vulture blog reports that Schwarzenegger was attached to the project more than a decade ago , before politics got in the way .
Clint Eastwood was later interested in playing the lead .
As well as Cry Macho , Schwarzenegger is considering a return to the Terminator series that helped make his name ( along with three other projects ) .
It was reported in April that he is attached to a "" rights package "" being offered to Hollywood studios for a fifth film in the man against machines saga .
More recent reports have hinted that the project could see a return for Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn , who starred alongside Schwarzenegger in 1984 's The Terminator .
Fast and Furious director Justin Lin is tipped to direct ."
"Alongside The Terminator and Handsome Stranger from Cactus Jack , Conan the Barbarian is routinely named as one of Arnold Schwarzenegger 's most iconic roles .
However , a young pretender to the throne has emerged in the form of Jason Momoa , the star of this summer 's Conan the Barbarian remake .
Has Momoa 's film got the chops to knock Schwarzenegger off his perch , or will Arnie always be the definitive barbarian ?
A trailer for the new version has just been released , so there 's only one thing for it – a head - to - head Conan trailer - off ...

"One of the most powerful , and unlikely , political pairings in America has fractured with the news that Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver have separated only weeks after he ended his term as governor of California .
The Los Angeles Times , which first reported the split , said Shriver had moved out of the couple 's Brentwood mansion after they had led almost entirely separate lives for several weeks .
Since he stood down as governor , the former bodybuilder and actor has been trying to rekindle his career in entertainment , while Shriver has been pursuing her charity activities .
Their 25-year marriage brought together a couple that at face value was strikingly diverse .
Schwarzenegger became a household name through a combination of chutzpah , charm and sheer muscle bulk that propelled him into stardom with the Terminator film trilogy .
Shriver was always a more cerebral personality , using her innate strength as a member of the Kennedy dynasty – her mother
Eunice Kennedy Shriver was the sister of John F Kennedy and her father Sargent Shriver made a failed bid for the vice presidency in 1972 – to build a more humble career as a TV news anchor .
The political differences between them were underlined in 2008 when Schwarzenegger , a soft Republican , backed John McCain , while Shriver , true to her family roots , came out strongly in favour of Barack Obama .
But the fusion of Hollywood with the Kennedys was a potent cocktail , one that proved useful when Schwarzenegger ran for governor in 2003 .
Without Shriver 's backing , he might never have served two terms in the post , which is ironic as she had serious qualms about him taking up the post .
A week before the election , in which he stood against the sitting Democratic governor , Gray Davis , Schwarzenegger became embroiled in a sex scandal .
The Los Angeles Times reported that six women had come forward to accuse him of sexual harassment , alleging that he had fondled their breasts or buttocks and made lewd comments .
On the day he was forced to apologise to "" those people that I have offended "" , his wife appeared on stage next to him .
Her intervention was seen as crucial in stabilising his campaign in its final days and securing his victory .
The factors behind their current separation are not known .
All the couple would say in a statement was that "" after a great deal of thought , reflection , discussion and prayer we came to this decision together "" .
They said that they were remaining focused on parenting their four children .
Shriver alluded to difficulties in her life a few weeks ago , when she posted a video on YouTube in which she invited people to advise her on her future .
"" I 'm in transition .
It 's so stressful to not know what you are doing next .
How did you find your transition , personal , professional , emotional , spiritual , financial ?
How did you get through it ?
"" she asked .
She also tweeted this week that looking at the iconic photograph of Obama in the Situation Room of the White House during the raid on Osama bin Laden , in which the president looks diminutive and scared , "" got me thinking : is the model of masculinity changing in America ?
"" It is hard not to interpret that as some reflection on her husband , a former Mr Universe .
Whatever happens to their marriage – there is no talk of divorce as yet – the pair are likely to continue on divergent paths .
Schwarzenegger has plans for a new Terminator film and is making a comic book series and TV show of the character .
Shriver , meanwhile , is concentrating on her annual conference to forward women 's power as an agent of global change ."
"Another day , another politician outed as an adulterer .
This time , the story will likely not fade from the headlines at the usual rate .
This time , the adulterer is Arnold Schwarzenegger , who doubles both as the former governor of California and a major movie star .
To make the situation still more lurid , he cheated with a servant , had a child with her , and covered it up â€ “ apparently , even from his wife â€ “ for a decade .
Oh , did I mention that he 's married to a member of the Kennedy clan , Maria Shriver ?
And that she 's a prominent feminist activist ?
And that she used her credibility as a liberal feminist Democrat to cover for him when he admitted to decades of sexual harassment during the 2003 campaign , when he was also exposed for participating in the 70s in what , by his description , sounds suspiciously like a gang rape ?
And that while his wife was out there working on behalf of women , Schwarzenegger was taking the time to rail against the evils of single motherhood ?
You know , just to make sure that no future would - be defenders of his bad behaviour could claim , "" At least he 's not a hypocrite .
"" If you presented it as a novel or a film script , you 'd get it bounced back with a note that said , "" Try to make it believable . ""
But despite the craziness of this particular situation , the basic story of the adulterous politician has become commonplace .
Is there any situation more confounding in politics than the exposure of adultery in the ranks of ambitious politicians ?
Once or twice , you expect a man ( and they are mostly men ) to screw up and get caught , but the endless parade of cheaters and cads defies common sense .
Why , your average voting citizen asks , would someone who has given his entire life over to striving for power risk everything for some fleeting sexual experience ?
Why , especially , do those men who fancy themselves not just political but moral leaders so readily make exceptions for their own peccadilloes ?
Most of us will never know , because most of us are n't wealthy members of an elite class who have been pampered into forgetting that you ca n't have whatever you want whenever you want it .
For most of us , cleaning our own houses , cooking our own food and having to fly coach provides a daily dose of humility â€ “ which can be a helpful thing to keep in mind when sexual temptations present themselves .
To make it even worse , even the more liberal - minded male politicians not only have this kind of class pampering , but they also tend to live in a world where women are easy to take for granted .
For many a male politician , women appear to exist for the purpose of making your life more pleasant and your ambitions easier to realise .
It 's not just that women are more likely to fetch your food , fluff your pillows and organise your life while you sit around talking politics and strategy in male - dominated groups of strategists and advisers .
It 's also that your wife has been demoted from a partner to your top cheerleader , expected to compromise her principles and ambitions so you can attain power .
Maria Shriver is a perfect example of the way that the role of the political wife demeans and objectifies women .
During the 2003 gubernatorial race in California , when Schwarzenegger was buried under a stream of allegations of sexual harassment , Shriver used her substantial reputation as a powerful , feminist woman as a shield against allegations levelled at her sleazy husband .
When a man like Schwarzenegger lives in a world where women are so subservient to him that they throw their reputations away for his political ambitions , it 's no surprise that he ca n't muster the basic respect for women required not to horndog the servants behind his wife 's back .
To be clear , there are two camps of egotistical politicians who cheat so stupidly , and the two should not be conflated : those who value consent and those who treat women like sex toys they can grab at , with little regard for what the women in question feel on the subject .
Men like Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich are cheating cads , but they , as far as we all know , draw the line at violence against women .
Unfortunately , when you build up a culture of overwhelming male entitlement such as politicians live in , you ca n't expect all of them to understand that , while cheating and lying is bad , harassing and assaulting is exponentially worse .
This is something to keep in mind when contemplating the Schwarzenegger situation , and his long and admitted history of harassing women that predates these revelations .
But it 's also something to keep in mind with regard to the charges of rape , sexual assault and unlawful imprisonment against the IMF head Dominique Strauss - Kahn .
Whatever the outcome of his case , there is no excuse for those who fail to distinguish between actual assault and caddish but consensual behaviour .
Conflating the two only amplifies a culture of entitlement for those living the low - responsibility elite lifestyle , blurring the line between treating women poorly and treating women criminally ."
"Cry Macho is the working title of the first film Arnold Schwarzenegger has agreed to make , for the sum of $ 12 m ( Â£7.4 m ) , since resigning as governor of California earlier this year .
It is also a highly apt description of his current state of wellbeing .
The Austrian - born actor - turned politician has been forced to admit that his womanising , once an integral and shamelessly celebrated part of his public image as a bodybuilder , has returned to haunt him .
He told the Los Angeles Times that he fathered a child more than 10 years ago by a member of his domestic staff .
The revelation , which he said he had confessed to his wife , Maria Shriver , after he stepped down as governor , now makes sense of their separation after 25 years of marriage .
The couple announced the split on 9 May , without giving any explanation .
It now transpires that for at least a decade , unbeknown to his wife , Schwarzenegger was paying maintenance to his child 's mother , who continued to work in their LA mansion until a few weeks ago .
The child has not been named , nor has the staff member , though she is known to have worked for the Schwarzenegger - Shriver family for 20 years .
"" I understand and deserve the feelings of anger and disappointment among my friends and family , "" Schwarzenegger said .
"" There are no excuses , and I take full responsibility for the hurt I have caused .
I have apologised to Maria , my children and my family .
I am truly sorry . ""
Shriver released her own statement .
"" This is a painful and heartbreaking time , "" she said .
"" As a mother , my concern is for the children .
I ask for compassion , respect and privacy as my children and I try to rebuild our lives and heal .
"" The couple 's son , Patrick Schwarzenegger , 17 , responded on Twitter : "" Some days you feel like shit , some days you want to quit and just be normal for a bit , yet i love my family till death do us apart [ sic ] . ""
The latest disclosures merely confirm one of Schwarzenegger 's most striking qualities : that in real life he has managed to lead an existence every bit as improbable as those of the characters he has played .
In the 1977 bodybuilding documentary Pumping Iron , he gave an insight into his megalomaniacal tendencies .
"" When I was 10 years old , I always dreamed of coming to America and being the greatest and being different from everybody else , "" he said .
"" I was always dreaming about very powerful people : dictators and things like that .
I was always impressed by people who could be remembered for hundreds of years â€ “ or Jesus , for thousands of years .
"" It sounded like a pipe dream , but to no small extent he made it happen .
He became so popular in America that at one point a movement was started calling for constitutional change to allow this foreign - born citizen to stand for president . ""
Never underestimate Arnold , "" said Ian Halperin , Schwarzenegger 's unauthorised biographer .
"" He 's the only person I have come across who has succeeded at the highest level in three different fields : bodybuilding , acting and politics . ""
His marriage to Shriver formed a seamless part of that improbable personal story : the uncouth Austrian forging an alliance with the most exalted family in modern American history .
The niece of John F Kennedy and daughter of the vice - presidential candidate Sargent Shriver , she was as dyed - in - the - wool liberal as Schwarzenegger was conservative .
Sex was always an issue , and came close to derailing the Schwarzenegger juggernaut .
In 2003 , when he ran for governor of California , a long line of women came forward to accuse him of having groped them .
Shriver had to stand by his side â€ “ literally
â€ “ to help him weather the scandal and win the election .
According to Halperin , Shriver was well aware of Schwarzenegger 's gargantuan sexual appetite , and insisted before they married that he swore to be faithful to her .
It is now clear that he failed to keep his word . ""
I feel immensely sorry for her , "" said Laurence Leamer , a biographer of both Schwarzenegger and the Kennedys .
"" She has lived an Oprah - like , pristine life , and now she has to deal with this . ""
The past 24 hours must feel to Schwarzenegger reminiscent of the part he played in his most famous movie , The Terminator .
In it , his bionic character is , in chronological order , shot and firebombed , blown up , mangled in a high - speed motorbike crash , run over by a lorry , incinerated in a fireball , torn in half and squeezed to a pulp in a hydraulic press .
But if that is how it currently feels to be Arnie , then he should draw comfort from the fact that the Terminator always rises again .
This time , however , after his wife 's probably permanent departure from their home , he looks certain to be rising alone ."
"I bet you miss the good old days , Arnold Schwarzenegger ( @Schwarzenegger ) , when you were the self - styled governator of California , family by your side , bouncing between parties with Gorbachev ( "" Great party .
Even at 80 , Mikhail Gorbachev is still rocking "" ) and bike rides with Boris ( "" Loved riding Boris Bikes in London with the man himself , Mayor Boris Johnson . "" )
Good times .
Sadly your wife finding out you have a 10-year - old son with the housekeeper was bound to dampen the mood .
Dealing with a divorce on Twitter is a very modern problem and you are going to need a few pointers .
So , listen up , Sperminator .
Stay classy You 've kept very quiet since the whole secret son thing blew up .
Your family , however , have been more forthcoming , with wife Maria Shriver (
@maria shriver ) already landing the first blow in the battle for the hearts of the twitterati , tweeting "" Thank you for all the kindness , support and compassion .
I am humbled by the love .
Thank you . ""
Your son Patrick ( @PSchwarzenegger ) changing his Twitter profile name to Patrick Shriver has got to sting a bit too .
Rule of thumb :
when dealing with a Twitter divorce , watch what Peter Andre ( @mrpeter andre ) and Katie Price ( @miss katieprice ) do and do the exact opposite .
No online spats over the children and
no rubbish ITV2 ""
I can make it on my own "" TV series .
Stay classy , Arnie .
Albeit belatedly .
Beware of Sinitta
There are few things that will promote solidarity among The Sisterhood more than mutual dislike of a hound dog .
Eighties popstar Sinitta ( @sinittaofficial ) , in particular , is baying for your blood .
Last week she could n't even concentrate on American Idol , tweeting in the middle ,
"" Thank God Oprah is by Maria 's side !
Sisters .
On side . . .
"" I do n't even think being "" so macho "" is going to get you out of this .
Watch your back .
Hook up with old friends
Remember when you did the film Twins with Danny DeVito ( @DannyDeVito ) and it was so funny because he was so small and fat and you were so tall and muscular
but you were playing TWINS ?
Oh , we laughed .
Why not in touch with Danny and bring back funnies ?
You 're going to need a distraction .
Hasta la vista , baby , @scouserachel"
"Arnold Schwarzenegger has put his Hollywood comeback on hold in an effort to repair his shattered personal life after revelations he fathered a child with a member of his domestic staff more than 10 years ago .
The former California governor had been tipped to return to the big screen in Cry Macho , a road movie about a down - on - his - luck horse breeder railroaded into travelling to Mexico to kidnap his boss 's young son from the child 's mother .
The film is now on hold , along with his TV cartoon The Governator , featuring a Schwarzenegger - style superhero , and a number of other planned projects .
The actor - turned - politician revealed earlier this week that he had fathered the child , whose mother worked for his family for more than a decade .
The revelation , which he confirmed to the Los Angeles Times in a remorseful statement , casts new light on the breakup of his 25-year marriage with Maria Shriver , announced by the couple last week . ""
At the request of Arnold Schwarzenegger , we asked Creative Artists Agency to inform all his motion picture projects currently under way or being negotiated to stop planning until further notice , "" Schwarzenegger 's lawyer said in a statement . ""
Gov Schwarzenegger is focusing on personal matters and is not willing to commit to any production schedules or timelines .
This includes Cry Macho , the Terminator franchise and other projects under consideration .
We will resume discussions when Gov Schwarzenegger decides .
"" As indicated in the statement , Schwarzenegger was also heading up a rights package for a fifth Terminator film .
It was being shopped around studios earlier this year , with several Hollywood heavyweights reportedly interested in making a film with the actor reinstalled in his best - known role .
Other projects in the development stages included action movie The Last Stand , Korean director Kim Ji - woon 's English language directorial debut .
Schwarzenegger would have starred as a smalltown sheriff tasked with capturing an escaped cartel leader planning to escape over the Mexican border ."
"It 's been a good week for infidelity .
We 've discovered that Arnold Schwarzenegger fathered a love child with one of his employees 10 years ago .
We 've had Chris Huhne 's betrayed wife relishing her revenge against her adulterous husband with the accusation that he asked her to take the penalty points for a speeding offence .
We 've had the lid on superinjunctions cracked open still further with the revelation by Lord Stoneham in the House of Lords that Fred Goodwin used such a gagging order to prevent publicity of his extramarital affair at the height of the RBS scandal .
And then of course we have had Dominique Strauss - Kahn charged with sexual assault of a maid in a New York hotel .
The rich and powerful may find it easier to afford and conceal their extramarital dalliances but infidelity does not just happen to "" bad "" people – to liars , cheats and selfish narcissists .
It lies in the shadows of every relationship and is far more common than we like to believe .
We do not have accurate statistics because this is still such a taboo issue but the research I found for a book on the subject suggested that between 20 % and 50 % of adults have had affairs .
All we really know is that infidelity is still the leading cause of separation and divorce and that it is a major trigger for domestic violence .
We are all vulnerable to an affair at some point in the life of a long relationship .
It 's an easy way to get our needs met without having to fight for them .
Infidelity can shatter the membranes of coupledom – loyalty , trust and privacy .
It is a guided missile designed to detonate right at the heart of a relationship so that it will force change .
We accept that it takes two to make a relationship , but when it comes to infidelity there are only villains and victims .
The person who strayed shoulders all of the blame .
They should have kept their knickers on .
What 's interesting and overlooked is why they did n't .
Perhaps it was because they were not brave enough to leave the stability of their relationship without someone else to run to .
Perhaps it was not a means to leave but a way for them to stay .
Perhaps it was a form of revenge for other "" crimes "" in the relationship , such as withdrawing or withholding sex , for refusing to listen or engage with their partner 's life or to take their resentments seriously .
Perhaps it was a form of depression management , a desperate attempt to inject a sense of edge , danger and the drama of secrecy into the deadness of monotony .
Perhaps it was an act of rebellion against the confines of marriage .
Many of us resort to sex as a form of empowerment when we feel disempowered in other areas of our lives .
We have affairs not necessarily because we are looking for another person , but because we are looking for another version of ourselves , to escape the responsibilities of parenthood , the encroaching mortality of mid life or the vacuum left behind in family life once the children have left home .
Sex and the lure of seduction with a new body may seem to be the prime motive for any infidelity but it is often the least important aspect .
The chances of a sexual betrayal threatening a relationship are greater than ever before .
Infidelity is big business with countless discreet dating sites , social networking and mobile technology offering people numerous opportunities just to connect with strangers .
The sexes mingle openly at work , often spending more time there than they do with their partners at home .
The modern truism that sexual fulfilment and gratification is essential for health and wellbeing gives plenty of those the excuse to bail out if passion dwindles .
Instead of understanding why people stray sexually we use threats – one strike
and you 're out – or express our need for denial openly
– if you ever have an affair I do n't want to know .
We swear fidelity without having a conversation as to what that might mean for us – is flirting at a party , going out with a friend from the opposite sex or masturbating alone acceptable ?
If we ca n't talk openly about sexual matters at the beginning of a relationship , how do we expect to be able to cope when things get tough ?
We have become far more tolerant of homosexuality , divorce or pre - marital sex , yet social disapproval of infidelity has remained constant .
Many relationships survive affairs , some even go on to build a stronger and happier life together because of what they have learned about themselves and each other through such a painful ordeal .
The only way we stand a chance of building a committed relationship through life is by accepting that the threat of sexual betrayal is always there .
Not by pointing our fingers at those in the public eye caught inflagrante ."
"Have relations between men and women reached a new low ?
Powerful men from Sir Fred Goodwin to Arnold Schwarzenegger – along with nameless footballers and actors still hanging on to their superinjunctions – are revealed to have risked marriage and career over an affair .
Kenneth Clarke was forced to confirm last week that he does think all rape is serious .
According to one of the world 's bestselling psychologists , the revelations of misconduct and ill - considered remarks indicate a disturbing deepening of the divide between the sexes .
Since its publication nearly two decades ago , Dr John Gray has sold 50 million copies of Men Are from Mars , Women Are from Venus , to people desperate to understand what was going wrong in their relationships and bedrooms and why .
The book 's title has become a virtual shorthand for describing a presumed gulf between the sexes .
Gray 's controversial view was that behavioural differences were hard - wired into our gender - specific brains .
Speaking to the Observer in the wake of the recent sequence of sex - related scandals , Gray claimed that the gulfs in understanding that divide men from women are being exacerbated by hormones , which are working against people achieving monogamy in a stressful world . ""
Why are the sexes not getting along ?
It 's just that people have new needs
and they do n't know what to do about them ; they want passion but do n't know how to sustain it , "" he said .
His theory is that powerful men have higher than average levels of testosterone , which they seek to "" top up "" when their reserves become depleted .
One way they do that is to have an affair .
According to Gray , long - term relationships generate oxytocin , dubbed the "" love hormone "" , which encourages bonding between couples and helps to lower female stress levels .
But that benefit comes at a price for alpha male partners . ""
With oxytocin and alpha men , as the women 's stress level goes down when she gets oxytocin from a loving monogamous relationship , the man 's testosterone level is going down , so he 's getting more stressed and more inclined to seek out risky behaviour to push it back up again .
The concept is that intimacy can lower a man 's sexual drive . ""
He believes that is why men like Schwarzenegger are driven to risky affairs , and why women will no longer tolerate it . ""
Arnie loves his wife deeply , but he 's breached trust and abused his power and men ca n't get away with that any more , "" said Gray , whose latest book is out in the US is called Venus on Fire , Mars on Ice . ""
The fact that Kissinger was once voted the sexiest man in America suggests women have always have been attracted to alpha males .
Power and influence has an effect on men that says , ' I 'm entitled ' .
They 've a greater sense of entitlement to breaking the rules , to corruption , but also they typically have higher levels of testosterone , which they depend on to function .
"" Power and influence has long excused men behaving badly .
But what I see is a trend which started in the US even before Bill Clinton , when Gary Hart was running for president in 1988 and they had pictures of him with a woman in a bathing suit who was not his wife , and he was kicked out .
Suddenly it was n't OK .
Values became more important .
That was a turning point , a shift in the consciousness of the public , a greater awareness of suppression of women 's rights .
And as more women were in the workplace , in newsrooms and in courtrooms they were outraged , unlike the way male reporters colluded to suppress the sexual proclivities of JFK . ""
In days gone by women would have turned a blind eye , says Gray .
"" When I was raised , in the fifties , for my mother a good husband was someone who had a job , he did n't drink or smoke too much , he did n't yell or shout .
She said that for that generation a provider was what women wanted .
She had a lifestyle which kept her oxytocin levels up so she was happy .
She says the lack of romance was n't a big deal and if she suspected he might have ' other responsibilities ' somewhere else it did n't bother her .
In the eighties women wanted romance .
In the nineties women wanted communication .
Now noughties women want romance , then communication , then they are saying , ' I get nothing in the way of domestic help . '
That 's all mixed up .
So while women are obsessing with help with the housework and men are obsessing with casual sex , their relationships are being riven apart . ""
In America the startling statistic is that the average length of a relationship is five years .
That 's three years of passion and two years of gathering the evidence they need to leave .
"" Gray 's theories are contested by scientists who insist society , not nature , shapes gender politics .
The associate professor of neuroscience at the Chicago Medical School , Lise Eliot , said : "" Yes , boys and girls , men and women , are different but most of those differences are far smaller than the Men Are from Mars stereotypes suggest . ""
Gray insists he is not saying men are enslaved by their hormones and that divides can and should be bridged . ""
Men are basically wired up to be polygamous but they are also wired up to be violent .
We learn to sublimate these urges and to civilise the experience .
If I see an attractive women , I use my brain to remember my wife , and my arousal goes back to my wife – you train yourself with that , you control your urges .
That 's why I 've been married for 26 years . """
"Like Arnold Schwarzenegger 's 13-year - old son by his former housekeeper , I 'm a "" love child "" â€ “ the spawn of a liaison between my single mum and her married lover , my dad .
I would n't be alive today if my father had not betrayed his legal wife and their two children .
My mom resisted pressure , from my dad and even members of her own family , to abort me â€ “
she really wanted me .
So , I have a personal interest in the "" Arnold scandal "" , his infidelity to his wife Maria Shriver .
And , necessarily , I 've also a complicated , emotional attitude to abortion .
I wonder if Arnold 's housekeeper 's son , being raised by his single mother , is feeling as I did growing up â€ “ which is sad that I do n't have a "" real "" dad , but at least , I 'm not an orphan or dead .
There are vast differences , of course .
My folks were Depression - poor , and Arnold â€ “ and Maria â€ “ are filthy rich .
They are both celebrities with millions in cash at their disposal .
Schwarzenegger can afford to make a deal with the boy 's mother â€ “ and probably has , as some sources report .
Super .
My only real grudge against my own hardly - ever - there dad is that : a ) he was n't around much ; and b ) he 'd rather unionise workers than make money .
( He was a labour organiser . )
So , it was ma and me against the world on our own â€ “ and , looking back , I would n't have it any other way .
I 'm sorry only about one other thing , which is that my half - brother and half - sister , dad 's "" legitimate "" children , both fine people , had a problem with me when we finally discovered each other after our parents died .
( It took my dad several years of agonising indecision to tell them once I popped up in his life . )
They had always seen themselves as Leo Sigal 's proper children , and why not ?
So , it came as a shock when he finally ' fessed up , late in the game , as Arnold just did with Maria , years on .
From day one , my mother Jennie always knew she had taken her man away from his wife and kids .
She coped with the knowledge as only a "" fallen woman "" could in those days .
Dad 's wife , the mother of his kids , I 'm told , lived for years in denial â€ “ until he finally returned to the family hearth , when God knows what revenge she took on him .
( Arnold may be lucky Maria has moved out ; she can look pretty fearsome . )
The worst part of it all was that I had to grow up not knowing any of this , at least consciously , until I was in my thirties .
Secrecy , not wanton sex , kills .
A kid usually knows what he does n't know â€ “ and that can be the dark cloud he 's always fighting , without knowing who , what and where it is .
In the end , it took a while but my grownup half - sister wholeheartedly and warmly embraced me and took me into her own family â€ “ for me , what Jews call a "" nachas "" , a joy .
My brother took longer , painfully wrestling with himself to acknowledge that , even though we both startlingly resembled our father , we really were both his sons .
Obviously , I identify with "" the housekeeper 's son "" â€ “ my mom also sometimes worked as a housekeeper and cook , in a lumber camp and at a summer resort .
I wish him all the best .
Perhaps one day , in the fullness of time , the four Shriver kids â€
“
that 's how they now identify themselves
â€ “ may feel it 's time to meet their half - brother .
What 's the Catholic word for nachas ?"
"Choosing a team to root for in this year 's NBA finals has been like deciding whether to let your daughter marry Arnold Schwarzenegger or Dominique Strauss - Kahn .
Seriously , what do you do if you ca n't stand the Heat – or the Mavericks ?
Consider Miami : the team 's schadenfreude - ometer has been registering radioactive levels since last July , when LeBron James announced his decision to take his talents to South Beach .
In one of the most unctuous hours in television history , James was not only ungrateful in spurning his hometown of Cleveland , Ohio , but he also managed to insult New York and Chicago , with whom he had been flirting .
As far as those three cities are concerned , there 's a middle seat waiting in the Ninth Circle of Hell for "" The Whore of Akron "" ( as Esquire writer Scott Raab has dubbed him )
– right between Judas and Brutus .
As the season unfolded , it looked as if James and Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh were a team of simony – sorry , destiny – but the pressure was clearly getting to them .
After a one - point loss to the Chicago Bulls , King James and his court were reportedly crying in their locker room .
Crying ?
With a 43 - 20 record ?
Even LBJ 's old team , the Cavaliers , did n't get weepy this season , and they went on a 26-game losing streak , tied for the worst ever in American sports history .
But then you have the Dallas Mavericks , a team who look at the NBA 's salary cap the same way Suri Cruise sees a shoe sale .
In the past decade , the Mavs have spent $ 851 m on players – nearly a quarter - billion more than the Heat – but they still do n't have a championship to show for it .
Naturally that drought does n't sit well with Dallas 's eternally adolescent owner , Mark Cuban .
The 52-year - old billionaire , who often makes Donald Trump seem shy , is at once the best and worst thing to happen to the NBA .
While his on - court cheerleading is undoubtedly infectious – he 's not just the owner , he 's a fan !
–
Cuban 's diatribes against the league and its officials have cost him nearly $ 2 m in fines over the years – including $ 250,000 after game five of the 2006 NBA finals against Miami .
( Petulant show - off that he is , Cuban matches each fine with a donation to charity . )
But here 's the funny thing : during this year 's finals , Cuban has been silent .
Either the NBA commissioner David Stern finally found a diplomatic solution to the Cuban Whistle Crisis , or Cuban himself wisely found the mute button and decided to let his team 's play speak for itself .
And it 's working .
The ancient Mavericks , led by their 32-year - old warrior Dirk Nowitzki ( who has played with a torn tendon in his left hand and despite a triple - digit fever in game four ) now have a 3 - 2 lead over the Heat as the series heads back to Miami this weekend .
Dallas 's aggressive defense and rainbow three - pointers have so utterly confounded the South Beach Cerberus of James , Wade and Bosh that LeBron looks like a lost puppy on the court .
After calling game five "" the biggest of my life "" , James actually stepped up – particularly since Wade was hobbled with a hip injury in the first quarter – and managed a triple double .
But when the game was on the line , LBJ once again entered the Witness Protection Program .
In the fourth quarter , he scored a whopping two points , bringing his final - quarter total in the series up to an astronomical eleven .
All of which has considerably diluted the Haterade that fans were drinking a week ago .
The Mavericks without The Cuban Show are actually a likeable team of old - timers who deserve a champagne shampoo .
And now that the Chosen One has become the Frozen One , cheering for the Heat almost feels like charity .
Almost .
Ether way , if they do win the title , it wo n't be because of LeBron .
And that 's a crying shame .
The last two games of the NBA season are to be played in Miami on Sunday and Tuesday ( if a game seven is required ) .

"On Monday , something happened to Arnold Schwarzenegger that he rarely experienced in his movies .
He lost .
In 2005 , while still governor of California , the star of Predator and The Terminator co - signed a law that would ban the sale of violent video games to minors in the state .
The games industry , through the Entertainment Merchants Association opposed , and on Monday , the US Supreme Court ruled that this law was a violation of the First Amendment .
Following the decision , Justice Antonin Scalia stated : "" Even where the protection of children is the object , the constitutional limits on governmental action apply .
"" The decision was greeted with barely contained delight by the games industry .
The Entertainment Consumers Association said it was "" thrilled "" , the Entertainment Software Association called it "" a landmark ruling "" and Electronic Arts chief John Riccitiello told website Game Politics : Everybody wins on this decision – the Court has affirmed the Constitutional rights of game developers ; adults keep the right to decide what 's appropriate in their houses ; and store owners can sell games without fear of criminal prosecution .
But naturally , there is a certain amount of discontent .
Two Justices dissented on the vote , which ended 7 - 2 in favour of the Entertainment Merchants Association .
One , Stephen Brayer , said : "" What sense does it make to forbid selling to a 13-year - old boy a magazine with an image of a nude woman , while protecting the sale to that 13-year - old of an interactive video game in which he actively , but virtually , binds and gags the woman , then tortures and kills her ? ""
California state senator Leland Yee , who penned the 2005 law , also questioned the ruling ; he has vowed to fight on . ""
As a result of their decision , "" he told PC Magazine , "" Wal - Mart and the video game industry will continue to make billions of dollars at the expense of our kids ' mental health and the safety of our community .
It is simply wrong that the video game industry can be allowed to put their profit margins over the rights of parents and the well - being of children . ""
Yee is considering rewriting the law , focusing it more tightly ( perhaps on specific depictions of violent acts ) so that it can pass untested .
His hopes have been raised by two Justices , Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito , who reportedly stated that they would reconsider if the law was trimmed or re - defined .
Alito expressed afterwards : "" I would not squelch legislative efforts to deal with what is perceived by some to be a significant and developing social problem .
"" It 's an ambiguous and complex situation that contrasts sharply with entertainment classification systems in UK , where the rating of movies and video games is more closely enforced .
In the US , the Entertainment Software Rating Board oversees an entirely voluntary ratings system , with no legal powers of censure over retailers , even when a title is rated AO , or "" adults only "" .
The ESRB requests that participating stores ask for parental permission before selling Mature or AO rated games , but failure to comply is not legally enforceable .
The 2005 law would have hit stores with a $ 1,000 fine for selling mature titles to under-17s .
Now , the ESRB claims high levels of retailer compliance throughout the country and also points to statistics that show the effectiveness of its awareness system with parents .
But in Britain , the Europe - wide voluntary classification system PEGI is accompanied by the requirement to have enforceable BBFC age - ratings on products that demand a 15 certificate or over .
Stores in the UK can be prosecuted for selling 15- or 18-certificate movies or games to under - age customers .
Amid all the talk of victory , let 's not forget that the EMA is a trade organisation not a free speech campaigner and that it represents an industry that would potentially lose billions in revenue if sales of games were to be restricted as they are in Britain .
I personally have no problem with the UK set - up – despite increased parental understanding of games classification , there are still plenty who would allow their children to play 18-certificate games
and I 'm not at all comfortable with that .
However , in the US , there is a more pernicious struggle between the religious right and the liberal entertainment media .
Many feared the California law could be the start of a slippery slope toward wider censorship measures .
Interpretations of the first amendment are being tested and subjectified – if the concept of free speech starts being chopped up , goes the liberal argument , where does the process of ratification end ?
There is also the possibility of de facto censorship .
It 's likely that if a classification law was passed nationally , large retailers such as Walmart would limit their stock of games with legally enforceable age ratings ; as a result , publishers would make less money from mature - rated games and their development could be sidelined .
The US is the world 's largest market for retail titles , so perhaps we 'd all see less titles like Grand Theft Auto , Bodycount and Call of Duty .
And then we have the added complication of downloadable content .
Presumably , the law would n't just have affected retail packaged games ; it would have applied to titles bought over streaming services such as Steam or the Xbox Live Arcade .
Vindicia , a company the provides billing systems for games publishers , filed an amicus curiae brief to the court in support of the EMA case .
The company 's CEO Gene Hoffman pointed out that age - verification processes are problematic to instigate , and can easily be circumnavigated by determined tech - savvy children .
He suggested that current parental control features and filtering software were doing the job .
He also stated , "" If the ban was enforced , the increasingly popular ' freemium ' business model for game publishers would have been jeopardised .
For this business model to work , players need to be able to access a sample of content without going through a restrictive age - verification process , and without having to provide credit card details up front ( unless children know their parents ' credit card details , this requirement might also otherwise prevent access by children to inappropriate content ) . ""
So there are other factors in the argument against Schwarzenegger 's proposed law .
It 's not just about protecting retail game sales , it 's about the evolving culture of game design and game distribution .
And at the base of everything is the simple proposition that violent games should be considered in parity with violent movies – should any law require the classification of one entertainment media platform while ignoring others ?
The one certainty is that , although this ruling is an important milestone for the games industry in the US , it 's unlikely to shut the door on future legislative efforts .
It also raises important and uncomfortable questions about the whole concept of free speech in the digital era .
This is a victory for the games industry , but its consequences and meanings remain uncertain ."
"Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria Shriver are to divorce after papers were filed with a Los Angeles court on Friday .
Maria Shriver , a stalwart of the Kennedy clan , filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences .
The documents submitted to the Los Angeles Superior court and mark official proceedings to end the couple 's 25-year marriage .
Entertainment website TMZ reported that Shriver has also submitted an application for custody for the couple 's two youngest children , Patrick Schwarzenegger , 17 , and Christopher , 13 .
The news comes nearly two months after it emerged the Hollywood action man and Terminator star had fathered a 13-year - old lovechild with the couple 's former housekeeper , Mildred Baena .
Revelations of Schwarzenegger 's infidelity broke shortly after he resigned his governorship and confessed to fathering the child and making maintenance payments to Baena , who had worked for the couple for 20 years .
Shriver had moved out of the couple 's LA mansion following the split in May and reports suggested the couple have been living separatelyfor several weeks .
Schwarzenegger has also been the subject of a number of further stories of alleged extra - marital affairs .
The actor has said he plans to return to the Terminator series of films , while Shriver has said she is now concentrating on planning a conference to forward women 's power as an agent of global change ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger is to test his popularity with the film - going public after signing up to play a small town sheriff tasked with capturing an escaped cartel leader in the western The Last Stand , reports Deadline .
The former California governor has been considering the role for some time , but having shelved a number of other projects in the wake of the scandal surrounding his divorce from wife Maria Shriver he appears to have decided it 's the right part with which to make his Hollywood return .
The former California governor had been tipped to return to the big screen in Cry Macho , a road movie about a down - on - his - luck horse breeder railroaded into travelling to Mexico to kidnap his boss 's young son from the child 's mother .
The film is now on hold , along with his TV cartoon The Governator , featuring a Schwarzenegger - style superhero .
The Last Stand was originally set up for Liam Neeson to star in , but the Ballymena - born actor found reason to delay signing on the dotted line and studio Lionsgate decided to plump for Schwarzenegger instead .
Korean director Kim Jee - woon will make his English language debut on the project .
"" It 's a property which a zillion directors fell in love with : the good , the bad , the weird , "" a Lionsgate exec told Deadline .
"" It 's an old - fashioned western specifically designed for a 63-year - old broken - down guy with a moral decision - whether Arnold decides to stand up for his town .
We always needed an iconic figure for it . ""
The executive added that Schwarzenegger was still an important figure in Hollywood .
"" I can tell you from The Expendables it was electrifying when Arnold came on .
He is still a big piece of news . ""
When Schwarzenegger 's involvement in Cry Macho was announced , it was reported that he would receive a $ 10m - plus ( Â£6 m ) payday based on a 25 % share of the first dollar gross for the project .
The Last Stand , however , reportedly has a modest $ 30 m budget and is not likely to prove nearly so lucrative for its star ."
"There 's a certain kind of movie star – usually one who has struggled against limitations of range or role – who seizes a new vocation in mid - career .
Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger went into politics , Dirk Bogarde and David Niven wrote books , and Hugh Grant has become a campaigner for reform of the British media .
As a result , a personality who would normally only be found on Graham Norton 's sofa or Film 2011 can legitimately be booked for Question Time and Newsnight .
And , so , on Tuesday 's edition of BBC2 's current affairs round - up , Jeremy Paxman found himself in the rare position of suffering competition for the thumping hearts of the women viewers of middle England .
Grant immediately positioned himself as an unusual sort of contributor – an acting pundit , as it were – by appearing in a billowing open - necked shirt , while Paxo , Times executive Roger Alton and Sir Norman Fowler were soberly suited and tied .
It was also soon apparent that Richard Curtis , the key scriptwriter in Grant 's career , drew on the actor 's own characteristics in asking him to portray charming but slightly baffled Englishmen who periodically struggle to finish sentences .
The actor 's advantage , though , was that the other participants seemed almost awed by his presence .
Alton addressed him as "" Mr Grant "" and Paxman declined to interrupt during a lengthy , self - cancelling response .
But Grant made his case impressively .
On Question Time , for example , he remained calm and gracious when Jon Gaunt , the former Sun columnist , taunted him over the hooker on Sunset strip .
Few politicians could have dealt as coolly with such a low punch .
For such shows , Grant 's status as the official anti - Murdoch has been a godsend .
For once , they can book a movie star without being accused of dumbing down .
And this curious curlicue in a leading actor 's career is a small symbol of the astonishing consequences of the Murdoch meltdown .
In what other circumstances , after all , would Norman Fowler have co - starred on screen with Hugh Grant ?"
"He will be back â€ “ but will he be any good ?
In fulfilment of one of his most famous movie lines , it was confirmed last week that Arnold Schwarzenegger , the action movie star - turned - two - term California governor , would be returning to the big screen in his first major role since entering politics .
The critics are divided on whether it will be worth his while .
While many actors have moved from films into politics â€ “ Ronald Reagan was the most famous â€ “ few have ever tried to make the switch twice and go back to their former career .
"" It is a unique moment in his career and for action cinema in America , "" said Professor Christopher Sharrett , a film academic at Seton Hall University .
The most obvious challenge facing Schwarzenegger , now 63 , is his age .
In The Last Stand , a contemporary western , he will play a small - town American lawman who has to capture a criminal drug lord before he escapes across the border .
The man who played a barbarian warrior in the Conan films and a robot from the future in the Terminator series is choosing to stick with action roles even though he will soon be a pensioner .
He has kept in remarkable physical shape for a man with six decades on the clock , but convincing movie audiences of his credentials as a heroic crime - fighting cop might be difficult . ""
He is getting long in the tooth and the movie industry is not very forgiving of that .
There is not much tolerance of it .
Young men in the audience will see him as an old codger and older people will see him as a star of yesteryear , "" Sharrett said .
But there is a precedent .
Sylvester Stallone is still pumping out action flicks at 65 and , while his films have not been winning him Oscars , they have generally been hits .
His last action film , The Expendables , took in $ 275 m at the box office .
Adding to the chances of Schwarzenegger 's return to the big screen being a hit is the fact many people will be keen to see the film for its curiosity value .
It also features an exciting new director , South Korean Kim Ji - Woon , who is trying to break into Hollywood after cult hits in Asia such as I
Saw
The Devil and The Good , The Bad , The Weird .
Also in Schwarzenegger 's favour is the fact that western - style films have a long tradition of ageing male leads . ""
He can be made to look good , but it will depend on the quality of the script and the film direction .
If that is good , then the film could easily work , "" said Professor Christine Holmlund , a cinema studies expert at the University of Tennessee .
The Last Stand promises to feature all the staples of a modern - day western : desperate criminal , FBI convoy , hostages , gun - toting henchmen and , of course , a hero .
Kim , who originally envisioned Liam Neeson in the lead role , has called the film "" a kind of a combination of Die Hard and High Noon "" .
It is clearly going to guarantee audiences more in the way of high explosives than high art .
There might be another reason for Schwarzenegger to be heading back to Hollywood .
Though he left office with an international reputation on environmental issues , he was hit by a scandal over fathering a child with a maid .
"" There is no surprise that he is coming back to films , "" Holmlund said .
"" This whole love child incident messes up his prospects for much else in the way of politics . """
"In a land of chaos and ruin , where limbs are lopped off and stumps spout blood , and memories have faded of the hoary Arnold Schwarzenegger films of old , the hour has come to wheel Robert E Howard 's barbarian action hero back out of retirement .
As played by Baywatch graduate Jason Momoa , Conan possesses "" the heart of a king , the loyalty of a bloodhound "" and the air of a peeved , preening surfer who ca n't find the beach .
He 's on a mission to save the ancient world and avenge his father 's death , battling an evil warlock and his witchy daughter ( Rose McGowan , having fun ) .
But it 's not all sorcery and swordplay .
Along the way , Conan finds brief moments of respite , whether it be arm - wrestling his brawny buddy into chuckling submission or carousing with the sort of nubile slave girls who look as if they were abducted on their way to a swimwear photo - shoot .
In this regard , the Conan upgrade is entirely in keeping with the spirit of the original pulp novels and comic - book spin - offs – all of which shone a similarly inquisitive light on those learned genre tenets of gore - porn and what scholars refer to as "" teen - masturbatory erotica "" .
Even so , Marcus Nispel 's film is too relentlessly one note and too abidingly cheesy to stay the course .
Here is a tale in which battle sequence spawns battle sequence and where the dialogue is rendered all - but unintelligible under the din of clashing steel and the screams of the mutilated .
Towards the end , Conan finally finds the beach , only to be immediately accosted by a pack of whirling - dervish sand monsters .
Bummer .
•
This article was amended on Monday August 29 .
The original standfirst incorrectly stated that the 2011 Conan the Barbarian is a remake of the 1982 film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger .
This has been been corrected ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger made his name back in 1982 in John Milius 's Conan the Barbarian , a superior sword - and - sorcery epic , as a comic - strip hero from the mythic dark ages .
It enabled Arnie to enter politics as what he called "" Conan the Republican "" .
Later he used the even greater success provided by the Terminator pictures to achieve elective office in California as "" The Governator "" .
Preceded by an epigram from Nietzsche ( "" That which does not kill us makes us stronger "" ) , Milius 's Conan had a certain fascistic grandeur ; its blood - and - steel teutonic fantasy was a tale told by an ideologue , full of sound and Führer .
This remake , the work of Marcus Nispel , the German film - maker who directed turbid retreads of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , Pathfinder and Friday the 13th , is a glum affair .
Starring the unimpressive , muscle - bound Hawaiian Jason Momoa as Conan , it begins with his warrior father delivering him by Caesarian section using a dagger on his dying wife during a fierce battle .
The movie was shot on location in Bulgaria in what appears to have been a partial eclipse of the sun ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger is in talks to play a kidnapped businessman in the indie thriller Captive , according to Deadline .
The announcement â€ “ along with the news last week that he is to take a leading role in a sequel to Sylvester Stallone action flick
The Expendables â€ “ suggests reports of the demise of the former California governor 's return to Hollywood may have been exaggerated .
Schwarzenegger , 63 , revealed in February that he was planning a high - profile comeback , including a possible fifth Terminator film ( the fourth to star Schwarzenegger ) and a cartoon TV series ( and possible movie ) titled The Governator .
However , his much - publicised matrimonial problems looked likely to derail such ambitions when they were revealed in May Captive could see Schwarzenegger as an American real estate magnate living in Brazil who is kidnapped and held for ransom .
While he tries to escape from an armoured - truck prison cell hidden in a SÃ£o Paulo landfill , a detective specialising in kidnap and ransom cases works to find him .
No director has yet been announced for the project , which is based on a story by Danish film - maker Nicolai Fuglsig and appears to echo the plot of the little - known but well - received 2010 Ryan Reynolds vehicle Buried , in which the actor played a US truck driver hostage trapped alive in a wooden coffin in Iraq .
As well as The Expendables 2 , Schwarzenegger has the action film Last Stand on his slate .
He will play a small - town sheriff tasked with capturing an escaped cartel leader who tries to high tail it to Mexico through his territory .
The film has a reported budget of $ 30 m ( Â£18.9 m ) , suggesting that Hollywood is dipping its toe in the water to test Schwarzenegger 's popularity before offering him the kind of big - money paydays which were being predicted prior to the revelations about his personal life .
Korean director Kim Jee - Woon will make his English language debut on the project , which was originally envisaged for Liam Neeson ."
"A museum dedicated to the life and work of Austria 's greatest film export , Arnold Schwarzenegger , has opened in the actor - politician 's home village of Thal , near Graz .
The museum is located in the first - floor flat where Schwarzenegger lived as a boy with his policeman father Gustav , mother Aurelia , and stepbrother Meinhard .
With no electricity and a "" pit "" toilet , it suggests Schwarzenegger 's early life was genuinely spartan .
Several of Schwarzenegger 's personal items from his childhood and teenage years â€ “ including his bed and first weight - training equipment
â€ “ are on display .
Visitors can also inspect life - size statues of Schwarzenegger as he appeared in the documentary Pumping Iron and the Terminator movie .
Schwarzenegger lived in Thal until 1965 , when compulsory national service forced him to serve in the Austrian army for a year .
His sights , however , had been set on a bodybuilding career since he was 14 , and eventually made his way to London in 1966 for the Mr Universe tournament , in which he was placed second .
In 1968 he emigrated to the US , and began his long march to acting celebrity ."
"These may seem golden times for the action movie .
An only slightly embalmed - looking Arnold Schwarzenegger is merrily tweeting from the Bulgarian set of The Expendables 2 , while his co - star Bruce Willis has announced a return to the fray with a fifth Die Hard .
Or perhaps that all strikes you as a little short - termist .
However much fun is had in the meantime , it ca n't be a sign of good health for any genre to become so reliant on men who have clearly , to use the cinematically correct parlance , got too old for this shit .
All the stranger then that one of the freshest action films in recent memory risks slipping by unnoticed – The Yellow Sea , a darkly propulsive South Korean crime thriller featuring all manner of car chases , gunplay and loving scenes of glass lavishly shattering , to be released in Britain next week .
Named for the stretch of water that lies between China , North and South Korea , it 's a compelling affair –
the protagonist is a broken gambler from the Chinese border town of Yanbian , who in desperation to find his wife after she escapes to Seoul agrees to be smuggled there to carry out a mob hit .
What then unfolds does so in a series of adrenalised setpieces ; while the pace of Na Hong - jin 's storytelling might be some way from flawless , the rush of those sequences is dizzying .
Of course , the thing about the action movie is that there 's still a sense in some quarters that its noisy , car - go - boom pleasures exist at one end of a spectrum , with foreign language film at the other .
Whereas in fact , as any action fan knows , that divide is bogus .
On the most basic level , subtitles cease to be an issue when the focus is flying bullets and stuff blowing up .
But also , film - makers from outside Hollywood have always had a knack for stylistically raising the bar and leaving America to catch up – a tradition spanning from Eisenstein to John Woo to Korea 's own Park Chan - wook .
The Yellow Sea is also one of the main attractions at the upcoming London Korean film festival , a three - week celebration so self - assured it does n't even need to call on the stellar back catalogues of Park or Bong Joon - ho .
As befits a country with such a madly diverse film culture , the programme runs from high school K - horror to slapstick 16th - century detective yarns – but with a cluster of superior action thrillers at its centre .
Na 's previous film , the technically staggering The Chaser , gets another airing on the big screen – while onetime "" Action Kid "" Ryoo Seung - wan has a full retrospective .
The highlight there is probably his most recent film The Unjust , a sprawling tale of police corruption with a genuine sense of ambivalence among the random head - poundings .
But aside from their facility with blood and pyrotechnics , another aspect of Korean cinema lends its action flicks a particular heft – their connection to the real world .
What really makes The Yellow Sea tick is its grounding in the experience of ethnic Koreans in Chinese - controlled outposts like Yanbian , the mood of semi - lawless gloom dramatic ballast for the chaos of its later stages .
Time and again through the festival 's lineup , the realities of the class divide and the anxiety and sadness of the relationship with the North arise almost as often as ultraviolent bedlam .
Of course , South Korea 's film - makers are n't the first to give action movies a social undercarriage .
But that combination has become as much a signature of the country 's cinema as operatic plotting , an ice - cream swirl of unease that runs through even its biggest mainstream hits .
The vastly successful 1999 blockbuster Shiri centred on the tension between Seoul and Pyongyang , while Bong 's much - loved monster spectacular
The Host doubled as a critique of the presence of the US military in South Korea .
Here in the west , unless The Expendables 2 finds Arnie and friends taking on the banks , our action still happens firmly in the land of make believe ."
"Who do you think is the highest - grossing movie star of all time ?
Tom Cruise ?
Arnold Schwarzenegger ?
John Wayne , perhaps ?
A woman ?
You could n't be any more wrong .
In fact , the Guinness Book of Records has just declared that it 's actually Samuel L Jackson .
In total , his films have grossed $ 7.4bn ( £ 4.6bn ) , putting him way above any of his co - workers , living or dead .
But how has he managed this remarkable feat ?
Was it luck ?
Good choices ?
The strength of his ability ?
Let 's find out how to become the highest - grossing movie star in history , the Samuel L Jackson way ...
Step one :
Never stop making films Since playing the part of Stan in 1972 's Together for Days , Samuel L Jackson has featured in over 100 movies .
The man is a machine .
Not including videos and TV movies and videogames , Jackson still finds the time to appear in movie after movie after movie .
In 2008 , for example , you could have seen him in The Spirit , Soul Men , Lakeview Terrace , Iron Man , Gospel Hill and Jumper .
Admittedly several of his films now are as Nick Fury , where he only has to put on an eyepatch and tut at Robert Downey Jr for a day or so , but even before that he had a work ethic that would exhaust his contemporaries .
Step two :
Find a franchise and dig your heels in Samuel L Jackson has never been shy about his desire to see out his dotage in a nice comfortable franchise , but happily several of his attempts have ended in failure .
He famously wanted his character to survive the end of Snakes on a Plane so that he could ride the wave of endless Snakes on a Plane sequels like some kind of conquering hero , but the film tanked and he never got his wish .
The same goes for his horrible update of Shaft .
But the tactic has paid off a couple of times .
Wearing a dressing gown and spending the majority of three interminable Star Wars prequels discussing intergalactic taxation added $ 2.4bn to his grosses , while Nick Fury accounts for over a billion more .
Step three :
No part is too small if the film is big enough
There 's talk of a Nick Fury film being made in coming years but , to be fair , Samuel L Jackson does n't really add a lot to his Marvel films at the moment .
All he does is show up , sometimes not even until the end credits have finished , and mutter something about a team he 's putting together .
Similarly , Mace Windu was n't an essential component in Star Wars , his character in Jurassic Park came and went without many people even noticing that it was him and , career maker or not , Jackson 's time on Pulp Fiction was mainly spent either talking about hamburgers or screaming biblical tracts at men with silly haircuts .
Step four :
Kick back and relax every now and then But Samuel L Jackson ca n't spend his entire career turning up , pulling one face and watching $ 288 m get added on to his all - time gross , like he did in Coming to America .
Sometimes you have to ignore the money and follow your soul .
Sure , maybe films like Unthinkable or Country of My Skull or Quantum Quest : A Cassini Space Odyssey were n't as popular as Jurassic Park and Star Wars and Iron Man , but they still count towards his combined total grosses .
In their own way , they still count .
Step five
: Everybody loves a badass
Did Mace Windu need to be a fearsome African American from Washington DC ?
No , he did n't , but George Lucas just thought it 'd be cool .
Was it essential that he narrated Inglourious Basterds over anyone else ?
No ,
but it was cool .
Technically , should n't Nick Fury have been played by David Hasselhoff ?
Perhaps , but Samuel L Jackson is cooler .
Basically , the moral of the story is this : be cool enough and huge films will trip over themselves to give you tiny parts .
And that 's apparently how you break records ."
"Everybody loves a comeback .
Mickey Rourke has been a major player ever since roaring back meatily and teary - eyed from a decade or so in the wilderness with The Wrestler , while all eyes are on Arnold Schwarzenegger to see if he can conjure up a little of the old 1980s magic in The Last Stand and The Expendables 2 .
And yet the most impressive renaissance of the past few years may have been more of a stealth affair .
Since that notorious sofa - jumping incident in 2005 , Cruise has been written off by industry bloggers , abandoned by Hollywood bigwigs , embarrassed by water - toting TV presenters , accused of hiding his true sexuality by sniggering comics and pilloried by just about everybody else for his commitment to Scientology .
Six years ago , Paramount head honcho Sumner Redstone said Cruise 's public persona had been so devalued by his off - screen antics that he was no longer worth the studio 's time .
Three years ago , we were told Tom was so unpopular that 20th Century Fox had decided not to use his image to promote action comedy Knight and Day , which was promptly panned by the critics .
More recently the rumour mill told us Cruise 's star had fallen so far that producers had decided to draft in Jeremy Renner to replace him in the Mission : Impossible franchise .
The vultures were not just circling , they had taken up residence and hawked front row seats to the schadenfreude circus that seems to follow the star of Top Gun everywhere he goes .
Unfortunately for the above , Cruise himself does not seem to have read the script .
It has been revealed that his latest film , Mission : Impossible – Ghost Protocol , has just become the most profitable instalment in what was already a pretty bankable series with an impressive $ 571 m worldwide .
Those who have seen the film will also be aware that reports of Cruise 's demotion turn out to be greatly exaggerated : when the Missions get really Impossible , it is Cruise 's Ethan Hunt who is called upon to scoot up and down skyscrapers , grinning toothily and flexing impressive if slightly terrifying 49-year - old sinews as Renner and the rest of the team bite their fingernails in the background .
Whatever one 's feelings about Cruise 's religious beliefs or antics , one has to admire the kind of relentlessly bull - headed determination which has seen him refuse to give up the mantle of Hollywood 's blockbuster action big dog .
Will M : I-4 end up being one last action hurrah before Cruise accepts the inevitable and allows his agent to send him the odd script for a character - led supporting role ?
Sly Stallone is still pounding the weights well into his 60s and Liam Neeson has recently emerged as an unlikely action hero while approaching the same sort of age , but it 's worth noting that Cruise has a far wider range than the former and is unlikely to plump for the kind of furrowed - browed , exploitation - tinged fare that has characterised the latter 's recent efforts .
Next up for Cruise , instead , is a turn as legendary rocker Stacee Jaxx in the hair - metal musical Rock of Ages , not a role that 's likely to prove particularly demanding or shift perceptions of him as an actor .
Like the Mission : Impossible series and Knight and Day
it 's yet another part that disguises any real - life unpopularity with the cinemagoing public by parachuting him into view as the coolest man on the planet , in this case one so in - demand that attractive women throw themselves at him , hoping desperately to have their appendages signed ( see trailer ) .
Cruise 's Hollywood A - lister predecessors did n't need that : Schwarzenegger was confident enough in his standing to send up his tough guy image in 1994 's Junior , while Jimmy Stewart , Cary Grant and Tony Curtis all took risks playing offbeat or downright unpleasant characters .
Now that he 's proved himself still capable of headlining a tentpole movie , might Cruise relax and head ( back ) into equally edgy territory ?
Many of us would love to see him playing against type once again as he did in Paul Thomas Anderson 's Magnolia , but we 'll probably have to accept that a career portraying weirdos is an unlikely direction for a man who is routinely described as being one .
Personally I 'd settle for seeing him in another villainous role , such as Vincent , his contract killer in Michael Mann 's Collateral , or even as a damaged hero like the drug - addicted future cop in Steven Spielberg 's Minority Report .
A revival of his much - discussed Les Grossman character from Tropic Thunder might just do the trick , though the hideous film producer 's over - the - top antics always reminded me rather too much of sofa - jumping Tom .
Cruise may have rediscovered his mainstream mojo in the four years since the underwhelming Valkyrie , but I think it 's fair to say that he 's done it without really stretching himself .
The true mark of the actor 's renaissance will be what he decides to do with the next stage of his career .
He may be back on top of the heap , but he ca n't keep running up and down skyscrapers forever , or audiences may start to reckon these Missions really are a bit too Impossible to be worth bothering with ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone have confirmed that they will co - star in The Tomb , an - wait for it - action movie directed by Swedish film - maker Mikael HÃ¥fstrÃ¶m .
Sly will play a structural engineer wrongly incarcerated in a prison of his own design , Arnie 's the soulful inmate who 'll help him escape .

"Arnold Schwarzenegger and Europe 's climate chief , Connie Hedegaard , are spearheading a new push to help people envisage a sustainable future using low - carbon resources .
The Sustainia initiative , launched on Wednesday with the support of the United Nations global compact , aims to take dozens of new and developing technologies from renewable energy to hydrogen - powered buses , and use designers to create visual representations and recreations that will allow people to imagine what a more environmentally friendly world would be like .
This is needed in order to allay people 's fears that opting for more environmentally sustainable practices may lead to a lower quality of life , according to the founders .
"" We 've done this because it is hard for people to understand what a sustainable future could look like , "" Hedegaard told the Guardian . ""
Many people do not want to give up what they know because they fear that if we get away from business as usual , we will go to a grey and uninteresting life .
But we can show that does n't have to be â€ “ we can create cities where there is cleaner air , where people have better transport and nice houses to live in .
Showing that vision is very important . ""
The initiative is aimed at the Rio+20 conference this June , where governments , businesses and civil society will discuss ways to encourage environmental sustainability .
The theme of the Rio+20 conference is "" the future we want "" , and Sustainia is meant to allow people to envisage what such a future would look like .
As well as creating a virtual model of a future sustainable world , and publishing a book laying out what that world will look like , the organisers of Sustainia will set up an award they are billing as a "" Nobel prize for sustainable development "" .
It will reward technological breakthroughs and designs that tackle environmental problems .
Schwarzenegger said : "" Being a champion in body building , in movies and in politics where I was able to lead California to renewable energy , energy efficiency , green jobs
â€
¦
I believe it is important to demonstrate that sustainability is the better choice for all of us .
For communities around the world and for the individual , the Sustainia award offers a multitude of benefits in terms of better health , more liveable regions and cities and increased productivity .
But we need to actually see it to understand it .
And this is what we will make possible . ""
The head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , Rajendra Pachauri , and Gro Harlem Brundtland , the former politician , many regard as the founder of environmental sustainability thinking , after she coined the definition of sustainability at the first Rio conference 20 years ago , are also taking part in Sustainia .
Businesses are also involved , including Microsoft , General Electric , Philips and TetraPak .
Georg Kell , executive director of the UN Global Compact , said : "" Sustainia is a clear articulation of the future we want "" and aligns well with the message the UN wants to convey in Rio and beyond : we can build a desirable , sustainable future .
Sustainia is a fresh and much - needed approach to communicating sustainability , engaging key stakeholders , and inspiring tangible action . """
"A luxury Tuscan spa hotel which has hosted the likes of Giuseppe Verdi , Paul Cézanne and Arnold Schwarzenegger during its 142-year history has rolled out the red carpet for an unexpected arrival from the world 's new capital of bling – Moscow .
Svetlana Medvedeva , the wife of outgoing Russian president Dmitry Medvedev , has hitherto avoided a reputation for rock star living , but made a start this month by booking out the entire Hotel La Pace in Montecatini Terme for a week and showing up with her son and a 30-strong entourage , including bodyguards and translators .
In a move worthy of an oil sheikh 's wife , Medvedeva , 46 , arrived while the 140-room hotel was shut for the winter , prompting staff to hurriedly throw open the shutters and plump up the pillows as Italian police set up a security operation in the small town .
As Vladimir Putin retakes the reins in Russia from her husband , Medvedeva may have wanted a breather from hectic years of opening art festivals , meeting Japanese orphans and visiting crisis centres for underage mothers .
With rooms going for € 600 a night and suites at up to € 1,300 – plus the price of saunas and massages – the elegant , Liberty - style Hotel La Pace clearly looked the right place to splurge .
Clark Gable , Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepburn have all checked in to sip the local water over the years , and discreet staff have handled smoothly guests with peculiar requests or capricious behaviour , including the Polish count who insisted on clearing the restaurant for a game of tennis to a British lord who was ticked off for flicking cherry stones at other guests during dinner .
Medvedeva 's visit followed promotional trips made to Moscow by hotel managers , reported Italian daily Corriere Fiorentino .
Her stay , the hotel hopes , will trigger an onslaught of Russian oligarchs and their wives , just as Roman Abramovich 's visit to the Tuscan resort of Forte dei
Marmi turned it from a genteel hideaway for Milan industrialists into Moscow - on - sea , and Putin 's stay at Silvio Berlusconi 's Sardinian villa
helped clog the island 's Emerald coast with Russian yachts .
Massimo Giovannetti , a local official in Montecatini Terme , told Corriere Fiorentino the effects of Medvedeva 's visit "" will be seen in the coming months when Russian tourists who love classic spas will turn up in ever greater numbers "" .
Mixing Russian millionaires and Italian lifestyle has not always proved easy .
The mayor of Forte
dei
Marmi has made plans to keep new local housing back for locals after prices spiralled , while in Sardinia bottles were reportedly thrown by rich Russians at pop star Zucchero after he objected to a woman texting while he sang .
The Hotel La Pace has its own experience of high maintenance Russians .
In 1908 the Russian ambassador to Italy complained the buzz of crickets was ruining his afternoon nap , prompting a resourceful manager to send two guitarists to his room to play "" sweetly and without stopping "" .
Giuseppe Bellandi , the mayor of Montecatini Terme , appeared to welcome the prospect of a Russian invasion , promising that from this season signs in the town will be written in Cyrillic as well as English and Italian ."
"Fresh from the critical debacle that was A Thousand Words , Eddie Murphy is reportedly making a new bid to alienate a new generation of moviegoers by getting involved in a sequel to the 1988 Arnold Schwarzenegger / Danny DeVito comedy Twins .
Entitled Triplets , the new film would see Schwarzenegger and DeVito reunited , with Murphy as a ( presumably long - lost ) third brother .
The original Twins was a well - received comedy directed by Ivan Reitman , in which Schwarzenegger and DeVito play the results of a genetics experiment that produces radically dissimilar twin brothers who grow up in entirely different enviroments .
It was made at the height of Schwarzenegger 's action - movie stardom , and showcased a hitherto little - suspected comedic side to his persona .
It was a sizeable hit , taking $ 111 m in the US and a further $ 104 m worldwide .
There is no word yet as to who might direct the project , but Reitman is unlikely to take the helm again , according to the Hollywood Reporter , preferring at this stage to stay in the background as a producer ."
"Well , he always promised .
Confirmation that Arnold Schwarzenegger would indeed be making a return to cinemas came a few weeks ago with the announcement of a sequel to Twins – Triplets , with Eddie Murphy .
And by the time that film reaches us , the man famous for littering his works with smoking bodies and eviscerated vowels will already have starred in
action thriller The Last Stand , and done the slo - mo explosion walk in Sylvester Stallone 's The Expendables 2 .
The Governator 's in the house .
The first Expendables , in 2010 , hinted at it , but this summer will make things clear : the beefcake action star is back .
There is a triple - beef sandwich in Marvel Avengers Assemble , starring Captain America , Thor and the Hulk .
In July , meat concentration levels get dangerously high with the Spider - Man reboot and The Dark Knight Rises .
The villain in the former is the Lizard who , judging by the hand he plunges through a car roof in the trailer , is far more hulking and steroidal than the lithe Green Goblin .
Meanwhile , Tom Hardy is still on the protein shakes , reportedly gaining 30lbs of muscle to slap Batman around in his role as "" human juggernaut "" Bane .
Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne "" the Rock
"" Johnson play bodybuilder bank robbers in Pain and Gain , the next film by Michael Bay .
The heyday for this sort of hero , of course , was the 1980s , when a person 's pay packet appeared to be proportionally linked to their bench - press record , and we were on first - name terms with Arnie , Sly , Dolph and Jean - Claude .
But this time around there 's something different about the beefcake .
They 've crossed the line , from pristinely oiled killing machines , to pockmarked veterans chancing it for one last job – and not just on the screen , as a jokey photo posted by Schwarzenegger , 64 , of him and Stallone , 65 , side - by - side in hospital apparently receiving treatment for shoulder injuries , showed .
You do n't see many sexagenarians in this kind of shape , but beneath the tattoos , the skin is papery over those abs , the visage raddled .
Something 's not right .
Prior to the 80s , if a film star had that ripped kind of body , he was almost certainly playing someone of impeccable moral standing ( think Johnny Weissmuller as Tarzan or Steve Reeves as Hercules ) .
Musculature of this kind was the province of demi - gods , superheroes and noble savages .
In the bodybuilding boom that followed , Arnie and Lou Ferrigno – their rivalry documented in the classic 1977 docudrama
Pumping Iron – became the sport 's ambassadors to mainstream culture .
They were in the right place at the right time – just as B - movies were becoming A - movies , and the call was out for a new , outsized kind of hero to help defenestrate what was left of 70s realism .
The action star of the 80s was widely seen , in films such as Predator , Rambo :
First Blood , Part II and Cobra , as Reaganite foreign policy made flesh ( with an Uzi 9 mm in hand ) .
They were a glorification of the shoot - first - make - self - aggrandising - quip - later kind of unilateralism used to keep the American end up against Soviet communism .
The pumped - up physiques signified impregnability in fractious times ; as Adam Curtis pointed out in a recent blog post , bodybuilding originally caught on in Britain at the turn of the 19th century , just as the idea of empire was starting to be questioned .
There 's no kind of self - doubt , it seems , that ca n't be sorted out with a few thousand squat thrusts .
Back in America , by the late 80s , beefy action heroes were already looking immobile next to nimbler newcomers such as Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson .
Schwarzenegger , the only beefcake with any real charisma , started to diversify into comedies .
In 1994 , Speed came out , and a buzz - cutted , discreetly buff Keanu Reeves gave us the new sensitive face of male action stardom ( and Sandra Bullock looked just as capable of getting their bus out of trouble ) .
We all know what the 80s he - man would have said about that , but the game was up for him .
The droll sheen had gone from Schwarzenegger 's films , and with 1996 's Eraser he began the worst run of this career .
Stallone was arguably the frontrunner of the pair for the first time .
Things were bad :
Steven Seagal started to look like a solution .
To make the humiliation worse , it was the geek who was put in charge of resurrecting the beefcake 's fortunes 10 years later .
Who else had the adolescent fantasy of muscle - bound impunity really been aimed at ?
As a pencilneck bookworm delighted to be invited into very unparentally guided screenings of Bloodsport and Commando , I count myself among that number in the 80s .
By the time we geeks were of age in the early noughties , with more than a few working in the studios or as film critics , we were ready to repay the debt , and invite the meathead back in .
But not without kicking a little ironic sand in his face , making movies or writing books that were a bit too clever about the trashy action heroes of old , such as Mabrouk El Mechri 's JCVD , or Seagalogy :
A Study of the Ass - Kicking Films of Steven Seagal , a 395-page ( with three appendices ) meditation on the master 's oeuvre by
Ai n't
It Cool writer Vern .
There was always a sense of the absurd in the best of the 80s beefcake oeuvre , in its cartoonishness and penchant for flippant violence .
But at the same time , the genre took itself with a narcissistic seriousness that would be impossible now : the audience is simply too knowing , about the drugs involved , about the political associations , about the limits of this kind of hero .
I think that 's the reason why recherché iron - pumpers such as Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson have stuttered in recent years : like your personal trainer says , it 's all about a strong core , and they do n't have a natural constituency any more .
Johnson – good - looking , dynamic and charismatic – has been mightily effective in impact parts in The Scorpion King , The Other Guys and Fast Five .
But left to hold the fort , he 's attempted the Schwarzenegger manoeuvre of combining po - faced actioners ( Walking Tall ) with knuckle - dragging comedies ( Tooth Fairy ) , with disappointing results .
The meatheads have to face it –
no one 's dazzled by a Himalayan bicep peak any more .
The Expendables shows the dangers of trying to pull the old routine without an ironic safeguard .
With the fatigued banter between its leathery linebackers , it comes across , as Peter Bradshaw put it , "" like it 's set in the world 's most macho prostate clinic "" .
The sequel , piling on even more beef in the shape of Van Damme and Chuck Norris , seems unlikely to be an arthouse departure .
Maybe it 's The Expendables franchise that best articulates the sense of desperation in the air , of a rearguard action for beleaguered masculinity .
Steroids and hormones have long been associated with bodybuilding ( Stallone himself was charged with importing human growth hormone , HGH , into Australia in 2007 ) , but this need for a little extra help is built into contemporary action heroes .
HGH used to be synthesised from cadavers .
It 's not so far from Batman 's Bane , and Venom , the super - serum that gives him his demonic strength .
Dubious elixirs fuelling dubious desires : no wonder the "" new beefcake "" has a touch of the dark side .
The Belgian film Rundskop ( Bullhead ) , one of this year 's foreign - language Oscar nominees , plays the idea for its full tragic dimension with an emasculated beefcake as protagonist : Matthias Schoenaerts gives a powerhouse performance as a Flemish farmer as juiced up as his swollen - haunched cattle .
But he 's got good reason for his rage : his testicles were crushed in a childhood accident .
The insecurity and the pain were probably there all along for the meatheads .
After all , Stallone first came to fame as the battered Rocky Balboa , perpetually climbing back on to his feet ; or John Rambo , in the first film the symbol of America 's wounded , post - Vietnam pride .
Arnie blazed his way through with more of a twinkle in his eye , but was never far from revelling in the violence , from acknowledging there was something inhuman coursing through that grotesque vascular network .
It was the Terminator , the remorseless android , not Conan the freed slave , that made him a star , after all .
At the height of their rivalry in 1986 , Schwarzenegger accused Stallone of a heartless , machine - like devotion to his work in a GQ interview : "" If you 're doing 120 lb curls , he will say , I can do 130 .
He 's obsessed , and that carries through in the way he dresses , how hard he tries to belong to a charity organisation .
It 's all Rocky , it does n't come from , you know
[ Arnold points to his heart ]
…
There 's no love there .
And people see that .
You can fake your way through for a year , but for ten years , that 's hard .
I think that 's the difference between him and me .
"" It 'll be interesting to see if Arnie 's heart , pig valve and all , is still in it as he makes his comeback .
After all , it is Stallone who has soldiered on , not for 10 years , but for more than 20 .
As the hulks stagger back for one more round , Hollywood must surely see itself reflected in these gorged physiques , pumped up past their prime , fear in their bloodshot eyes ; there 's an obvious parallel with its stable of multi- million - dollar blockbusters , their budgets inflated past the danger point , too big to fail .
( No wonder World Wrestling Entertainment , which understands the pantomime appeal , is continuing to expand its film arm . )
"" Too big to fail .
"" They said it about the banks , of course .
Perhaps the giant scale of the whole thing is only just coming into view and the new beefcake is n't just Hollywood but the swollen , over - fed west , pumped up not on creatine but on credit , nervously self - medicating against its own decline .
I think of Shame , Steve McQueen 's film , as the spiritual film of the hubris - hulk : the way the director frames Michael Fassbender 's features in towering closeups as monumental as skyscrapers , or a Mr Universe pose , pushing his handsomeness over into something imposing and over - evolved , ready to collapse under its own mass .
People always hark back in dark times .
The fanboys would like to turn back the clock to the geek antiquity of the 80s ; Schwarzenegger , Stallone and their meathead peers probably want it even more , to when they were well - oiled titans .
But things ca n't be the same .
We know too much about the price paid , and the big secret beating in ageing beefcake hearts : that your body never lies .
Like Arnie said in Terminator 2 , his battered android finally accepting its expiry date : "" I know now why you cry . ""

"James Cameron has told Arnold Schwarzenegger to ensure he is the focus of the next Terminator film before signing up to return to the iconic role .
Cameron , who directed the first two films in the dystopian sci - fi series but was not involved in the most recent two , has signalled his distaste for later Terminator entries on multiple occasions , famously pointing out that he "" told the story "" in 1991 's Terminator 2 : Judgment Day .
However he told MTV he met up with Schwarzenegger last autumn and tried to be "" as encouraging as possible "" about the proposed project . ""
Frankly , at that time , I thought it needed to be more about him , "" Cameron said .
"" I told him he should not do it until it 's focused on his [ T-800 ] character , or he should n't do it .
I think there are some great stories that can be told about that character that have n't even been thought of yet . ""
After eight years away from Hollywood , the former California governor signalled his intention to return to the role of the Terminator in April last year .
Justin Lin , currently the toast of Hollywood after returning the Fast and Furious franchise to box office credibility , was set to direct but dropped out in September .
The return of Schwarzenegger ( even at the age of 64 ) to his most iconic role makes a fifth Terminator film a tantalising prospect for studios , even if the series has not been at its best since Cameron 's last outing .
The first non - Schwarzenegger film , 2009 's Terminator Salvation , was the worst - reviewed so far , although it still made $ 370 m ( Â£225 m ) globally ( albeit on an enormous $ 200 m budget ) .
The former bodybuilder appeared only as a CGI recreation of his younger self .
Terminator 5 was being touted around studios last year , but Schwarzenegger put plans for the film and his return to acting on hold in May when it was revealed he had fathered a child with a household employee outside of wedlock more than a decade ago .
The Austrian - born actor and his wife Maria Shriver filed for divorce in July after 25 years of marriage , but there have since been rumblings that Schwarzenegger is still planning a Hollywoood comeback .
He is due to star alongside old comrade Sylvester Stallone in the action film
The Tomb for director Mikael HÃ¥fstrÃ¶m , and has also signed on for a sequel to the 1988 comedy Twins , which saw him portray Danny DeVito 's not - so - identical sibling .
Titled Triplets , the film will add a third long lost brother into the mix , with Eddie Murphy the current favourite to take on the role ."
"Venice Beach has long been known as the bohemian heart of Los Angeles .
It was a place by the sea where the city 's obsession with Hollywood stars gave way to a strange mix of hippies , artists and muscle - bound weightlifters pumping iron on the boardwalk ; where Beat writers such as Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac haunted its bars and cafes .
Arnold Schwarzenegger first shot to fame there as a young bodybuilder , fresh from Austria , long before he became an action star and a politician .
Now , however , another unusual newcomer to Venice Beach is causing a stir among its long - established alternative scene .
That interloper has arrived in the form of internet search firm Google , which has snapped up some 100,000 sq ft of Venice office space for more than 500 sales and technology staff .
It is also negotiating on a further 100,000 sq ft , including the Gold 's Gym , which has long been the symbol of Venice 's large population of bodybuilders .
The invasion has sparked a furious debate among Venice residents , and wider observers of Los Angeles ' shifting social scenes , as to whether Google 's presence could irrevocably change one of the city 's most distinctive neighbourhoods .
Schwarzenegger himself has voiced concerns â€ “ immediately denied by Google â€ “ that his beloved Gold 's could be closed by the sudden invasion of geeks into a city some are even beginning to call Silicon Beach .
"" It 's this conspiracy theory : ' Google is coming !
They are going to take over and wipe out our bodybuilding ' , "" Schwarzenegger recently told the New York Times newspaper , which had accompanied the former California governor on a tour of the neighbourhood .
Another local muscleman , Nathanial Moon , was more blunt and told the newspaper 's reporter the development was "" the ultimate revenge of the nerds .
The greatest way of getting back at all the guys that stuffed people from Google into lockers in high school and stole all their prom dates .
"" But there are other concerns beyond just what might or might not happen to Gold 's .
The hippies , hobos , penniless artists and small business owners peddling beads , bongs and bohemia might have their say too .
Like many former gritty areas of America 's big cities â€ “ such as New York 's East Village â€
“ Venice has already been subject to a wave of gentrification .
Drug dealers are a less common sight on city streets following a police crackdown and a stretch of one of its formerly rundown streets â€ “ Abbot Kinney Boulevard â€ “ was recently named one of the coolest blocks in America by GQ Magazine .
Celebrities , such as actors Robert Downey Jnr and director Jon Favreau , have bought buildings in the neighbourhood .
Lindsay Lohan lives there , although the hard - living star might seem to her many detractors like an example of old Venice Beach partying rather than a leap upmarket .
An ad agency owned by basketball star Kobe Bryant has also just moved to the area .
It also now boasts a Whole Foods store and some expensive fashion boutiques .
That has raised the concern that the area is becoming a little like nearby Santa Monica , which is now solidly gentrified .
Chris Matyszczyk , a columnist at tech website C - Net , said that would be a shame .
Venice is known the world over for its beach boardwalk populated by burnouts , skateboarders and hippies .
The movement of Google and other tech firms into the neighbourhood is likely to push up house prices and rentals and see its genuinely seedy vibe replaced by something a little more sanitised .
"" It is inevitable they will change the culture of the place .
But we need our seedy parts of the world , "" he said .
Yet Google has played its cards well , perhaps hoping to avoid the experience of trendy frozen yoghurt maker
Pinkberry , which ended up being boycotted by residents .
Instead it moved into the area only after a public meeting .
It also moved into a renowned Frank Gehry building which boasts a statue shaped like a giant pair of looking glasses outside its front lobby , perhaps lending the Google geeks a bit of cool street credit .
"" They have been smart about it .
They moved into a great building and are helping to regenerate a crappy part of town , "" said Matyszczyk ."
"As a curtain - raiser to the new version of Total Recall starring Colin Farrell coming out later this year , here 's a rerelease of Paul Verhoeven 's sci - fi action picture from 1990 , based on the Philip K Dick short story We Can Remember It for You Wholesale .
In a distant future where interplanetary travel is commonplace , construction worker Douglas Quaid ( Arnold Schwarzenegger ) pines for a trip to Mars , but his wife Lori ( Sharon Stone ) is n't interested .
So instead he goes to a mysterious neurosurgery company that promises to implant a vivid memory of a glorious trip to Mars in his mind at a fraction of the real - world price .
It all goes horribly wrong .
This wildly successful movie laid the foundations for The Matrix and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , though time has not been kind to the pre - CGI future - world sets , and occasionally there 's a bit of a Lew Grade look to the whole thing .
Never mind .
It 's still a guilty pleasure â€ “ though the guilt quotient is a bit higher â€ “ and that 's down to the still - extraordinary presence of the massively gym - built Arnold who somehow does n't date : still postmodern and post - Earthling after all these years ."
"Ahead of a remake out next month , a reissue for Paul Verhoeven 's 1990 sci - fi classic , with Arnold Schwarzenegger trying to remember why he 's on Mars .
It 's still a remarkable film , gloriously ropey in places ( those taxi cabs are like something out of Woody Allen 's Sleeper ) yet brilliant in others , with its synth score and lines such as : "" If I 'm not me , then who am I ?
"" It 's a blockbuster from another era , when a big idea , rather than a pair of 3D goggles , gave the film its extra dimension ."
"The original film was one of the highest grossing movies of 1990 and a moderate hit with the critics .
Twenty two years on it has only grown in stature and is seen as one of the best films in the careers of both director Paul Verhoeven and star Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Unfortunately the same can not be said for the newly released remake of Total Recall , which has been rubbished by US reviewers and looks set to open poorly this weekend at the box office .
Starring Colin Farrell in the role of Douglas Quaid made famous by Schwarzenegger , and with Underworld director Len Wiseman in the hot seat , the new version has been described as "" bland , bloodless and humourless "" and "" another remake that did n't need to be made "" by reviewers .
Criticism was also directed at a perceived lack of logic in the storyline , which like the original is sourced from science fiction guru Philip K Dick 's 1966 short story We Can Remember It For You Wholesale . ""
Soulless , bombastic and numbingly repetitive , Total Recall is easy to forget within a few hours of watching , "" writes USA Today 's Claudia Puig .
"" Verhoeven 's R - rated original involved Martians facing off against those who held them in tyranny .
It also engaged in more mystery surrounding what was reality and what was implanted memory .
This humourless PG-13 remake , directed by Len Wiseman ( Underworld ) , is less of a mindbender .
It takes place on a bleakly stylised Earth , with a pair of mega - continents facing off .
Mired in hectic , repetitive - looking special effects , it does n't dazzle as much as look like a big - screen video game . ""
Instead of drawing the audience in , the action scenes merely blur together .
And the intriguing , thoughtful concepts at the story 's core are glossed over .
Total Recall is another remake that did n't need to be made . ""
"" The original Total Recall was built from bottom to top as a vehicle for certified stars , "" writes the Wall Street Journal 's Joe Morgenstern .
"" Schwarzenegger filled the bill , and then some ; so did Sharon Stone , in the role of the wife .
Audiences cared about them going in , and the movie capitalised on their presence with sexy riffs , smart jokes ( including some crude but shrewd ones about Arnold 's physique ) , a few whiffs of silliness , a sprinkling of grace notes to punctuate the thundering action .
The remake has no grace notes , or grace , no nuance , no humanity , no character quirks , no surprises in the dialogue and no humour . ""
"" As directed by Len Wiseman from a screenplay and screen story credited to five different writers , this Total Recall plays more like a pop - culture mashup , "" complains the LA Times ' Kenneth Turan .
"" It adds elements from Blade Runner and Inception ( as well as a dash of The Bourne Identity ) to the Recall cosmos and takes off like a shot .
The fun is fun while it lasts , it just does n't last long enough .
"" Its relentless action and its ' is it live or is it Memorex ' concerns about what is real and what is not eventually wear you out .
After too many hard - to - follow chases out windows and doors and up and down ultramodern elevator shafts , after too many people saying things like ' this is going to sound crazy , ' ' Jesus Christ , it 's hard to believe ' and ' you 've got to be kidding me , ' our systems end up on overload .
And there is nothing very futuristic â€ “ or entertaining â€ “ about that . ""
The film currently maintains a 30 % "" rotten "" rating on the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes , but does have the odd advocate .
"" As much as the inner fanboy in me wanted to say that they should have never remade Total Recall , the openminded critic in me found plenty to like here , "" admits Austin Kennedy of Sin Magazine .
"" It did take me about 15 - 20 minutes to get into it at first .
But once Kate Beckinsale starts kicking Farrell 's ass , the pace picks up at a relentless speed and barely slows down until the end .
The best thing about this movie is that it has great action set pieces .
There are three or four really awesome chases . ""
Perhaps even more gallingly for studio Columbia , which has put up a $ 125 m budget for the remake , Total Recall 2012 looks set to open with a relatively meagre $ 25 m to $ 30 m at the US box office , behind superhero blockbuster
The Dark Knight Rises despite the latter being in its third week in cinemas .
The original film also made $ 25 m on debut , but cost less than half of its successor 's budget .
Total Recall opens in the UK on 29 August ."
""
"Audiences clearly have a taste for Lionsgate 's action masala The Expendables 2 , which contained enough spice to stay atop the US charts for the second consecutive weekend .
I said last week that the sight of Sly Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger shooting holes in the landscape after all these years says all you need to know about the dearth of marketable A - list action heroes today , but you 've got to hand it to them
â€ “
it appears the old dogs can still entertain .
Good to see Universal 's fourth Bourne thriller taking strides towards the $ 100 m mark .
Jeremy Renner has fitted into the franchise seamlessly with his quiet intensity and superior acting chops and The Bourne Legacy should pass the milestone by next weekend , which will be its fourth in release .
ParaNorman has grossed $ 28.3 m after two weekends .
It 's a flawed gem
but I doubt it has enough in the tank to overtake Coraline , the earlier film from Laika Entertainment that Focus Features also distributed .
Coraline finished on $ 75 m and was something of a phenomenon because of its artistry and story subject .
The artistry is still on show in ParaNorman â€ “ Laika is a brilliant stop - motion factory â€ “ but audiences have n't responded to the I - see - dead - people theme as enthusiastically as its backers would have hoped .
ParaNorman 's narrative lags in places and the finale is way too intense for young children .
It ranks alongside the incinerator sequence in Toy Story 3 for inappropriate scares and would lend itself to a live - action remake in the vein of Carrie .
Speaking of which , MGM and Sony 's Carrie remake starring Chloe Moretz opens next year .
The big story of the weekend was the rise of 2016 : Obama 's America .
The conservative documentary surged from number 13 to number eight in its seventh weekend in release and added $ 6.2 m to reach just over $ 9 m .
That 's great going for a political doc .
Admittedly the numbers are not in the Michael Moore league but he is a phenomenon and a $ 9m - plus gross is nothing to sniff at .
Distributor Rocky Mountain Pictures staged a smart , targeted campaign that drew political sympathisers to screening venues .
The distributor - for - hire has released plenty of movies in recent years such as An Inconsistent Truth , which rebutted some of the arguments in Al Gore 's acclaimed global warming essay An Inconvenient Truth , and the intelligent design polemic Expelled :
No Intelligence Allowed .
Off - piste distributors like Rocky Mountain have been springing up a dime a dozen in recent years to help smaller movies make a splash at the increasingly crowded box office .
Open Road is an example of a larger company doing just this : the distributor is a joint venture between the two leading domestic theatre chains AMC and Regal ( the former is being acquired by Chinese conglomerate Dailan Wanda ) and has had some success this year with The Grey ; not so much with Killer Elite .
Open Road opened the action comedy Hit And Run in 10th place at the weekend
and it 's taken $ 5.9 m in its first five days .
While this is n't the best result in the world , much of the production costs will have been covered by international pre - sales through a company called Exclusive Media International co - run by the veteran British producer Nigel Sinclair .
Pre - sales are the primary financing mechanism for the independent space and give a movie such as this a shot at a US theatrical release .

"Like most profoundly unfunny people , Arnold Schwarzenegger is very proud of his sense of humour .
Hardly a page goes by in Total Recall , his whopping 650-page memoir , without a reference to some sticky situation he got out of through cunning use of deadpan or a passing zinger â€ “ for example , when he debated Arianna Huffington during the 2003 California gubernatorial race : "" If she got overly dramatic , I could say , ' I know you 're Greek ' or ' Switch to decaf . '
"" The other thing you learn from Arnie 's book is that everything in life has a bodybuilding analogy .
Once in office , losing a dispute with the labor unions was like "" losing to Frank Zane in Miami [ Mr Universe , 1968 ] when I first came to America . ""
Bonnie Garcia , the state legislator he got into trouble with for referring to as "" very hot "" because of her "" black and Latino blood "" , reminded Arnie of "" Sergio Oliva , the Cuban weightlifting champion I battled for the Mr Olympia title back in the 1970s .
"" I 'm sure Ms Garcia was thrilled by this news .
There are many , many more delights in the book , particularly if you imagine them being read aloud to you by Schwarzenegger .
Here are 15 of the best : 1 .
As a boy in rural Austria , Arnie was given a Hitler storybook , depicting the triumphs of the Third Reich , with space for a child to stick in his own pictures , and which was one day quietly removed from the house .
When he asked his mother what happened to it , "" All she would say was , ' We had to give it up . '
"" 2 .
Arnie was so obsessed with coming to America , he tried translating his name into English , but it did n't really work . ""
Black corner "" was the nearest he got , although "" ' black plowman ' , "" he writes , "" would be closer . ""
In his first film , a B movie called Hercules , producers suggested he be billed as Arnold Strong , since no one could pronounce Schwarzenegger and it was too long for the movie poster .
His accent was so thick they dubbed over him .
3 .
At 18 years old , Arnie had 19-inch biceps and built a bodybuilding routine to put Zoolander to shame .
"" I started to see how I could choreograph my moves and ride the melody like a wave â€ “ quiet moments for a concentrated , beautiful three - quarter back pose , flowing into a side chest pose as the music rose and then â€ “ wham !
â€ “ a stunning most - muscular pose at the crescendo . ""
4 .
This is an actual sentence in the book : "" Finally , I smiled and hit my double - biceps pose , one of my best .
That brought a roar from the crowd .
Sergio answered with his trademark two - arm overhead victory pose .
Again , the crowd went nuts , chanting ' Sergio !
Sergio ! '
I executed a chest pose , which he started to match but then thought better of it , shifting to a ' most - muscular ' shot .
More screams for Sergio .
I did my best trademark pose â€ “
the three - quarters back â€ “
but that was n't enough to turn it .
"" 5 .
He thinks Nixon was a great guy and a fabulous president , if you overlook Watergate .
6 .
In his early 20s , Arnie put down every last cent he made as a bricklayer and from his mail order fitness pamphlets , on a six - family block in LA that became the foundation of a multimillion - dollar real estate empire .
( The building cost $ 215,000 .
He put down $ 27,000 , borrowed another $ 10,000 from a friend , and took out a mortgage on the rest .
He quadrupled his money in three years .
Within 10 years , he was in position to buy an entire city block in Santa Monica : $ 7 m for 39,000 square - feet .
For any of you with lingering doubt : he 's not a dummy . )
7 .
When Arnie was in his 20s , his father would still return letters he had written to him with spelling mistakes marked up and corrected .
8 .
After meeting a 21-year - old Maria Shriver at a celebrity tennis tournament , the first words Arnie said to Eunice Kennedy Shriver , her mother , were : "" Your daughter has a great ass . ""
( Eunice replied , "" That 's very nice . "" )
As Arnie says , meeting these kind of people could have been intimidating , but luckily , he had "" the kind of personality that put people at ease "" .
9 .
Arnie thought Shriver was beautiful , brilliant and an amazing catch .
Or as he phrases it , "" The fling with Brigitte Nielsen underlined what I already knew : I wanted Maria to be my wife . ""
10 .
Arnie despairs of most artists ' crapness with money and rightly points out that : "" Picasso would go into a restaurant and do a drawing or paint a plate for a meal .
Now you go to these restaurants in Madrid , and the Picassos are hanging on the walls , worth millions of dollars .
That was n't going to happen to my movies .
"" 11 .
This is an actual sentence in the book : "" I was mad as hell because I felt that every one of the killings in Conan [ the Barbarian ] was well shot and extraordinary .
So what if the first thing you see is Thulsa Doom raiding Conan 's boyhood village and that his mother 's head goes flying through the air ? ""
12 .
It is a very , very long wait for the first reference to Mildred the housekeeper .
Arnie summarises his affair and the birth of his love - child thus : "" Mildred had been working in our household for five years , and all of sudden , we were alone in the guest house .
When Mildred gave birth the following August , she named the baby Joseph and listed her husband as the father .
That is what I wanted to believe and what I did believe for years . ""
13 .
He presents his reticence on the matter as an extension of his devotion to public service : "" At the time I found out for sure that Joseph was my son , I did n't want the situation to affect my ability to govern effectively .
"" 14 .
He is sorry and would like to get back together with Maria .
15 .
This is an actual sentence in the book : "" Maria and I are very different in that way .
She grew up in a world where a sharp line was drawn between friends and the help .
With me , there is almost no line . """
"Oho !
What gift is this from the celebrity gods , floating down on to the Lost in Showbiz desk ?
Why , it 's Arnold Schwarzenegger 's 650-page autobiography , Total Recall â€
“
My Unbelievably True Life Story .
While LiS is dismayed to lose its long - running bet that the title would be
I Told You
I 'd Be Back â€
“
And I Am ! ,
the subtitle does provide consolations with its pleasing similarity to Gary Shteyngart 's tale of a plucky immigrant in America , Super Sad True Love Story , but Arnified .
Thank you , celebrity gods !
Tools down , everyone
â€ “
it 's a Lost in Showbiz book group special .
The first thing to say is that this is not a celebrity autobiography .
Trust me , I have a degree in celebrity autobiographies from TMZ.com University , and this is not a contribution to that noble genre .
No , what Arnie ( anyone who suffered the film Junior has earned the right to such familiarity ) has done is write a political autobiography , which is a very different beast .
A celebrity autobiography drips with gossip and humility , with the subject detailing at length their failings only then to end on a note of happy redemption and rehab , with positivity about the future A political autobiography is generally a cut - and - paste job from old newspaper articles detailing what the politician was doing on this date or that , while the subject constantly tells the reader how he was in the right about certain decisions and everyone else in the wrong , and it all ends somewhat elegiacally with the politician now out of office .
That , to no one 's gratitude , is precisely what Arnie has produced , with his exhortations about how Predator 2 would have been a success if only the director had listened to him , and other important issues .
He then is forced to end his "" immigrant made great "" saga on the somewhat less than triumphal note of his wife leaving him after he boffed the maid and fathered her child .
Living the American dream !
Sure , there might be more references in Arnie 's book to calf - sculpting exercises , "" hot affairs "" and Planet Hollywood than you probably get in , say , Robert Caro 's The Passage of Power , the much - lauded recent biography of Lyndon Johnson ( although maybe not that many more than in Bill Clinton 's My Life ) .
But ultimately , this is very much a political as opposed to celebrity autobiography , which is an interesting choice from a man who is one of the most iconic actors of the modern era and was one of the worst state governors in history .
But despite his adherence to the more self - validating form , Arnie can not help but come across as a reassuringly repulsive individual .
Even aside from his constant cataloguing of his financial earnings and his unGuardian politics ( "" Taking the [ Watergate scandal ] out of the equation , I admired Richard Nixon and thought he was a terrific president "" ) , it 's the way this condom stuffed with walnuts ( copyright : Clive James ) just radiates with self - love and a near sociopathic lack of interest in others that really sticks in the mind .
Let us return to the aforementioned boffing and flip to the index .
But there , just beneath "" Back - end , Arnold 's , 362 - 63 , 374 "" is not , as one might expect , "" Baena , Mildred "" , the name of the mother of his non - Kennedy child , but Ban Ki - moon and Antonio Banderas .
Instead , Mildred is dispatchfully dealt with as barely a sidenote in the final chapter : "" Mildred had been working in our household for five years and all of a sudden we were alone in the guest house .
When Mildred gave birth the following August , she named the baby Joseph .
"" As narrative ellipses go , it 's not quite up there with "" Reader , I married him "" , but it nips at Charlotte Bronte 's heels .
There is a similarly intriguing literary gap in what Schwarzenegger refers to as "" allegations of bad behaviour on my part "" , specifically , the LA Times ' 2003 article headlined , "" Women say Schwarzenegger Groped , Humiliated Them "" .
Arnie 's explanation is that while "" none of the groping accusations are true "" he had "" behaved badly sometimes "" and he makes a vague reference to "" rowdy sets "" .
Ditto his "" hot affair "" with Brigitte Nielsen while he and Maria Shriver were about to get engaged .
Arnie reassures readers that the fling "" underlined what I already knew : that I wanted Maria to be my wife "" .
Whether the affair made Shriver feel the same way is not elucidated .
Nothing brings our Arnold more pleasure than himself , especially when he says "" outrageous things "" .
One of these outrageous things is when he meets Shriver 's parents , and , by way of introduction , Arnie says to the rather wonderful Sargent Shriver and Eunice Kennedy Shriver : "" Your daughter has a great ass . ""
( Kennedy Shriver , possibly not understanding Arnie 's accent , replies : ""
That 's very nice . "" )
Incidentally , this book contains the following sentences : "" I became the proud owner of the world 's first civilian Humvee "" ; and "" The idea of buying a Boeing 747 snuck up on us slowly . ""
It also contains the creepiest family photo
I think I have ever seen featuring Arnie and his two young sons using a public urinal while Arnie stares intently at his sons ' urination activity .
Who would take such a photo ?
And why would you put it in a book ?
Yet more unanswered questions with which we 'll all have to live .
From David Niven to Danniella Westbrook , from Nina Simone to Nikki Sixx : when it comes to celebrity autobiographies LiS has read them all .
But never have we finished one disliking the author as much as we ended up disliking Schwarzenegger .
So congratulations , Arnie !
You win the laurel of LiS 's most unpleasant , creepiest celebrity autobiography ever !"
"Sometimes even the most liberal among us need a dose of old - fashioned machismo .
It 's why that sexist , arrogant "" blunt instrument "" of the British secret service , James Bond , is still popular 50 years after his first cinematic adventure , why hearts leap whenever furrow - browed vigilante Batman takes out the bad guys the cops ca n't touch , and why Conan the Barbarian is still popular more than 80 years after pulp writer Robert E Howard first created the musclebound Cimmerian barbarian .
But while 007 and the Dark Knight have seen more than their fair share of decent celluloid adventures , Conan has been poorly treated on the big screen .
Of the three movies to star the character , only John Milius 's majestic Conan the Barbarian from 1982 is worthy of the name .
And that 's why today 's news that Hollywood is planning a direct sequel
â€ “ restoring Arnold Schwarzenegger , no less , to the role which made him famous â€
“ is so inspiring .
Reportedly the inspiration for John Goodman 's unhinged Walter Sobchak in the Coen brothers ' The Big Lebowski , Milius once told a Guardian interviewer that he would like to feed progressively minded movie producer Harvey Weinstein to the Taliban .
Nevertheless , he was exactly the right guy to shoot a Conan movie .
Milius 's take , which he mostly wrote himself after excising almost all of Oliver Stone 's original screenplay , posits the barbarian as the ultimate self - made man , the epitome of rightwing libertarianism .
First seen as a small , orphaned child sold into slavery , Conan literally carves himself out of granite in front of our eyes , progressing from human power station ( via the famous wheel of pain scene ) to pit fighter and on to free thief and adventurer as the film progresses .
With Schwarzenegger in a career - defining role ( despite apparently having to repeat his lines up to 40 times or more due to his Austrian accent ) and a supporting cast that also included the great Max von Sydow and Japanese - American actor Mako Iwamatsu as wizard Akiro , Conan the Barbarian is an epic , yet strangely minimalist masterpiece .
Few words are spoken throughout but those which are uttered have the utmost potency , largely because Milius purloined speeches almost wholesale from Friedrich Nietzsche ( "" that which does not kill us makes us stronger "" in the film 's opening ) and Genghis Khan .
When Conan is asked what is good in life , he paraphrases the latter : "" To crush your enemies , see them driven before you , and to hear the lamentations of their women . ""
The new film is being put together by a team which at first glance does not have half of Milius 's pedigree ( the latter also wrote iconic lines such as "" Do I feel lucky ?
Well , do you punk ? "" for Dirty Harry
and "" I love the smell of napalm in the morning "" for Apocalypse Now . )
Producer Chris Morgan , who may well write the screenplay , has been involved in the last four Fast and Furious movies , which , while decent enough action flicks are hardly cult classics of the calibre of Conan the Barbarian .
Nevertheless , he and co - producer Fredrik Malmberg are making all the right noises about the new project .
"" The original ended with Arnold on the throne as a seasoned warrior , and this is the take of the film we will make , "" Malmberg told Deadline .
"" It 's that Nordic Viking mythic guy who has played the role of king , warrior , soldier and mercenary , and who has bedded more women than anyone , nearing the last cycle of his life .
He knows he 'll be going to Valhalla , and wants to go out with a good battle . ""
"" After the original seminal movie , all that came after looked silly to me , "" Morgan added . ""
Robert E Howard 's mythology and some great philosophy from Nietzsche to Atilla the Hun was layered in the original film .
People say he did n't speak for the first 20 minutes of the film , but that was calculated in depicting this man who takes control of life with his own hand .
This movie picks up Conan where Arnold is now in his life , and we will be able to use the fact that he has aged in this story .
I love the property of Conan so much that I would n't touch it unless we came up with something worthy .
We think this is a worthy successor to the original film .
Think of this as Conan 's Unforgiven . ""
All of which sounds suitably tantalising .
But will the new film successfully excise memories of cheesy 1984 sequel Conan the Destroyer , a hokey quest movie featuring Arnie alongside Grace Jones and Andre the Giant which eschewed the violence and mysticism of the original in favour of a more family - friendly approach , and the recent misfiring Jason Momoa - fronted reboot ?
We 'll find out in 2014 , when the film is due to hit cinemas .
One thing 's certain : if Arnie must return to acting , I 'd much rather see him playing Conan again in a role which makes use of his age than turning up in cheap tributes to 80s action films that were never all that great in the first place , or desperately trying to pull on that knackered old T-800 outfit one last time .
Returning to the role that made him a star feels like the right way to bid a last hurrah to an iconic screen presence without resorting to cheap theatrics .
Now all the producers need to do is pull Milius ( who has n't directed a cinematically released feature in 20 years and sees his fall from the grace as part of a leftwing Hollywood conspiracy ) off the firing range and give him a say in the movie .
Failing that , I hear Clint Eastwood is having issues with casting his musical take on A Star is Born .
Schwarzenegger directed by the ultimate macho movie hero would represent a fine farewell for both of them ."
"RZA is to follow his directing debut
The Man with the Iron Fists with a biopic of the Mongol emperor Genghis Khan , according to the Hollywood Reporter .
The rapper , producer and actor will be working from a screenplay by John Milius , the writer and director of 1982 fantasy epic Conan the Barbarian ( starring Arnold Schwarzenegger ) , who is also known for his work on Apocalypse Now and Dirty Harry .
Milius , a colourful Hollywood character who was the inspiration for John Goodman 's unhinged Vietnam veteran Walter Sobchak in the Coen brothers ' The Big Lebowski , has been trying to get the project off the ground for several years and was at one point lined up to direct .
Khan 's empire lasted a century and a half and eventually covered nearly a quarter of the Earth .
His Mongol armies were responsible for the massacre of as many as 40 million people , and his name remains a byword for brutality and terror .
Milius 's screenplay reportedly tells the story from the point of view of the emperor 's son and grandson .
The film is due to shoot in China next year .
RZA , who rose to fame in the 90s as the leader of hip - hop outfit Wu - Tang Clan , has moved into film - making via score writing and acting .
The Man with the Iron Fists , on which he also makes his screenwriting debut ( working with co - writer Eli Roth ) , is a martial arts film set in 19th - century China .
RZA also stars , along with Russell Crowe , Cung Le , Lucy Liu , Byron Mann , Rick Yune , David Bautista , and Jamie Chung .
The movie is due in cinemas in the US this weekend and arrives in the UK on 7 December .
As well as the long - gestating Genghis Khan epic , RZA is also tipped to direct action thriller
No Man 's Land , described as influenced by cult 1979 film The Warriors .
The screenplay by Trey Ellis and David Klass takes place over one night and centres on a man who steals a powerful criminal 's diamond that "" proves to be far more valuable than initially thought "" .
The story of Khan was notably brought to the big screen in the critically acclaimed Mongol : The Rise to power of Genghis Khan in 2007 .
Another version is the 1956 Dick Powell epic The Conqueror , starring a famously miscast John Wayne as the warrior chieftain ."
"The sleep of reason breeds monsters , and one of the most alarming creatures dreamed up by our irrational culture is the stogy - puffing bogey Arnold Schwarzenegger .
He is the spirit of the age made flesh , and his careers as athlete , actor and politician have dramatised its most disturbing paradoxes â€ “ the showdown between technology and human nature , the reduction of art to self - marketing , the transformation of government into a branch of showbiz .
His surname , translated , means "" black corner "" : he is the dead end at which the evolution of our species and the development of our society have abruptly arrived .
Arnie 's very existence is a vindication of the Third Reich 's values .
Born in 1947 in defeated Austria , he is , as he once admitted , an unrepentant admirer of Hitler 's oratory , and while still a teenager â€ “ after experimentally crashing some tanks during his military service , fine preparation for his later Hollywood stunts â€ “
he devised his own way of prosecuting the FÃ¼hrer 's campaign of conquest .
His body would be his weapon of war : he lifted weights until he had "" deltoids like cannonballs "" and "" a chest like a fortress "" .
"" I aimed to be a leader some day , "" he balefully growls , and he became one when he won the Mr Universe championship . ""
Just get out of the fucking way , "" he warned the puny pretenders who dared to challenge him .
He is frank about his fantasy in this unashamed book , which is an epic of the revved - up ego : "" I pictured myself high up on the pedestal , trophy in hand .
Everyone else would be standing below .
And I would look down . ""
Could the eloquent Adolf have put it better ?
Arnie 's agenda extended that of the Panzer divisions that trampled Europe .
"" I planned , "" he announced after recruiting a few foreigners to the Munich gym where he trained , "" to go global with everything that I wanted to do .
"" Here was the unimpeded triumph of the will .
In fact the idea of will â€ “ the ruthless energy that makes him compare himself to a locomotive â€ “ is so important to Arnie that when filming The Terminator he initially refused to contract that sacred word .
Tone - deaf and still inept in English , he refused to utter the Terminator 's threat "" I 'll be back "" and instead insisted on saying "" I will be back "" .
It sounded more rugged , he told James Cameron ; "" I 'll "" surely had to be effeminate .
Cameron managed to persuade him that an apostrophe was no threat to his virility .
Little Austria could n't contain Arnie for long .
"" America , "" he decided while still at school , "" was the most powerful country , so I would go there . ""
He imagined it as a facsimile of his bulging , steroid - boosted physique : "" For me , America meant one thing â€ “ size . ""
In skittish moods , he likes to think that his mother might have been impregnated by a GI from the occupying army after the war : then he 'd be a native - born American , and could run for the presidency .
We can only hope that Frau Schwarzenegger did not allow herself to be Americanised in the back of a jeep .
As soon as Arnie hit the ground , he set about purchasing swathes of his new homeland .
His goals included finding "" an apartment building to buy and move into "" .
Note the order of business : you can hardly imagine him modestly renting a room .
Next he bought a portion of desert outside LA , the site for a projected supersonic airport that was â€ “ like Arnie himself
â€ “
"" monstrous , very futuristic , exactly what I imagined America was about "" .
Then came cinematic stardom .
Arnie advanced from Conan the Barbarian to The Terminator , in which he was typecast as a machine : like the United States itself , he went straight from barbarism to decadence , overleaping the intermediate stage known as civilisation .
Power in our culture depends on imagery and publicity , so political office almost automatically followed .
The first President Bush made Arnie , as he puts it with his usual absolutism , a "" fitness czar "" .
This latter - day Romanov would never be unseated by a red revolution : his mantra , on and off screen , is "" Fucking communists , I despise them "" .
When California elected him its Governator , he understood this to be just another acting role .
The blissed - out citizens of the Golden State could have done worse , of course : attempts were made to convince Mel Gibson to run against him in the 2006 Republican primary .
Arnie 's political philosophy was crassly testicular . ""
Change , "" he declared , "" takes big balls , "" and he grafted those organs on to women he approved of : among the "" ballsy people "" on his gubernatorial staff was "" a small , tough , blonde , cigar - smoking lesbian "" .
A little more incongruously , he remarks about his wife : "" One side of Maria was ballsy . ""
Apparently she had an eggy side as well , since their marriage produced four children , supplemented by an extra son who was mothered by a housekeeper .
Clive James once famously said that the bodybuilding Arnie looked like a condom stuffed with walnuts ; when he and his employee Mildred coincided in a guesthouse attached to the marital mansion , the condom apparently split and what leaked out was a peanut - sized replica of the Impregnator .
Arnie has put the embarrassment behind him .
"" I have to keep moving forward , "" he says : he 's a locomotive , remember .
He takes pride in his automated efficiency , boasting that once at Cannes he gave 40 TV interviews and 54 print interviews â€ “ all of them , I bet , exactly the same â€ “ in a single day .
Or is he , despite his steely post - human implacability , actually one of the "" subhuman thugs "" who maraud through Conan ?
While making Terminator 2 , he often questioned Cameron about the existential status of the character he was playing : "" Is he too human now , or not human enough ? ""
It 's what I asked myself after finishing this book , which is self - obsessed without being self - aware .
I decided that Arnie 's megalomania must be superhuman , since his memoir contains no trace of the apologetic irony that redeems some of his films .
He is , notwithstanding the efforts of a "" coauthor "" implausibly named Peter Petre , a machine without a ghost inside him ."
"The Running Man was , for me , one of those books you read after you 've seen the movie .
I knew that it was a Stephen King novel ; it was the last of the compiled Bachman Books I owned ( though not the last to be written by the Bachman persona ; there were still three more to be published â€ “ four if you count Misery ) , the only one I had n't read yet .
I watched the movie , because the TV movie of It was ( to my adolescent self ) incredible , and I had seen The Shining and that was incredible , and this had Arnold Schwarzenegger in it and I loved Predatorâ€
¦
It was a series of things that led to me watching the film first , and then reading the book .
And that was a curious experience for me .
First published in 1982 under the Bachman pseudonym , The Running Man is a particularly SFish dystopian novel about a future where America is run by a totalitarian government , and television game shows are bloody and omnipresent .
Essentially , it 's The Hunger Games .
King wrote it in a week ( in fact , 72 hours , apparently ) and it was pretty much published as a first draft .
Nowadays , the film is far more famous than the book ; an action classic , of sorts .
It 's full of fight scenes and statements about the nature of television ; of sitting down and watching while atrocities occur ; of a quasi - plausible future .
Fourteen - year - old me did n't really care about that .
I cared , back then , that Arnie was the main character , and he kicked all sorts of ass .
He quipped while killing the bad guys ( "" What a pain in the neck ! "" when beheading somebody ; "" He had to split ! "" when cutting somebody in half ; "" He was Subzero , now he 's just plain zero ! "" when killing a man whose gimmick is ice - related ) !
He smoked an endless run of cigars !
He fought for the rights of the common people !
He won the love of a woman by being really , really masculine ( in a way that , now , is actually a little bit creepy ) .
He brought down the entire government / evil TV company that framed him for murder !
The film was a masterpiece of 1980s idiocy , and I totally loved it .
The book , though â€ ¦
Where was the quipping ?
Where was the fun ?
The plot was completely different , too .
For a start , Ben Richards ( and , in hindsight , I should have seen what a terrible name for an Arnie character that is ) has a dying child who needs medicine , and a wife who has had to take to prostitution in order to provide for the family .
He 's a weak man , physically and emotionally , and desperate .
He 's not framed for killing protesters because he 's a soldier : he 's a man who is willing to do anything for his family .
Over the course of the novel , the game show aspect of the movie is n't the prominent thing , unlike the neon of the filmed counterpart : instead , there 's a bleakness , a sadness at the state of the world .
And the ending ?
Well , it 's quite the kicker .
( Spoiler follows ! )
After discovering that his wife and child have been killed by the television company , Ben hijacks a plane and crashes it into their skyscraper .
Quite aside from the chilling visuals that provides us with nowadays , it 's a horrifying end to the novel : there 's no hope there , not really .
It 's not as if Ben saves the day and the world and frees the people from the tyranny of the awful television state they now live in ; instead he 's driven ( as in most of these early Bachman Books ) by personal rage , deep inner pain , "" his black eyes burning like the eyes of a demon "" .
Ben is a mouthpiece for King 's own views about where society could be heading ; he 's got something to say , and it 's said through his pain .
But when I was younger , of course , this was n't what I wanted .
I did n't want moaning and suffering and politics ; I wanted the quips .
The film set my expectations , and the novel failed to meet them .
With The Shining , it was different : I read the book first , and saw the film as an adaptation .
Same with It .
But I came to this the other way , and to some extent treated the King original as a novelisation .
That is n't a slur ; I read a lot of novelisations when I was a kid , in lieu of seeing the films ( with Alien , pretty much my favourite film of all time , I 'd read the Alan Dean Foster novelisation and the Simonson / Goodwin comic before I ever saw the film ) .
This time , I read the book and much preferred it .
Maybe I 'm more attuned to the sadness now ; maybe I 'm better with the weaker Ben Richards , the desperation that makes him enter the competition .
It 's decently written : not King 's best , but not his worst .
The structure is interesting too , echoing his other dystopian game show novel of the period , The Long Walk .
Where that novel counted down the boys left alive as part of the text , here the short chapters are on constant countdown , starting at 101 .
You know when the book is going to end : the timer tells you .
It 's a pacey device , and one that serves the game - show content of the novel , and this is a good book ; mid - tier King .
After I 'd read it , I thought it only fair that I also revisit the film .
I had n't seen it since I first watched it :
like so many films of the time , it was eminently disposable ; fun , but the sort of film you rented rather than owned .
Rewatching it was odd .
Turns out it 's awful .
Totally dreadful : lumbering and badly made ; full of terrible acting , terrible quips ( "" What a pain in the neck ! ""
etc ) , terrible everything .
There 's very little to love ; the best thing about it is the John ' St Elmo 's Fire ' Parr theme song .
The things that it 's shouting about â€ “ television , oppression â€ “ are little more than meaningless bellows .
The book has action , but it also has a point ; it has pathos , where the film is all comic - action bluster .
And Arnie should never have been cast as Ben Richards .
He was always meant to be weak , driven , desperate ; and he was always meant to have something to say .
Next : We discover that there are other worlds than these : it 's The Gunslinger , the first book in King 's Dark Tower series ."

Click here to watch Until now , Arnold Schwarzenegger 's journey back towards movie stardom has been tentative to say the least .
His appearance in The Expendables 2 basically amounted to him listing all of his catchphrases in chronological order like a sad circus bear .
Then he spent the rest of the summer fruitlessly trying to develop a kind of monstrous Laurel and Hardy - style double act with Boris Johnson .
If anything , that was worse .
But now , finally , Schwarzenegger is ready to take on Hollywood again .
His fully fledged comeback vehicle , The Last Stand , is released next month .
But what 'll it be like ?
Will Arnie be back to his best ?
He 's 65 years old and looks like a scrotum full of walnuts , but can he still take down swarms and swarms of baddies all by himself ?
Will it at least be better than The 6th Day ?
The newest trailer for The Last Stand attempts to answer all these questions and more in exactly 60 seconds .
Let 's see how successful it is .
Great news â€ “
it 's business as usual .
A bunch of maniacs are making a crazed dash for the Mexican border , while apparently firing as many automatic weapons as they can .
If this were real life , it would be the silliest episode of Police Camera Action ever .
But this is an Arnold Schwarzenegger film , so it 's probably the most subtle call to action anyone could think of .
Only one man can stop these lunatics .
It 's ...
Forest Whitaker in a suit ?
What ?
That 's no good .
He 's won awards , for crying out loud .
He 's acclaimed for his nuanced performances .
He 'd better not be in The Last Stand too much .
I do n't know about you , but the last thing I want is loads of ill - advised thoughtfulness stinking up Arnold Schwarzenegger 's wave of pensionable violence .
Oh dear .
This gets worse and worse .
Here 's our first shot of Arnold Schwarzenegger , and he 's holding a telephone .
A telephone , for god 's sake .
It 's the right way up and everything .
I do n't think his character in Collateral Damage even knew what a telephone was .
Maybe he threw one at a baddie 's head during Commando or something , but only as a last resort .
Who wants to see an Arnie film where Arnie has the mental capacity to work basic household items ?
Not me .
Politics has changed you , Schwarzenegger , and not for the better .
Oh , wait , no .
Scrap that .
Schwarzenegger 's sidekick in The Last Stand is Johnny Knoxville .
And he 's wearing a funny hat .
You can breathe a sigh of relief now , everyone .
The phone was a red herring .
Only a colossal idiot would want to be friends with Johnny Knoxville .
Arnie 's back , and he 's just as much of a moron as ever .
Now we 've cleared that up , it 's time to watch Arnie shoot things .
So here you go â€
“ here
he is shooting a handgun while pulling a face like he 's trying to stifle a guff .
And here 's Arnold Schwarzenegger shooting a shotgun while pulling a face like he 's failed to stifle a guff , and he 's followed through , and he 's having to waddle all the way home .
And here 's Arnold Schwarzenegger shooting a ...
hey , that 's not a gun !
It 's a cup of coffee .
What sort of highbrow Little Lord Fauntleroy goes around drinking coffee ?
You suck , Arnold Schwarzenegger .
We did n't watch this trailer to watch you hydrate .
This is the worst film of all time .
I take it all back â€ “ here 's Arnold Schwarzenegger firing a machine gun out of the back of a school bus while Johnny Knoxville gurns and yelps next to him .
The Last Stand is going to be amazing .
You must never leave us again , Arnie ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger has become the latest Hollywood star to dismiss suggestions that violent movies are to blame for gun massacres such as the recent killing of 20 children in Connecticut .
The iconic action star , who is currently promoting his new film The Last Stand , told reporters it was important to "" keep [ the two ] separate "" .
He said : "" [ This is ] entertainment and the other thing is a tragedy beyond belief .
It 's really serious and it 's the real deal . ""
He added : "" We have to analyse how we deal with mental illness , how we deal with gun laws , how we deal with parenting . ""
The 65-year - old actor , for whom The Last Stand is his first lead role since the end of a seven - year stint as governor of California , said the entire situation surrounding the deaths of 20 children and six staff at the Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown , Connecticut last month should be carefully looked at .
"" Everything has to be analysed ; no stone [ left ] unturned , "" he said .
"" How can we do better with gun laws ?
If there are any loopholes , if there 's a problem , let 's analyse it
â€
¦ Are we really dealing with the mental problems the right way as a society ? ""
Schwarzenegger also hinted that the culture surrounding gun enthusiasts might need to change in a reference to Connecticut killer Adam Lanza 's mother Nancy , who was murdered with her own assault weapons . ""
Does a mother need to collect guns and take her little kids shooting ?
"" the actor asked .
The Newtown massacre on 14 December has reignited the US debate over gun control , but opponents of new legislation have refused to accept that easy access to firearms led to the deaths .
In a speech last month , National Rifle Association executive vice president Wayne LaPierre specifically blamed Hollywood films and video games for the heightened culture of gun violence in the US .
Since then , film - makers and actors have found themselves at the centre of an uncomfortable media storm .
Director Quentin Tarantino , who is currently promoting his blood - spattered new spaghetti western homage Django Unchained , last week angrily denied any link between screen violence and real - life killings during a US radio interview . ""
Would I watch a kung fu movie three days after the Sandy Hook massacre ?
Would I watch a kung fu movie ?
Maybe , 'cause they have nothing to do with each other , "" he said .
The Last Stand , the tale of a small - town sheriff ( Schwarzenegger ) tasked with stopping a notorious escaped cartel leader from crossing the border into Mexico , opens on 18 January in the US and a week later in the UK ."
"There may never be another Hollywood film star like Arnold Schwarzenegger .
In the 1980s and 90s the Austrian oak was such a totemic figure on the big screen that screenwriters stopped bothering to explain away his thick Styrian accent and preposterous bulk , aware that audiences accepted him instinctively .
Perhaps the most obvious sign of the former California governor 's slide down the stature scale comes in the denouement of his new action film The Last Stand , which is out today in UK cinemas .
Faced with a sneering villain who has been behaving very badly indeed , Schwarzenegger 's grizzled small - town sheriff tells his enemy : "" You make us immigrants look bad . ""
It raised a laugh at the screening I attended , but 80s writers would n't have needed to flag up Arnie 's alienness .
While Schwarzenegger often played characters with Anglo - Saxon names such as Ben Richards , John Kimble and Julius Benedict , the role that made him famous took advantage of his teutonic tones .
John Milius 's 1982 fantasy epic Conan the Barbarian cast the former Mr Olympia as Robert E Howard 's unstoppable Cimmerian warrior .
Those of us who recall the iconic Schwarzenegger era were delighted earlier this week when he confirmed plans for a new Conan movie in which the actor will star as an older version of the character .
Out goes Game of Thrones ' Jason Momoa , who headed up the poorly received 2011 remake , and back comes the saga 's original lead in a movie that will be built around him . ""
[ Universal ] finally came forward , "" Schwarzenegger told Ai n't It Cool . ""
And said , ' You 're absolutely right .
The previous regime has missed the boat here .
We want to pick it up .
We 're going to buy the rights
and we 're going to be serious about it and make a quality film with an A - director and with A - writers and so on .
And we want you to participate in this .
We want you to star and you to play Conan .
We 're going to take a story where Conan is at that age
so it 's totally believable
and you 're not looking like a 30-year old action guy . '
"" "" The original ended with Arnold on the throne as a seasoned warrior , and this is the take of the film we will make , "" producer Frederik Malmberg told Deadline when Legend of Conan was first announced .
"" It 's that Nordic Viking mythic guy who has played the role of king , warrior , soldier and mercenary , and who has bedded more women than anyone , nearing the last cycle of his life .
He knows he 'll be going to Valhalla , and wants to go out with a good battle . ""

But is the great lunk still up to the job ?
On the evidence of The Last Stand , the jury 's still out .
There is a fatigue in Schwarzenegger 's performance that rather suits the character .
He 's a hard - boiled former cop in a US - Mexico border town who finds himself the only obstacle in the way of an escaped cartel boss .
The movie itself has the sort of low - rent , throwaway veneer you might expect to find in a film starring one of Schwarzenegger 's 80s action contemporaries â€ “ Jean Claude van Damme or Dolph Lundgren , perhaps â€ “ rather than the big man himself .
And Arnie is no longer the towering colossus of old : those years away from the big screen do not seem to have improved him as an actor or as a screen presence .
It 's an entertaining watch in a cheap and cheesy kind of way , but there are moments when you wonder if Schwarzenegger 's heart is really in it .
The Last Stand might have been written for Clint Eastwood , a figure who ( on screen at least ) gets more intense and intimidating the older he gets .
It is this kind of battered determination that Schwarzenegger needs to rediscover if his late era acting career is to bear fruit .
While it 's wonderful to see him back on the big screen , he appears right now like a man who has been shrunk by his travails .
No one wants to see Schwarzenegger appearing in storylines that do not suit his age , but he needs to be given scripts that allow that old cheeky confidence to emerge .
Audiences want to see Arnie the bombastic barbarian again , which ( hopefully ) is where Legend of Conan comes in .
Schwarzenegger is almost as much of a self - made man as the great Cimmerian himself .
He personally recruited Paul Verhoeven for 1990 's Total Recall , perhaps his best film , and set himself up to star .
He may have less clout in Hollywood these days , but I have no doubt that Legend of Conan has a better chance of emerging as a decent movie if its star takes it upon himself to crack a few heads together .
When the film was first announced in October , there were suggestions that producer Chris Morgan , best known for the Fast and Furious films , might write the screenplay .
Morgan hardly constitutes an A - list figure , so Arnie may yet have his work cut out .
Milius is still around , aged 68 , and most likely just waiting for a chance to emerge from Hollywood purgatory .
He also has a ready - made unfilmed screenplay , King Conan :
Crown of Iron , ready to draw on .
Now what a movie that would be ."
"He 's older , a little more craggy and definitely a lot more wrinkled , but Arnold Schwarzenegger is about to stalk across movie screens once more , gun in hand , blasting away at his enemies while muttering monotone catchphrases .
At the age of 65 and via a modern western , Schwarzenegger has embarked on another career shift , taking him back to the action blockbusters that brought him global fame .
This week will see the London premiere of The Last Stand , in which he plays the sheriff of a quiet American town on the border with Mexico .
It is a remarkable twist to an astonishing life story for the Austrian bodybuilder turned actor turned two - time Republican governor of California .
While America is no stranger to actors who become politicians â€ “ such as Ronald Reagan and Fred Thompson â€
“
the idea that one could then go back to being a working Hollywood actor is new .
But that is where Schwarzenegger is headed .
After leaving behind famous roles as Conan the Barbarian and a killer cyborg in the Terminator franchise to become governor of a state with the seventh largest economy in the world , Schwarzenegger has now returned to one - liners , shootouts and car chases .
Or , as some wags have dubbed it , Schwarzenegger has gone from the Terminator to the Governator to emerging in another new role as the Rejuvenator .
His new movie is even a modest hit .
Joe Morganstern , a film critic at the Wall Street Journal , approved of the cinematic comeback of one of the great action heroes of the 1980s .
"" The movie is n't about eloquence , it 's about giving Mr Schwarzenegger a chance to take on new enemies that include advancing age , "" he said .
The film 's marketers seemed to agree .
Billboards for the movie featured Schwarzenegger firing a giant machine gun under the tag line : "" Retirement is for sissies . ""
The plot of The Last Stand is simple enough and gives Schwarzenegger ample opportunity to display his familiar , if somewhat limited , range of acting talents â€ “ a ruthless fugitive bears down on the usually sleepy community , desperate to cross the frontier into freedom .
Only one man can stop him and â€
¦ you can probably guess the rest .
It is directed by Korean Kim Jee - woon , in his first English - language film , and has grabbed a respectable - ish score of 60 % on the film review website Rotten Tomatoes .
But not everyone approves of Schwarzenegger 's refusal to grow old gracefully and away from the spotlight .
Stephanie Zacharek , a film critic at public radio network NPR , did not find the film much fun . ""
By the end , even Schwarzenegger looks worn out .
Maybe being governor was n't such a hard job after all , "" she sniped .
Not that Schwarzenegger is listening to those critics .
Last week he held a question and answer session with the online community website Reddit in which he fielded queries about his comeback .
Schwarzenegger was shameless about pitching himself as available for Hollywood 's hottest directing talent from blockbusters to art - house films .
"" I would like to work with Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg .
Also Sam Raimi would be great to work with , "" he enthused .
That sort of bravado is typical Schwarzenegger .
His life story has been one of unrelenting optimism even in the face of things such as an infidelity scandal that would have derailed the careers of other famous faces .
Observers see his return as him simply doing what he likes to do best .
After all he does not need the money .
Nor does he need the fame . ""
He likes to perform .
He loves being on a movie set , "" said Noah Levy , senior news editor at In Touch Weekly magazine .
But does he really have an action movie future ahead of him ?
Levy is not convinced . ""
No disrespect to gentlemen of a certain age , but I think he is a little silly in that kind of movie .
What I think people would want to see him in is a comedy .
He has great comedic timing and there is something oddly lovable about him , "" he said .
That is something that Schwarzenegger â€ “ star of previous comedy movies such as Twins â€ “ has considered .
Last week Schwarzenegger was asked on Reddit by a nine - year - old fan if he had more fun with comedic roles or action ones . ""
Definitely , comedies are more fun to make , "" he replied .
So , one way or another , whether carrying a gun or packing a punchline , it seems that Schwarzenegger â€ “ to paraphrase his famous movie quote â€ “ will be back ."
"A grim day for morale at the Sun after another of its journalists was charged over alleged illegal payments to a public official .
So what better way to raise spirits than by bringing in actor turned governor of California turned actor ( again ) Arnold Schwarzenegger to open the Sun 's new TV studio and take part in a web video interview with Bizarre editor Gordon Smart .
Armed with nothing more threatening than a pair of scissors to cut the red tape at the opening ceremony , the Terminator was plugging his first starring role in a decade in Last Stand .
After an early hiccup about the lack of water in Arnie 's Sun - branded mug â€ “ "" what a beginning â€ “ empty ! ""
â€ “ the two appeared to get on famously , although the Hollywood star did drop an unfortunate pre - watershed F - bomb .
Smart , who 's obviously been mugging up on his Ofcom broadcasting code , was quick to apologise , however .
He 'll be back ?"
"Two California men have sued Lance Armstrong and his publishers for fraud and false advertising , claiming that the cyclist 's best - selling memoirs , which are billed as non - fiction , were revealed to be filled with lies when he confessed last week to systematic doping .
The class - action complaint was filed in federal court in Sacramento , California on Tuesday , five days after Armstrong ended years of vehement denial and admitted in a televised interview with Oprah Winfrey that he had cheated his way to a record seven Tour de France titles through the use of banned , performance - enhancing drugs .
The named plaintiffs in the suit were Rob Stutzman , a public relations executive who served as a deputy chief of staff for former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , and Jonathan Wheeler , a chef and amateur cyclist .
They said they had bought the books
It 's Not About the Bike and Every Second Counts because they believed in Armstrong and his story of returning without drug assistance to the Tour de France after a nearly fatal bout with testicular cancer .
Stutzman and Wheeler said they felt "" duped , "" "" cheated "" and "" betrayed "" by the realization that the books , marketed as inspirational true - life memoirs , were replete with fabrications .
Their lawsuit accuses Armstrong and his publishers , Penguin and Random House , of violating consumer protection laws on false advertising and fraud by selling the books as works of non - fiction .
Lawyers for the purported class of Armstrong book buyers say readers are entitled to restitution and possibly statutory and punitive damages for deceptions .
They say the publishers should have detected these , even though Armstrong passed drug screenings for various international cycling competitions .
A similar lawsuit was filed in 2011 against Greg Mortenson , co - author of the best seller Three Cups of Tea , accusing him of fabricating much of his story about promoting education for impoverished girls in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
That suit , which alleged fraud and unjust enrichment , was dismissed last year by a federal judge in Montana .
Readers , however , did win a $ 2.75 m settlement from literary hoaxer James Frey who , like Armstrong , confessed his deception in an interview with Winfrey .
His settlement marked a rare victory for aggrieved book buyers ."
"This week on our film review show , Xan Brooks , Peter Bradshaw and Catherine Shoard scour their history books for Steven Spielberg 's squeaky - clean take on Abraham Lincoln , chase down Osama bin Laden via Kathryn Bigelow 's Zero Dark Thirty , bend a knee in the court of The King of Pigs and shield their ears against Arnold Schwarzenegger 's booming comeback with The Last Stand"
"Back from the Governor 's Mansion in Sacramento to the daily grind of Hollywood , Arnold Schwarzenegger is not only in an action movie that might have been designed for Clint Eastwood , he 's also as slimmed - down , craggy - faced and ill - coiffed as his fellow Republican politician .
Under the expert direction of Kim Jee - woon ( this is the Korean film - maker 's English - language film debut ) , Arnie plays former top LA cop Ray Owens , now in semi - retirement as a small - town Arizona sheriff on the Mexican border .
What starts out as a cop movie turns into a western when a third - generation drug kingpin escapes from the Feds in Las Vegas and heads south to the border , where a gang led by Peter Stormare are installing a bridge to facilitate his return to Mexico .
There 's an allegory lurking here .
The FBI are led by decent - minded African American Forest Whitaker who does n't trust the local sheriff , and when things go pear - shaped , the only man able to put the American hearse before the Mexican cartel is Arnie .
Loudly echoing John Wayne in Rio Bravo , he swears in five trusted deputies to protect the town against the approaching Hispanic thugs .
Fortunately they 're not only armed to the teeth , but one of their number runs a historical weapons museum , and a local old lady is packing a rod .
What do you call a place like this ?
Home â€ “ if you belong to the National Rifle Association , who might well have sponsored this film ."
"Action stars of yesteryear are staging comebacks in 2013 and so far they have struggled to cling on to former glories â€ “ at least in the US .
There was a time when the testosterone - soaked triumvirate of Arnold Schwarzenegger , Sylvester Stallone and Bruce Willis could be counted on to do the business at the box office .
That time was circa 1990 and the passage of more than two decades has changed the audience .
Those of us who thrilled to Terminator and the original Total Recall whimpered last month when Schwarzenegger underwhelmed audiences with The Last Stand â€ “ although his forthcoming thriller Ten could be the real deal .
Rambo and Rocky devotees were left deflated when Stallone bombed in Bullet to the Head earlier this month .
Now comes the turn of the third member of the erstwhile Planet Hollywood club .
Willis , who still looks much like he did in his halcyon days , is the chart topper in the US after his fifth John McClane outing finished on $ 29.3 m ( Â£19 m ) over the four - day Presidents Day bank holiday weekend .
A Good Day to Die Hard 's weekend gross only just prevailed over Universal 's week - old comedy Identity Thief , nonetheless this was a pretty good result and Fox top brass will be pleased .
The movie 's international performance was an unqualified success as more than $ 61 m put it on course to cross $ 100 m outside North America by next weekend .
Willis has retained his appeal and remains a bankable action star .
His appearance opposite Joseph Gordon - Levitt in the recent release Looper was a good indication of his enduring status among moviegoers , and I 'd suggest it was one of the key reasons why Rian Johnson 's sci - fi thriller surged past the $ 160 m worldwide mark .
After all , Gordon - Levitt was at the time largely untested as a leading man , and the director is still not a household name , although that may change .
So hats off to Willis , who on recent showing remains the only one of the three macho men of yesteryear who still seems relevant .

"Next year , today 's Formula One cars will belong in a motor museum .
They will look as old hat as Arnold Schwarzenegger up against Robert Patrick 's liquid metal T-1000 in Terminator 2 .
The engines â€ “ except they wo n't be called engines but power units â€ “ will be downsized from V8s to 1.6-litre V6 turbos .
It does n't sound at all bad , by the way .
The fuel will be measured meanly , as if by a parsimonious barman serving shorts , and use of Kers will give 161bhp a lap for 33 seconds instead of today 's 80bhp a lap for 6.7 seconds .
That means it 's a must - have , instead of an optional extra , except it wo n't be called Kers ( Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems ) any more but ERS ( Energy Recovery Systems ) , which will combine kinetic energy from the rear axle and thermal energy from the exhaust via the turbocharger .
OK , enough technical gabble already .
But this stuff is really important and to get your head around it , you could visit the Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains in Brixworth .
Except they wo n't let you enter some areas unless you scrub up like a surgeon , and they will frisk you for recording devices , such as mobile phones , in case you decide to flog some technical info to their rivals .
It is possible to bang on about broader torque curves and traction limits until the Caterhams come home , but the point is Mercedes are hugely enthusiastic about 2014 and after three years back in Formula One without any significant returns they must improve on their record of one solitary win in that period compared with , say , McLaren 's 18 .
The bean counters at Mercedes 's headquarters in Stuttgart might be starting to wonder if the Â£242 m they spent in 2011 at Brackley and the engine division in Brixworth is a fair return on their investment .The suits may well note that 25 % of that figure , Â£60 m , was paid out to the team 's 989 employees , understood to be the largest staff roster in F1 .
Spending on engines rose 54 % to Â£116 m , with a significant slice devoted to the research and development of the V6 powerplants .
Mercedes are likely to have spent similar amounts last year , again in continuing their engine push for next season but also developing the team 's 2013 car in which Lewis Hamilton will make his debut in Australia on Sunday , 17 March .
Granted , they are already working on next year 's power units at Ferrari and Renault , but Mercedes , a giant that has not been sleeping so much as in a deep coma in F1 terms , have even more incentive to get everything right for the new car this season .
But while everyone has been obsessing about what Mercedes and their star signing from McLaren might do in 2014 , it has rather taken attention away from what the Silver Arrows could achieve this season .
Aside from the signing of the British former world champion there has been movement at the top of the organisation , with Norbert Haug making way as head of motorsport for Toto Wolff , formerly of Williams .
And with the Austrian 's arrival , Ross Brawn is to make way as team principal with the arrival next season of the McLaren technical director , Paddy Lowe .
It was only two months ago that Brawn defiantly stated : "" I am the team principal and I am in charge "" , only to duck questions about his long - term future . ""
I hope I 'm going to be a part of the team for a very long time , "" added Brawn .
For the time being Haug is giving little away , saying only : "" I need some time to meet people , speak to them and get an overview , but I think what the team needs utmost is stability .
We are coming up to a difficult season , a very important season for the team , so let 's keep the ball flat at the moment and see how it develops . ""
Events did not bode well , however , in the first couple of days of testing in Barcelona .
Brake failure at high speed saw Hamilton smash into the barriers at 180 mph and with flames erupting from Nico Rosberg 's car , Mercedes looked as accident prone as a circus clown 's car .
Since then , however , in Jerez and Barcelona once more , the Silver Arrows have been deeply impressive .
Mercedes now look capable of winning races , especially early on , though whether the team can match the level of in - season development of McLaren and Red Bull is another matter .
Mercedes 's inability to move along , perhaps hampered by their now banned double DRS system , was their biggest problem last year .
But Hamilton can help here too .
He is not the best when it comes to getting underneath the bonnet and taking a car to bits and putting it back together again , but development of the W04 is made easier for Brawn and his crew when a breathtakingly fast driver is pushing a grand prix car to its limits .
Hamilton is also making all the right noises , not heaping too much expectation on his engineers .
"" We exist to win and all the guys are working to win but we also have to be realistic and we do n't know where we are , "" he said .
"" Other people are talking us up at the moment but who knows what we are going to do ?
"" I just know my place .
I have come to a team who have struggled and who have not been able to compete with Red Bull , Ferrari or McLaren .
So I can not expect the team to make a massive leap , but if they do , then it will be spectacular .
Mercedes will impress this year , whether it will be at the start or the end of the season , I do n't know .
But I really believe in this team and it has been growing the longer
I have been with these guys .
The more time I spend at the factory , the more I meet people , the more excited I get . ""
The merits of Hamilton 's move from a winning McLaren to a struggling Mercedes have been regularly questioned , but after an encouraging testing his confidence is clearly growing .
"" I have been on a nice curve and going from strength to strength and making the right decisions .
I have also been trying to keep myself out of trouble , which definitely helps , and I am happy with the decision I have made , and it is nice to drive a different car .
"" It was more lucrative to stay where I was and a guarantee to be competitive as the car was evolving .
There was a guarantee there whereas Mercedes have not won and they have not had that winning streak .
The pressure comes from myself .
I expect myself to win and I expect myself to achieve greatness .
That is what I work hard for . ""
But if Mercedes do win races and even challenge for the championship this year , it will hardly help Lowe when he replaces Brawn at Brackley .
Brawn 's strategic and organisational skills will be indispensable next year with all the changes .
His position has been made more comfortable by Wolff 's efforts to avoid a head - on crash between his team principal and Mercedes 's non - executive chairman , the three - times world champion Niki Lauda .
A strong 2013 will strengthen his case even more .
But it will not make life simple for Lowe when he arrives at the end of the year .
Mercedes are already a team with considerably more chiefs than Indians ."

"Arnold Schwarzenegger is in talks to star in a remake of the classic 1984 cult film The Toxic Avenger , about a mutated hero who wreaks bloody revenge on his erstwhile tormentors , according to Variety .
Schwarzenegger 's role remains unclear , but he will not be playing the title character .
The Toxic Avenger is traditionally a seven - stone weakling who is transformed into a muscle - bound monstrosity after being dumped in a barrel of toxic waste by a gang of bullies .
Lloyd Kaufman 's original film was a flop upon release but subsequently gained huge popularity on the New York midnight screening circuit : three sequels eventually emerged , culminating in 2000 's Citizen Toxie :
The Toxic Avenger IV , and there has also been a musical and a cartoon spin - off .
Hot Tub Time Machine director Steve Pink is taking charge of a screenplay he co - wrote with Daniel C Mitchell .
The new Toxic Avenger is being pitched as a PG-13 ( 12A is the closest UK equivalent ) , while the original is listed as an 18 on IMDb .
Schwarzenegger has made a gentle return to the multiplexes since the end of his seven - year stint as governor of California in 2011 .
He headlined January 's middling action romp The Last Stand as a grizzled sheriff taking on Mexican mobsters , and took a larger role in Sylvester Stallone 's The Expendables 2 in 2012 , following up his cameo in the original .
Next up is the David Ayer action thriller Ten , in which Schwarzenegger will play the commander of an elite squad of DEA operatives ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger has confirmed that previously announced sequels to three of his best - known films , The Terminator , Conan the Barbarian and Twins , all remain on course to enter production .
The former California governor needs a bona fide box - office smash after a lukewarm return to Hollywood with an expanded cameo in Sylvester Stallone 's The Expendables 2 last year and a starring role in the middling action romp The Last Stand , in January .
Speaking to Metro to promote the DVD release of the latter , Schwarzenegger said audiences could expect to see him in familiar roles in the near future .
"" We 're writing [ Terminator 5 ] now , "" said the Austrian - born bodybuilder turned actor turned politician turned actor again .
"" There are three projects being written that involve me .
One is Terminator 5 , the other is a Conan movie that Universal is doing and there 's the sequel to Twins , which is called Triplets .
We 'll all look quite different in that .
The third triplet is Eddie Murphy , so figure that one out . ""
Schwarzenegger did not appear in the most recent Terminator film , 2009 's Terminator Salvation , though his likeness was borrowed via digital technology for the movie 's T-800 biomechanical attack units .
Comedy Twins , from 1988 , saw the actor team up with Danny DeVito as far - from - identical siblings .
John Milius 's Conan the Barbarian , from 1982 , is considered the best film about Robert E Howard 's Cimmerian warrior , and helped launched its star on the road to the Hollywood A - list ."
"Mel Gibson is to play the villain in the next instalment of Sylvester Stallone 's 80s action throwback saga The Expendables , according to Showbiz411.com .
The gossip site quotes a source as suggesting that Gibson will join fellow newcomers Nicolas Cage , Jackie Chan and Milla Jovovich in The Expendables 3 , which will also star series regulars Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Other rumoured new recruits include Wesley Snipes and Steven Seagal .
Stallone tweeted in April that Gibson had turned down the chance to direct the next instalment in the saga ; now it appears the former A - lister has agreed to a turn in front of the cameras instead .
Gibson has struggled to find currency in Hollywood following a period of negative publicity stretching back to 2006 , when he reportedly made antisemitic comments to a police officer who arrested him for drink driving .
Audio recordings of the film - maker and actor ranting at his ex - girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva further diminished his bankability .
Comments in an explosive letter last year by the screenwriter Joe Eszterhas , who accused Gibson of sabotaging a planned film about a 2nd - century BC Jewish revolt for antisemitic reasons , appeared to put the final nail in the coffin of Gibson 's career .
The actor and director 's most recent movie , Get the Gringo ( known as How I Spent My Summer Vacation in the UK ) , was released direct to video in the US .
Prior to that , Gibson made abortive attempts to return to the spotlight with a cameo in The Hangover Part II , from which he was dropped following complaints by cast and crew , and as a director on a film about the Vikings starring Leonardo DiCaprio which never got the green light .
The 2011 film The Beaver , directed by Jodie Foster and starring Gibson as a depressed toy - company boss who develops an alternate personality represented by a hand puppet , received some good reviews but failed to ignite the box office .
Neither the actor nor Stallone has yet confirmed if Gibson will play the villain in The Expendables 3 .
If he does , he will follow in the footsteps of Jean - Claude Van Damme , who squared off against Sly and his musclebound team of mercenaries - for - hire in last year 's second instalment ."

The road from body - builder to screen thesp is well worn , giving us Arnold Schwarzenegger reciting Shakespeare ( "" To be or not to be ... not to be ! "" ) and Jean - Claude Van Damme having an existential crisis in JCVD .
Having first risen to stardom under his beefy ringside moniker "" the Rock "" , Dwayne Johnson goes for "" serious "" in Snitch , squaring up against such heavyweights as Susan Sarandon in a tale of a divorced father forced to confront some "" big moral issues "" when his son is arrested for casual drug trafficking .
Despite a "" real life "" backstory ( this has its roots in an episode of the PBS series Frontline , with which it shares a producer ) and some blurb during the end credits about the mandatory sentencing of dealers being worse than that for rapists , the alleged "" issues "" are never any match for the dumbo shoot - outs and physics - defying car chases that remain the movie 's run - of - the - mill money - shots .
Teeth are gritted , shaven - heads stroked , families hugged , moist - eyes blinked â€ “
but it 's the sight of big things getting smashed to pieces that endures , and ultimately bores ."
"The last time Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger shared a screen , it was for The Expendables 2 .
It was a mess of a film where Stallone and Schwarzenegger essentially shouted their old catchphrases at each other as many times as they could and then went home .
But now they 're back in a new movie called Escape Plan , which promises to be much more satisfying .
What 's most exciting about Escape Plan is that it is n't just a film
â€ “ it also doubles as a handy how - to guide for the world 's criminals .
Stallone 's movie character is a seasoned escape artist who can break out of any prison in the world , and the Escape Plan trailer is only too happy to share his secrets with you .
So if you ever find yourself wrongly incarcerated for a crime you did n't commit , and you need to escape to freedom , just think back to the Escape Plan trailer 's step - by - step instructions .
I 'll break them down for you .
STEP ONE :
Remember to eat all of your meals .
Breaking out of prison will test you emotionally and physically , and you 'll need all the strength you can get .
STEP TWO :
Remember that carton of milk you just drank ?
Do n't throw it away .
Instead , using a plastic fork , carefully remove the laminate from inside .
You 'll need it to escape .
STEP THREE :
Using a Bible to shield your actions , put the laminate over the security keypad that governs the entry and exit from your wing of the prison .
STEP FOUR :
Wait for a warden to key in the exit code and , voilÃ , you now have a set of fingerprints telling you precisely what the exit code is .
Or what the four numbers of the exit code are .
Assuming that the codes do n't change several times a day because this is a prison and that just seems like it 'd be the sensible thing for it to do .
Still , at least you have the warden 's fingerprints now .
That 's probably something , right ?
STEP FIVE :
Make a family of tiny owls out of Plasticine .
Not only will these owls become your trusted confidants â€ “ and occasional lovers â€ “ during the formation of your escape plan , but they wo n't crap all over the place like real birds too .
Making a plasticine bird immediately makes you several times smarter than that idiot from The Shawshank Redemption .
STEP SIX :
Find a woman who can dress more suspiciously than anyone else you know , and get her to blow up a car .
It does n't matter why .
Explosions look cool .
STEP SEVEN :
There , you are now out of prison .
Calmly walk to the nearest telephone booth and casually chat to your mum , even though several dozen police officers are pointing their guns at you .
STEP EIGHT :
OK , maybe in retrospect calling your mum immediately after breaking out of prison was n't the cleverest idea .
You have now been caught and housed in an even higher - security jail â€ “ one that looks like a terrible fake - industrial nightclub from the early 1990s .
This is the worst prison of all .
But it 's OK
â€ “
you 're Sylvester Stallone , and breaking out of prisons is what you do .
This'll be a piece of cake .
STEP NINE :
Befriend Arnold Schwarzenegger 's dad .
STEP TEN :
Break out of prison , get in a helicopter , climb down the ladder that 's hanging out of the helicopter , find a gun and shoot the baddies .
Admittedly the "" break out of prison "" part of this step is a bit woolly and ill - defined , but you 're Sylvester Stallone .
You 'll figure it out ."
"When he was elected mayor of Rome last month , Ignazio Marino received a gift in the post from colleagues at the Thomas Jefferson university in Philadelphia : a box set of Arnold Schwarzenegger films .
Some might have thought it verging on the blasphemous for the man in charge of one of the world 's art house capitals , but he was nonetheless delighted .
Marino , a bespectacled , bicycling 58-year - old , nurses a "" passion "" for the Austrian - born American , and quotes his best lines liberally , to the dismay of his advisers , during interviews .
But , while the coming - together may seem incongruous , the two men do have at least one thing in common â€ “ before he entered politics , Marino 's daily life was about as far from that of the mayor of Italy 's capital as a film - star 's is from that of the governor of California .
But while Arnie was breaking box office records as the Terminator , Marino was a transplant surgeon .
After a medical career that took him from Italy to the US and back again , during which time he performed his home country 's first organ transplant on a patient with HIV , Marino decided to run for election in 2006 as a senator in Italy 's parliament .
This year , he raised the stakes by standing as the centre - left Democratic party 's candidate for Rome mayor against the centre - right incumbent , former neo - Fascist Gianni Alemanno .
During the campaign he was targeted by animal rights activists who denounced him for having tried to use baboon organs for human transplants .
So why do it ? ""
Because of the challenge , "" he said , in a recent interview with the Guardian .
It is certainly that .
In his latest incarnation Marino is stepping to the political fore at a time when voter disillusionment is high and , in his own words , "" the feeling that politics is bribing , corruption , stealing , is very entrenched in the minds of many , many Italians and probably the majority of Romans "" .
He is also taking over the reins of a city with an illustrious past but an uncertain present , a dysfunctional transport system , creaking public services and unparalleled , but woefully underfunded , cultural treasures .
"" It 's a controlled emergency , where you need to make a plan , you need to have an organisation , a schedule , and obviously resources , "" he said .
"" It 's different from emergencies where you just do your best to save a life .
You need to make a solid plan and stick with that . ""
In an attempt to reduce car use , protect ruins from traffic fumes and enhance the sight for tourists and locals , one of Marino 's first plans as mayor is to partially pedestrianise a stretch of the via dei Fori Imperiali , the traffic - clogged road built under Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini , which cuts through some of the most precious archaeological sites of ancient Rome .
In recognition of the need for environmental and cultural improvement , it is emblematic of much of Marino 's vision for Rome .
The medical man , who travels around the city on a maroon bicycle , in keeping with the ascetic political zeitgeist , has said he would like to find an outside corporate sponsor to revive the capital 's botched bike - hire service .
And , having witnessed two closures last month of the Colosseum due to wildcat strikes , he is also keenly aware of the capital 's need to improve and capitalise on the showcasing of its cultural treasures .
Even though the amphitheatre falls under the administration of the state , the symbolic impact of the closures is obvious and Marino said they left him feeling "" very discouraged "" .
He would like to see the great Rome tourist experience , which many find dazzling and maddening in equal measure , streamlined , with , for example , a single ticket allowing entrance to all museums .
He would not like to see a repeat of Â£54 which a British family were charged this year for four ice - creams .
Beyond the basic challenges , Marino is eyeing a greater prize â€ “ that of giving a once - glorious city a renewed contemporary energy .
Born in Genoa , he came to the capital aged 13 and , later on , trained in one of its hospitals while witnessing the bloodiest effects of the terror - ridden anni di piomba ( years of lead ) .
"" I think we really need to fix ordinary problems like traffic but we also need to give the town a vision , "" he said .
"" For example , my dream is to give to Rome a science museum .
It does n't have one , which is pretty unusual for a capital . ""
With the coffers in their current state , however , that may have to remain a dream for the time being .
The city 's public transport agency , for example , is reported to be on the verge of bankruptcy .
But Marino remains optimistic .
He says that when he decided to leave the US for mafia - blighted Palermo , to help set up a transplant centre in 1997 , his colleagues thought "" it would be a disaster , a failure , the ruin of my career "" .
But it was not , and the centre has been successful .
And , as ever , his medical career is informing his political one .
"" It 's like in an operating theatre , "" he says .
"" The way successful surgeons operate is by sitting in a conference room , studying all the X - rays , all the medical charts , the medical history of the patient , and then you decide what plan you will be pursuing . ""
A successful surgeon , in my view , is someone who is planning and discussing the pros and cons before the action .
Then you go in the operating theatre ; you have your plan , but you work all together â€ ¦
This is the idea that I have , and I think that if I am able to perform this way , and have the city councillors perform in this way , I think we will succeed . """
"There is a scene in the original Terminator movie where a balding middle - aged man with a paunch shouts to Arnold Schwarzenegger : "" Hey , buddy , you got a dead cat in there or what ?
"" The image then switches to the Terminator 's digital screen , which displays six possible responses :
Yes / No .
Or What ?
Go Away .
Please Come Back Later .
Fuck You , Asshole .
Fuck You .
A cursor highlights the most appropriate sentence and Schwarzenegger says it : "" Fuck You Asshole .
"" I sometimes think of that scene when I 'm in a football mixed zone
â€ “ the area players walk through to speak to the press ,
most of whom are begging , for that is what it is , for someone to stop and speak .
Usually players walk past as if you are not there
â€ “ the silent movie version of Schwarzenegger 's response .
On other occasions they will pretend to be talking into their mobiles , a ruse that falls apart if it starts ringing .
Incidentally , my favourite mixed - zone tactic came from Marco Materazzi after the World Cup final in 2006 .
Seven billion people wanted to know what he had said to Zinedine Zidane ; he preferred to walk past listening to booming rap on his beatbox .
Even when footballers do open their mouths , we are back to a Mary Whitehouse - friendly version of the Schwarzenegger menu .
Four or five options , learned in media training 101 , all of which are equally tedious .
Taking the positives .
No easy games in the Premier League .
Each game as it comes .
They were a well - organised team .
There are others , but by then we have all zoned out .
Sometimes you can understand where footballers are coming from .
Say anything of interest and Twitter erupts , Sky Sports News ' ticker starts to rev up and your words are displayed in bold on the back pages .
It can be more hassle than it is worth .
Still , there is a balance to be struck between access and actually playing the game â€ “ and most sports seem to manage it .
For the past 12 days I have been at the Tour de France , where it is a curious thrill to find sports people who are both courteous and happy to speak to the press â€ “ and by extension anyone who follows cycling .
You can get riders at the start , when you might expect all their focus to be on the slow torture ahead , after the finish and sometimes at the team bus as well .
It was hard not to contrast a typical football mixed zone with the sight of Geraint Thomas crossing the line at the team time trial in Nice , his body dressed in sweat and clearly hurting from cycling 25 km flat out with a fractured pelvis , yet still speaking generously and interestingly to the swarm around him .
TV crews .
The press .
The public .
All got a word or two .
Most cyclists are the same .
They regard speaking to the press , even after long and brutal day in the saddle , as part of their jobs .
In the United States they are even more open .
At every game , whether it is pre - season or the Super Bowl , reporters are allowed in the locker room .
There is no obligation for a player to speak , but usually they do .
Many of these teams realise the best way to serve their global fan bases â€ “ to borrow a grubby buzz phrase â€ “ is to allow a little light in , even if it can show up the cracks .
Just before the New Orleans Saints played in the NFL game at Wembley in 2008 , for instance , there were reports that two of their players , Deuce McAllister and Will Smith , had tested positive for weight - loss drugs .
The next day McAllister and Smith were in the locker room .
And reporters were able to ask them about it directly .
Because baseball and basketball teams also play several times a week it allows trust to build up between players and reporters .
In the Premier League the relationship is more like that between landowners and serfs in medieval England .
Now and again the press is lobbed scraps â€ “ sustenance basically â€ “ but little more .
It is time for this to change .
TV companies should demand more from the Premier League teams .
The press probably should , too .
ESPN gets a meeting with the coaches the day before every Monday Night Football game to gather background material .
Can you imagine that happening in the UK ?
I was there when Alan Pardew briefly attempted the US approach while he was at Reading a decade ago .
The sweet stink of Lynx and liniment hung in the air .
The naked bodies were a little disconcerting , but not as much as the slogans on the dressing room wall that announced â€ “ and I paraphrase , but only slightly â€ “ "" 20 % more crosses = two more chances of scoring a goal ! "" and "" Try 10 % harder , win 10 % more games "" .
I also remember Luke Chadwick sitting in his boxer shorts pondering the sight of balding middle - aged men with paunches standing around him .
"" It is a little bit strange to see journalists be ing allowed in , but it 's up to the gaffer , "" he said .
"" Still , I do n't suppose it will happen at Manchester United any time soon . ""
He was right about that .
And it sure was better than being told where to go , Terminator style ."

Monday was Madonna 's turn , in which it was revealed that there will never be a sequel to her book , Sex , and her favourite method of procrastination is plucking her eyebrows .
Here are 10 other things we learned : 1 . Madonna dreams
Perhaps it should n't be surprising
but you might think that if you were the object of so many people 's dreams , you would n't need to dream yourself .
But Madonna dreams , and not only that , she dreams about Brad Pitt .
And it 's quite a conventional sex - leading - to - children dream , not a sex - for - sex 's sake dream , nor even a dream about sex so wild it is unimaginable except to people of her proven sexual enterprise : "" Brad Pitt and I were living together and there was a small blonde child in the bed .
Sorry Angelina , it was only a dream . ""
The really surprising thing is that you have n't bumped into her in ( or having ) the same dream .
If you have a thing for Madonna and a thing for Brad Pitt , this could be fruitful territory .

The woman is obsessed .

She does n't do lols
There is not a single lol or smiley or abbreviation in the whole transcript .
Just traditional words .
And when she wants to laugh , for example when someone tells her that "" as a straight man , I think I 've had the same [ Brad Pitt ] dream "" , she says : "" HAHAHAHAHAHAHA . ""
( She 's not so good with punctuation , though . )
4 .
She has a bong in the shape of a penis
It was a birthday present , and is one of a few clues to her interior decor ; the others being that she keeps fish and cockroaches ( "" Why u do not [ sic ] have any pet at home ? "" ) .
And , no doubt , it is all exquisitely vacuumed .

Please note , this only applies if you are Frank Ocean ( the gay guy she would most like to turn straight â€ “ though , happily for all , he is bisexual )
, Daft Punk ( she wants to work with you
and you need to return her call ) or Snoop Lion , who posted "" when r we goin on a canoe ride ? ?
"" , to which she replied : "" When you send me a canoe . ""
Of the three , this last one seems the least likely to happen .

It 's surprisingly easy to make her happy Make her a dirty martini , or get her a slice of good lemon tart or "" the rose lycee macaroon cake from La Duree "" .
Interestingly , given that Madonna does n't include capital letters where convention says they should go , it 's surprising that she uses them for her favourite cake shop .
Perhaps it is a mark of respect .
Endearingly , she has got them in the wrong place , which can happen with French .

It really is all about her Just over halfway through , a reader called iamjanthony posts a moving question : "" Ray of Light album helped me come into my own in small town Nebraska , and know that there was love and acceptance in my future .
So many of us have had similar experiences through your music .
I ca n't imagine what that must feel like for you .
How often do you think about who your art is reaching ?
"" The post is heartfelt and flattering , but the answer that comes back is a rebuttal unhindered by punctuation : "" only when i hear comments like this from people do i think about it the rest of the time i only think of how i would like to express myself i think about expression not results "" .
Brilliant .

She has a weirdly recurring phrase One that , admittedly , may not be a weirdly recurring phrase in her day - to - day life : "" Send photo . ""
She uses it six times in the course of the chat â€ “ so she can decide which woman to kiss , what tattoo to get , who to go on a date with and even just in response to a plea for an acknowledgment .

There are some things she wo n't answer Three questions drew only silence .
Madonna was happy to answer things such as : "" Will you be my boo ? ""
( "" yes i 'll be your boo "" ) and "" Where should I put these hydrangeas ? ""
( "" up your ass "" ) but not "" Can you name one straight guy you wish you could turn gay ? "" .
Nor , "" Madonna , if you could not be ' Madonna ' for one day , what would you do that day ? ""
And definitely not , "" What do you really think of Lady Gaga ?
"" 10 .
If you would like to meet her in person , it would be a good idea to move to â€ “ or at least take a holiday on â€
“ the island of Lamu , Kenya
The tiny island is a place that Madonna says she would like to travel to .
It has the additional benefit of being without roads and cars , therefore affording no easy escape for celebrities seeking to avoid encounters with ordinary people .
( Madonna also says she would like to travel to Egypt , but there are more people there , and you are less likely to bump into her . )"
"Hollywood studio 20th Century Fox has denied reports that Arnold Schwarzenegger will play the main villain in James Cameron 's Avatar sequel .
The occasionally incisive Latino Review blog said on Monday that the former governor of California would reunite with his Terminator director on the long - gestating followup to the highest - grossing movie of all time .
Cameron is planning three new films set in the same solar system as the forest moon of Pandora , where the action took place in his 2009 box - office megalith . ""
No truth to this , "" a Fox representative told Variety .
However , the trade bible said casting had just got under way for the new film , and Schwarzenegger might still be on a list of potential stars .
More established Hollywood sites routinely rubbish scoops by upstart rivals in the blogosphere .
More often than not they turn out to be right to do so , but Latino Review has occasionally struck gold in the past .
While the site predicted recently that Christian Bale would return as Batman for a sequel to Man of Steel ( the role eventually went to Ben Affleck ) , it correctly revealed that Marvel Studios ' next film would be based on the Guardians of the Galaxy comic before the film company officially announced it last year .
Meanwhile , Schwarzenegger has been joined by Kelsey Grammer in the next instalment of Sly Stallone 's enduringly popular 80s action throwback saga The Expendables .
Grammer will portray Bonaparte , an ex - mercenary who helps the Expendables in their mission , in The Expendables III .
According to Deadline , the role was originally earmarked for Nicolas Cage .
Grammer , the former star of TV comedies Cheers and Frasier , will join an ensemble cast that already includes Stallone , Jason Statham , Harrison Ford , Mel Gibson , Antonio Banderas , Jet Li , Dolph Lundgren and Wesley Snipes ."
"What 's the most preposterous aspect of this not - so - great escape : that Sly Stallone should be playing the brains behind the weighty tome Compromising Correctional Institution Security ?
That he should blithely accept government coin to test the perimeters of an off - the - grid panopticon where Vinnie Jones commands greater authority than Sam Neill ?
Or simply that he 's then obliged to accept the protection of Austrian anarchist Arnold Schwarzenegger ?
( A brawnily tender shower scene may have hit the cutting - room floor . )
Director Mikael HÃ¥fstrÃ¶m clears some space for his hotchpotch cast , and delivers one smartly concealed twist , but he 's stuck with increasingly ropey material , and the problem of setting semi - crucial structural talk in mouths that have n't formed a coherent sentence for decades .
It 's basically Prison Break for dopes , and â€ “ in everything from the prisoners ' jumpsuits to the streaks in Arnie 's hair
â€ “ decidedly grey pulp , never quite distinctive enough to merit anything more than a tardy , generally unmemorable DVD viewing ."
"Sylvester Stallone has admitted he fostered a "" violent hatred "" for rival action hero Arnold Schwarzenegger during the pair 's 1980s heyday .
Stallone , who stars alongside his former bÃªte noire in the new thriller Escape Plan , described a fiercely competitive relationship with the musclebound Austrian - born star which drove both on to greater success .
"" We had violent hatred , "" the 67-year - old actor told US talk show host David Letterman . ""
Have you ever had that ever ?
Competition where you really had an arch enemy that kind of brings out the best in you .
As Arnold would say , it really pushed you to accelerate . ""
Stallone said the antipathy between the pair went so far that he hated "" that [ Schwarzenegger ] was on the planet , basically "" .
He said : "" After a while , I started to like this competition , this one - upmanship .
He 'd get a bigger gun .
I 'd shoot more people .
He 'd shoot more people .
But then , he went into science fiction , which kind of left me behind . ""
Stallone entered the public consciousness via 1976 's Rocky , the tale of an unlikely blue collar championship boxing contender which he starred in and co - wrote .
Schwarzenegger was best known for the 1977 docudrama Pumping Iron , but did not really become a well - known action star until 1981 's classic fantasy Conan the Barbarian .
The pair have since starred together in The Expendables series of action films , as well as Escape Plan , which sees them as cellmates vying to find their way out of a maximum security prison that has been designed by Stallone 's structural engineer character , Ray Breslin .
Schwarzenegger plays a character named Rottmayer .
Mikael Hafstrom 's film , which was previously titled The Tomb , hits US and UK cinemas this weekend , before debuting in Australia on 28 November .

"Arnold Schwarzenegger , the one - time action hero fronting a blockbuster TV special on climate change next month , has financial ties to some of the worldâ€ ™ s most destructive logging companies , an investigation group found on Tuesday .
The former governor and climate champion is a part owner of an investment company , Dimensional Fund Advisers , with significant holdings in tropical forestry companies .
A number of those forestry companies were implicated in highly destructive and illegal logging which has destroyed rainforest and critical orangutan habitat in Borneo , and fuelled conflict and arms trafficking in Liberia , the investigators from Global Witness said .
The group , whose founder won this yearâ€ ™ s $ 1 million TED prize for its campaigns , said the holdings were at odds with Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s public image as a climate champion .
Tropical forests are an important store of carbon that would otherwise accelerate climate change .
â€œHe is a very prominent environmental champion in his public life while profiting from some of the most egregiously notorious companies operating in the forestry sector , and in our view that is deeply hypocritical , â€ � said Oliver Courtney , a Global Witness spokesman .
There was no immediate comment from Schwarzenegger .
DFA responded through an email from a public relations firm , saying : â€œWe are a privately held company and can not comment on Mr. Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s investment in Dimensional.â€ �
The emailed statement from Alex Stockham of Rubinstein Associates said DFA had systems in place for clients seeking to ensure investments free of serious environmental or ethical impacts .
â€œDimensional understands that some clients have perspectives and preferences related to social , sustainability and/or environmental issues and works to accommodate those preferences in customised separate accounts.â€
�
Global Witness said their research indicated Schwarzenegger held an estimated 5 % stake in the firm , which manages an estimated $ 338 billion globally .
Those holdings included $ 174 million in about 20 forestry companies .
Global Witness has questioned the allegedly destructive activities of some of those firms .
The group said Schwarzenegger had disclosed the investment in DFA while he was still serving as Californiaâ€ ™ s governor .
Schwarzenegger and DFA did not immediately respond to requests for comment .
It is not clear whether Schwarzenegger was aware of how the investments were made .
Schwarzenegger pushed for action on climate change while serving as Republican governor of California .
In the run - up to the Copenhagen climate conference in 2009 , he joined regional leaders from Indonesia and Brazil urging Barack Obama and other leaders to help developing countries stop deforestation .
In his post - political career , he has raised his profile as a climate champion even further as executive producer of an ambitious new television series airing on Showtime from 13 April , Years of Living Dangerously .
The series â€ “ fronted by a slew of Hollywood A - listers from Matt Damon to Jessica Alba and Don Cheadle â€ “ aims to make climate change part of mainstream conversation .
â€œA scientist will never get the attention of an actor , â€ �
Schwarzenegger told a press tour in January .
â€œI always felt there was a communication gap in bringing people in and making them part of the movement.â€ �
For his episode , Schwarzenegger went out with â€œhot shotâ€ � crew to fight an active wildfire in Montana .
In his disclosure forms , which date from 2011 , Schwarzenegger said he had stock of â€œmore than $ 1 millionâ€ � in DFA â€ “ the highest category .
He also listed annual dividends of at least $ 100,000 .
The forms did not require full disclosure of Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s entire holdings in DFA , the group noted .
A number of campaign groups â€ “ and ethical investment networks â€ “ have grown more concerned over the years about human rights abuses and environmental destruction caused by illegal logging .
Global Witness singled out six of the forestry companies in DFA portfolios for engaging in deforestation on an industrial - scale in countries across South - East Asia and Africa .
Four of the companies held by DFA were blacklisted by investment managers for the Norwegian governmentâ€ ™ s sovereign wealth fund .
In 2012 , the Norwegian government found one of those companies , Ta Ann , had clear felled at least 100,000 hectares of tropical forest in Sarawak - critical habitat for endangered orangutan .
"" There can be no doubt that [ this destruction ] will have serious , irreversible consequences for biodiversity and the ecosystem services delivered by the forest , â€ � the Norwegian investigation found .
Global Witness said DFA had $ 4.15 million investment in Ta Ann as of November 2013 ."
"How ironic that back in 1984 , when Arnold Schwarzenegger 's lean and preposterously muscular Terminator first made contact with human civilisation , we were told the sinister T-800 "" will not stop , ever , until you are dead "" .
Turns out that Michael Biehn 's Kyle Reese was correct in one sense , for we seem to have been plagued by Terminators of ever - decreasing vitality ( barring 1991 's T2 : Judgment Day ) on the big screen ever since .
But Arnie has now stepped up to let us into a vital secret that might have been extremely useful to John Connor and his army of human freedom - fighters in their resistance campaign against the machines .
The Terminators do not in fact go on forever , he told MTV .
On the contrary , they decay just like the humans upon whom their cyborg physiology is modelled .
Arnie , who is set to appear as the T-800 once again in next year 's Terminator : Genesis , was asked to explain how he planned to portray the same ( presumably ageless ) robot for the fourth time when he himself had advanced from 37 to 66 since 1984 .
"" The way that the character is written , it 's a machine underneath , "" Schwarzenegger patiently explained .
"" It 's this metal skeleton .
But above that is human flesh .
And the Terminator 's flesh ages , just like any other human being 's flesh .
Maybe not as fast .
But it definitely ages .
""
Whatever your views on an extremely convenient revision of the Terminator rulebook , there is no denying that the film saga as a whole has been in decline ever since the halcyon days of the James Cameron era .
Genesis , as well as restoring Arnie to the series following his absence from 2009 's Terminator Salvation ( except in CGI form ) looks set for an impressive cast .
Game of Thrones ' Emilia Clarke is in line to play Sarah Connor , with Zero Dark Thirty 's Jason Clarke as John Connor and Spider - Man 's brilliant JK Simmons as a weary detective who has been chasing robots for three decades .
Unfortunately , we 've seen this all before with Salvation , which managed to recruit a post - Dark Knight Christian Bale , Bryce Dallas Howard and Helena Bonham Carter , but still left fans of the series nonplussed .
Genesis also has Game of Thrones ' Alan Taylor reportedly on board to direct , but the latter proved with last year 's Thor : The Dark World that he is no more than a safe , albeit talented , pair of hands .
What Genesis really needs is a film - maker with the vision and clout to reimagine Terminator in a manner which restores it to relevancy .
Fans of Cameron 's films will probably declare that the series should have been allowed to die a graceful death following the denouement of T2 , which saw Sarah and John Connor successfully divert the course of history away from machine armageddon with the help of a friendly T-800 and a few ghettoblasters pre - loaded with Guns N Roses tapes .
But this is modern Hollywood , and the money men will never allow a successful franchise to be killed off while it is still stacking up greenbacks .
The answer seems to be a respectful reboot with a polite nod or two to the series ' past , perhaps along the lines of JJ Abrams 's remarkably successful reworking of Star Trek five years ago .
After all , the Terminator saga 's sci - fi leanings should allow plenty of room for alternate timelines .
Genesis 's title fits the bill , but its suggestion of a new dawn for the series is undercut by rumours that the film 's storyline will bounce around between the events in 1991 and 1984 that we saw in Cameron 's original movies , a foolish plan unless the film - makers really plan to hold themselves up to an impossible standard .
Another suggestion , that the movie will centre on a Terminator sent back to protect Sarah Connor as she grows up , sounds more promising as the basis for a new timeline .
But is Arnie 's T-800 really the right cyborg for the job ?
There is a reason Abrams refused to cast William Shatner 's Captain Kirk in 2009 's Star Trek reboot , opting instead for the less intrusive figure of Leonard Nimoy 's Spock as he sought to reimagine the series with a new cast .
By the same maxim , it 's going to be almost impossible for Taylor and his team to apply the fresh coat of paint that 's so desperately needed to bring Terminator hurtling back to cultural currency when a giant Austrian bloke is leaning menacingly against the relevant wall .
â€¢ Ben Child :
Please let Joss Whedon take over Terminator"
"Arnold Schwarzenegger is in his pants offloading guns from a seaplane into a small boat .
He is urged to be careful by an air hostess who is assisting him in his quest to rescue his daughter from the clutches of a deposed South American dictator .
Our hero rows to an island , his powerful and naturally attained muscles receiving a loving few seconds of attention from the camera .
Once ashore , he tools up with a startling amount of weaponry .
Heâ€ ™ s about to take on an entire mercenary army .
Schwarzenegger films are ridiculous , and Commando is perhaps the silliest of the lot .
But they â€ “ or , at least , those he made before becoming governor of California â€ “ also form a crucial part of my upbringing .
I grew up in the 1980s , when I formed three nascent conclusions about the world : one , nuclear war is terrifying and probably inevitable ; two , the Soviet Union has a cooler aesthetic but are probably the bad guys ; and three , do n't mess with Arnie .
The set - up of Commando is very simple , and quickly established shortly after the opening credits .
The Austrian Oak plays the improbably named John Matrix , who used to be a special forces fighter , but now he spends all of his time taking care of his daughter Jenny , eating ice cream , feeding the local deer , and being baffled by Boy Georgeâ€ ™ s sexuality .
A quiet life .
But the ex - dictator , Arius , sends his hoodlums to kidnap Matrix 's daughter in order to blackmail him into ( singlehandedly ) deposing the current president of Val Verde .
Rejecting this anti - democratic and frankly unAmerican course of action , Matrix instead hunts down , and dispatches , all of Arius 's henchmen , using a variety of weaponry and one - liners .
And what one - liners they are .
No - one enunciates a terrible pun or sweary pay - off like Schwarzenegger .
Arnie kills a hoodlum on a plane , and turns to the air hostess : "" Please do n't disturb my friend .
He 's dead tired . ""
Arnie impales the man who betrayed him with a pipe : "" Let off some steam , Bennett . ""
Arnie is dangling a man off a cliff . ""
Remember , Sully , when I promised to kill you last ?
I lied . ""
Come to think of it , quite a few of his lines are directed at the dead , dying , or very soon to die .
He should save his zingers for people who will remember them .
Now , you may be asking : whereâ€ ™ s the guilt ?
Thereâ€ ™ s nothing in the Bible about not enjoying Schwarzenegger movies .
Part of it is that I hate modern action films .
The plots are boring , the characters dunces , and I find the politics that drive them â€ “ from sexual to geopolitical - frequently reprehensible .
When my friends try to intellectually justify the likes of the humourless recent Batman films , I think of Charlie Brooker 's imaginary magazine for simpletons , Shit Film Liker ( cover :
â€œCon Air 2 : at last!â€ � ) .
Yet I 'll happily watch Arnie slaughter wave after wave of unconvincingly moustached mercenaries .
I 've become un - desensitised to Hollywood violence over the years , so I 'd much rather watch extras give it their best slow - motion collapse after being shot ( falling off a roof is a particular favourite ) , or spin into their air in balletic twirls after a grenade explodes vaguely near them , than the realism - porn of today 's action flicks .
Though it feels heretical to admit it , there are some problems with Commando .
The kidnapped air hostess turned sidekick , feistily played by Rae Dawn Chong , gets some good lines , wisely puncturing one scene with "" I ca n't believe this macho bullshit "" â€ “
but she 's underused .
Matrix 's nemesis , his former buddy turned obsessive henchman - in - chief , is played with an exaggerated campness that would be considered offensive today .
But Arnie was the last action hero ( do n't watch Last Action Hero ) .
The proposed sequel to Commando eventually became Die Hard , after Arnie turned it down .
And fun film though it is , Bruce Willis ushered in the era of the ( slightly ) more realistic action flick .
They started to take themselves a smidgin too seriously .
Commando revels in a sense of its own ridiculousness , and in that , is a lesson to us all .
â€¢ More from My guilty pleasure"
"There seems to be something about cult 80s action movies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger that Hollywood just can not leave alone .
Conan the Barbarian was revived in 2011 with commercials director Marcus Nispel taking over from John Milius 's 1981 original .
Terminator has been brought back several times with the much - maligned McG given the most recent crack at the man versus the machines saga with 2006 's disappointing Terminator Salvation .
Underworld 's Len Wiseman made us all wish we could step into a fancy futuristic dream parlour with the power to banish memories of his horrible bash at rebooting Total Recall from our minds for ever in 2012 .
Even Predator , which looks set for a revival by Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Iron Man 3 director Shane Black , has been down this road before .
Four years ago Hungarian film - maker NimrÃ³d Antal brought us the middling Predators , which transported the mandibled extraterrestrials to their home world in a storyline half - inched from the comic book World War Hulk .
Despite the presence of Robert Rodriguez as a hands - on producer , it was not a big hit and audiences failed to warm to the idea of Adrien Brody as an action hero .
Antal has barely been heard of since bar last year 's well - received Metallica concert film Through the Never .
So just why is the blogosphere getting so excited about the prospect of a Black - directed Predator movie ?
Well the fact is that the former Lethal Weapon screenwriter delivers unusually brave films that make audiences think without ever losing mainstream appeal .
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang was a superbly realised comic neo - noir , which often left the audience as brilliantly bamboozled as star Robert Downey Jr 's Hollywood desperado Harry Lockhart .
The film also reinvented Val Kilmer as a character actor and introduced the world to a never - better Michelle Monaghan .
Iron Man 3 thrillingly played on audiences ' own prejudices about both swarthy - skinned terrorist "" types "" and comic - book movies in general , with a fabulous narrative twist worthy of Christopher Nolan .
This is the film - maker who reputedly fell out with the makers of the Lethal Weapon series for trying to kill off Mel Gibson 's Riggs : he is willing to take risks in the name of art , something that will always make his movies worth watching , even if it terrifies the living daylights out of the money men .

Early reports suggested Black 's Predator movie might be a full - scale reboot .
But the director told Collider earlier this week that it will be more of an "" inventive sequel "" .
He said : "" Why start over , when you 've all this rich mythology yet to mine ? "" and added that he was not a big fan of reboots generally : "" I like the idea of expanding and exploring the existing Predator mythology , rather than hitting the restart button . ""
All of which sounds perfectly reasonable , and at least spares us the horrors of Colin Farrell or Sam Worthington as the new Dutch .
But where exactly can the next Predator film go if Black is determined to avoid the jungles of central America ?
The Predator home world idea never really took off , so Brody 's unfortunate Royce seems doomed never to get off that particular planet .
America has changed radically since the crime - ridden 1990s and a Predator 2-style gangland tale seems less palatable than it once was .
Gary Busey 's DEA agent revealed in the sequel that the Predator likes to hunt his prey in war zones , so Black might easily find himself in Iraq or Aghanistan .
But we should remember that the aliens may have been visiting Earth for centuries : how much more fun might the new film be if it hauled the timeline back to the wild west era , or introduced Predators into the second world war ?
Quentin Tarantino 's Inglourious Basterds may have missed a trick .
The main worry here is that Black has become an in - demand director since the enormous success of Iron Man 3 , and already plans to farm out screenwriting duties to his old pal Fred Dekker ( Monster Squad ) once he 's come up with the initial story idea for his take on Predator .
He 's only "" attached "" to direct at this stage â€ “ and no - one wants to see a lesser film - maker parachuted in at the last minute .
If Arnie 's back catalogue is n't going to get better treatment this time around , we 're probably better off dusting off the VHS of John McTiernan 's original cult classic than taking a punt on yet another tepidly belated sequel ."
"â€œHas any other football team played 11 triallists like Hereford United did this summer?â€ � posed Steve Hodges last week .
Herefordâ€ ™ s current situation is a dire one and , with the threat of liquidation still lingering over the club , it was no surprise to see them fielding triallist XIs against Droylsden and , rather oddly , Beskitas in pre - season .
With the clubâ€ ™ s future hanging by a thread , there was understandably little mirth to be found in the reaction to those friendly teams .
But not so at Hyde FC .
â€œLast month Hyde FC played a team of completely traillists for the third - or - so time in a row , â€ � writes John Jacques .
â€œIt was getting confusing keeping track of the names
â€ ¦
so they just started naming the players after actors and such.â€ �
Having named a team of revolutionaries for the fixture against Altrincham â€ “ Fidel Castro , Vladimir Lenin , Karl Marx , Leon Trotsky , Maximilien de Robespierre and so forth â€ “ mixed in with a couple of contracted players , a triallist XI took the field against Burnley in their following fixture â€ ¦ SAD SIGNINGS ( 2 )
Last weekâ€
™ s look at sad signings â€ “ featuring Nicolas Anelka , Jaap Stam and Emmanuel Frimpong all handling new shirts as if they had just been pulled out of a bin â€ “ sparked several more missives to the Knowledge inbox .
â€œItâ€ ™ s hard to top American Danny Szetela who signed with MLS with the expectation of ending up with his hometown club the Metrostars in New York , â€ � writes Jason Maxwell .
â€œInstead
the MLS player lottery system placed him with the Columbus Crew.â€ �
And look how pleased he is to find himself in Columbus , Ohio rather than New Jersey :
Also appearing rather less than cchuffed is Jonjo Shelvey on his arrival at Swansea .
â€œI said at the time he looked like a hostage holding up that dayâ€ ™ s newspaper to prove he was still alive , â€ � writes Stu Goodwin .
KIT
COMMEMORATIONS â€œPortsmouthâ€ ™ s new kit has names of fallen soldiers on it .
Are there other examples of clubs recognising war victims on their kit?â€ � tweeted Simon Cook last week .
Andrew Walker points us towards Raith Roversâ€ ™ away kit for the 2014 - 15 season , which has been designed to pay tribute to the 16th Royal Scots regiment , a battalion formed of sportsmen , seven of whom came from the Kirkcaldy club .
Three Rovers players
â€ “ Jimmy Todd , Jimmy Scott and George McLay â€ “ were killed during the conflict .
â€œWe wanted to do something completely different for next season in terms of kit colours , â€ � the Raith chairman , Turnbull Hutton , told the Dundee Courier ,
â€ �
but at the same time the board has been considering a suitable way to mark this centenary in an appropriate manner , so we have brought these two ambitions together with our new green and black strip .
â€œWe hope that it captures the imagination of the Scottish footballing public and , through next seasonâ€ ™ s sports pages , that it ensures that we really do remember the sacrifices of our players and so many others 100 years ago.â€
�
And in Wales Aberystwyth Town are also commemorating the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the first world war .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re the kit suppliers to Aberystwyth Town Football Club in the Welsh Premier League , â€ � write the good folk at RM Teamwear ,
â€œand
this season we produced their home strip honouring the centenary of the first world war , more specifically on the sleeves we have the names of players who played for the club and lost their lives in the Great War .
Their name , rank and Regiment are on players 1 - 14 in the war veteran playerâ€

Others have â€œIn Memory of Players of This Club

KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE â€œI was quite surprised to attend a match at my local club , Wisla Krakow , who were playing PKS Slask ( from Wroclaw ) in the Polish first division , â€ � wrote Roger Mackin back in the halcyon days of 2010 , when all this were fields , Mars bars cost 26p and you could leave all your windows open when you went on holiday .
â€œI was a bit worried about dangerous hooligan action but I was told beforehand that the hooligans of these two teams were â€˜friendsâ€ ™ .
And it was true .
They proceeded to sing each othersâ€ ™ songs and included a cute â€˜Wisla i Wroclawâ€ ™ number .
Do other clubs have such a love affair going on while in the same ( top ) division ?
It seems unlikely but there must be a precedent .
Having said that , I canâ€ ™ t imagine English fans singing â€˜Stoke and Fulham , la la la la la.â€ ™ â€ �
It seems that Wisla and PKS are far from the only sides to enjoy such friendly relations .
In fact , theyâ€ ™ re not even the only sides in Poland .
â€œWhen
I used to wander along to support the mighty Polonia Warszawa ( Legia Warszawaâ€ ™ s older , nobler , smaller rival ) , they used to sing songs in support of Cracovia ( Wisla Krakowâ€ ™ s older , nobler , smaller rival ) and also had a soft spot for Arka Gdynia , â€ � writes Nicholas Walton .
â€œIt was normal to have a few Cracovia flags and shirts in attendance .
Other clubs had other alliance networks
â€ “ although I was told by Polonia fans that Legia didnâ€ ™ t have any friends as they were arrogant big - time - Charlies .
â€œThe alliances extended to hooligan gangs .
Possibly this is because generally small travelling fans were able to build links , especially for a spot of fighting , on away trips â€ “ based upon perceived shared identity ( as with Polonia and Cracovia ) and rivalries.â€ �
And itâ€ ™ s a phenomenon far from confined to the land that produced Grzegorz Lato , Zbigniew Boniek and , yes , Dariusz Wdowczyk .
There are further examples elsewhere in Eastern Europe .
â€œI attended a match this August between Dinamo Kiev and Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk , who were at the time both in the top five of the Ukrainian top division , â€ � writes Adrian Rogstad .
â€œThe match was a dreary 0 - 0 draw attended by just 17,000 , so the best entertainment came from the two teamsâ€ ™ fan groups , who my local â€˜guidesâ€ ™ told me had a friendly relationship .
â€œIn the second half , they would on occasion join in each othersâ€ ™ songs ( which I have no idea what were about ) , and towards the end were united in a chant of â€˜Metalist is a team of condomsâ€ ™ , referring to Metalist Kharkiv , a club both of the groups apparently despise .
I have no idea if calling someone a â€˜condomâ€ ™ is a common insult in Ukraine or whether the choice was merely due to the fact that â€˜teamâ€ ™ ( komanda ) and â€˜of condomsâ€ ™ ( kondoma ) rhymes in Russian.â€ �
But not all fans come together to deride their common enemy as a team of prophylactics .
â€œIt is quite common in Turkey but the best example is the friendship between Bursaspor and Ankaragucu , â€ � writes Dominic Brassington .
â€œThe friendship comes from , allegedly , the death of a fan going to watch the game and the fans then agreeing to bury their differences .
On the match day the fans will meet before to eat , visit Ataturkâ€ ™ s mausoleum if the match is in Ankara and watch the game in a party atmosphere .
â€œBut the support extends far beyond that .
While Bursaspor were on their charge to winning the league last year
Ankaragucu fans came out en masse to support Bursa against Genclerbirligi , and Bursa sent a large number of fans to support Ankaragucu against Fenerbahce .
The province numbers in Turkey run alphabetically with Ankara No6 and Bursa No16 , so during Bursa games
the fans chant Ankaragucu during the sixth minute and vice versa.â€ �
The Bundesliga is also littered with these relationships .
Bayern Munich and Bochum , 1860 Munich and Kaiserslautern , and Schalke and NÃ¼rnberg are particularly close , but there are plenty of others of varying strength and also a plethora of regional alliances .
The reasons behind the phenomena are varied , and not always easy to work out ( even our man in the know , Rafa Honigstein , was unsure of the exact origins ) .
The spectre of hooliganism and â€œmy enemyâ€ ™ s enemy is my friendâ€ � almost certainly lies around some , though by no means all .
Cologneâ€ ™ s freundschaft with St Pauli , for example , dates back to 1978 and the final day of the Bundesliga season .
Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach , facing Dortmund , required victory and a 10-goal swing to win the title on goal difference , while Cologne travelled to already - relegated St Pauli .
Gladbach rather conveniently trounced Dortmund 12 - 0 , but Cologne took the title thanks to a 5 - 0 win .
Fans of both sides apparently celebrated together .
Serie A is also a hotbed of inter - club cosying .
â€œIn Italy , nearly all clubs are â€˜twinnedâ€ ™ with other clubs ( Gemellaggi),â€ � writes Paul Haynes .
â€œFor example , the team I support , Napoli , are twinned with Genoa .
When Napoli were promoted to Serie A in 2007 , the Genoa ultras held up a banner saying â€˜Benvenuto fratello napoletanoâ€ ™ â€ “
â€˜Welcome ,
my Neapolitan brotherâ€ ™ â€ “ when the clubs met in the league.â€
�
And there are even teams on the other side of the Atlantic that enjoy a pre - match sing - song and shirt - swap with their rivals .
â€œLanus and Colon in Argentina claim that they are â€˜more than friends , they are brothersâ€ ™ ( â€˜MÃ¡s que amigos , hermanosâ€ ™ ),â€ � writes Martin K. Hereâ€ ™ s the teamsâ€ ™ fans enjoying a bit of quality time together .

"The director of The Expendables 3 , Patrick Hughes , has confirmed internet speculation that Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jet Li play gay lovers in the action sequel .
Interviewed by grantland.com , the Australian film - maker was asked if a scene at the end of the movie , in which the Hollywood legend cuddles up to China 's famous martial arts hero , meant the pair 's characters were in a relationship .
His response : "" I believe they are . ""
Schwarzenegger plays Trench Mauser , a former comrade and sometime rival of Expendables leader Barney Ross ( Stallone ) in the action series .
Li portrays Yin Yang , a hand - to - hand combat specialist and retired member of the mercenary group .
At the end of the team 's current mission , the pair are told to "" get a room "" by Ross after they are seen nuzzling into each other .
Replies Mauser : "" We do n't need a room ! "" as he pulls Yang in close . ""
So jealous ! ""
he then remarks .
Homosexual characters have started to appear more regularly in Hollywood films .
In May , How to Train Your Dragon 2 director Dean DeBlois revealed that Gobber the viking from the animated film series prefers same - sex relationships , while Harry Potter creator JK Rowling announced in 2007 that wizard Dumbledore is gay .
Schwarzenegger had a mixed record on gay rights while in office as governor of California .
He has said he personally believes that marriage should be between a man and a woman , but would not oppose the legal rights of any human being to get married .
As governor , he performed two marriage ceremonies for gay couples during his eight years in office .
The latest Expendables instalment opened in fifth place at the US box office at the weekend with a haul of just $ 16.2 m ( Â£9.7 m ) .
Producers have blamed the weak figures on the existence of a highly publicised high - quality illegal download of the film , but new figures from the piracy - tracking firm Excipio suggest the movie is not even proving particularly popular when available for free .
Stallone also appears to have seen his hopes dashed for a spin - off "" Expendabelles "" series led by Sigourney Weaver .
The Hollywood Reporter says the Alien star has eschewed the role in favour of the chance to star as a grandmother in the Juan Antonio Bayona children 's fantasy A Monster Calls .

"The 2014 Sustainia Awards , chaired by Arnold Schwarzenegger , attracted more than 900 submissions for projects and technologies representing 10 different sectors from food , fashion and , city development to transportation and healthcare .
Collectively , these projects are deployed in more than 84 countries .
The runners up for the award are showcased here and the winner will be announced in Copenhagen on Thursday 30 October .
The ceremony will celebrate these innovations ahead of the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changeâ€ ™ s ( IPCC ) anticipated report on climate change , due to be finalised 31 October .
1 .
Food finalist : Netafim ( Israel ) - gravity - powered irrigation
Netafim is behind a low - tech irrigation system for smallholder farmers in developing countries which increases and secures yields while saving water and cutting costs .
It drips precise quantities of water and nutrients right at the root zone of crops while an elevated tank distributes the water using gravity .
This minimises the need for electricity and investments in infrastructure .
The UN estimates that 500 million smallholder farmers provide over 80 % of the food consumed in the developing world .
Irrigation systems are vital to sustain agriculture as it addresses water scarcity and soil erosion .
The solution is commercially viable with a payback - time of about a year , making it fit for microfinance projects .
2 .
Transportation finalist : 8D technologies ( Canada ) - bike sharing app As a mode of transport ,
the bicycle is one of the lowest emitter of greenhouse gases - even with the CO2 emissions of the food you need to power a bike .
This helps explain why bike - sharing systems are being adopted increasingly by cities .
The Spotcycle app from 8D technologies aims to make bike - sharing more convenient and smartphone - friendly .
The app locates nearby bike stations and communicates availability , maps out bike paths and helps with navigation .
The app is already in sync with cities in North America , Australia and Europe .
3 .
Buildings finalist :
Advantix ( USA ) - air - conditioners which use saltwater Air conditioners use about 5 % of all electricity produced in the US .
As a result , 100 m tons of carbon dioxide are released each year .
Advantixâ€ ™ s air conditioning system uses saltwater which means it needs 40 % less energy than normal systems .
Whereas air - conditioning systems normally chill the air to remove humidity and then reheat it in a highly energy - intensive process ,
Advantixâ€ ™ s air - conditioners funnel the air through non - toxic fluid saltwater instead .
The process dehumidifies the air without the need for re - heating . 4 .
Fashion finalist : I : CO ( Switzerland ) - textile recycling Clothes are often discarded after the first or second life cycle , and apparel accounts for up to 10 % of a western consumerâ€ ™ s environmental impacts .
Through an advanced take - back system , I :
CO works to keep apparel , footwear and other textiles in a continuous closed - loop cycle .
Used shoes and clothing are collected in stores and retail outlets , where customers are financially rewarded for depositing their used items .
Once collected , the textiles are sorted according to more than 350 criteria for designation .
Used clothes can be labeled suitable for : second - hand sale , recycling into fibres and paddings for new products , or upcycling .
5 .
IT Finalist : Fairphone ( Netherlands ) -
A smart - phone with social values Through development , design and production , social enterprise
Fairphone works to create positive social impact in the consumer electronics supply chain - from responsible mining , decent wages and working conditions to reuse and recycling .
Fairphone began by redesigning the processes behind the production , making phones that use conflict- free minerals and are assembled in a factory with a worker - controlled welfare fund .
To date , Fairphone has sold nearly 50,000 phones from its first two production runs .
6 .
Health finalist : We Care Solar ( USA ) - solar suitcases giving life Preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth claim 800 lives daily and 99 % of cases happen in developing countries .
We Care Solar has created a sustainable solution .
The Solar Suitcase provides solar electricity for medical lighting , mobile communication and essential medical devices for rural areas and humanitarian settings .
This enables safe and timely obstetric care , which ultimately improves maternal and neonatal outcomes .
Additionally , the innovation allows emergency surgeries to be conducted around - the - clock in rural hospitals .
The Solar Suitcase has been introduced to more than 600 healthcare facilities in 20 countries .
7 .
City Finalists :
Wecyclers ( Nigeria ) - Pedal - powered recycling
In Lagos , Nigeria , Wecyclers is fuelling social and environmental change by enabling people in low - income communities to make money from unmanaged waste piling up in their streets .
It is a response to the local waste crisis ; the municipal government collects only 40 % of city garbage .
The Wecyclers initiative has deployed a fleet of cargo bicycles to pick - up , collect and recycle garbage in low - income neighbourhoods .
Families are encouraged to recycle their bottles , cans and plastics through an SMS - based programme .
For every kilogram of material recycled , the family receives Wecyclers points on their cell phone .
Families can then redeem points for goods such as cell phone minutes , basic food items or household goods .
The initiative adds to the local economy by hiring personnel locally .
8 .
Resource finalist : Newlight Tech ( USA ) - carbon - negative plastic With its novel technology that converts greenhouse gases into plastic material ,
AirCarbon has disrupted the market by replacing oil - based plastics with a sustainable product that is competitive in both price and performance .
It is made from a process where carbon in the air is captured and used in manufacturing .
AirCarbon uses pollutants as resources to make products otherwise made from oil .
Products made from AirCarbon are carbon - negative even after calculating the emissions from the energy used in production .
AirCarbon is currently used to make chairs , bags and cell phone cases .
9 .
Education finalists : Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha (
Bangladesh ) - school boats combatting climate change More than one million Bangladeshis could be displaced by rising sea levels by 2050 .
One consequence is that children can not attend school for long periods of time , making it harder for them to escape poverty .
By building a fleet of solar - powered school boats , the Bangladeshi initiative Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha has secured year - round education in flood - prone regions of Bangladesh .
Each floating school boat collects students from different riverside villages , ultimately docking at the last destination where on - board classes begin .
Solar lighting makes the schedule flexible , which provides for additional educational programs in the evening .
Shidhulaiâ€ ™ s floating schools model has been replicated in Nigeria , Cambodia , Philippines , Vietnam and Zambia .
10 .
Energy Finalists : Opower ( USA ) - personal energy - efficient expert Through use of big data , Opower has given energy utilities a new way of engaging with customers in order to improve energy efficiency .
The software solution combines cloud technology , big data and behavioural science to produce data analyses and personalised information on how to save energy .
To motivate reductions in energy consumption , utilities use Opower to share money - saving insights with custumers .
Opower can also show households their energy usage compared to neighbours ; an effective method in motivating people to save energy .
Opower has enabled savings of over 4TWh of energy , which is equivalent to $ 458 m ( Â£283.1 ) in bill savings .

"The evening starts shambolically .
Technical problems hold things up , though I suspect the technicalities are more to do with Arnold Schwarzenegger not being here on time .
Half an hour late , and weâ€ ™ re off .
â€œA big welcome to Jonathan Ross ,
â€ � the host Rebecca Cooper says to warm applause .
But Ross fails to materialise .
â€œJust a short delay because Jonathan Ross has been held up .
We shouldnâ€ ™ t be too long at all.â€ �
The room is hot and stuffy , the atmosphere not entirely relaxed .
â€œGet me out of this hole , â€ � shouts an audience member , paraphrasing Schwarzenegger in Predator .
Not only has Arnie killed more people than any other mainstream action hero ( 509 and counting ) , heâ€ ™ s also patented more one - liners than any other movie star .
â€œGet to the Chopper , â€ � heckles another man .
Another quote from Predator , which loosely translates as letâ€ ™ s get this show under way .
Expectation is high .
The audience is full of Schwarzenegger obsessives â€ “ bull - necked men who worked their bodies and dreamed the Arnie dream but never quite realised it .
A three - minute montage is shown â€ “ Arnie as Mr Universe , Arnie as the Terminator , Arnie as the Governor .
â€œThis story you know , so are you ready for the story you donâ€ ™ t?â€ � teases Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s voiceover before he walks on to the stage .
You bet , especially at these prices .
The cheapest tickets are Â£126.50 , while for Â£2,100 you not only get to meet and greet him , you also have your picture taken with him ( â€œYour photoshoot should take no longer than 15 seconds , â€ � VVIPs are forewarned ) .
For 10 grand you could perhaps get a piggyback home .
Finally Schwarzenegger arrives , his body tightly packed into a navy blue suit .
â€œI said Iâ€ ™ d be back , â€ � he says ,
the most famous one - liner of all .
The crowd roars .
At 67 , heâ€ ™ s looking good , California - style â€ “ face barely lined , full head of brownish hair , pearly teeth that could devour the world .
Ross asks his first question and Arnie delivers a 20-minute motivational masterclass .
He was told heâ€ ™ d never make it as a bodybuilder ( his bullying father wanted him to marry any Austrian girl called Heidi and be a policeman ) but he won Mr Universe five times .
Hollywood producers told him heâ€ ™ d never make it in the movies ( he spoke robotic English and was physically huge at a time when little fellas like Dustin Hoffman and Woody Allen were all the rage ) but he became the biggest action hero ever .
He was told heâ€ ™ d never make it in politics ( who would vote for an excessively muscled movie star with a weird accent ? ) and he became governor of California , running the eighth biggest economy in the world .
Whatâ€ ™ s more , he did it as a Republican in a traditionally Democrat state .
Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s story really is remarkable .
And he tells it well .
Every single victory is hard won .
So thereâ€ ™ s the disapproving father who finally praises him two months before he dies ; the mother who weeps and calls in the doctor because of the pictures of oily muscle men on her sonâ€ ™ s walls , only to be reassured that it is all perfectly normal and heterosexual ; the fierce rivalry with Sly Stallone ( â€œI hated the son of a bitchâ€ � ) that ends with them waltzing together in Cannes happily reconciled by Mammon as they open Planet Hollywood together .
This is the American dream writ large .
Very large .
And this is the message most of the audience have come to hear : chase that rainbow , dream the impossible , donâ€ ™ t be afraid of failure , stay hungry , ignore the naysayers , when you fall pick yourself up , work your butt off , and you too can earn squillions and become a global hero .
You could imagine many of the people here putting Arnieâ€ ™ s mantra on a loop and playing it 24/7 .
They lap it up .
But there are problems with the evening , executive - produced by hairdresser - turned - impresario Rocco Buonvino .
First , the venue is horrible â€ “ a hotel suite with chairs set out in rows as long as a runway .
Itâ€ ™ s hard enough to see Schwarzenegger from a central seat
, never mind the outskirts .
Perhaps the biggest disappointment is that despite the promise of the unseen , uncensored Arnie , both Ross and Schwarzenegger are on auto - pilot .
There is not an uncomfortable moment for either interviewer or interviewee .
Ross touches on
the starâ€ ™ s troubled private life for about 10 seconds , and then only euphemistically ( Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria Shriver divorced after Shriver discovered he had secretly fathered a child with their maid ) .
Schwarzenegger admits he was disappointed with himself ( â€œOne of my biggest failingsâ€ � ) , but quickly magics it into another triumph in which hard work and devotion to the children win the day .
For once , we could do with hearing more from Ross â€ “ a bit less reverence , a little more cheek and a whole lot more nosiness .
Not surprisingly , Schwarzenegger isnâ€ ™ t big on self - doubt or irony .
He talks about how his father never understood his bodybuilding training .
â€œHe said : â€˜If you want to get strong , why donâ€ ™ t you get an axe and chop down some wood , and deliver it to peopleâ€ ™ s homes ?
That way you do some good .
This way youâ€ ™ re doing it for yourself .
I donâ€
™ t get it .
Are you so in love with yourself?â€ ™ â€ �
It was the perfect moment for Ross to ask whether his father had a point .
You never know , Schwarzenegger might have agreed .
â€¢ Iâ€ ™ ll be backstage
â€ “
would you pay Â£2 K for a drink with Arnie , Sly or John ?"
"Almost a year on , I still donâ€
™ t fit the clothes I used to wear before 2014â€ ™ s Spine Race .
I lost all my body fat and a significant amount of muscle too .
Okay , I was hardly Arnold Schwarzenegger before , but now my T - shirts and jumpers hang off me like Iâ€ ™ m a scarecrow
( on the upside it has made me a faster runner ) .
My wedding ring sometimes slides off my finger unnoticed when hand washing .
And three of my toes still feel really weird .
The race messed up my thermostat and body clock for a while after too .
Despite not being able to run for three weeks , I regularly woke in the middle of the night , sweating , panicky and ready to dash outdoors into the darkness .
Worse than all of that , my wife refused to have any of my kit in our washing machine and I had to hobble to a laundrette and unload it and fumble for 50ps before the manager could smell the big pile of rotting outdoor gear and have it quarantined for scientific research .
I like doing things twice anyway , but I really canâ€ ™ t
wait to go back and go through it all again on 10 January .
The Spine calls itself â€œBritainâ€ ™ s most brutal raceâ€ � and itâ€ ™ s a single - stage ( meaning the clock is always ticking ) , mountain marathon along the 268-mile Pennine Way , Englandâ€ ™ s toughest national trail .
Youâ€ ™ re allowed seven days to complete it and race director Scott Gilmour calls his co - creation â€œalmost perfect in its crueltyâ€ � .
It isnâ€ ™ t just a foot race .
For some , itâ€ ™ s an obsession .
I struggle to contain and explain the affect the Spine Race has on me .
Itâ€ ™ s combination of three of my greatest passions : the Pennine Way , distance running and getting unrecognisably muddy .
I had hiked the Pennine Way , and fallen head over boggy heels in love with it , when I wrote the official guidebook for it .
So for 2014â€ ™ s Spine Race
I was prepared for the terrain , the weather and running a long way .
Less so the sleep deprivation , which trigged vivid hallucinations that led me off route and had me talking out load to non - existent people and big red Chinese lanterns .
What I also wasnâ€ ™ t prepared for was the eventâ€ ™ s special aura .
The staff â€ “ many are volunteers , giving up their week to look after us smelly , mid - life - crisis idiots
â€ “ are amazing , fetching cups of tea , taping up your foul feet , giving you endless encouragement , throughout the night â€ “ when theyâ€ ™ ve probably had less sleep than you .
Though there was tough love too .
At one point , when presumably my commitment to reaching Kirk Yetholm looked open to question , I was told â€œYou frigging [ not verbatim ] well will finish this race!â€ � by the Spineâ€ ™ s wonderful
â€œmother
superiorâ€ � , the legendary Nici Griffin .
Which was exactly what I needed .
Well that , dry socks and a gallon of strong tea .
Locals , too , have started to take some ownership of the four - year - old race .
On a rainy night in the Yorkshire dales , in the middle of nowhere , a stranger was waiting to give me water and advise me on the route .
On Hadrianâ€ ™ s wall , a hiker donated me food ( I wasnâ€ ™ t begging , I should state , but maybe looked less than well nourished ) .
I found out later that a hostel owner in Byrness , following the race online , stayed up well into the small hours on the remote chance I would call in .
At home , because of the trackers â€ “ designed for safety but turning the race into a social media phenomenon
â€
“
I got many messages of goodwill , often from people I hadnâ€ ™ t spoken to for ages , and from those I didnâ€
™ t realise had my number .
People who had no interest in running or mountains seemed addicted to watching what my daughter called â€œDaddyâ€ ™ s wiggly lineâ€ �

"Arnold Schwarzenegger has confirmed plans to star in a sixth Terminator movie , by which time the actor would be nearly 70 .
Schwarzenegger will return to his best known role , the T-800 cyborg , in Alan Taylorâ€ ™ s Terminator : Genysis this July .
But he told The Arnold Fans he would also be filming the follow - up .
â€œYes , of course ,
next year , â€ � said the former governor of California when asked to confirm his involvement by the fan site .
A sixth Terminator film would mark Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s fifth turn as the T-800 , though the former body - builder also appeared digitally in 2009â€ ™ s poorly - received Terminator Salvation .
With the movie unlikely to hit cinemas before 2017 , Schwarzenegger would be 69 or 70 by the time fans got to see it .
Trailers for Terminator Genysis suggest the film features Schwarzenegger as at least two different versions of the T-800 .
Taylorâ€ ™ s movie also stars Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor , Jason Clarke as John Connor and Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese , as well as Matt Smith , Lee Byung - hun and JK Simmons .
The storyline for the latest instalment of the man - versus - machine saga centres on Reeseâ€ ™ s journey across time to protect Sarah Connor from the Terminators sent to kill her in an effort to stop her son John from averting judgement day .
A similar scenario was played out in 1984â€ ™ s Terminator , but this time Reese finds that the past has changed and a completely different set of circumstances now exists in an alternate timeline .

Genysis hits US cinemas on 1 July and arrives in the UK two days later ."
"After choosing to avoid starring in McGâ€ ™ s poorly received sequel Terminator : Salvation in 2009 , it seems that Arnold Schwarzenegger has no regrets , as the actor has confessed to not liking the film .
In an interview with Good Morning America , the star spoke about his decision not to appear in the film .
â€œThank
God , â€ � he said .
â€œIt sucked.â€ �
The former Governor of California , who starred in the first three Terminator films and will star in this summerâ€ ™
s
Terminator : Genisys , was also diplomatic when asked which of the instalments was his favourite .
â€œI really canâ€
™ t say that , â€ � he said .
â€œI think that the three that I was in , they all three had their own personalities and interesting storylines.â€ �
Terminator : Salvation opened to poor reviews back in 2009 , despite a cast headlined by Christian Bale and an uncredited script polish from Jonathan Nolan .
It was initially seen as the start of a new trilogy but the rights to the franchise were sold and the series is instead receiving a reboot with Terminator : Genisys .
The film , which stars Schwarzenegger as well as Emilia Clarke and JK Simmons , focuses on Kyle Reese travelling through time to protect Sarah Connor again but finding an alternate timeline playing out .
Schwarzenegger has already signed on for the sixth film in the series ."

"Being an internationally beloved screen icon doesnâ€ ™ t necessarily make you a good actor .
Alas , I come to you with a heavy heart to share that Arnold Schwarzenegger , a performer I love with a primacy usually reserved only for close blood relatives , really has no business making a drama .
I give the odd , small film Maggie all the points in the world for experimenting with genre - blending and subverting audience expectations , but thereâ€ ™ s just too much about it that fails to connect .
I never want to be a critic that demands actors , or stories for that matter , should â€œstay in laneâ€ � , but if you insist on swimming upstream , you better have enough stamina .
Maybe the trouble lies in the the double - whammy : seeing Arnold try to emote ( yes , at one point a single tear rolls down his face , like snow melting on the side of Mount Rushmore ) , as well as Maggieâ€ ™ s attempt to fuse a dour indie drama with the tropes of dystopian fantasy .
As in the recent Interstellar , we begin in the American heartland on the brink of ( or maybe on the rebound from ? ) total collapse .
Thereâ€ ™ s a viral zombie infection in the air , but society soldiers on , listening not just to emergency broadcasts , but specific , recognisable programming like NPR .
The rate of infection is dropping due to some draconian measures involving unseen quarantine zones .
If everyone follows the rules , they may just get through this .
We first meet Maggie as sheâ€ ™ s picked up by her father , Wade ( Schwarzenegger ) , at a hospital .
For reasons never quite explained , she went out to the city , and itâ€ ™ s presumably there where she got bitten .
Despite Wadeâ€ ™ s enormous build ( and never - addressed Austrian accent , which I imagine is unusual for farms outside Kansas City ) , he is powerless to help his daughter .
Once bitten , there will eventually come â€œthe turnâ€ � .
Itâ€ ™ s the waiting period that differentiates Maggie from other zombie stories .
There are usually eight weeks between exposure and a victimâ€ ™ s debut as a flesh - gobbling monster .
Youâ€ ™
d think thereâ€ ™ d be a set structure , but the impression is that everyone on Earth is still dealing with this one day at a time .
And until your big day comes when someone must either dump you off at a quarantine zone , from which only rumours escape , or shoot you , you basically just go home and try to live your life .
It isnâ€ ™ t that easy , of course , and what youâ€ ™ ve paid to see isnâ€ ™ t Arnold mowing down zombies ( though there is a tiny bit of this ) ,
itâ€ ™ s Arnold staggering through agonised limbo as he tries to avoid thinking about what heâ€ ™ ll do when he has to put his daughter down .
Thatâ€ ™ s a serious bit of business , of course , and certainly has potential .
Unfortunately , the road there is extremely slow .
The moments when Arnold just has to look like a lion with a thorn in his paw work okay , but when heâ€ ™ s got dialogue to deliver , well , thatâ€ ™ s when you realise why heâ€ ™ s never done heavier material like this before .
Maggie is lacking in action , so must rely on its performances to succeed .
The casting certainly makes it notable as a curiosity , but as cinema itâ€ ™ s the hobbling dead ."

"Arnold Schwarzenegger is apparently on a mission to terminate the myth that protecting the environment hurts the economy .
The actor and former politician is in Australia to promote his new film Terminator Genisys , the first a planned new trilogy for the popular movie franchise .
During his stint as governor of California between 2003 and 2011 , Schwarzenegger passed the first emissions trading scheme in the United States .
He has said all countries , including Australia , need to lift their game when it comes to tackling climate change .
â€œIn order for us to be successful the whole world has to work together ...
Australia , Austria , the US â€ “ everybody has to work together , â€ �
Schwarzenegger told Channel Tenâ€
™ s
The Project on Friday night .
â€œSo I am on a mission ,
Iâ€ ™ m on an environmental crusade to go and motivate everyone to go in that direction.â€
�
Schwarzenegger said after California introduced tough new environmental laws the stateâ€ ™ s economic growth well outpaced the national rate .
â€œThe thing that you always hear when you do that is â€˜this will hurt the economyâ€ ™ ,â€ � he said .
â€œGoing green and protecting the environment did not hurt the economy , itâ€ ™ s a bunch of nonsense.â€ � Australiaâ€ ™ s prime minister , Tony Abbott , has consistently criticised the former Labor governmentâ€ ™ s carbon tax , which has been repealed .
He has called the tax destructive and said his government would â€œnever do anything that damages the economyâ€ � .
Terminator Genisys opens in Australian cinemas on July 1 With Australian Associated Press"
"James Cameron has given his surprise seal of approval to upcoming science fiction sequel Terminator : Genisys , more than a decade after claiming the time - travelling saga should have been shut down after its first two iconic films .
Cameron introduced the world to Arnold Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s unflinching T-800 cyborg in 1984â€ ™ s The Terminator , and returned to complete the story with 1991â€ ™ s Terminator 2 : Judgment Day , by which time the Austrian former bodybuilder had become a huge Hollywood star .
He famously said he had â€œtold the storyâ€ � over the course of the two movies , which culminated with John and Sarah Connor teaming up with a new T-800 ( still Schwarzenegger ) to avert the machine apocalypse .
But speaking to Yahoo !
Movies , Cameron said he was prepared to make a dramatic u - turn after catching an early screening of Terminator Genisys .
â€œI feel like the franchise has been reinvigorated , like this is a renaissance , â€ � said the Avatar director .
â€œThe new film , which I think of as the third film [ in the series ] , you see [ Arnold Schwarzenegger ] take the character even further .
â€œI had no idea what to expect sitting down , I had no involvement in making this film ,
â€ � added Cameron .
â€œIf you like the Terminator films , youâ€ ™ re gon na love this movie.â€ �
The director , who previously dismissed 2003â€ ™ s Terminator 3 : Rise of the Machines and 2009â€ ™ s Terminator Salvation as unworthy of the name , said he had been won over by the new filmâ€ ™ s key plot twist , controversially given away in a recent trailer .
The narrative curveball sees Jason Clarkeâ€ ™ s usually heroic John Connor returning to 1984 as some kind of cyborg villain in the new timeline .
â€œThe idea of taking John Connor and flipping him to the bad guy , itâ€ ™ s kinda cool , because you got to riff against expectations , â€ � said Cameron .
â€œItâ€ ™ s all about the twists.â€ � Terminator : Genisys stars Game of Thronesâ€ ™ Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor and Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese , with Schwarzenegger returning to one of his best known roles at the age of 67 .
In the new storyline , John Connor once again sends his key lieutenant back in time to save his mother from machine terminators and ensure his own survival .
But when Reese arrives in the past , he discovers Sarah is no longer the innocent target seen in 1984â€ ™ s The Terminator .
Cameron himself fed the film - makers the mechanism which allowed them to recast the former California governor , suggesting that a Terminator who spent decades in the past while waiting to spring into action might outwardly age while their machine skeleton remained in perfect working condition .
Cameronâ€ ™ s intervention could prove a box office boon for Alan Taylorâ€ ™ s film after early trailers failed to win over fans disappointed by the previous two movies .
Terminator :
Genisys opens round the world at the start of July ."
"The former governor of the state of California is slumped in a black leather armchair after a hard day terminating in a tropically humid New Orleans .
On his face is a layer of putty - like prosthetic makeup , luminous mint in colour and presumably for green - screen masking , a semicircular metallic attachment glued around it , suggesting that the T-800 may have lost another electronic eyeball today .
Long the sanest Republican politician in the country , Arnold Schwarzenegger is back in the saddle as Americaâ€ ™ s action hero .
About to turn 67 , he is in excellent shape , as you would expect , though he looks knackered after his exertions in the heat .
â€œThere are different stages of deterioration for the T-800,â€ �
he says , pointing at his face .
â€œStage one is scratches , stage two is worse .
This is stage five , and thereâ€ ™ s a stage six after this , so I will definitely be taking a beating or two.â€ � His accent is heavy , but his English is excellent , with a very Germanic meticulousness regarding grammar and syntax .
Tired as he is , Schwarzenegger is nonetheless in characteristically tireless form as the promoter - in - chief of his own product ; everything he says is designed to sell it .
â€œItâ€
™
s terrific because I think very few times
, if any , can I remember that the same person has been involved in the same franchise , from 1984 to 2015 , over 30 years .
I donâ€
™
t know of another example
, not James Bond , not Batman â€ “ the actors always change .
There are no others , â€ � he avows with conviction .
( It feels best not to mention Die Hard when heâ€ ™ s on such a roll . )
His director is a â€œvisionary , â€ � , his collaborators â€œamazingly talentedâ€ � and â€œincredibly
dedicatedâ€ � , and so on .
Heâ€ ™ s an endearingly relentless steamroller of a salesman .
Schwarzenegger is also kind enough to share with us some of the tips he offers in his own motivational speeches ( a second money - spinning career for every ex - politician ) : â€œHave a clear idea of what youâ€ ™ re doing ;
donâ€ ™ t listen to the naysayers ; work your ass off ; give something back , donâ€ ™ t just take.â€ �
Itâ€ ™ s
the classic Horatio Alger , up - by - your - bootstraps , all - American recipe for getting ahead , and God knows , it worked for Arnie .
Here he is with an odyssey of success behind him , riches in the bank and the summit of his political ambitions achieved .
All things considered , he didnâ€ ™ t do too badly , and , as a liberal Republican , he set things up quite nicely for his Democratic successor Jerry Brown , who doesnâ€ ™ t face the Republican supermajority in the State Assembly that scuppered Arnieâ€ ™ s best ideas , some of which Brown has now adopted .
But the â€œGropenfuhrerâ€ � allegations that dogged him in his first gubernatorial campaign were echoed after a retirement forced by the scandal of a child born to his housekeeper years before , resulting in separation from his wife of 29 years , Maria Shriver of the Kennedy dynasty .
There is a lot to climb back from , then .
Today , there is something poignant and slightly shrunken about Schwarzenegger as he talks about his upcoming projects .
â€œTriplets , the sequel to Twins , The Expendables 3â€ � : every one a sequel or a reboot , everything from yesterday .
At one point I almost feel bad for finding out Iâ€ ™ m fractionally taller than he is .
Terminator Genisys , however , looks like the real deal , and possibly his salvation .
Filming of the fifth Terminator movie is taking place , appropriately enough , in the ruins of our recently collapsed civilisation .
In this case , itâ€ ™ s the hollowed - out shell of what was once a big - box Loweâ€ ™ s
Home Improvement superstore , with ceilings
50 ft high and a vast interior space capable of holding six or seven different indoor sets for the movie .
Loweâ€ ™ s didnâ€
™ t go under in the financial collapse of 2008 , but only because it shut down tonnes of branches like this one .
Loweâ€ ™ s is never coming back here , and neither are the four big - boxes adjacent to it , all of them echoingly vacant and sombre .
Everything about the Terminator Genisys set is on a massive scale .
In the vast parking lot outside the site of the main location , 30 Star Waggon trailers are parked side by side , in diminishing perspective toward the low horizon .
When the lunch - bell sounds , the craft services section â€ “ five huge tents joined together â€ “ is
so packed itâ€ ™ s like the wedding in The Godfather .
â€œItâ€ ™ s in the nature of the beast , â€ � says director Alan Taylor ,
â€œand itâ€ ™ s a big beast , a highly collaborative process .
Much of the film - making goes on not on the set , but in post and in the effects labs all over the planet .
And we have two full - time units shooting .
The second unit even has its own separate base of operations .
That is big.â€ �
And this man has worked on Game of Thrones , so he knows .
Itâ€ ™ s July 2014 in a monsoonal , enervatingly humid New Orleans , the kind of feverishly torpid , exhausting Louisiana day that makes you hallucinate about fjords and ice - fishing .
Indoors , itâ€ ™ s worse ; the air doesnâ€ ™ t stir .
Between the baffle - walls and partitions are glimpses of large movie set - pieces .
Near the floor - to - ceiling entrance , there is what looks like an electricity substation , all scary - looking pylons and zap - youâ€ ™ re - dead conductors and transformers , an excellent location for a fight to the last between a couple of T-800s .
Out of sight somewhere is the Cyberdyne Laboratories set , visible only on a monitor in the green room on which , for a few minutes , Jason Clarke , who plays John Connor , acts out a scene with Courtney B Vanceâ€ ™ s Dr Miles Dyson .
This is as close to a spoiler as we will get all day , the admirably ( and annoyingly ) close - mouthed , spoiler - phobic cast and crew going all out to keep us from learning too many details of the narrative â€ “ or indeed , any at all .
But Connor , hero of the War Against the Machines , messiah of post - apocalyptic mankind ... here in the present day ... at Cyberdyne ?
That stuck in my mind .
For a year .
The Terminator franchise has endured its own odyssey since the fourth , Arnie - less entry , Terminator Salvation , set entirely in the future as mankind wars with the machines .
Schwarzenegger , whose victorious gubernatorial campaign in 2003 surely benefited from the simultaneous summer release of Terminator 3 : Rise of the Machines , wasnâ€ ™ t around for Salvation , â€œand anyway
, I didnâ€ ™ t like the script .
But the day I left the governorâ€ ™ s office , I got a phone call saying that the Ellisons had bought the rights to the franchise.â€
�
The Ellisons are Megan and David ,
the children of billionaire Oracle chairman Larry Elllison , each of whom has their own production company : Meganâ€ ™ s
Annapurna Pictures , which finances the kind of middle - budget arthouse projects that the studios wonâ€ ™ t touch in the current comic - book monoculture ( Her , Foxcatcher , The Master ) ; and Davidâ€ ™ s Skydance Productions , which has specialised in remakes , sequels and reboots such as True Grit , Star Trek : Into Darkness and GI Joe : Retaliation .
They elected for Skydance to handle T5 .
The franchise fell on bad times in the post-2008 economy , but in the end it arose from the ashes of various bankruptcy fire - sales .
Everyone interested in Terminator agreed that they disliked McGâ€ ™ s Terminator Salvation , director Alan Taylor ( The Sopranos , Mad Men , Game of Thrones ) in particular .
â€œWhat detracted from it for me was that it was set entirely in the future .
Part of the mythology and the fun is that theyâ€ ™ re set in a world we know and can comprehend , and then into that world comes this incomprehensible , unstoppable force .
Seeing that relentlessness rampaging in our world is key to the mythology .
So they abandoned one of the things I love most .
We begin in the future , showing events that have been mentioned in previous movies , but were never staged .
And then you find yourself in our world .
Weâ€ ™ re a very different animal .
One of the things I admire about James Cameronâ€ ™ s original T1 and T2 is that theyâ€ ™ re very simple , very pure .
Weâ€ ™ re a lot more complex than that , which is a challenge.â€
� Consultations were had with franchise creator Cameron , who gave his blessing , and Arnie entered talks ( â€œWith no Arnie , as far as I was concerned , there would be no movie â€ “ and we had no plan B
, â€ � says Ellisonâ€ ™ s co - producer , Dana Goldberg ) .
A script was finally commissioned from Patrick Lussier and Laeta Kalogridis , and once it was deemed strong enough to underpin a projected trilogy of movies , things really got under way .
As David Ellison says : â€œIt was nice to wash off 30 years of built - up complications and go at it all over again as a cohesive new franchise.â€ �
But he insists this isnâ€ ™ t Terminator part five , or a reboot , or in any way a betrayal of the franchise .
â€œWe didnâ€ ™ t want to just recreate the movies Cameron made , we wanted to take his incredible universe and update it to have a relevance for today .
So it is very , very reverential to the canon thatâ€ ™ s been established , just heading in new directions.â€ � Cast and crew insist that the first two Terminator movies â€ “ the only ones , as far as I can divine , that theyâ€ ™ re interested in â€ “ were made in the shadow of the cold war .
Back then the theme of man against intrusive , potentially insurgent technology was still strictly a sci - fi staple .
Nowadays itâ€ ™ s the world we all live in , and the franchise is adjusting itself accordingly .
â€œThat cold war paranoia is the larger framework of the first two movies , â€ � says Ellison ,
â€œbut now we are so reliant on technology that â€ “
I mean , I see six or seven iPhones on the table in front of me , at least two of which have a thumbprint - ID security feature on them .
SkyNet no longer needs to beat down your front door because you lined up in front of the Apple store and invited the wolf to dinner .
So a commentary on technology and society , and how they interact , is a very important part of this story.â€ �
Clarke agrees :
â€œIf you read books like The Singularity
Is Near [ by Ray Kurzweil ]
, you know technology is going to be a problem , artificial intelligence reaching that point where it can master us , where one day the machines , which weâ€ ™ ve built to function at no higher level than a servant or a dog , are gon na go all Animal Farm on us and move into the bed â€
“ and then youâ€ ™ re finished!â€

( This is the first time Iâ€ ™ ve ever heard his native Australian accent . )
A year later , back in Hollywood , weâ€ ™ re shown enough of Terminator Genisys to hazard a few good guesses , and one major mystery from New Orleans is solved .
Connor does indeed return from the future â€ “ or does he ?
The John Connor who arrives in 2015 is a Terminator himself , and he kills some surprising people .
And this time around , the person who , in accordance with established Terminator tradition , gets to say , â€œCome with me if you wanna live!â€ � is Sarah Connor herself , played by Game of Thronesâ€ ™ Emilia Clarke .
She is following in the footsteps of her GoTs cast - mate Lena Headey , who starred in the promising but soon - cancelled TV adjunct to the franchise , Terminator :
The Sarah Connor Chronicles , but she still hews to the Linda Hamilton version of the character .
â€¢
This article was amended on 12 June 2015 .
An earlier version misspelled Ray Kurzweilâ€ ™ s name as Raymond Kurzwell .
â€œThere was obviously an incredible amount of pressure following in the footsteps of Linda Hamilton , playing one of the most iconic female roles ever , but I didnâ€ ™ t feel like I could turn it down .
But my backstory is such that Sarah is essentially an entirely different character.â€
�
Playing the Queen of Dragons in GoT , Clarke had done her homework on strong women : she liked Katharine Hepburn in Adamâ€ ™
s
Rib , Cate Blanchettâ€ ™ s Elizabeth and Shirley MacLaine in The Apartment .
â€œTop of the list : Linda Hamilton in T2.â€
�
As she reminds me , â€œIâ€ ™ m the only girl on this movie , running with the boys , so I had to show my mettle , show â€ ™ em how itâ€ ™ s done !
Iâ€ ™ m not allowed to slow down .
Iâ€ ™ ve been warned that now Iâ€ ™ m fanboy - fodder for life , and my dark hair is no longer my disguise - my cover is totally blown , Iâ€ ™ m screwed!â€ � she chuckles delightedly , straightens her Terminating outfit , and heads back to the set to kick another hundred acres of robot ass .
Delighted that he has a good product to hawk , Schwarzenegger is exuberant and upbeat ; a far more effervescent , less dejected - looking figure , at our second encounter in Hollywood last month , with the swampy , debilitating haze of New Orleans firmly in the past .
Most delightful for him :
James Cameronâ€ ™ s blessing .
â€œI think he was very happy .
I talk to him all the time .
I heard no complaints.â€

Again .
The Terminator franchise stumbles out of the wreckage of the critically savaged sequel Salvation , this time with the participation of the original model , Arnold Schwarzenegger , and the lavish endorsement of series co - creator James Cameron .
Salvation â€œsuckedâ€ � and Genisys , weâ€ ™ ve been told , is a new dawn .
In this alternate timeline , the genius of 1984â€ ™ s splendidly cheesy The Terminator and its sleek , superior follow - up Terminator 2 : Judgment Day , are the only history that matters .
Itâ€ ™ s the kind of thing the fans want to hear .
But the reality is that Terminator Genisys is part remake , part reboot , mostly failure .
Sold simultaneously on the promise of returning to the franchiseâ€ ™ s roots and innovating for a new generation , instead , Thor :
The Dark World director Alan Taylorâ€ ™ s sequel apes the first two filmsâ€ ™ iconicism , but falls short of achieving any in its own right .
Kyle Reese ( Jai Courtney ) is sent back in time by John Connor ( Jason Clarke ) to protect his mother , Sarah Connor ( Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke ) , from the Terminator .
Reese arrives in 1984 as per the original film , but â€ “ somehow ( something about a â€œnexusâ€ � ) â€ “
the timelineâ€ ™ s altered and in this reality itâ€ ™ s
Sarah looking out for Kyle .
Theyâ€ ™ re aided by a version of the Terminator ( re - christened the Guardian and played by Schwarzenegger )
thatâ€ ™ s been watching out for Sarah since an attack on her family by the machines left her orphaned as a child .
She calls him â€œPopsâ€ � , while he â€ “ still , in any timeline you like , a machine â€ “ finds her affection baffling .
The first hour of the film sees Taylor recreating Cameronâ€ ™ s original in a style similar to Gus van Santâ€ ™ s shot - by - shot remake of Psycho .
Thereâ€ ™ s the yellow dump truck , a lookalike of its cigar - chomping driver and naked CGI Arnold , crouched in the shallow blasted out by his time - travelling orb .
The punks are still there , still wondering whatâ€ ™ s wrong with this picture .
Kyleâ€ ™
s feathercut has gone , but he still pulls on his stolen high tops languorously enough to give the Nike branding a good showing .
Itâ€ ™ s an elaborate exercise in nostalgia that will delight the faithful and confuse the newcomer .
The second half of the film is for them , where Genisys spins off into a peppy , self - aware parody of everything that made the early films unique .
The lore is disconnected and rewired , making for a confusing , but sporadically entertaining ride for anyone who remembers the originals .
At times Taylor offers a Comic Relief sketch version of The Terminator : more ridiculous than revolutionary .
Genisys â€ “ because of its 12A certification
â€ “ lacks the first two chaptersâ€ ™ wallop .
Cameronâ€ ™
s films were unusual for mainstream cinema in that they sutured violence to character to give it meaning .
The Terminator was murderous without thought , but with cause .
The gore â€ “ the body horror of the Terminator repairing an eye socket or flaying an arm to prove a point
â€ “ was grounded in the story .
The slaughter of humanity felt real .
Thereâ€ ™ s no fear here .
No real sense of dread .
The techno - paranoid get an Apple - ish operating system ( the Genisys of the title ) to worry about , but a tablet canâ€ ™ t inspire terror .
The CGI doesnâ€ ™ t look to have evolved much from Judgement Day .
The film feels soft and phoney .
In the original Terminator Kyle Reese described how the humans could tell when the robots were trying to pass themselves off as alive : â€œThey had rubber skin .
We spotted them easy.â€
�
Watching Genisys , you can relate .
Salvation was boring , but Genisys makes you sad .
Risk - averse Hollywood has made a crash - test dummy of a once great franchise , simply throwing everything at it to see what it stands .
Itâ€ ™ s heartbreaking to watch Arnie execute the same old programmes : the terrible robo - smile ; the slang ; the wear and tear of his living tissue revealing the cyborg underneath .
â€œOld , but not obsolete , â€ �
the Terminator / Guardian tells us when his age is brought into question .
In truth , it feels like both .
In a sense , the Terminator franchise wrote the code for Hollywoodâ€ ™ s current creative stagnation .
Judgment Day redefined the action genre , CGI and the star system , creating a thirst for sequels that still leads studio decision - making today .
It was a radical film , one that escaped the B - movie trappings of its predecessor by locking into a genuinely terrifying vision of mankind supplanted .
Cameron wasnâ€ ™ t scared to move on either .
The penultimate scene â€ “ with the Terminator sacrificing himself to save the future
â€ “ implied the director was quitting while he was ahead .
Today â€ “ with our rebooted , rebooted Spider - Man and ever - expanding
â€œcinematic universesâ€ �
â€ “ not even death can kill a pop culture hero .
Yet Genisysâ€ ™ s alternate universe yarn smacks of a particular desperation : the nuclear option in Hollywoodâ€ ™ s War on Jeopardy .
Cameron has called this â€œthe officialâ€ � third Terminator film , but itâ€ ™ s just another sequel .
Thereâ€ ™ s talk of two more of these .
They are on the production line , being built now to make our future just that little bit more drab .
The war is over .
The machines have won ."
"Ridicule his abilities as you wish but Arnold Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s films have made over $ 4bn worldwide over a 30 year period , making him one of the most successful actors of all time .
And while this might have less to do with his impeccably emotive line delivery and more to do with his hulking physical presence , heâ€ ™ s sustained a surprisingly varied career nonetheless .
This week he returns to play his most iconic role in Terminator Genisys and , since itâ€ ™ s not going down as one of his greatest films , hereâ€ ™ s what weâ€ ™ d pick instead .
Pumping Iron
Perhaps the only actor to have ever broken out in a documentary , Arnieâ€ ™ s appearance in this bodybuilding doc has brought him both rewards and embarrassment .
The 30-year - old goes into great , great detail about his routine , showing off his physique at any given moment .
In this haunting clip , we hear him compare weight training to ejaculating .
Total Recall Long before Colin Farrell and director Len Wiseman brought roughly nothing to the table in the 2012 remake , Paul Verhoeven and Arnie added surprising smarts to this 1990 sci - fi thriller .
A thin layer of satire added to a pacey action plot made it one of Arnieâ€ ™ s most purely enjoyable films .
Terminator 2 :
Judgment Day
The first Terminator is a brilliantly spare thriller , as ruthlessly efficient as Arnieâ€ ™ s deadly android , but James Cameronâ€ ™ s 1991
sequel transformed a B - movie into a blockbuster .
Utilising CGI in a way that no one had before , the effects still hold up to this day and the undervalued storytelling makes it a model on how to keep a broad audience on the edge of their seats .
Last Action Hero Unfairly overlooked , this 1993 meta - action film provided Arnie with a chance to poke fun at his persona , quite literally , as the actor played himself .
Released a week after Jurassic Park , it was always somewhat doomed , with a complicated premise that was a little too knowing and also a little too nuts to work on the masses .
True Lies Arnieâ€
™ s attempts at comedy were mixed and , given the failure of Last Action Hero , itâ€ ™ d be understandable if he stayed away from the genre completely .
But reuniting with James Cameron for this 1994 attempt was a stroke of genius .
Making sure the action quota was kept in check while also ensuring a steady stream of laughs , the balance was perfectly managed and proved , yet again , that Arnie works best when paired with Cameron ."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger has given the sequels to his 1987 blockbuster Predator a skinning , saying the follow - up films â€ “ neither of which starred him â€ “ were not â€œsatisfactory to the audienceâ€ � .
When asked in a Q and A hosted by Reddit whether he would consider appearing in an upcoming franchise reboot helmed by Iron Man 3 director Shane Black , Schwarzenegger revealed that he has â€œnot been askedâ€ � , but that Blackâ€ ™ s talents as a â€œgreatâ€ � writer and director would ensure that â€œit would become a great movieâ€ � , even without his involvement .
He went on to describe the first Predator as his â€œabsolute favouriteâ€ � of the series , and criticised the latter films implying that the the studios rushed them in order to make a quick buck .
â€œThe sad story is that sometimes studios do a great job with creating sequels , and sometimes they really screw it up bad , and it all has to do with greed , â€ � he said .
â€œThey sometimes want to do it really cheap and make as much money as possible , so they donâ€
™ t hire the right cast or the right director.â€
�
Schwarzenegger presumably does not feel the same way about the latest instalment of the Terminator franchise .
In Terminator Genisys he again returns to his best - known role as the titular cyborg , although that film has been received largely negatively by critics .
He has never shown the same devotion for the Predator franchise since starring in the original back in 1987 , and turned down the offer to appear in 1990â€ ™ s Predator 2 due to a salary dispute .
The series has continued in his absence , spawning Predators in 2010 , Alien vs. Predator in 2004 and Aliens vs. Predator : Requiem in 2007 ."
"He is a young British graphic designer who always wanted to work in the film industry , but even in his wildest dreams Henry Hobson never imagined making his directorial debut with his boyhood hero â€ “ Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Maggie , a small budget , independent thriller about a viral pandemic , was an unlikely choice for Schwarzenegger .
The film , which will be released in UK cinemas this month , was written by a first - time screenwriter and directed by Hobson , who has spent the last 15 years designing title and credit sequences for other peopleâ€ ™ s films .
It had a budget of $ 1.4 m ( Â£900,000 ) the director said .
Yet Schwarzenegger came on board as both actor and producer after reading the script , playing against type as a protective father who fights to save his adolescent daughter when she becomes infected with a walking - dead virus .
It is both a zombie thriller and a human story about the impact of illness .
Hobson , 34 , born in Salisbury , Wiltshire , has no film connections in his family .
His father is a university lecturer , his mother a radiographer .
He could barely believe it as he watched the footage produced during the filmâ€ ™ s 25-day shoot .
Schwarzenegger is in almost every scene .
â€œ[I thought ] this isnâ€ ™ t quite normal .
This is someone Iâ€ ™ ve grown up with seeing on screen â€ ¦ a pinch - yourself moment , â€ �
he said .
Schwarzenegger became intrigued by the script â€ “ written by John Scott , a Nasa engineer â€ “ after it appeared on the industryâ€ ™ s
â€œblack listâ€ � , for the best unproduced screenplays .
â€œWhen
I read it
, I knew I had to do it ,
â€ � the actor recalls in the production notes .
â€œIt is more vulnerable than any role I have played , more real , more emotional .
Youâ€ ™ re used to seeing me play the ubermensch , the action hero bullets canâ€ ™ t seem to hit .
â€œIn Maggie , I am the everyman â€ ¦ dealing with the most basic concerns â€ “ protecting his family.â€ �
After training at the Royal College of Art â€ “ inspired by another former student , Sir Ridley Scott , who went on to become an Oscar - winning director â€ “ Hobson designed the title , end and credit sequences for films such as Robin Hood and Sherlock Holmes .
There is a â€œcommunity of ardent graphic design fansâ€ � , but audiences are generally more interested in their popcorn or in grabbing their coats when the credits roll : â€œYouâ€ ™ ll see the film , watch your work come on â€ “
and then you see all these faces turning [ away from the screen],â€
� Hobson said .
He used his skills as a visual artist to woo Schwarzenegger , producing storyboard images that were so intricate and extensive , they spanned some 200 pages .
They detailed â€œmy thoughts behind each sceneâ€ � , he said .
â€œ[Schwarzenegger had ] never seen that before â€ ¦ It put him in my headspace.â€ � Hobson produced similar images for the rest of his cast , including Abigail Breslin , Oscar - nominated for Little Miss Sunshine , and Joely Richardson , whose recent films include Endless Love .
Despite taking a break from movies to become Californiaâ€ ™ s governor from 2003 to 2011 , his popularity remains high .
Having struggled to interest financiers , Maggieâ€ ™ s budget was found as soon as Schwarzenegger was attached to the project .
â€œHe was such a dedicated actor , â€ � said Hobson .
â€œI felt I was able to get an untapped gem with Arnold .
Heâ€
™ s such an amiable personality .
He puts everyone at ease.â€ �
The film will be released on 24 July .
It premiered at the Tribeca film festival in April to mixed reviews .
Rupert Preston , managing director of Vertigo , the filmâ€ ™ s UK distributor , said : â€œFor a first - time director on a fairly low - budget , very independent movie , to attach one of the biggest stars in the world is extraordinary.â€ �"
"Arnold Schwarzenegger has been chosen by the French government to join Nobel prizewinners , philosophers , UN secretary generals , spiritual leaders and theologians to make the moral case for the world to act urgently on climate change .
Talking at the worldâ€ ™ s first summit of conscience for the climate on Tuesday â€ “ ahead of the crucial UN climate change meeting in the city in December â€ “ the Terminator star and former California governor declared the science debate over , saying planetary catastrophe could only be avoided with ethical action : â€œIâ€ ™ ve starred in a lot of science fiction movies and , let me tell you something , climate change is not science fiction , this is a battle in the real world , it is impacting us right now .
â€œI believe the science is in .
The debate is over and the time for action is now , â€ �
he told an invited audience of intellectuals and spiritual leaders from all faiths .
â€œThis is bigger than any movie , this is the challenge of our time .
And it is our responsibility to leave this world a better place than we found it , but right now we are failing future generations.â€ �
â€œThis year alone we will dump 40bn tonnes of carbon emissions into our atmosphere .
The World Health Organization says that air pollution causes over 7 million premature deaths every year and all over the world we can see flooding , monster storms , droughts and wild - fires that are completely out of control.â€
�
The meeting , called by French president FranÃ§ois Hollande ahead of the Paris political summit , was intended to put pressure on governments to act by mobilising millions of people to declare publicly that they â€œcaredâ€ � for earth .
Former UN secretary general Kofi Annan , chair of the Elders group of former world leaders , echoed a phrase attributed to Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev talking about nuclear war in 1979 , saying â€œclimate change would leave the living envying the deadâ€ � .
â€œIf action is not taken immediately my grandson will live in a world suffering heat waves , severe droughts and floods .
Cities like new York and Venice will drown .
We are on the brink of catastrophe but the solution to the climate crisis can not be left to governments alone ...
People are taking the lead and demanding change .
We must not fail them.â€ �
Irish president Michael Higgins called for moral courage .
â€œOur current malaise is grounded in a cynicism we must confront .
We need to confront the cult of the individual and insatiable consumption and replace it with a new thinking .
We must reconcile science with ethics.â€ � Cardinal Peter Turkson , Ghanaian president of the Vaticanâ€ ™ s Pontifical council for justice and peace , who helped Pope Francis write the encyclical on human ecology published last month , said that the climate is a common good .
â€œIt is a global common meant for all but the costs are being borne by those who have least contributed to it .
â€œAt stake now is the wellbeing of the earth , our common hope .
What we need is care .
When we care for something it is with passion and commitment of the heart .
Thatâ€ ™ s why Pope Francis called for care of the earth .
A sense of passion is needed.â€ � Muslim theologians , Christians and Hindus said they saw climate change both as an existential threat and as an opportunity for renewal .
Sheikh Bentounes , leader of the Sufi brotherhood Alawiya , urged mankind to carry â€œa hope of a futureâ€ � .
â€œThe prophet Mohammed called on man to plant and sow seeds .
He said â€˜Even at the end of times continue to plant and sow.â€ ™
We have responsibility to carry this hope to the end .
This tiny vessel in infinite space that we call earth is unique.â€ � Daoists , Confucians , shamans , Jesuits , Bhuddists and others called for politicians to act on behalf of humankind at Paris .
Patriarch Bartholomew , leader of 300 million Orthodox Christians , despaired at humanityâ€ ™ s blindness , but quoted writer Fyodor Dostoevsky saying that â€œbeauty would save the earthâ€ � .
â€œScientists and theologians agree that humanity depends on nature .
We must accept the moral imperative for action .
Religion must also be involved in the crucial question of climate changeâ€ � , said Bartholomew .
David Rosen , director of inter - religious affairs at the American Jewish Committee , said : â€œClimate change takes place where there is unbridled avarice .
It is a symptom of the disease and cry for us to respond .
It is the opportunity for humans to rediscover the higher values than materialism and indulgence.â€ �
Hindu leader Nandita Krishna , who has restored 50 sacred forests , feared that insatiable greed had gripped everyone on earth and this had led to climate change .
â€œWe can not replicate the environment or create it .
Unless we see the divine in creation we will not understand our role and duty as humans , â€ �
she said .
Nobel prizewinning economist Mohemed Yunus , founder of the Grameen bank in Bangladesh , said technology could help achieve zero poverty and zero carbon emissions .
â€œ[But ] technology today is in the hands of the money makers and the war - makers .
They are not directing it to solve the problems of the world.â€ �
It was left to 86-year - old Benin writer and politician Albert TeveodjrÃ © to represent the views of secular thinkers .
â€œNature was loaned to us as a place to live .
I witness a world of profit at all costs which will ruin the envronment and devastate everything .
I am very worried .
I think I will leave the world with many worries.â€ �"
"Itâ€ ™ s a zombie film staple : that awful moment when a loved one has been infected by the virus and now youâ€ ™ ve got some hard choices .
Maggie stretches this idea out to one interminably boring and mawkish film , overlaid with YA - dystopian self - pity .
In a standard - issue post - apocalyptic world of car - wreck - strewn highways and creepy deserted convenience stores , Maggie ( Abigail Breslin ) has been infected by the zombie bug ; sheâ€ ™ s in the initial stages of skin discolouration on her hands , being cared for by her grizzled old uninfected dad , played by Arnold Schwarzenegger .
He has already had the task of taking his axe to his erstwhile lovely neighbours , who came shambling on to his property .
Now he has to decide if and when to flick the safety off his shotgun and lead poor , confused Maggie out into the back yard .
But first theyâ€ ™ ve got a bit more bonding and indie acting to do , and Maggie must bid farewell to some equally stricken boy admirer , whoâ€ ™ s got those same icky black veins starting to creep up his cute face .
The whole thing is drowning in body fluids and emo slush .
As for producer - star Arnie , trudging grimly through this nonsense , thereâ€ ™ s no sign of the former Governator and Terminator turning into the Seriousactingator ."

"Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a man ruefully getting by in an America yet again afflicted by the walking dead ; for once , a movie in which heâ€ ™ s the person least likely to say : â€œIâ€ ™ ll be back.â€ �
But this is a zombie story less about sudden scares than about emotional notes , for Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s character has a daughter ( Abigail Breslin ) whoâ€ ™ s been bitten and is fated to turn â€œnecroambulistâ€ � , as the clinical term has it here .
An enterprisingly low - key debut by British title sequence designer Henry Hobson , Maggie conjures up a world that has turned an acrid blend of grey and sepia ; the grim lyricism suggests a profoundly depressed Terrence Malick .
As a tragedy of teenage terminal illness , Maggie belongs less in the horror cycle than with those stories of premature death ( eg The Fault in Our Stars )
that are the latter - day version of 19th - century tubercular romance , and it hits notes of pathos more often than it achieves genuine poignancy .
But Breslin is affecting as the ordinary young woman beneath the festering flesh , while Arnie shows a delicacy youâ€ ™ d never have suspected , at least not from his current TV ads with meerkats ."
"The blockbuster Heâ€ ™ ll be back .
Arnold Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s dusty catchphrase was looking a mite optimistic a few weeks ago , after Terminator Genisysâ€ ™ s under - powered launch â€
“ as was Paramountâ€
™ s decision to pencil in a 19 May 2017 release for a sixth instalment to the franchise .
A stonking $ 27.4 m opening Sunday in China changes all that , boosting the $ 155m - budget film much closer to the $ 400 m mark , and the kind of profit margin that gets dead android fingers twitching again .
Itâ€ ™ s the countryâ€ ™ s fourth biggest opening day , behind Furious 7 ( $ 63 m ) ,
Avengers : Age of Ultron ( $ 33.9 m ) and Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen ( $ 30 m )
â€ “ and far in advance of the US first day ( $ 8.9 m ) .
China audiences were probably gagging for Hollywood product after the two - month blackout , and that old publicity warhorse Schwarzenegger took full advantage , personally chaperoning the film into the country ( even appearing on the local version of The Voice ) .
Even if its Chinese run doesnâ€ ™ t have the stamina to top the American one ( $ 89.1 m so far )
â€ “ a long queue of postponed US blockbusters in the coming weeks
make that far from a foregone conclusion â€ “ Terminator Genisys is shaping up to be the biggest exemplar yet for a significant trend : films saved by China .
Hollywood has been increasingly reliant on overseas box office to rescue its stragglers , but these days China can manage it almost singlehandedly in many cases .
Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s own Expendables 3 ( 35.4 % Chinese gross ) , Pacific Rim ( 27.2 % ) , Edge of Tomorrow ( 17.8 % ) and Robocop ( 20.9 % ) were all high - cost US underachievers for which a big Chinese push made the crucial difference .
So when the next Terminator heads through the time portal , perhaps weâ€ ™ ll be seeing Jackie Chan with robot innards .
The reverse remake We all know about Hollywood appropriation of foreign cinema .
But what about films heading in the opposite direction ?
Once almost comical riffs on American bombast , the likes of Bollywood Superman and Turkish Star Wars functioned as a kind of shambolic payback for whatever indignities had been heaped on the latest foreign arthouse gem bought up by Hollywood .
But now , with many emerging markets growing to impressive size , the reverse - remake is becoming a sound business proposition .
The Chinese version of Foxâ€ ™ s 2009
Anne Hathaway - Kate Hudson romcom
Bride Wars has just opened to $ 23.6 m
â€ “ a fraction more , even inflation - corrected , than the original ( $ 23.5 m ) .
Bankable actor - model - singer Angelababy and relative newcomer Ni Ni play the two best friends whose nuptial scheduling collides ; the remakeâ€ ™ s opening weekend was scheduled for the Qixi festival , Chinaâ€ ™ s Valentineâ€ ™ s day equivalent .
Developed by Foxâ€ ™ s
local - language arm ,
itâ€ ™ s debatable whether the film is really a local triumph , or a piece of effective â€œglocalisationâ€ � by Hollywood .
Not designed to travel to the extent the original was , Chinese Bride Wars wonâ€ ™ t reach the first filmâ€ ™ s $ 114.7 m worldwide .
The Chinese market is still smaller than the American one and the same scaling - up effect enjoyed by US remakes of foreign films â€ “ for example ,
Hong Kongâ€ ™ s
Infernal Affairs taking $ 7.1 m in 2004 , but The Departed boosting that to $ 132.3 m two years later â€ “ doesnâ€ ™ t apply .
But increasingly , foreign port - overs can hope to more than hold their own domestically â€ “ as the Chinese
What Woman Want ( 2011 , $ 10.2 m ) , Bang Bang !
( last yearâ€ ™ s Bollywood remake of Knight and Day , $ 42 m ) and Brothers ( the Bollywood remake of Warrior , which opened last weekend , $ 17.2 m ) certainly did .
The new goal is to top the originalâ€ ™ s
US gross :
Zhang Yimouâ€
™ s
A Woman , a Gun and a Noodle Shop , which took $ 38 m against $ 3.9 m for the Coen brothersâ€ ™ Blood Simple , may have been the first to manage that .
Bride Wars may soon follow .
The genre scavenger Not much of import in the US this weekend , with Sinister 2 , American Ultra and Hitman : Agent 47 all failing to make much noise .
The latterâ€ ™ s
$ 8.2 m debut puts it 21st on the list of videogame - adaptation openings , way off $ 47.7 m for Lara Croft : Tomb Raider in a field with a surprising number of $ 50m+ strivers .
But Hitman : Agent 47 â€ “ its producers surely noting the 60.3 % international split for the first Hitman film , from 2007 â€ “ is engineered for overseas success .
With its anonymous - assassiny , bullet - timeish , generic - action setup , low star overheads in the shape of Rupert Friend and Hannah Ware , and a no - frills title , itâ€ ™ s clearly designed to pick low - hanging fruit across as wide an area as possible .
The UK ( $ 7.5 m ) , France ( $ 6.9 m ) , Germany ( $ 6.1 m ) and Russia ( $ 4.9 m ) were key markets first time around ; if the latter at least holds up , while other emerging markets show similar signs of growth as Mexico ( Hitman : 684 K ; Agent 47 : 809 K ) this weekend , and third - tier ones like Malaysia build exponentially ( Hitman : 224 K ; Agent 47 : $ 1.3 m ) , then Agent 47 could make similar amounts to its predecessor .
Budgeted at $ 35 m , the sequel will have to work harder than the first , which made $ 100 m off a $ 24 m budget .
Caustically received by reviewers , the sequel shows that Hollywood has other means , very different from bulldozer blockbuster marketing , of critic - proofing its wares : by stealth , shaving off the percentages in lots of places .
Beyond Hollywood Extremely quiet in terms of new entries : just South Korean debut
The Beauty Inside in at No 23 on the global rankings with $ 3.9 m .
And itâ€ ™ s another foreign remake of a US original : a 2012 episodic collaboration between Intel and Toshiba in which audience members get to play the lead character on his Facebook timeline .
Possibly itâ€ ™ s the concept , not the remake value , thatâ€ ™ ll be the draw here .
After a month on release , Choi Dong - hoonâ€ ™ s 1930s Manchuria resistance thriller The Assassination , with $ 77 m , will be passing Age of Ultron any day now to nestle on top of South Koreaâ€ ™ s 2015 box office .
The future Another week of swirling global box - office currents before The Maze Runner : Scorch Trials arrives in mid - September to get everyone moving in the same direction .

Arnold Schwarzenegger is to replace Donald Trump as the host of the NBC reality show Celebrity Apprentice , the network has announced .
One is an actor turned politician turned actor again ; the other is a real estate mogul turned reality TV star who is currently polling in first place for the Republican presidential nomination .
â€œArnold
Schwarzenegger is the epitome of a global brand in entertainment and business , and his accomplishments in the political arena speak for themselves , â€ � NBC said in a statement on Monday .
Schwarzenegger , star of such films as The Terminator and True Lies , served as California governor from 2003 to 2011 .
Since leaving office , he has returned to acting , most recently in Terminator Genisys .
The network cited Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s â€œpersonal passion for the formatâ€ � in helping producer Mark Burnett choose him to take over from Trump .
â€œThe Celebrity apprentice â€ ¦ will be back!â€ �
it said .
NBC dropped Trump in the early days of the billionaireâ€ ™ s quest for nomination over comments he made describing some Mexican migrants as criminals and rapists .
â€œAt
NBC , respect and dignity for all people are cornerstones of our values , â€ � a spokesperson for the network
said at the time .
â€œDue to the recent derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding immigrants , NBCUniversal is ending its business relationship with Mr Trump.â€ � The new series of Celebrity Apprentice is expected to air in 2016 ."
"The all - action movie star and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has lent his weight to a campaign against ivory poaching by blowing up an elephant tusk on camera .
The Wildlife Conservation Societyâ€ ™ s
â€˜96 elephants campaignâ€ ™ aims to draw attention to the daily death toll of the majestic animals .
In the video , a T - shirt wearing Schwarzenegger says : â€œHey , stop killing 96 elephants every day just because of this ivory .
Lets get rid of the demand once and for all.â€ �
He then presses a detonator , exploding a tusk .
More than 42 tonnes of illegal ivory have been destroyed so far this year in China , the Republic of Congo , Ethiopia , Kenya , Mozambique , Thailand , United Arab Emirates , and the US .
But the WCS fears that a House interior appropriations bill could roll back current US regulations and thwart efforts by the Fish and Wildlife Service to curtail the illegal trade .
John Calvelli , the WCSâ€ ™ s campaign director said : â€œWe are extremely grateful Arnold Schwarzenegger has joined the 96 Elephants campaign , and we are hopeful that his global following of fans will become allies to stop the killing , stop the trafficking and stop the demand of ivory.â€

"Green campaigners should stop talking about the risks from climate change in 2050 and talk about â€œright nowâ€ � , the former governor of California , Arnold Schwarzenegger , has said .
â€œIt drives me crazy when people talk about 30 years from now , rising sea levels and so on , â€ � he told the Guardian in an interview at the Paris COP21 climate conference .
â€œWhat about right now ?
Thousands of people are dying from pollution .
People are living with cancer [ because of air pollution].â€
�
He said campaigners should focus on the immediate effects of polluting the environment , because that resonates with the public in a way that distant visions of future harms do not .
Most people find it hard to imagine the world in 2050 or 2100 , the dates that are being discussed at the Paris conference for a â€œlong - term goalâ€ � on climate action , he said .
â€œThere are people stuck in cancer wards now , tubes sticking out of them - 7 million people die a year because of pollution , â€ � he said .
â€œWe should be talking about that.â€ � â€œStuff that happens in the future does not mean anything to people , â€ � he said .
He cited an advertising campaign in California that showed small children sucking air through an inhaler , because of the damage done to their respiratory systems by breathing polluted air .
â€œPeople saw this commercial , what we are doing to our kids , and thought â€˜we have to protect our environmentâ€ ™ .â€ �
Polls found that the ads were effective in persuading people of the need for new regulations , he said .
â€œAll of a sudden , the poll numbers changed.â€ � â€œMy job is to get the message out there , â€ � he added .
â€œIf you do not have people behind you , you canâ€
™ t do anything [ on legislation ] .
Global warming is an extremely important issue , the most important issue .
You have to communicate it properly .
You have to communicate to people that this is right now.â€ �
At the Paris climate change conference , entering its second and final week , governments are hoping to forge a new global agreement on limiting emissions that would kick in from 2020 , when current commitments run out .
A new draft text of an agreement was published on Saturday , and is now under scrutiny by the 195 governments gathered in France .
Schwarzenegger , a Republican , and internationally known as a star in films such as Terminator , was a strong proponent of action on air pollution , and greenhouse gas emissions , while in office .
His successor , the Democrat Jerry Brown , joined him in Paris in calling for action on emissions .
â€œThe Paris conference is the biggest leap forward in dealing with climate change .
France has been instrumental in advancing this agenda ,
â€ � he told the Guardian .
Schwarzenegger said such joint efforts from both sides of the US political divide were essential to making progress on environmental problems .
â€œI never paid much attention to [ political ] parties , â€ �
he said .
â€œThis is a peopleâ€ ™ s issue , not a party issue.â€ �
He said that â€œsub - nationalâ€ � authorities , such as state governors and assemblies in the US , and regional and city governments , could play an important role in bringing down greenhouse gas emissions , by taking their own initiatives independently of national governments .
â€œIt is good that this is now being recognised , â€ � he said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s about [ emphasising ] efficiency , and alternatives [ to fossil fuels].â€ � California under successive administrations has brought forward a series of measures on air pollution and greenhouse gases , including a pioneering regional cap - and - trade system for carbon .
Republicans in the Senate recently opposed Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s â€œhistoricâ€ � Clean Power Plan to cut nationwide emissions from power plants , and Republican states have filed lawsuits against the regulations .
In Paris , a group of Republican politicians from the US has been seeking meetings with the chief officials of leading developed and developing nations .
They broadly oppose an international deal on climate change , while the Obama administration has pushed strongly for an ambitious deal in Paris .
A group of 10 Democratic senators also attended the talks at the weekend , pledging to help President Obama attain his environmental goals ."
"Rugby World Cup tickets , watching Benedict Cumberbatchâ€ ™ s turn as Hamlet and a private screening of Arnold Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s latest Terminator film were among the freebies enjoyed by senior civil servants at the Department of Culture , Media and Sport last year .
Sue Owen , permanent secretary at the DCMS , took full advantage of the sports bonanza last year , attending Englandâ€ ™ s Rugby World Cup matches against Fiji and Wales .
The freebies , courtesy of England Rugby World Cup , included taking a â€œspouse , family member or friendâ€ � .
Owen also attended Englandâ€ ™ s first cricket Test against New Zealand at Lordâ€ ™ s last May , thanks to England Cricket .
It wasnâ€ ™ t all play for Owen , who also met BBC director general Tony Hall twice about charter review prior to the governmentâ€ ™ s licence fee deal with the corporation in early July .
The meetings , described as â€œcatch - upsâ€ � in DCMS data covering the first nine months of 2015 published on Friday , were held on 27 April and 1 June .
She also had a catch - up with David Abraham , the Channel 4 chief executive , on the same day she first met Hall .
She also caught up with Ofcom chair Patricia Hodgson twice .
Interestingly , one meeting on 9 July came just days after news of the BBCâ€ ™ s licence fee deal had broken in the press .
The other meeting was on 17 September .
Owen also met one journalist , Financial Times public policy editor Sarah Neville , on 25 June .

"Paramount has removed a planned Terminator sequel from its release schedule for 2017 , after last yearâ€ ™ s reboot of the cyborg franchise underwhelmed at the box office .
Terminator :
Genisys was meant to be the first film in a new trilogy uniting original star Arnold Schwarzenegger with younger actors Emilia Clarke and Jai Courtney .
It was released last summer to middling reviews ( the Guardianâ€ ™ s Peter Bradshaw called it â€œintensely unnecessaryâ€ � ) and underperformed at the US box office , bringing in less than $ 90 m ( Â£64 m ) .
But its surprising global pick - up ( it made around $ 350 m outside the US ) meant that a new Terminator 2 still seemed like a possibility .
Paramount have now decided otherwise , with a summer 2017 date vacated and replaced with Dwayne Johnsonâ€ ™ s Baywatch movie .
Paramount had also ambitiously scheduled a new Terminator 3 for June 2018 , as North American rights to the franchise would revert to series creator James Cameron in 2019 .
The studio is now pinning its franchise hopes on the continuation of the Star Trek , Mission : Impossible and Transformers films .
This year will also see a reimagining of video horror
The Ring , hope for some JJ Abramsâ€ ™ magic in spin - off 10 Cloverfield Lane and Jack Reacher :
Never Go Back .
The studio is also hoping its Baywatch adaptation will appeal to younger audiences unfamiliar with the original , bringing in Zac Efron as Johnsonâ€ ™ s co - star .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to make it badass , but we still want to pay homage to the original show , so itâ€ ™ s really a careful combination
, â€ � Efron said to MTV last year .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to beat up some dudes , and swim a lot.â€ �"
"John Kasich needs to display some political muscle in advance of Ohioâ€ ™ s winner take all primary next week .
So who better to endorse him than Arnold Schwarzenegger ?
At a chilly outdoor rally in a Columbus park , Kasich received the backing of the action movie star and former California governor on Saturday .
Schwarzenegger warmly endorsed Kasich , telling the crowd of almost 1,000 : â€œWe need John Kasich to now take charge and be in the White House .
The former governor , who will replace Republican frontrunner Donald Trump as host of The Apprentice , described Kasich as â€œan action heroâ€ � who â€œkicked some serious buttâ€ � during his time in Congress .
Kasich celebrated the endorsement by wearing a â€œgovernatorâ€ � jacket , which he said was a gift from Schwarzenegger .
Kasich spent most of his speech sticking to his insistence on â€œa positive messageâ€ � and avoiding â€œname calling and slimingâ€ � .
However , he did retell a favorite story about how he was â€œwhining to [ Schwarzenegger ] about negative campaigning in Ohioâ€ � during Kasichâ€ ™ s first campaign for governor in 2010 .
He said the then - governor of California looked him straight in the eye and said : â€œLove the beatings .
Love them.â€ �
But , without winning a single state and with only a pair of second place finishes to his name so far , Kasich has had a lot of beatings to enjoy in the 2016 primary .
However , while the Ohio governor is campaigning hard in Michiganâ€ ™ s primary on Tuesday , he has staked his entire campaign on the winner - take - all Ohio contest on 15 March , and Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s endorsement added hometown credibility in addition to celebrity luster .
The Terminator star was in Columbus for the Arnold Classic , a world - renowned bodybuilding competition that is held in Ohioâ€ ™ s capital city annually .
However , at the rally on Sunday , many of the attendees seemed to be there for Kasich , rather than Schwarzenegger .
Henry Rosenstein , a high schooler from Dublin , Ohio , told the Guardian : â€œI always kind of thought Kasich has made the most sense out of the Republican candidates ...
I like his temperament.â€ � Rosenstein added that although there were a lot of Trump supporters in his high school , he did not expect many of them to vote .
Cindy Bond of Columbus said : â€œI wouldnâ€ ™ t come to see Schwarzenegger , â€ � adding : â€œBut
itâ€ ™ s nice.â€ �
Mary Knight of Westerville , Ohio , praised Kasich as â€œa moderateâ€ � and noted : â€œWhat he says is sensible .
He doesnâ€ ™ t say crazy things , over - the - top things , and grew up as a lower - middle - class person.â€
�
The Kasich campaign is hoping to bank on this local appeal as well as their strong organization in the Buckeye State to notch up a big win on 15 March .
Matt Borges , the chair of the Ohio Republican Party , said that the Kasich campaign was working with candidates in competitive local primaries to make sure that the presidential hopefulâ€ ™ s literature was being handed out by them and even to get local candidates to identify potential Kasich supporters for the Ohio governor .
In contrast , Borges said Trump had simply flown in for a campaign stop and claimed he had heard anecdotally of exactly one person whose door had been knocked by the Ted Cruz campaign .
Kasich , who was five points behind Trump in a recent poll of the state , just needed â€œto remind Ohio voters why they wanted him to be governor in first place , â€ � Borges said .
Kasich â€œcan win , will win and everything changes when he carries Ohio.â€
�
With all this organization behind him â€ “ at the rally on Sunday , a parade of Ohio Republicans including a former senator took the state to warm up the crowd â€ “ Kasich should be a favorite in his home state .
However , with only one recent poll and a volatile electorate , anything could happen .
As Mary Knight told the Guardian : â€œThis is the most difficult [ election ] to gauge because of that idiot Trump.â€ �"
"As everyone knows , the new golden age of culture is the 90s .
Its influence has inevitably seeped into fashion and â€ “ in the spirit of the defining emotion of the decade : irony ( thanks Alanis )
â€ “ there has been a visual nod to the defining blockbusters of the era on the catwalk .
Palace â€ “ which loves a good visual in - joke â€ “
new summer collection features a striking image from Terminator 2 : Judgement Day ( Arnold Schwarzenegger and Edward Furlong looking mournfully at a skateboard ) .
It follows the lead of Vetementsâ€ ™ Titanic hoodie , which crested on a sustained wave of Leonardo DiCaprio Oscar hype and Kate and Leo reunion mania .
More obliquely , there were Gareth Pughâ€ ™ s
Hannibal Lecter - inspired face huggers and Ashley Williams referencing Jurassic Park in her London fashion week show , which was prefaced by the John Williams theme song .
So why the love of these 90s blockbusters ?
In part , itâ€ ™ s a nostalgic longing for the pre - internet age .
â€œI think it holds relevance for millennials who have grown up saturated with online images , â€ � says fashion historian Amber Butchart .
These same millennials who grew up to become designers and weave this imagery into their work .
As well as fashion designers coming of age during this era , this familiar yet nostalgic cinematic imagery is a quick way to convey an emotional state , appropriate for the click - and - consider age of Instagram and Tumblr that we live in .
â€œThe speeded up pace of fashion also ensures that trend cycles are faster , â€ � says Butchart , drawing the link between the use of imagery and the pace of the fashion industry .
Itâ€ ™ s proof , if needed , that fashion has hit peak 90s ."
"More than two decades since the first , gut - crunching Terminator movie , James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger have collaborated again on a campaign encouraging people to cut down on the amount of meat they eat .
Spearheaded by WildAid , the drive has American and Chinese audiences in its crosshairs , and endorses efforts by the latter government to reduce the populationâ€ ™ s meat consumption by 50 % .
â€œYou have to respect that , â€ � says Cameron in backstage footage from the shoot .
â€œThatâ€
™ s a leadership
position.â€
�
The director , whose off - screen ecological activism has been detected in the plots of films such as Avatar , said heâ€ ™ d been stirred into action after clocking his own hypocrisy .
â€œHow can I call myself an environmentalist when Iâ€ ™ m contributing to environmental degradation by what I eat?â€
�
Speaking alongside Cameron , Schwarzenegger reports health benefits of cutting down his meat and dairy intake on the advice of doctors .
â€œIâ€
™ m slowly getting off meat ,
â€ � he says ,
â€œand
I tell you : I feel fantastic.â€ �
The video , which is part of a wider strategy including billboards and online pledges , features Schwarzenegger staggering through a ravaged landscape presumably destroyed in part by the carbon emissions of the livestock industry .
â€œLess meat , less heat , more life , â€ � concludes the actor in the film , who also states that the notion meat is needed for muscle strength is incorrect .
The campaign makes curious contrast with a video released earlier this week , fronted by Matt Damon , Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara , lobbying for an end to the torture and slaughter of some 10,000 dogs in the far east as part of an annual food festival ."
"Itâ€ ™ s easy to forget when reading about James Cameronâ€ ™ s latest ventures , from pro - environmental short films to the 10 million Avatar sequels we seem to have been waiting eons for , that this was once the youthful master of a kind of grounded , blue - collar futurism , a purveyor of science fiction able to conjure up stories in which ordinary people were often just one or two wrong turns away from encountering vicious , multi - jawed , acid - blooded beasties , or grim , unflinching red - eyed robots from the world to come .
In many ways 1984â€ ™ s The Terminator is now remembered best as one of the twin pillars of Arnold Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s early Hollywood career .
The hulking Austrian had previously been considered virtually uncastable thanks to his preposterous frame and thick Styrian accent , but along with John Milius , whose film Conan the Barbarian hit cinemas two years earlier , Cameron worked out that it was only necessary to find freakily eccentric roles for the oversized actor to introduce the world to perhaps the biggest star of the 1980s .
And yet The Terminatorâ€ ™ s true quality , especially when taken alongside its sequel , 1991â€ ™
s
T2 :
Judgment Day , is the manner in which Cameron brought sci - fi to the people .
The genre often ignores ordinary lives in favour of those lived by the elite , in the form of space explorers , scientists and engineers .
Hollywood seems to think that those who have reached societyâ€ ™ s top rung will be the most likely to discover that we are not alone in the universe , whether by encounter with aliens , AIs or evil cyborgs from the machine - ruled future .
Yet Terminatorâ€ ™ s real hero is Linda Hamiltonâ€ ™ s Sarah Connor , a perfectly ordinary woman who time - travelling resistance fighter Kyle Reese ( Michael Biehn ) first meets in a nightclub .
Even in the filmâ€ ™ s blockbuster follow - up , T2 , Cameron is at pains to flag up the simple family life of the movieâ€ ™ s Oppenheimer figure , the Cyberdyne Systems engineer Miles Dyson .
Whenever the movieâ€ ™ s themes become too fantastical , Cameron ruthlessly pulls them back down to earth , building brutal , humanist foundations for his futuristic castles in the air .
So Dyson is first imagined as a figure of evil , the destroyer of worlds , until we visit his home and see his kids cowering at the thought of their daddy being hurt by Connor and her sinister and unwelcome compadres .
Cameron must have jumped at the chance to take on a sequel to Alien , Ridley Scottâ€ ™ s pioneering slasher flick in space , because the British film - makerâ€ ™ s 1979 sci - fi horror appears to have been built with exactly the same toolbox .
Influenced by the vision of grinding cosmic boredom presented in John Carpenterâ€ ™ s early 1974 venture Dark Star , Scott gave us a crew of blue - collar workers who are clearly only in space for the money , the diametric opposite of the wide - eyed , cosmic Boyâ€ ™ s Own optimism of Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars films .
Aliens , Cameronâ€ ™ s 1986 sequel , presents another vision of ordinary people dealing with horrific circumstances , from Sigourney Weaverâ€ ™ s
Ripley ( forced back to the alien - infested planetoid in exchange for the return of her unfairly revoked flight licence ) to the heavily armed but ultimately helpless grunts sent to take down the xenomorphs .
This almost unspeakably extreme vision of humanityâ€ ™ s future in space is constantly grounded in the cold reality of life beyond the borders of our solar system , and is never allowed to slip into the realms of starry - eyed Spielbergian space fantasy .
Cameron did his best to inject Avatar , his 2009 blockbuster megalith , with the same icy reality - shot to the heart .
Itâ€ ™ s made clear in the opening scenes , as we meet Sam Worthingtonâ€ ™
s
disabled soldier
Jake Sully , that future Earth remains a place of poverty and shrinking resources , where the working - class are forced to waste their lives in military servitude .
The tiny details that push Cameronâ€ ™ s players beyond the realms of caricature are in place for Weaverâ€ ™ s
chain - smoking exobiologist Grace Augustine and Stephen Langâ€
™ s ruthless alien - hating bigot Colonel Quaritch .
But itâ€ ™ s hard to conjure up a sense of spiky realism when your movieâ€ ™ s key characters are 14ft - tall space elves with ethernet - capable tails , dragons for pets and symbiotic relationships with sentient , god - like megaflora .
The Terminator films and Aliens should be required viewing for new sci - fi film - makers , especially those hoping to break into the big budget arena .
Without Cameronâ€ ™ s eye for detail and obsession with the lives of ordinary people , later movies in both futuristic sagas have languished in a sea of vapidity , unable to interest their audiences in protagonists with less apparent humanity than the merciless extraterrestrials and metal killing machines whose eternal task it is to hunt them down .
Compare Emilia Clarkeâ€ ™ s version of Sarah Connor in last yearâ€ ™ s Terminator Genisys to the original , Hamilton - essayed iteration , or Christian
Baleâ€ ™ s shouty take on John Connor with Edward Furlongâ€ ™ s vivacious turn as mankindâ€ ™ s teenaged sci - fi messiah .
In each case , the recast versions are thinly drawn facsimiles , plastic people about whom we know next to nothing and who make us care even less .
Cameron has now been working almost exclusively on Avatar and its sequels for at least a decade , and one suspects it could easily be another 10 years before all four ( yes , four ) new films find their way into cinemas .
In his absence , no one has quite taken up the mantle â€ “ though Neill Blomkamp has at times essayed a similar street - level vision of things to come .
The Titanic director is only 61 , but you wonder if his passion for the environment and fondness for the untapped possibilities of motion - capture tech will leave time for a return to the stark sci - fi of those early films .
Like Furlongâ€ ™ s ever - optimistic Connor in T2 , we can only hold out hope that good things eventually come to those who keep the faith ."
"Sicario star Benicio del Toro is set to take the lead in the latest Predator film , according to Deadline .
Currently titled The Predator , this will be the fourth in the series featuring the invisible , bloodthirsty alien , which was put on the map by the 1987 original starring Arnold Schwarzenegger .
( There are also two crossover
Alien vs Predator films , released in 2004 and 2007 . )
This latest version will be directed by Shane Black , currently riding high after the success of Iron Man 3 and The Nice Guys .
Black also had a small role in the first Predator film , as part of Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s special forces crew ( and the first one to be killed by the alien ) .
No plot details have yet emerged , but Schwarzenegger criticised the franchise in a Reddit interview , saying the films following his original hit were â€œnot
satisfactoryâ€

"What a week it has been in the NFL .
First we learned that the Vikings might not have been crazy to trade for Sam Bradford , then that Matt Forte does an alarmingly good Arnold Schwarzenegger impression .
I would ask who could ever have predicted such a thing , but in fact I already know the answer - grafhamboy - the one and only person to call every game correctly in week two .
That makes it two weeks , and only two people to score a clean sweep .
Will you join them ?
And will I , unlike last week , remember to post the overall standings in the comments section below ( sorry guys ! ) .
Here are the games you need to call : Denver Broncos @ Cincinnati Bengals (
Sunday 1 pm ET/6pm BST )
One touchdown , three interceptions and two wins .
Trevor Siemianâ€ ™ s 2016 season is already starting to look suspiciously similar to Peyton Manningâ€ ™ s 2015 .
As long as the Broncos can run the ball and dominate on defense , they will remain extremely hard to beat - even for a Cincinnati team averaging almost 350 yards per game through the air .
The Bengals have abundant talent at all of the offensive skill positions , but the key question here is whether their offensive line can hold up .
No quarterback has been sacked more than Andy Dalton through two weeks , whilst the teamâ€ ™ s running backs are averaging a meager 1.27 yards before contact .
The Broncos will lose a little something up front with DeMarcus Ware injured , but I still suspect that Von Miller might have a fun afternoon with Andrew Whitworth and his old Texas A&amp;M team - mate Cedric Ogbuehi .
Broncos to win Oakland Raiders @
Tennessee Titans ( Sunday 1 pm ET/6pm BST )
Thereâ€ ™ s a lot to like about Oakland this season .
Derek Carr is developing into one of the leagueâ€ ™ s best young quarterbacks , a deep receiving corps boasts sufficient weapons to keep opponents from doubling up on Amari Cooper , and the team has obtained solid production out of three different running backs as well .
But then there is the defense , which has given up 69 points and more than 1,000 yards in two outings .
Tennessee might not be the best equipped team to exploit the Raidersâ€ ™ many flaws , but Marcus Mariota did remind us what he is capable of in leading two fourth - quarter scoring drives to snatch a come - from - behind win over Detroit .
Typically I might suggest that homefield advantage could tilt this game in the Titansâ€ ™ direction .
But given that they have won just two of their last 17 games at Nissan Stadium , the opposite might actually be true .
Raiders to win Baltimore Ravens @
Jacksonville Jaguars ( Sunday 1 pm ET/6pm
BST )
Elvis Dumervil is hoping to make this his first game back after offseason foot surgery , which feels rather fitting .
It was against these same opponents last season that the linebacker collected a facemasking penalty on the penultimate play of the game ( a play that , incidentally , should have been called dead for a false start ) - allowing the Jaguars to kick a game - winning 52-yard field goal .
Bad memories aside , what do Baltimore have to fear on Sunday ?
They are 2 - 0 , and their hosts 0 - 2 .
And yet , in some areas they do not match up well .
A struggling backfield led by Justin Forsett is not ideally equipped to exploit the Jagsâ€ ™ shoddy run defense .
On the other side of the ball , Allen Hurns has a major height advantage on Baltimoreâ€ ™ s No2 corner , Shareece Wright .
But , when push comes to shove , Iâ€ ™ m just not picking Gus Bradley over John Harbaugh .
Ravens to win New York Jets @
Kansas City Chiefs ( Sunday 4.25pm
ET/9.25pm BST )
Few teams were more daunting to throw the ball against in 2015 than Kansas City , who finished with the second - most interceptions ( 22 ) and fourth - most sacks ( 47 ) in the league .
So far , this year looks very different .
The departures of Sean Smith and Tyvon Branch have left gaps in the secondary , while Justin Houstonâ€ ™ s injury vastly diminishes the teamâ€ ™ s pass rush .
Both DeAndre Hopkins and Will Fuller posted 100-yard games against the Chiefs last Sunday , and it is no coincidence that the teamâ€ ™ s rally against San Diego a week previously occurred after Keenan Allen had left the field .
The Jets might not be ideally equipped to exploit this weakness against the pass , however , with both Eric Decker and Brandon Marshall hobbled and likely to be game - time decisions .
Chiefs to win San Diego Chargers @
Indianapolis Colts ( Sunday 4.25pm ET/9.25pm BST )
Speaking of injuries , Philip Rivers might soon run out of team - mates to throw the ball to for San Diego .
After Allen in week one , now Danny Woodhead has also been lost for the season - depriving the quarterback of both his two favourite targets .
The Colts , though , have an even longer injury list - and look especially thin in the secondary with Darius Butler , Antonio Cromartie and Clayton Geathers all struggling , and Patrick Robinson working his way through the NFLâ€ ™ s concussion protocol .
My suspicion is that Rivers will be able to move the ball through the air just fine , but even if he canâ€ ™ t , the Chargers might also do well to feed Melvin Gordon against opponents who have given up 250 rushing yards so far .
Chargers to win Atlanta Falcons @
New Orleans Saints ( Monday 8.30pm
ET / Tuesday
1.30 am BST )
Giving Drew Brees time to throw at the Superdome is not typically a recipe for success , so the Falcons have good reason to be concerned about a pass rush that has achieved just a single sack in two games .
Already this season they have been torched by Derek Carr and Jameis Winston , surrendering eight touchdown drives of 75 yards or longer .
Their one consolation is that the Saints are really not faring that much better , with two sacks and more than 900 yards allowed .
Indeed , dig a little deeper into the numbers and you find that Atlanta has had nearly twice as many ( 11 ) QB hurries as New Orleans ( six ) .
Neither team , in the end , has much going for it on defense .
What the Falcons have demonstrated , unlike their neighbours , is that they do have a viable running game to go with their downfield attack .
Falcons to win"
"Donald Trump will not give up his role as an executive producer of The Celebrity Apprentice , the reality TV showâ€ ™ s studio said on Thursday , confirming a continuing business entanglement of the president - elect but not its details .
Trumpâ€ ™ s name will appear in the credits of the show , studio MGM told Variety magazine on Thursday , after the name of show creator Mark Burnett and before that of the programâ€ ™ s new host , Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Trump hosted the show for more than a decade before his presidential campaign , during which NBC , the network that airs the show , broke ties with him over his claims that Mexican people are â€œbringing drugs , and bringing crime , and their rapistsâ€ � .
A spokeswoman for MGM did not immediately reply to questions about the arrangement .
The studio did not disclose to Variety any terms of the deal except that it would pay Trumpâ€ ™ s fees , and that NBC would not .
A spokesman for Trumpâ€ ™ s transition team did not reply to a request for clarification .
During a string of meetings last month to interview potential cabinet members of the next White House , Trump met with Ari Emanuel , his agent while he was on The Apprentice and the brother of Rahm Emanuel , former White House chief of staff for Barack Obama .
Trump gave no details about that meeting , only telling reporters outside a New Jersey golf club that the meeting was â€œvery good .
Great guy .
Great friend of mine.â€ � Burnett has denied that he supported Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential campaign , and said in October that he and his wife â€œreject the hatred , division and misogyny that has been a very unfortunate part of his campaignâ€ � .
The producer also denied that he suppressed leaked unaired footage or audio from Trumpâ€ ™ s time on the show .
A former contestant , Summer Zervos , is one of several woman who has accused Trump of kissing and groping her .
Trump bragged about being able to grab and kiss women without consent in leaked audio from a 2005 appearance on Access Hollywood , near the peak of his fame from The Apprentice .
The president - elect has refused to make a clean break from his sprawling and opaque business interests , instead exploring what legal loopholes could allow his daughter and son - in - law , Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner , to play roles of some kind in the government .
He reportedly intends to keep a stake in his company , while formally handing control to his two adult sons , Eric and Donald Jr.
He has so far declined to fully divest from the holdings , as the Office of Government Ethics has advised , and threatens to test the limits of US law on conflicts of interest .
During the presidential election , Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign falsely said that handing control to his children would serve as a â€œblind trustâ€ � .
Since beginning transition work with the Obama administration , Trump has met with Indian business partners , his Washington hotel has courted diplomats , and his potential interests in Taiwan and Argentina come under scrutiny .
Breaking with four decades of political tradition , Trump has also refused to release his tax returns , keeping secret the extent of his wealth or potential conflicts of interest in the US and abroad ."
"You have to be â€
“
perhaps you always had to be
â€ “ a certain type of person to watch The New Celebrity Apprentice .
Perhaps thatâ€ ™ s the kind of person who understands why they felt the need to rebrand it
â€œThe Newâ€
�
once Donald Trump had successfully used it to vault into the White House ; or the kind of person who needs a montage to be reminded that Arnold Schwarzenegger was a bodybuilder who also starred in the Terminator movies and Twins before the show starts ; or the kind of person whose vision of southern California can be defined , as it is in one interstitial , by a beautiful woman picking her bathing suit wedgie as the sun sets .
This is America in 2017 , and all we can do is stare at former reality show contestants , pop stars , a â€œYouTube celebrityâ€ � and sports figures ostentatiously chewing Trident gum and wonder at the reality that â€œbrandsâ€ � have wrought upon this great nation .
Or we can just listen to Schwarzenegger intone his most famous lines â€ “
â€œIâ€ ™ m backâ€ � , â€œYouâ€ ™ re terminatedâ€ � , â€œHasta la vista , babyâ€ � and â€œCrush your enemies ,
see them driven before youâ€ � ( which is from Conan the Barbarian and the functional equivalent of trying to make â€œfetchâ€ � happen )
â€ “ and let ourselves be lulled into the fantasy that people more famous than us know whatâ€ ™ s best .
The contestants this year , unless youâ€ ™ ve spent a lot of time already watching reality shows or televised sports , need some introductions .
Sure , thereâ€ ™ s actor Jon Lovitz , Boy George ,
MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼eâ€ ™ s
Vince Neal and Wilson Phillipsâ€ ™ Carnie Wilson .
But thereâ€ ™ s also two retired football players ( Eric Dickerson and Ricky Williams ) , boxer Laila Ali , retired WNBA player and former Olympian Lisa Leslie and former MMA fighter ( and convicted money launderer ) Chael Sonnen .
And then thereâ€ ™ s the reality show contingent : Matt Iseman ( American Ninja Warrior host ) , Carson Kressley ( Queer Eye for the Straight Guy ) , Brooke Burke - Chavet ( Dancing with the Stars ) , Kyle Richards ( Real Housewives of Beverly Hills ) , Carrie Keagan ( the â€œYouTube celebrityâ€ � ) , Nicole â€œSnookieâ€ � Polizzi ( Jersey Shore ) and Porsha Williams ( Real Housewives of Atlanta ) .
Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s advisers are Tyra Banks and , in keeping with the Trump tradition of incorporating family , Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s nephew , entertainment lawyer Patrick Knapp Schwarzenegger .
No surprise : the first challenge was to help out Banksâ€ ™ s new make - up project , Tyra Beauty , which promises to â€œtransform your face in five minutes with six productsâ€ � , all in stick form .
They split the contestants into two teams , men ( Team Arete ) and women ( Team Prima ) , and the teams got to work designing an introductory event .
Williams was made project manager of Team Prima , whose planning session was more focused on the aesthetics of the presentation than the content .
At the event , Prima elected to have the models apply their own make - up , to demonstrate the ease of the five - minute face , with Burke - Chavet hosting .
Boy George helmed Team Arete , but Kressley was the stand - out player , coming up with their slogan â€ “ â€œI came , I saw , I contouredâ€ � â€ “ on the fly .
They decided that their gimmick would be to show how easy it is by having the straight guys ( Iseman , Dickerson , Williams , Sonnen , Neil and Lovitz ) apply the products on the models at the event while explaining more about the line .
Back in the boardroom after the presentations , Banks said that Prima had great energy but missed some of the talking points , and that she thought it was wrong that none of the women on the team actually used the products themselves .
Team Arete , on the other hand , demonstrated more knowledge of the product , and she liked that each man came out to sell the products .
Schwarzenegger declared Team Arete the winner , and the women were left to battle it out .
They instead argued about why they should not have lost , and only Keagan , who had been shown playing around on her phone during the planning session , threw anyone under the bus : Williams , the project manager .
Williams put Keagan and Polizzi up for elimination and , in the elimination round , nominated Polizzi .
But Schwarzenegger had other ideas , noting that Keagan consistently said in the evaluations that sheâ€ ™ d done what was asked of her .
â€œYou maybe have watched previous shows , â€ � he said ,
in an obvious reference to Trump ,
â€œand those did what was required stayed on for a longer period of time , but thatâ€ ™ s not how I handle things .
Who is taking the most risk is really what it comes down to , so therefore Carrie , youâ€ ™ re terminated .
â€œNow , get to the chopper.â€ �
Both are , of course , lines from his films , though eliminated stars are , apparently , driven to an airfield and helicoptered â€ ¦ somewhere over Los Angeles .
But while Keagan was done , viewers were not : it was a special , two - hour premiere , and so there was yet another contest .
In the second half , contestants were brought to the El Capitan Theater on Hollywood Boulevard because something - something about smiles .
Anyway , it was a totally random lead - in for a contest to write a song and shoot a video for Trident gumâ€ ™ s new ad campaign , celebrating many different kinds of smiles .
Prima , of course , choose Carnie Wilson as project manager , but it was Kyle Richards who came up with the video concept : Aliâ€ ™ s â€œknock - outâ€ � smile .
They decided to shoot a video in which Polizzi chews a bunch of gum and knocks Ali out with her smile , over Leslieâ€ ™ s objections that they were ignoring the â€œmany
smilesâ€ � part of the concept .
Leslie ended up shooting and then having to reshoot the video , while Williams directed and Wilson and Richards worked on the song .
It came down to the wire in editing , but they ended up with a video with which everyone but Leslie was happy .
Arete picked Lovitz as team leader and then had to talk him out of starting the video with a joke about British people having bad teeth .
Instead , they came up with filming something that makes each of them smile and , leaving Boy George and Neil to the song , headed out to Venice Beach to shoot .
Boy George and Neil worked well together until the editing process , during which Neil started drinking wine and Boy George , a recovering addict , objected and began rolling his eyes .
Their editing process was also fraught , and Boy George was unhappy with the amateurish final result .
During the screenings , the women felt confident but Kressley and Lovitz both noticed that the Trident people had zero reaction to the menâ€ ™ s video , which made them nervous .
In the boardroom , Team Prima talked about how the concept came into being but Leslie admitted to Schwarzenegger that she didnâ€ ™ t think it was the right concept .
When Arnold turned to the men , several of the women started to bicker about Leslieâ€ ™ s objections and Schwarzenegger had to silence them with a look .
The major objection to the menâ€ ™ s video seemed to be that Iseman was smiling while eating wings , though Boy George and Neil aired their differences over Neilâ€ ™ s drinking in the studio ( which went from â€œone glass of wineâ€ � to â€œa couple glasses of wineâ€ � ) and Boy Georgeâ€ ™ s defense of his sobriety .
Still , Knapp Schwarzenegger said that the executives loved the core message , how the men leveraged their celebrity and how they incorporated many smiles , but that they hated the production values .
Banks told Prima that the executives loved the womenâ€ ™ s videography and production values , but they felt the plot overtook the branding message and the everyday smiles concept â€ “ which had been Leslieâ€ ™ s point .
Team Arete won again , and Wilson looked totally devastated .
The women again argued with being in the bottom , and stood by their concept .
Leslie and Williams suggested that , if the concept was off , Richards should be in the bottom , but Polizzi , for the second boardroom in a row , tried to dodge the question and earned Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s ire .
He not only mocked her for being unwilling to make hard choices , but suggested she could be fired for it , until Wilson interrupted and said that she was ready to place Leslie and Polizzi in the bottom .
Returning to the boardroom , Schwarzenegger asked Wilson what her thinking was in nominating Leslie and Polizzi for elimination , when it was Richards who missed boat on the concept .
Wilson said that Richards put more effort in than anyone else , but Leslie countered by standing up both for herself and Polizzi .
Arnold said that thereâ€ ™ s no reason to fire Leslie or Polizzi , so
itâ€ ™ s
Wilson on the chopping block .
â€œHasta la vista , baby ,
â€ � he said .
â€œGet to the chopper.â€ � Look : it makes more sense if you never actually saw Predator , and only recognize it as part of his brand ."
"How did your business Moola [ an online money management service ] start ?
Iâ€ ™ m sure
itâ€ ™ s the same for everyone in financial services :
youâ€ ™ re often approached by friends asking you what they should do with their money [ Godfrey has worked in financial management since 1997 ] .
For me this was magnified because I was being asked the same question on television while appearing as a money and consumer expert [ Godfreyâ€ ™ s credits include the BBC , ITV and Sky News ] .
There is a savings crisis in the UK .
Millions [ according to Deloitte research the number is 5.5 million ]
have a bit of money to invest but no access to financial advice .
People are making more financial transactions online and I felt this change in behaviour was not being catered for .
Meanwhile , finance has been shrouded in jargon and complexity , which has alienated people .
With Moola , which was launched at the end of 2016 , I wanted to offer something different .
The advice is jargon - free and it provides a stripped down service to small investors .
For financial advisers it takes away the regulatory and administrative burden of looking after smaller clients , making it more cost - effective .
So far , we have a few thousand people signed up and we have been working with venture capital and private equity firm Octopus Investments and their network of independent financial advisers and customers for the last couple of months .
How does Moola make money ?
It gives users access to online investment services for a fee [ the lowest amount that can be invested is Â£200 ] .
We keep the price down by offering a simplified service and automating wherever possible .
The fee is a small slice of whatâ€ ™ s invested .
It covers the cost of safeguarding the money , background checks , guiding towards investment options , putting the money to work and monitoring it from then on .
Where would you like to take it ?
The vision is to change the landscape of finance , making it inclusive and accessible , so that everyone can grow their money , regardless of how much money they have or how much they understand about investing .
It could help people who feel left behind financially , such as those who made their feelings known in the Brexit vote .
You recently appeared as an adviser to Arnold Schwarzenegger on The Celebrity Apprentice in the US â€ “ how did that opportunity come about ?
It took seven years of blood , sweat and tears .
I started from scratch in the media , dedicating time to build a network of contacts and develop the on - camera skills needed .
Of course , I also had to build a track record in business , from firms running $ 10bn [ Â£8bn ] of peopleâ€ ™ s money [ Brooks Macdonald ] , to my own startup .
As one of few official contributors for CNBC outside of the US , Iâ€ ™ d already been broadcasted to millions of American viewers on a regular basis .
Also , the network that runs The Apprentice is NBC , the owner of CNBC , and therefore I was â€œin the familyâ€ � .
For this new season , with Arnold Schwarzenegger as the new boss , there was even more of a focus on entertainment .
And the show had moved to California from New York [ and
Trump Towers ] , so
my running a financial technology startup was a perfect fit [ with Californiaâ€ ™ s reputation for successful technology startups ] .
As the boardroom adviser , my role was to assess all contestants during the tasks and then report back to Arnold on their performances and suggest who he should fire and save .
In the celebrity version , the contestants battled it out for their chosen charities .
What was it like ?
It was fun , surreal and absolutely fascinating to see behind the scenes .
It was inspiring to be around such powerful and prominent personalities .
With each task kept to a time limit , it meant shooting the show was full - on .
It was also hard work offering real , tangible business insights while being entertaining .
But I loved every second of it .
What was it like to do business in front of a camera crew ?
The biggest difference between TV and real life is the time restrictions .
Itâ€ ™ s unlikely youâ€ ™ d have to launch a new brand or close a deal within the 24-hour period in which an Apprentice task is shot .
But the skills you need to succeed are the same , and so are the challenges .
Itâ€ ™ s just like learning about business on fast forward .
While you were over there , did you get a sense of the buzz around the election ?
What were peopleâ€ ™ s views of Donald Trump ?
Like with Brexit over here , the rise of someone outside of politics showed how split the country is in terms of the millions of people who feel disenfranchised and left behind .
Why do you think finance is dominated by men ?
Itâ€ ™ s a self - perpetuating scenario where the lack of women has put off more women from rising through the ranks .
But a successful business needs a balance of skills .
Diversity of age , gender and background is required to represent customer needs , challenge the business strategy and deliver tailored solutions .
The way to solve the problem is to initiate a virtuous circle of [ diverse ] role models and mentors showing how it can be done and shifting the balance .
Is there anything you would do differently if you started again ?
Nope .
Iâ€ ™ ve made mistakes but they made me tougher .
You probably learn more from a misstep than by getting something right first time .
What is your proudest moment ?
Advising the legendary Arnold Schwarzenegger and being in the company of titans such as Warren Buffett , Jessica Alba , Tyra Banks and Steve Ballmer on The Celebrity Apprentice is a contender .
Starting Moola with a talented team , backed by industry leaders and authorised by our regulator is another .
Theyâ€ ™ re only beaten by marrying my soulmate , having the most amazing son and a daughter on the way .
What advice would you give to other aspiring entrepreneurs ?
Solve a problem rather than sell a product , validate the need before you build , find a great team .

"Arnold Schwarzenegger has told Donald Trump that the two men should swap jobs so â€œpeople can finally sleep comfortably againâ€ � after the US president joked about his TV ratings at the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday .
The Terminator star and former governor of California has replaced Trump as the host of what is now called The New Celebrity Apprentice .
Before being sworn in as president last month , Trump attacked his successorâ€ ™ s ratings for the first episode of the show , tweeting : â€œWow , the ratings are in and Arnold Schwarzenegger got â€˜swampedâ€ ™ ( or destroyed ) by comparison to the ratings machine , DJT.â€ �
During Thursday morningâ€ ™ s National Prayer Breakfast , an annual faith gathering of religious leaders and members of Congress ,
Trump returned to the theme : They hired a big , big movie star , Arnold Schwarzenegger , to take my place .
And we know how that turned out .
The ratings went right down the tubes .
Itâ€ ™ s been a total disaster .
And Mark [ Burnett , the creator of Apprentice ] will never , ever bet against Trump again .
He then called on religious leaders to pray .
â€œI want to just pray for Arnold , if we can , for those ratings , â€ � said the president .
In response , Schwarznegger took a dig at Trump in a Twitter video : â€œHey Donald , I have a great idea .
Why donâ€ ™ t we switch jobs ?
You take over TV , since youâ€ ™ re such an expert in ratings , and Iâ€ ™ ll take over your job , and then people can finally sleep comfortably again , â€ � he declared , raising his eyebrows at the camera .
Within 30 minutes , Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s post had 10,000 retweets .
The ratings of Celebrity Apprentice have dropped this year , down 16 % this week in the 18 - 49 age demographic , a season low .
As a Republican governor of California from 2003 to 2011 , Schwarzenegger focused much of his political career on increasing clean energy and climate change mitigation .
Before last yearâ€ ™ s election , he said he would not vote for Trump , making it the first time he didnâ€ ™ t vote for a GOP candidate since becoming a US citizen in 1983 after he emigrated from Austria .
The former professional bodybuilder also publicly criticized Trumpâ€ ™ s travel ban this week , calling it â€œvetted
badlyâ€ � .
â€œTo go and ban people who have a green card , that means that the United States of America has given you permission to work here permanently and you are on the way to permanent citizenship
â€
¦
I was in that position â€ ¦
Itâ€ ™ s crazy , itâ€ ™ s crazy and makes us look stupid when the White House is ill - prepared to put this kind of executive order out there , â€ � he told entertainment TV host Mario Lopez on Extra ."
"Seven months after leaving Downing Street in the wake of the Brexit vote , David Cameron has appeared in a bizarre video with Arnold Schwarzenegger vowing :
â€œIâ€ ™ ll be back.â€ �
In a rare public appearance , a relaxed - looking Cameron , in open - necked shirt and with tousled hair , poses with the actor and former California governor in the video posted on Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s
Snapchat feed .
â€œIâ€ ™ m with my good friend David Cameron , from England , the ex - prime minister , â€ �
Schwarzenegger says by way of introduction .
Cameron adds : â€œIâ€ ™ m with the governor .
He did a great job , and Iâ€ ™ ll be back.â€
�
It is not clear in what capacity the former prime minister was predicting his return , but it is unlikely he meant politics , having resigned as an MP in September .
Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s chummy encounter with Cameron on Friday followed a less cordial exchange with Donald Trump the previous day .
At a national prayer breakfast , the president had taunted the actor over the TV ratings of his former show The Apprentice , which Schwarzenegger now presents .
â€œThey hired a big , big movie star , Arnold Schwarzenegger , to take my place , and we know how that turned out , â€ �
Trump said .
â€œThe ratings went right down the tubes .
Itâ€ ™ s been a total disaster
â€
¦
I just want to pray for Arnold ,
if we can , for those ratings , OK?â€ � Schwarzenegger posted a short video on his Twitter feed in which he said : â€œHey Donald , I have a great idea .
Why donâ€ ™ t we switch jobs ?
You take over TV , since youâ€ ™ re such an expert in ratings , and Iâ€ ™ ll take over your job , and then people can finally sleep comfortably again.â€ �
He later released a statement through his spokesman that read : â€œArnold is praying that President Trump can start improving his own approval ratings , which were the worst in history for an incoming president , by taking his job seriously and working inclusively.â€ � Not content to leave it there , Trump tweeted on Friday : â€œYes , Arnold Schwarzenegger did a really bad job as governor of California and even worse on The Apprentice , but at least he tried hard!â€ �
Cameronâ€ ™ s comment that the former governor did a â€œgreat jobâ€ � may have been a gentle rebuttal to the president .
It is not clear where Cameron and Schwarzenegger shot their video .
Their relationship goes back to 2007 when Cameron , then leader of the opposition , travelled to California in an attempt to align himself with the then governor .
At the time , he told an audience of tech entrepreneurs that his wife had asked him how he would explain to an American audience what sort of Conservative he was .
â€œI said : â€˜Darling , Iâ€ ™ ll just say look at me and think of Arnold Schwarzenegger.â€ ™ â€ �
The pair later met at the Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s office in Sacramento , talking in a tent in the garden so the governor could smoke cigars .
As he left , Cameron was presented with a gift of 10 of Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s favourite movies on DVD , two of which were his own ."
"After 15 days of chaotic activity when he made heads spin around the world , President Donald Trump flew from Washington on Friday for the Florida mansion he calls the Winter White House , leaving behind a faintly traumatised US capital .
The exhausting first two weeks of the Trump presidency were bookended by an obsessive fixation with his inaugural crowd size and his use of a usually solemn speech at the national prayer breakfast to continue a feud with Arnold Schwarzenegger over ratings for The Apprentice .
The turbulent character of the early days has looked little different from the insurgent campaign that propelled him to the Oval Office as he has escalated tensions with Mexico , flouted diplomatic norms with Australia , picked fights with members of his own party and signed a flurry of executive orders that have already reshaped perceptions of America on the global stage .
At the center of it all has been a cast of characters jockeying for Trumpâ€ ™ s ear , creating a struggle for power that has manifested in a mix of chaos , leaks and uncertainty .
The Trump White House already bears more resemblance to the court of a Renaissance king than to most prior administrations as favorites come and go , counselors quarrel over favor and policy decisions are often made by whim or without consultation .
Steve Bannon , the former Goldman Sachs rightwing ideologue , now chief strategist and counselor to the president has been virtually ever present in the Oval Office since inauguration day , bringing to the center of American politics the apocalyptic worldview that turned his Breitbart website into a magnet for conservatives who thrilled to its sensationalist headlines and vented their anger in its comments section .
A Cardinal Richelieu in cargo pants , he guides many key ideological decisions , giving Trumpâ€ ™ s early policy moves the look of a Breitbart daily news list .
His loyal ally Stephen Miller , a 31-year - old former Capitol Hill staffer , has proved to be a lightning rod for criticism as Trumpâ€ ™ s ban on refugees and immigration from seven Muslim - majority countries swiftly unravelled .
Miller , the policy director and speechwriter , was a staffer for Jeff Sessions â€ “
the Alabama senator who was a relatively obscure immigration hawk until Trump and Bannon adopted him as the intellectual force at the back of their rightwing radicalism .
Sessions , who has been nominated to be Trumpâ€ ™ s attorney general , has a reactionary record on race , voting rights and immigration .
He opposes same - sex marriage , and when Trump was caught on tape talking of grabbing women â€œby the pussyâ€ � ,
Sessions called it a â€œstretchâ€ � to characterize that as sexual assault .
Miller often served as Trumpâ€ ™ s warm - up man on the campaign trail , whipping up rallies as crowds chanted â€œbuild the wallâ€ � , and wrote Trumpâ€ ™ s speeches , attempting to mold the candidateâ€ ™ s stream of consciousness into complete sentences .
Miller , with Bannon , was responsible for the â€œAmerican carnageâ€ � inauguration speech which delivered Trumpâ€ ™ s dark vision of the country he was inheriting from Barack Obama .
On the other side is Reince Priebus , the former chair of the Republican National Committee , who could hardly be further removed in personality and style : mild where those around him are brash .
As chief of staff , he should be the gatekeeper , but has struggled to assert himself .
He has already been briefed against , including a memorable quote this week in the Washington Post , in which an anonymous official said of him : â€œA little bit of under - competence and a slight amount of insecurity can breed some paranoia and backstabbing ,
â€ � adding : â€œWe have to get Reince to relax into the job and become more competent , because heâ€ ™ s seeing shadows where there are no shadows.â€
�
Another who is visibly struggling is Sean Spicer , the White House press secretary who also came on board from the RNC .
The daily face of the administration behind the lectern in the Brady press briefing room , his side parting , and pocket square precision have not been matched when he opens his mouth â€ “
the typically hour - long sessions slide from attempts at false bonhomie to bitter personal attacks on individual journalists .
Often shouting , this week he got into another Alice in Wonderland battle with the facts when he denied that Trumpâ€ ™ s immigration ban was really a ban , even though it was pointed out to him by reporters that , both he and the president himself had repeatedly used the word to describe one of the first signature policies of the new administration .
â€œBut the president himself called it a ban , â€ � a reporter said .
â€œSo is he confused , or are you confused?â€
� â€œIâ€ ™ m not confused .
The words that are being used to describe it are derived from what the media is calling it .
He has been very clear that it is extreme vetting.â€ �
Perhaps the most high - profile person from Trumpâ€ ™ s orbit , Kellyanne Conway , remains precisely that : a public face of the administration whose primary role appears to be hopscotching between the news networks almost as performance art .
The pollster had worked on the conservative right with the National Rifle Association , Newt Gingrich and Trumpâ€ ™ s own vice - president , Mike Pence , before bringing a steely professionalism to Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign .
Her forceful , combative style with television inquisitors has been mostly impressive â€ “ although her use of the phrase â€œalternative factsâ€ � to justify the Trump White House view of the world will probably hang around her neck for years to come .
All the while in the background lurk Trumpâ€ ™ s daughter and son - in - law , Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner .
As Trumpâ€ ™ s wife Melania has disappeared from public view , opting to remain in New York City where their 10-year - old son Barron attends school , Ivanka has served as a de facto first lady .
She visited Dover air force base with her father on Wednesday to honor the first US service member killed under Trumpâ€ ™ s watch .
Kushner , who ran much of the Trump campaign , is one of his father - in - lawâ€ ™ s closest advisers , somehow elevated from Manhattan property deals to security clearance at the heart of government and a seat in the situation room .
So far he has been scarcely visible â€ “ popping up to fill out the chorus line behind Trump in Oval Office photocalls as the president flourishes another executive order .
Yet when a special forces raid in Yemen that led to the death of an American soldier was approved , Kushner sat with Bannon and Priebus while Trump made the decision .
The growing influence of Bannon has sounded alarm bells across Washington , even among Republicans .
While most lawmakers from Trumpâ€ ™ s own party are reticent to insert their opinion into his staffing decisions , his decision to elevate the former Breitbart CEO to the National Security Council was met with concern for potentially insulating the president from experienced professionals in favor of his political allies .
â€œIt sounds problematic to me , â€ � said Lindsey Graham , a senator from South Carolina who was a vocal critic of Trumpâ€ ™ s during the presidential campaign .
â€œThe National Security Council has been driven by professional folks .
Iâ€ ™ ve never seen a situation where someone whoâ€ ™ s more from the political realm has a permanent seat .
I donâ€
™ t think thatâ€ ™ s a good precedent.â€ �
James Lankford , a Republican from Oklahoma who sits on the Senate intelligence committee , said Bannonâ€ ™ s appointment was â€œobviously a political position in the middle of a body that is usually distinctly non - politicalâ€ � .
â€œObviously the president can choose how heâ€ ™ s going to have the inner workings of his White House , â€ � he said .
â€œItâ€ ™ ll be of interest to us just how it operates.â€ �
But the unveiling of the first major Bannon - driven policy , framed as a matter of urgent national security , was nothing short of tumultuous .
Last Friday , Trump ended the first week of his presidency by temporarily suspending all refugee admissions to the US and placing a moratorium on immigration from seven Muslim - majority countries , spiraling the US government into days of chaos that played out globally .
The executive order , shaped by Bannon and Miller , made good on Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign promise to crack down on Muslim immigration to the US .
Chaos ensued at airports across the country , as officials acting upon the administrationâ€ ™ s order hadnâ€ ™ t a clue how to implement it .
Green card holders and interpreters who served alongside the US military in war - torn countries were swept up in its broad implications , and even young children were detained for hours .
It was soon revealed that neither John Kelly nor James Mattis , the new secretaries of homeland security and the defense department , had been fully briefed in advance .
Nor had congressional leaders , with even the House speaker , Paul Ryan , telling reporters days later that he only learned of what was in the travel ban as the policy was being issued .
Miller , the architect of the order , was sent out to defend the ban on national television as a split - screen carried the widespread protests prompted by the dramatic shift in policy .
But despite Millerâ€ ™ s vigorous justification for what the White House dubbed as â€œextreme vettingâ€ � , the damage had been done .
A number of Republicans , who might have otherwise supported Trumpâ€ ™ s action had they been involved in the process , sharply criticized the administrationâ€ ™ s handling of the ordeal and called for swift changes .
The botched rollout of the travel ban , according to a veteran of Capitol Hill and Republican campaigns , was emblematic of the challenges posed by the current power structure surrounding Trump .
â€œThere are not enough people of that ilk with the requisite experience to successfully operate the federal government , â€ � said the strategist , who requested anonymity to speak more freely .
â€œAt the same time , the scope of the decisions that have to be made by the executive branch of the US government is so vast that you have to delegate power.â€
�
The tension surrounding the travel ban and its immediate aftermath also laid bare the fissures emerging between the various factions within the White House .
As Bannon and Miller called the shots behind the scenes , crafting a policy that played directly to Trumpâ€ ™ s base , Priebus and Spicer found themselves tasked with cleaning up the mess .
Miller did , however , face the heat when MSNBC host Joe Scarborough launched into a stinging rebuke on his morning talkshow â€
“ regularly watched by Trump himself .
â€œYouâ€ ™ ve got a very young person in the White House on a power trip thinking that you can just write executive orders and tell all of your cabinet agencies to go to hell , â€ �
Scarborough said , before addressing Miller plainly .
â€œBy the time youâ€ ™ re 35 , maybe youâ€ ™ ll know how Washington and the White House really works .
â€œIf youâ€ ™ re still around , â€ � he added .
â€œI hope youâ€ ™ re not.â€ �
Some close to Trump defended Miller , framing the outrage over the travel ban as driven by negative media coverage .
Jason Miller , a former adviser to Trump , no relation to Stephen Miller , said the young aide had developed a unique understanding of Trump and his appeal on the campaign trail .
â€œSteve really understands the economic populism movement both from his time working in conservative politics and being on the campaign trail , â€ � Jason Miller told the Guardian .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s really clicked with the president and understands how the president wants to articulate and frame things.â€ �
Jason Miller also contested reports of dysfunction inside the West Wing , deeming many of the leaks from within the administration as the work of government officials who never wished for Trump to get elected .
â€œAre some people getting their knickers in a twist because of the changes ?
Yeah , â€ � he said .
â€œBut these are the things the president said he was going to fight for and advocate.â€ �
The core team at Trumpâ€ ™ s side inside the Oval Office , Miller added , was unlikely to change .
Trumpâ€
™ s campaign was nonetheless rocked by repeated shakeups .
And the Trump White House is expected to be no different , where staffers of even the most even - keeled presidents are prone to burn out after only a few years .
To some observers , those surrounding Trump are ultimately powerless in the face of a president who obsessively drives his own image .
Referring to Trumpâ€ ™ s contentious call with the Australian prime minister , Lindsey Graham said the incident was a precise example of where regardless of those standing at his shoulder , â€œthe words of the president of the United States really matterâ€ � .
â€œEventually heâ€ ™ s the president .
Heâ€
™ s the guy on the phone , â€ � Graham said .
â€œAnd to the extent that politics is music , heâ€ ™ s off key.â€ � The inner circle Steve Bannon :
Trumpâ€ ™ s dishevelled chief strategist has brought his rightwing Breitbart website agenda to the seat of power and has been a virtual ever - present in the Oval Office .
Steve Miller : an ex - Capitol Hill staffer who has risen from role as Trumpâ€ ™ s election rally warm - up man to writing the â€œAmerican carnageâ€ � inauguration speech and botching the chaotic roll - out of the immigration ban .
Reince Priebus : the chief of staff who came from within the Republican party machine to try to professionalise the freewheeling Trump operation .
Already facing questions over his ability to control .
Jared Kushner : the son - in - law with security clearance .
Property deals in Manhattan swapped for a role in the conversation when the US launched a raid in Yemen .
Ivanka Trump : daughter stepped in on first lady duties , joining her father aboard Marine One when he went to honour the return of a fallen US Navy Seal killed in the Yemen commando raid .
Kellyanne Conway : combative defender of the Trump administration on the airwaves â€ “ certain to be forever remembered for proposing â€œalternative factsâ€ � .
Sean Spicer : clean - cut , well - scrubbed but not very polished .
The White House spokesman rapidly defaults to rage in the briefing room .
Period ."
"Is there method in the madness ?
No one doubts that Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s first 50 days as US president have busted norms , paradigms and taboos every bit as surely as his insurgent election campaign .
On day 44 , for example , he used Twitter to accuse his presidential predecessor , Barack Obama , of criminal wiretapping , then in the next moment mocked his reality - TV successor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , over poor ratings .
But Trump has also been both praised and criticised for doing more than many politicians to keep his election promises .
There have been fleeting moments when a blurry picture of policy sharpens into focus .
From the botched travel bans to the wrangling over healthcare reform , there are signs of how difficult it will be to translate policy into coherent action .
â€œThere is no ideology around the policies we see so far , â€ � said Michael Steele , former chairman of the Republican National Committee .
â€œThere are particular impressions on issues .
A lot of it is campaign - related rhetoric.â€ �
To be in Washington these days is to dwell inside a washing machine , a daily churn of intelligence leaks , congressional demands for blood â€ “ attorney general Jeff Sessions has survived but the former national security adviser Michael Flynn did not â€ “ and pre - dawn presidential tweet storms ( President Trump has topped more than 540 tweets at the last count ) .
Yet the architect of the chaos has also twice attempted to step back and explain his vision for America .
First , on day one , there was his dark inaugural address , with its ringing phrase
â€œAmerican carnageâ€
� and unabashed nationalism .
Second , on day 40 , there was an address to a joint session of Congress which struck a less harsh tone and promised a â€œnew chapter of American greatnessâ€ � , offering an olive branch for bipartisan cooperation .
But perhaps it was day 35 that offered a peek behind the curtains to the whirring cogs and wheels of White House machinery .
It was not so much
â€œTrumpismâ€ � as â€œBannonismâ€ � , articulated by chief strategist Steve Bannon , who has compared himself to Thomas Cromwell in Henry VIIIâ€ ™ s court and emerged as the biggest influence on the presidentâ€ ™ s thinking .
â€œIf you look at the lines of work , I would break it up into three verticals or three buckets , â€ � he told the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) near Washington .
â€œThe first is kind of national security and sovereignty â€ ¦
The second line of work is what I refer to as economic nationalism â€ ¦ The third , broadly , line of work is deconstruction of the administrative state.â€
� Work began on these â€œthree verticalsâ€ � at a hectic pace with distinctly mixed results .
On the first , Trump announced that he would seek a $ 54bn increase in military spending , while cutting back on aid and diplomatic programmes , though he is yet to signal a meaningful shift in the fight against Islamic State .
But the most disruptive act so far was a travel ban on seven Muslim - majority countries , rushed through on a Friday night , replete with glaring flaws .
It backfired spectacularly , with mayhem and protests at airports , and was knocked back by the courts â€ “ an early kick in the complacency of the administration .
A revised ban â€ “ slimmed to six countries but with substantially the same policy thrust â€ “ is now also facing legal challenges by six different states from Hawaii to New York .
Rich Galen , former press secretary to Dan Quayle , an ex - vice - president , said : â€œI think they were totally shocked how quickly it got thrown back in their face by the judicial world and the political world .
That taught them a lesson that they need people around them who know what they are doing .
They thought they could bluster their way through it.â€
�
The learning curve from campaign to governance has proved steep , Galen added .
â€œWhat these guys are finding out is itâ€ ™ s a lot harder to do it than talk about it .
Being president is a lot harder than 140 characters.â€ �
He predicted : â€œI think the next 50 days will look very much like the first .
Trump is having a lot more trouble adjusting to people not leaping in the air every time he suggests something .
As president , you canâ€ ™ t control the press , you canâ€ ™ t control the legislature , you canâ€ ™ t control the judiciary.â€ �
Economic nationalism implies an assertion of domestic control of the economy , protectionist policies such as tariffs and , perhaps most importantly in this context , opposition to trade and immigration .
At CPAC , Bannon hailed withdrawal from the Trans - Pacific Partnership as â€œone of the most pivotal moments in modern American historyâ€ � , enabling Washington to negotiate bilateral trade deals instead .
Trump â€ “ who likes the mantra â€œBuy American and hire Americanâ€ �
â€ “ has made questionable claims that jobs are already returning to the country because of him .
There are fears he will impose punitive tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports , triggering a trade war that will stifle economic growth .
John Hudak , a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington , said some Republicans in Congress would be unwilling to support â€œtrade sovereigntyâ€ � and Trump had diminished his chances of enlisting Democrats .
â€œFor
a person who can become so petty in party politics , to launch an agenda that needs help from the other party shows a president who is under - talented , â€ � he said .
Hudak described Trump as â€œthe anti - Clintonâ€ � , contrasting him with President Bill Clintonâ€ ™ s ability to reach across the aisle even in his darkest political moments .
As for immigration , the populist movements in Britain , France and elsewhere have been characterised as dividing the world between â€œnationalistsâ€ � and â€œglobalistsâ€ � .
Bannon has made clear his loyalty to the former while declaring war on the â€œcorporatist , globalist media that are adamantly opposed to an economic nationalist agendaâ€ � .
Construction on Trumpâ€ ™ s border wall has not yet begun but he has backed his incendiary campaign rhetoric with new guidance that promises a security crackdown on the border and could see millions of undocumented immigrants deported .
A series of highly visible raids by the presidentâ€ ™ s nascent deportation force has left Latino communities across the country on edge .
Then , in the longer term , there is a $ 1tn infrastructure plan , intended to boost employment .
In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter last November , Bannon gave a crucial insight .
â€œItâ€ ™ s everything related to jobs , â€ � he said .
â€œThe conservatives are going to go crazy .
Iâ€ ™ m the guy pushing a trillion - dollar infrastructure plan .
With negative interest rates throughout the world , itâ€ ™ s the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything.â€ �
That infrastructure plan , also cited in Trumpâ€ ™ s speech to Congress , will be tough for some Republicans to swallow , while sympathetic Democrats might balk at lending support to this president .
Third in the set of Bannon principles was â€œdeconstruction of the administrative
stateâ€
� , a phrase reminiscent of The Lord of the Rings , according to one commentator .
It implies that the left has created a shadowy bureaucracy to push its agenda and that the state itself is inimical to the popular will .
â€œThe way the progressive left runs , is if they canâ€ ™ t get it passed , theyâ€ ™ re just going to put in some sort of regulation in an agency , â€ � Bannon said .
Trump has signed two executive orders slashing regulations and declared : â€œWe donâ€ ™ t need 75 % of the repetitive , horrible regulations that hurt companies , hurt jobs.â€ � Activists are concerned that the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) will be a particular target , risking an increase in pollution .
But Hudak warned : â€œThereâ€ ™ s a heck of a lot of regulation in this country that protects industry .
You can kill the EPA but if you go too far youâ€ ™ re going to harm big business in this country .
The idea that you can take a hatchet to the federal bureaucracy and always please conservatives is a myth.â€
�
It is still uncertain , for example , whether Trump intends to shut down the Export - Import Bank , which has benefited some major corporations .
â€œClosing it would be conservative but not Republican , â€ �
Hudak said .
For all the hurly - burly , few believe that a clear blueprint is yet discernible amid Trumpâ€ ™ s scattergun approach to the making of both policies and wild , distracting accusations that tend to consume news cycles .
Rich Tyler , a conservative political analyst , observed : â€œThere is no ideology , save for populism .
Thereâ€ ™ s no anchoring governing philosophy to any of this .
There may be â€˜Trumpismâ€ ™ but itâ€ ™ s not really conservatism or Republicanism .
There may be a realignment but the incompetent and mixed messages coming out of the White House make it very difficult.â€
�
Bannonâ€ ™ s
three verticals need to be better defined , Tyler added .
â€œI still donâ€
™ t know what our position is towards Russia and Putin , Iâ€ ™ m still unclear what the plan is to defeat Isis in Syria and Iraq , I donâ€ ™ t know what our agenda is for North Korea and Kim Jong - un .
I donâ€
™ t know what â€˜economic nationalismâ€ ™ means.â€
�
For the next 50 days , he predicted ,
â€œItâ€ ™ s going to get harder .
Weâ€ ™ ve now seen the way the administration reacts .
They donâ€ ™ t have a replacement for Obamacare .
Foreign powers will continue to test us and weâ€ ™ ve shown we donâ€ ™ t have a response.â€ �
Such is
Trumpâ€ ™ s temperament and volatility
, there were some who doubted he would make it to 50 days .
But his speech to Congress reassured doubtful Republicans and left Democrats digging in for a protracted battle against a constantly moving target .
Bob Shrum , a Democratic political consultant , said : â€œThereâ€ ™ s a deal here : the congressional Republican party is putting up with the tweets and other things they donâ€ ™ t like and in return they get to repeal and replace Obamacare and cut taxes for rich people .
â€œThese are conservative dreams .
They are putting up with Trump because heâ€ ™ s giving them their conservative dreams .
I expect more of the same so long as heâ€ ™ s there.â€ �"
"Arnold Schwarzenegger has ruled out a run for the US Senate , in response to widespread speculation that the actor would return to political life to take on Donald Trump .
Schwarzenegger , who was governor of California from 2003 to 2011 , had been tipped by political insiders to enter the 2018 race for the US Senate , either as a Republican or an independent , in a move that would have given him a public platform to oppose Trumpâ€ ™ s presidency .
However , Schwarzenegger refuted the rumours in a Facebook post published on Sunday , suggesting instead that he would continue his battle against political gerrymandering .
â€œIâ€ ™ m deeply flattered by all of the people who have approached me about running for Senate , but my mission right now is to bring sanity to Washington through redistricting reform like we passed here in California , â€ � he wrote .
â€œGerrymandering has completely broken our political system and I believe my best platform to help repair it is from the outside , by campaigning for independent redistricting commissions .
â€œThank you for your kind messages and all of the support
and I hope youâ€ ™ ll join me in my battle against gerrymandering with the same enthusiasm.â€
�
Schwarzenegger has long been a vocal critic of Trump , supporting Trumpâ€ ™ s opponent John Kasich in the Republican primaries and later announcing that he wouldnâ€ ™ t vote for Trump as president , following the release of a widely condemned recording in which Trump boasted about groping women .
It was the first time that Schwarzenegger had not voted for a Republican candidate for president since he became a US citizen in 1983 .
A Twitter feud between the pair has intensified in the weeks following Trumpâ€ ™ s swearing in as president .
Trump mocked the ratings of his successor as host of The Celebrity Apprentice , at the National Prayer Breakfast in February , and Schwarzenegger suggested in response that the two men should swap jobs , so that â€œpeople can finally sleep comfortably againâ€ � .
Earlier this month , Schwarzenegger announced that he would not return as host of The New Celebrity Apprentice , blaming Trumpâ€ ™ s continued involvement in the show , as executive producer , for its poor ratings .
Trump in turn claimed in a tweet that Schwarzenegger had not resigned but had been â€œfired by his bad ( pathetic ) ratings ....
Sad end to great showâ€ � ."
"The jockey who rode Fridayâ€ ™ s Cheltenham Gold Cup winner was wearing special goggles to combat the double - vision he suffers from since a kick to the head in a fall last summer .
Robbie Power has the impaired vision when looking through the top of his left eye , a condition which would hardly affect most people but which is a fundamental problem for jockeys as a result of the bent - forward posture they are obliged to adopt in races .
In Fridayâ€ ™ s post - race photographs , Power could be seen with one eye wide open and the other almost closed , prompting social media comparisons with Arnold Schwarzenegger in The Terminator .
Counterintuitively , Power reports that it is the more open eye , the left one , which is damaged .
Power , who also won the 2007 Grand National on Silver Birch , was injured at the Galway Festival in July when he was an early faller in a 20-runner race over hurdles and was kicked as a horse passed above him .
The blow broke a cheekbone and caused a complex fracture of his left eye - socket , with additional damage to the muscle on the floor of his eye - bed .
While the other symptoms passed , Powerâ€ ™ s vision did not recover and it appeared that his career in the saddle might be over .
The 35-year - old credits the Dublin - based ophthalmologist Ian Flitcroft for the fact that he was eventually able to return to the saddle in October .
Two months later , he was given the ride on Sizing John , who carried him to Cheltenham glory on Friday .
â€œI wear specially treated goggles to correct the double vision , â€ � Power said on Monday .
â€œIt doesnâ€ ™ t affect me in everyday life .
I can still drive and everything else is fine .
Itâ€ ™ s only a problem when youâ€ ™ re on a horse , looking out of the top of your eyeball . â€œIan Flitcroft came up with the idea .
He said I was the first jockey heâ€
™ s worked with but heâ€ ™ s worked with swimmers and snooker players before .
â€œIâ€ ™ d say the muscles on the floor of the eye - bed have gone .
It would probably take surgery to fix them and Iâ€ ™ ve been told that surgery is an option.â€ �
But Power added that he was not tempted by surgery , given how well the corrective goggles have worked for him .
Power could arguably be at a disadvantage relative to other jump jockeys when the mud is flying , circumstances in which some jockeys wear several pairs of goggles and pull down the outermost set if they become muck - spattered .
When that happens , Powerâ€ ™ s only option is to try wiping away the mud with his fingers , but it didnâ€
™ t stop him riding winners through a typically wet Irish winter .
Nor was the Galway fall his only recent injury , as he ruptured a disc in his back in January , requiring an epidural injection as part of his treatment .
It was an unpromising buildup to last weekâ€ ™ s Cheltenham Festival , where he then rode three winners , his first successes in Britain since 2011 .
Of Sizing John , he said : â€œI rode him for the first time at Christmas and made the suggestion he should go up in distance .
Iâ€ ™ ve always had great faith in the horse , I believed heâ€ ™
d stay the trip .
We had the homecoming last night in Moone [ the horseâ€ ™ s home village in Kildare ] , which was very exciting .
â€œIt was an unbelievable feeling .
Iâ€ ™
d say I appreciated it more than winning the National
because Iâ€ ™ m 35 now , not 25 .
But theyâ€ ™ re the two biggest races in jump racing .
Iâ€ ™ m very lucky to have won both.â€ � Exeter 2.00

"It may well be â€œhasta la vista , babyâ€ � for Arnold Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s Terminator : the long - running science - fiction franchise is reported to have been cancelled .
According to the New York Daily News , Paramount , which holds the rights to the franchise , has declined to bring back the sunglasses - wearing cyborg for future instalments of the series .
â€œIt is over for The Terminator and Arnold , â€ � a source told the paper .
â€œThe studio has taken the sequel off the production slate completely , meaning there is no preproduction or any plans for another sequel .
The talent had been offered long - term deals , but this is not happening.â€ �
The most recent film in the Terminator series , Genisys , was released in 2015 and struggled at the US box office .
However , it fared better internationally , particularly in China , and eventually took $ 400 m worldwide .
But that international success may not have been enough to save the franchise .
A sequel to the film was removed from Paramountâ€ ™ s 2017 release schedule last year , and now looks to have been shelved .
â€œThe Genisys movie was seen as a way of reviving [ the franchise ] , but the critics were not happy and somehow the studio bosses fell out of love with making more , even though they made huge profits , â€ � the source added .
Schwarzenegger first played the Terminator ( T-800 ) , a cyborg sent back in time to kill a woman pregnant with the leader of a future resistance movement , in the 1984 film of the same name .
The role made Schwarzenegger a global star , and he went on to star in two sequels , Judgment Day ( 1991 ) and Rise of the Machines ( 2001 ) .
He had a small cameo in the widely panned fourth instalment Salvation in 2009 , before returning as lead for Genisys .
There were reports in January that James Cameron is preparing a reboot of the films when he regains partial rights to the franchise in 2019 .
It is unclear how Paramountâ€
™ s reported decision will affect Cameronâ€ ™ s proposed update .
The director is currently working on four sequels to his fantasy film Avatar .
The Terminator is not the only Schwarzenegger - related franchise to have stalled .
Earlier this month the actor and former politician announced that he would leave NBC talent show The Celebrity Apprentice , which he hosted following Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s departure to run for president .
Ratings dipped during Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s tenure , which he blamed on the â€œbaggageâ€ � of Trumpâ€ ™ s unpopularity .
Trump , who is still listed as an executive producer on the show , responded by claiming that Schwarzenegger had been â€œfired by pathetic ratingsâ€ � ."
"Under different circumstances , something could have been made of this well - intentioned movie , a story of tragedy and obsession based on the 2002 Ãœberlingen disaster , in which the collision of two jets in German airspace resulted in 71 deaths .
The action is transplanted to Columbus , Ohio , and Scoot McNairy does a decent job playing Jake , the air traffic controller involved .
There is a very tense opening sequence in the control tower as disaster approaches .
Arnold Schwarzenegger trudges through his role as Roman , a construction worker whose wife and pregnant daughter are killed in the crash , and who battles to find any official prepared to offer him a meaningful apology .
His performance suggests a decent guy who has been badly let down by a heartless convocation of lawyers , but he fails to provide any plausible clue to the obsessive and retributive side to his characterâ€ ™ s personality .
The screenwriter is Javier GullÃ³n , who scripted Denis Villeneuveâ€ ™ s interesting doppelganger drama Enemy in 2013 , and the film was co - produced by Schwarzenegger with Darren Aronofsky .
I can imagine it coming to life in the hands of a director like Alejandro GonzÃ¡lez IÃ±Ã¡rritu or Jacques Audiard , but this is a two - dimensional piece of work ."
"A dour almost - thriller about an air - traffic controller ( Scoot McNairy ) who inadvertently kills 271 people , including the wife and pregnant daughter of Ukrainian construction worker Roman Melnyk ( Arnold Schwarzenegger ) , this is a trick of a movie that pretends it will subvert expectations by putting Arnie in a cuddly sweater .
Helped along by a gloomy , oppressive score , it neither thoughtfully examines themes of trauma , guilt and grief nor moves with any sort of haste to its eventual , obvious , revenge - thriller conclusion , despite its short 90-minute running time ."
"Nostalgia can only take you so far .
Just ask Bryan Singer , whose efforts to recapture the wonder of the Richard Donner - era Man of Steel in 2006â€ ™ s Superman Returns faltered on the kryptonite of audience indifference .
Likewise , pity the creative team behind 2015â€ ™ s Terminator Genisys , who were convinced they only had to get Arnold Schwarzenegger back as the robo - toned T-800 in order to restore the long - running sci - fi saga to its 80s and 90s zenith , or poor old Guy Ritchie , who presumably thought the current passion for all things spy - themed would make his recent big - screen upgrade of The Man from UNCLE a box office shoo - in .
All of the above failed to connect with audiences because they didnâ€ ™ t bring fresh ideas to venerable franchises , to inject renewed energy into a tired old dance .
And yet the current revival of Star Wars , in the wake of Disneyâ€ ™ s 2012 buyout of all rights to the space saga , has been built almost entirely on an ardent nostalgia for the original trilogy that hit cinemas between 1977 and 1983 .
While naysayers quite reasonably grumble that JJ Abramsâ€ ™
The Force Awakens was a hurriedly assembled rehash of themes from the first Star Wars movie , the vast majority of fans were more than willing to accept the odd stolen plot point as a necessary evil provided the sagaâ€ ™ s traditional knockabout space - romp roots were renewed and there was absolutely no mention of bumbling Gungans or tedious trade blockades .
Likewise , last yearâ€ ™ s Rogue One triumphed largely as a fanboy - focused feast .
This was cinema for those who loved 1977â€ ™ s
Star Wars so much they would shell out to see what amounted to an eccentric aperitif to that movie , a revisiting of the events that led to the blowing up of the first Death Star from the perspective of a bunch of Rebel grunts whose very existence fans had spent the previous 40-odd years being merrily oblivious of .
From a commercial perspective , this approach has been a no - brainer ( to the tune of more than $ 3bn at the global box office for the last two instalments ) .
Why risk seeking out a new creative seam rich enough to keep Star Wars in business for the next decade while there is still precious metal to be found by mining the sagaâ€ ™ s roots ?
Moreover â€ “ and despite Lucasfilm narrowly averting disaster on Rogue One â€
“
the new films have simply been a cut above those released between 1999 and 2005 , when George Lucas seemed hell - bent on throwing everything he had worked so hard to create straight down the Sarlaccâ€ ™ s deathly maw .
But even Lucasfilm now knows that the game is up , as evidenced by comments made over the weekend at Disneyâ€ ™ s D23 event in Anaheim , California .
If The Force Awakens restored the saga to its rightful tone , and Rogue One manifested as a delightful side dish to the main event , The Last Jedi is being hyped as something altogether fresh .
Daisy Ridley suggests the new episode is â€œunexpected , but rightâ€ � while Mark Hamill says he â€œnever could have imaginedâ€ � the storyline this time around .
John Boyega reckons â€œeverything is being shifted in the opposite way to what the audience expected after sevenâ€ � .
These are bold statements , and it remains to be seen whether The Last Jedi can deliver on them .
Johnson himself invited fans to imagine the new chapter as a giant curveball in Star Wars history when he had Skywalker apparently damn the entire Jedi order in the teaser for Episode 8 .
Rumours swirl that we might find out more about the legendary Guardians of the Whills ( re)introduced in Rogue One ; even that epic Force Trees will play a part in events â€ “ perhaps revealed as the catalyst for the metaphysical energy field entering the galaxy .
And frankly , even if the latter sounds horribly reminiscent of Lucasâ€
™ awful midi - chlorean experiment on the prequels , it would at least represent a deepening of our knowledge of the big - screen Star Wars universe .
For fansâ€ ™ greatest fear is that the new instalment offers nothing new at all , that it cleaves tightly to the template of 1980â€ ™ s Empire Strikes Back â€ “ just as its predecessor stuck closely to 1977â€ ™
s Star Wars .
We already know that Ridleyâ€ ™ s Rey will spend time with Luke Skywalker on Ahch - To , an encounter that seemingly parallels Luke learning the ways of the Force from Jedi master Yoda on the swampy planet of Dagobah in Irvine Kershnerâ€
™ s brooding sequel .
There are hints that the First Order may mount a revenge attack on the Resistance â€ “ Johnson has described the good guys having to deal with a â€œpressing threatâ€ � on the remote mining planet of Crait â€ “ in the wake of the destruction of Starkiller Base in The Force Awakens , which would surely lead to claims of cribbing from the Dark Sideâ€ ™ s early victory on the ice planet of Hoth in Empire .
Most worryingly of all â€ “ and concerns here are radically reduced if one simply ignores the murkier corners of the geekosphere â€ “ fan sites and message boards have been rumouring for months that The Last Jedi will feature a monumental twist on a par with Empireâ€ ™ s revelation that Darth Vader was once Anakin Skywalker .
If it really does turn out that Rey is the reincarnation of Vader , or even , as some are suggesting , that the shiny black death cyborg was lying to Luke ( dum , dum daaaaah ! )
all those space decades ago , Johnson might want to try freezing himself in carbonate for a few decades from 15 December â€ “ until the resulting backlash has quietened down a bit ."
"All his life , Arnold Schwarzenegger has embodied dominance .
Mr Olympia , Conan the Barbarian , the Terminator , the Governator â€ “ on screen or on a podium
he was the biggest , the strongest , the mightiest .
Whether wielding a sword , a shotgun or a governorâ€ ™ s pen , as a film character or himself , he exulted in success â€ “ in victory .
â€œCrush your enemies , see them driven before you and hear the lamentation of the women.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ ll be back.â€ � â€œIf they donâ€ ™ t have the guts , I call them girlie men.â€ �
He was , and seemingly always would be , the Austrian Oak .
A preternatural degree of confidence , focus and ambition propelled him from the forest village of Thal to triumph in bodybuilding , Hollywood and US politics .
The accent and a name once deemed unpronounceable did nothing to slow him .
Even the jokes , such as Clive James comparing him to a brown condom full of walnuts , only bolstered the mystique .
But as Schwarzenegger approaches his 70th birthday on Sunday he confronts a relentless , insidious foe not even he can vanquish : time .
Schwarzenegger , after all , is human .
And the clock , unlike alien predators and rival cyborgs from the future , can not be stopped .
As it ticks , his supremacy ebbs .
â€œHe just wants to be number one , in whatever context .
He would do anything to sustain it .
But the ageing process ...
itâ€ ™ s never welcome , â€ � said Barbara Outland Baker , a former girlfriend .
â€œI think deep inside him there is some discomfort : â€˜What am I supposed to do with this journey ?
I only want to be number one .
If not number one , what am I supposed to do?â€ ™ â€ � Schwarzenegger remains famous , popular and busy
â€ “ manically busy .
Early mornings you can spot him in Santa Monica , belting up Ocean Avenue on his bicycle , flying through red lights for his cardio .
He still pumps iron , acts , travels and champions political candidates and causes .
â€œHe is like a Terminator machine in terms of ceaseless going , going , going , striving , striving , striving , â€ � said Bonnie Reiss , global director of an institute that bears his name at the University of Southern California .
Striving , but no longer conquering .
Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s recent films have fizzled at the box office .
He stumped in vain for John Kasich in last yearâ€ ™ s Republican primaries .
Chatter of him running for Senate or mounting some type of political comeback has faded .
The former action hero who ran California is no longer number one .
He has invested his remaining political capital in the worthy if arcane issue of redistricing reform - curbing the gerrymandering which bedevils local and state elections and fuels partisanship .
He is ginning up money and attention for a case which will reach the Supreme Court in October .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s a gadfly .
He doesnâ€ ™ t really have much of a constituency in the Republican party , â€ � said Jack Pitney , a politics professor at Claremont McKenna College .
â€œCalifornia Republicans donâ€
™ t talk about him any more .
Heâ€ ™ s essentially
a non - person.â€ � Schwarzenegger used to be political royalty .
He married Maria Shriver , John F Kennedyâ€ ™ s niece , and as an outsized GOP outsider brushed off sexual harassment allegations dubbed â€œgropegateâ€ � and won Californiaâ€ ™ s governorship in 2003 .
It was a rocky tenure .
He mocked Democratic opponents as â€œgirlie menâ€ � , clashed with unions and other powerful interest groups and watched the recession ignite a fiscal crisis .
He averted meltdown and won re - election by rebooting his administration , moving to the political centre and grinding out legislative gains .
Upon leaving office in 2011 he tainted his legacy by commuting the jail sentence of the son of a political ally .
His divorce from Shriver amid revelations of an affair and secret son with their housekeeper further dented his reputation .
For all his political accomplishments â€ “ he mobilised California in the fight against climate change â€ “ the loss of executive clout must hurt , said Outland Baker .
â€œHe really likes fame and power and
the movie industry canâ€ ™ t provide the same level of real fulfillment , â€ �
she said .
Their relationship ended in 1974 but they remained in touch and he gave an interview for her 2006 memoir , Arnold and Me :
In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak .
Schwarzenegger , who became a US citizen in 1983 , dreamed of the White House .
But an effort to amend the constitution , the so - called Arnold amendment , failed to lift the ban on foreign - born candidates .
A huge blow , said Outland Baker : â€œYou want to be the best , the top , if youâ€ ™ re Arnold .
If he could run , he would try.â€
�
The ascent of another celebrity - turned - GOP politician to the Oval Office , however , has conjured an unexpected role , one with a global spotlight and rapt audience : needler of Donald Trump .
The two used to be on good terms but Trumpâ€ ™ s rise triggered a feud .
It erupts in slug and counter - slug every few weeks .
The president branded Schwarzenegger a â€œtotal disasterâ€ � and â€œpatheticâ€ � as host of Celebrity Apprentice , which he used to host himself .
He told a national prayer breakfast gathering : â€œI want to just pray for Arnold ... for those ratings.â€ � Schwarzenegger has swung back with gusto .
â€œHey Donald , I have a great idea ,
â€ �
he said in a video posted on social media .
â€œWhy
donâ€
™ t we switch jobs ?
You take over TV because youâ€ ™ re such an expert on ratings and I take over your job and then people can finally sleep comfortably again.â€ �
When Trumpâ€ ™ s approval ratings sank he gloated : â€œThe ratings are in , and you got swamped.â€ �
Speculation abounds over Trumpâ€ ™ s motivation for the trolling .
â€œA competition with someone he thinks is worthy of being an opponent
, â€ � suggested Joel Fox , a tax policy consultant who collaborated with the Governator .
â€œI think he finds Schwarzenegger threatening because he has this deep insecurity about his manhood , â€ � said Pitney , the analyst .
Whatever the reason , the Terminator star has become a â€œsubtle irritantâ€ � and agent provocateur to the worldâ€ ™ s most powerful man , said Michael Blitz , co - author a 2004 biography titled Why Arnold Matters :
The Rise of a Cultural Icon .
â€œArnold may not be able to pump much iron anymore
but he remains a persistent virtuoso of pumping irony into the bizarre state of American politics .
He is the has - been who still is.â€ � Schwarzenegger is well equipped for battle in this nexus of politics and celebrity , said Reiss , of the Schwarzenegger Institute .
â€œTrash - talking and head psyching was part of the bodybuilding world ,
â€ � she said .
The future governor honed his taunting skills against a bodybuilding rival , Lou Ferrigno , the future Incredible Hulk , in the 1977 documentary Pumping Iron .
Trump and Schwarzenegger convert the feud into publicity , said Outland Baker : â€œThey have enough in common that they probably understand the psyche of each other better than the rest of us.â€
�
Schwarzenegger had more to gain , said Fox , the policy consultant .
â€œIf the president wants to engage with Arnold , itâ€ ™ s
advantage Arnold.â€
�
The former governor has used the attention to spotlight climate change and an after - school programme , both causes close to his heart .
Trump - trolling aside , Schwarzenegger works hard to sustain his brand against the ravage of time .
It conspires to downsize him , literally : his official height , 6ft2 in , has been disputed over the years by doubters who claim he is closer to 5ft10 in .
He still works out at Goldâ€ ™ s gym in Venice , trundles around Los Angeles in his ( biodiesel ) Hummer and travels widely to promote climate change measures , bodybuilding contests and movies .
The bankable star of action flicks such as Predator , Commando and Total Recall , and comedies such as Twins and Kindergarten Cop is long gone .
Recent action outings such as The Last Stand , Escape Plan and Sabotage misfired .
Pivoting to smaller , quieter films â€ “ Maggie , Aftermath â€ “ won over some critics ( Arnie can act ! )
but audiences stayed away .
He plays a hitman in the upcoming comedy Why Weâ€ ™ re Killing Gunther .
Schwarzenegger still brings stardust and policy mastery to events promoting the environment , bipartisanship , voting reform and youth programmes .
France recently recognised his climate change efforts with the Legion dâ€ ™ Honneur .
A packed , rewarding life for most mortals â€ “ but Arnie ?
The meaning of life , he one said , was not â€œsimply to exist , to survive , but to move ahead , to go up , to achieve , to conquerâ€ � ."
"The UKâ€ ™ s financial watchdog is to launch a Â£42 m campaign featuring a model of the Terminator star , Arnold Schwarzenegger , to raise awareness of the deadline for making complaints about payment protection insurance .
The Financial Conduct Authorityâ€ ™ s ad campaign , which is being paid for by the 18 banks , building societies and credit card providers with the most PPI complaints , is being launched exactly two years before the 29 August 2019 deadline for claims .
It features an animatronic model head of Schwarzenegger mounted on tracks that pursues supermarket shoppers urging them to stop procrastinating and look into making a PPI claim .
â€œMake a decision , do it now , â€ � says the robotic Schwarzenegger threateningly , in scenes reminiscent of the Terminatorâ€ ™ s dogged pursuit of his intended victim , Sarah Connor , in the 1980s film .
The mini - terminator is voiced by David Brent , a Canadian actor and comedian .
The Â£42 m campaign has been created by M&amp;C Saatchi , the Conservative partyâ€ ™ s longstanding ad agency , and will first air during Emmerdale on ITV1 on Tuesday night .
â€œWith this advertising campaign , our biggest challenge is cutting through the noise on PPI and we have created a campaign that is designed to do just that , â€ � said Emma Stranack , the FCAâ€ ™ s head of business and consumer communications .
â€œWe have undertaken extensive testing to ensure the creative idea was impactful and understood by our very broad target audience .
The result is a suite of adverts that we are confident will help us achieve our campaign objectives.â€ �
The FCA said it was spending Â£42.2 m on the entire â€œdeadline awarenessâ€ � marketing push , with Â£24.4 m of that going on the ad campaign across TV , billboards and posters , online and video - on - demand services .
In addition , Â£4.9 m was spent producing the ads , to cover items such as talent fees â€ “ including Schwarzeneggerâ€ ™ s image rights â€ “ and another Â£4.2 m was spent on a helpline and website .
Agency fees , for M&amp;C Saatchi and the media planning and buying agency Manning Gottlieb OMD , totalled Â£3 m .
A further Â£3 m was spent on partnerships , PR and social media customer service , and Â£1 m on legal fees , staff costs and contingency .
The FCA spent Â£1.7 m on evaluation and testing to ensure the ad campaign hits the mark with consumers .
â€œWhen people hear â€˜PPIâ€ ™ they switch off .
Weâ€ ™ ve heard so much about it
, weâ€ ™ ve stopped listening , â€ � said M&amp;C Saatchi executive creative director Justin Tindall .
â€œThis campaign is designed to cut through the white noise and capture peopleâ€
™ s attention.â€

"Steven with an jarringly emotional takeaway message .
Tough Flo reveals her own Arnold Schwarzenegger tendencies .
Sheâ€ ™ ll be back .
And so will I !
Next week is bread week , and it looks spectacular from that trailer .

Like a thinner Charlie Brooker , or a slightly camper Graham Norton , he was too good for this world .
But not good enough for the tent .
Save Flo .
Flo canâ€ ™ t go .
I need her , even without the Flo - titles .
Ah my friend Gabby is in that Purple Bricks advert .
Iâ€ ™ m pleased for her !
I donâ€

Prue always gets some sexualised banter in at this point .
Like sheâ€ ™ s on a timer .
Liam last week , and Chris â€œI love your compassâ€ � this week .
Long working days do wear down oneâ€ ™ s social decorum , I guess .

Paul and Prueâ€ ™ s faces as Chris was outlining the rules to his Great British Sail Off puzzle .
As if he was explaining how his fillings pick up KGB radio waves , and tell him what to do .
Never thought Iâ€ ™ d say this , but bring back the historical interludes .
â€œLeopold of Schweinsteig invented Lucky Charms by casting his kingly treasure into a field of barley , under the influence of syphilis ...

When ... when would the necessity of making a biscuit board game arise ?

I feel like Noel is coming up with these showstoppers himself .
That was a very underperformed technical , wasnâ€ ™ t it ?
Unfortunate cookies .
These adverts do go on .
I vote we all make a simultaneous tea and crash the grid , just to get rid of them .
Oh god , the KFC advert .
It haunts me .
Chris and Flo bring up the rear , James does well and Sophieâ€ ™ s number twos are very solid .
But Yan steals it .
Go Yan and go Science !
Sophie leaps straight from the back to the top of the class with her beautifully shaped little hearts .

Wunderbar , Sophie !
Youâ€ ™ re the new Steven .

â€œRaw batterâ€ ™ s not much fun , â€ � gags Prue , spitting out Chrisâ€ ™ s wad of underdone biscuit .
Donâ€ ™ t need a fortune cookie to know which way the windâ€ ™ s blowing for him .
â€œAll I have to do now is the dipping and the nutting.â€ �
Calm down Stacey , this isnâ€ ™ t Love Island .
They all seem stressed and hapless .
Is anyone bossing this ?
Possibly Sophie at the back .
They havenâ€ ™ t put a camera on her for a while , so I assume sheâ€ ™ s baking her cookies inside a crystal ball , or stone - baking on a statue of Nostradamus .
â€œI

Ironically , she writes it twice , casting doubt on whether in fact she can .
Contestants writing their own fortunes , at least for this round .
â€œSpeak your mind for it is â€ ¦

Sophie and Stacey pull ahead .
They may be well Waitrose , but theyâ€ ™ re not a bad bunch when it comes to the baking , are they ?
Seriously , who is Tom ?
Juliaâ€ ™ s jelly wotsits are beyond weird , right ?
Floâ€ ™ s
gin is unapparent , but Stevenâ€ ™ s chewy almonds get a thumbs up .
Kateâ€

Sophieâ€ ™ s biscuits are identikit marvels , like sheâ€ ™ s poured out a tray of Mrs Crimbles cookies .
Why is Prue dressed like Timmy Mallett ?
Judging time !
Prue gives James the Federer of backhanded compliments .
â€œYouâ€ ™ ve made 24 almost identical biscuits.â€

This is what sheâ€ ™ s like when sheâ€ ™ s being nice ?
â€œIâ€ ™ m getting rhubarb which is lovelyâ€

she wheezes painfully ,
as if sheâ€ ™ s just ingested a tablespoon of fertilizer .
Perfume ads are beyond parody , arenâ€ ™ t they ?
Theyâ€ ™ re the Donald Trump of commercial content .

This ad break brought to you by Sesame Street and the letter S Liam praises septuagenarian Floâ€ ™ s jammy prowess .
â€œThat is sick.â€ �
She sips her tea , content with a job well done .
I want these two to be a double act forever .
Now , drink your syrup , everyone .
In the midst of all this excitement , can we call a moratorium on Noel and Sandiâ€ ™ s skits ?
While not the ring - puckering low of the â€œbowled overâ€ � bit last week , the â€œsandwich biscuitâ€ � gag still leaves you wanting less .
â€œOrange and â€

â€œSex?â€ �
Sandi and Chris enjoy the clumsiest flirtation to ever grace a tent .
The bungalow of erotic banter , it doesnâ€ ™ t even reach the height of a single entendre .
Kate had a relative in the engine room of the Titanic , who survived , we discover .
I usually take a micro - nap when people talk about their families on TV , but that is fascinating .
None of the presenters know what to do with the information however , so the conversation ends on a lightly awkward note .
Sophie is SO winter sports , isnâ€ ™ t
she ?
Howard I need all the encouragement I can get !
Iâ€ ™ m all jacked up on cinnamon palmiers and will definitely collapse before the showstoppers .
Forget the gin - stewed raspberries , Flo and her girlfriends singing All About

Who is Tom ?
I swear this is the first Iâ€ ™ m hearing about him .
Heâ€ ™ s
no Steven , I know that .
Floâ€ ™ s working on her bingo wings , while â€ “ hang on
, did Julia just do â€ ¦ a comedy Russian accent ?
I bet sheâ€ ™ s actually from Budleigh Salterton .
James doing some amazing fake answering a phone in that clip .
Textbook â€œThatâ€

marriage : everything and nothing.â€

Literally what does that mean , Sandi .
I love rose , cardamom and pistachio , so Juliaâ€ ™ s biscuits should be lovely .
Yanâ€ ™ s peanut butter and banana effort sounds kinda amazing too , with added science .
Who leaves Siberia to live in Crawley ?
Thatâ€ ™ s like moving from the freezer to the refrigerator .
â€œIf you combine a hard biscuit with a soft interior , itâ€ ™ ll go all over your lap.â€ �
Paul explains the quickest way to a soggy bottom after a big night / a certain age .
Well which is it ?
Make up your minds .
Sandi folding in a bit of QI - ery into the intro .
Noelâ€ ™ s shirt is so red it looks like heâ€ ™ s peeled his entire skin off .
Worth a drink .
Here we go !
Settle down and listen the doctor .
The clearly mad doctor Oetker .
Ch4 Newsreader garbled that summary of J - Lawâ€ ™ s new film , but the words she did get out were intriguing .
Filthy Beast ?
A dirtier sequel to Dirty Beast ?
Shall we do a bingo ?
Letâ€ ™ s do a bingo .
If any of these occur , drink everything you own : Noel being quieter than his shirt Prue carving â€œNot worth the caloriesâ€ � into a contestantâ€ ™ s head Uncle Paul mellowing like the fruitfulness of autumn
Liam calling Paul Pops , and explaining â€œwe bake different nowadaysâ€ � Stacey staring into a bin
The old Bake Off canâ€ ™ t come to the phone right now .
Why ?
Because sheâ€ ™ s brown bread .
If youâ€ ™ re reading this , youâ€ ™ ve decided
last weekâ€

And this is where things get interesting .
Weâ€ ™ ll start sifting the star bakers from the kitchen no - marks , ditching anyone boring and becoming slowly obsessed with the rest .
This week itâ€ ™ s biscuits .
Whoâ€ ™ ll snap into gear , and who will crumble ?
Thereâ€ ™ s only one way to find out : dust off that weird holiday booze , undo a button or several , and letâ€ ™ s get comment - y .
The show starts at 8 pm , and I want you on your worst behaviour .
See you then , baking bredren !"
"Years from now , when people look back on the 2010s they will be confused and scared .
They will look at our angry politics , our monochrome Marvel cinema , our weird obsession with one stock image of a man looking at a woman while another woman looks angrily at him , and conclude that we were an unknowable and stupid people who worshipped the offspring of Kate Middleton , and got sad when a big clock stopped going bong .
And if they look hard enough , they will find a piece of art that sums up our era quite perfectly .
A work that was released last week , with little fanfare , that will surely come to define us as a people .
Historians will watch this work and nod .
â€œAh
, I see now why these people acted as they did .
The 2010s truly were a dark and disturbing time.â€
�
The work of which I speak is not a play , not a film ; and it is not Bake Off .
It is a 60-second advertisement for reclaiming PPI , starring the screaming , robotic , disembodied head of Arnold Schwarzenegger on a small remote - control car , and it is one of the most upsettingly haunting things I have ever seen .
It is set in a low - ceilinged dystopian supermarket ; 1980s horror synth ominously growls in the background .
Three weary shoppers try to make a decision on what kind of apple , kitchen roll or deodorant they want .
They take slightly too long .
That is their only crime .
For that , they must pay .
Out of nowhere ,
Arnoldâ€ ™ s
rubber face bursts from the produce .
â€œSurprise!â€ � he screams , rolling out with unnatural speed .
The people think of running , but it is too late .
He is there .
He must be placated .
The horror synth grows louder .
â€œDo it !
Make a decision !
Just pick one !
Do it naaaaaaaaow!â€ �
he yells , his metallic body spinning and shaking , like an unholy demon crossed with a miniature all - terrain vehicle .
The customers suppress sobs , pick their items and march sadly to the cashier .
â€œYouâ€ ™ ve at least made a decision on the PPI , right?â€ � he snarls .
The ham - faced shoppers shake their heads , eyes wet with fear .
Arnie lets out a guttural , animalistic , â€œCome aaawn!â€ � , and for a second it looks as if he will bite off their kneecaps with his disturbingly realistic teeth .
Mercifully we instead cut to a woman at a desk explaining the details of PPI , and the shoppers are allowed to go home , presumably to sign up for Ocado so they never have to leave the house again .
The advert , part of a Â£30 m Saatchi campaign paid for by the Financial Conduct Authority to inform the public about the upcoming PPI deadline , provokes infinitely more questions than answers .
Where is the rest of Arnieâ€ ™ s body ?
Who is controlling Arnie ?
Why is he so invested in peopleâ€ ™ s PPI claims ?
How does he eat ?
Does he feel pain ?
Can he be programmed to feel at all ?
Is there a chance he will gain sentience and attempt to take over the world , turning every human into a disembodied head who demands to know the status of your PPI claim ?
None of these questions have been answered yet , but given that the PPI deadline doesnâ€ ™ t expire until 2019 , weâ€ ™ ll probably have a few more instalments to find out .
â€œRoboArnie and the Missold PPI Claimâ€ �
â€ “ which also sounds like another Terminator movie that no one asked for â€ “ is part of a growing genre : nostalgia ads , or nostalgiads , which inexplicably use fictional characters from the childhood of the target demographic , usually without logic or reason , to sell products .
Famous examples include MoneySupermarketâ€ ™ s use of Skeletor , where the fearsome Masters of the Universe villain takes time off from trying to enslave Eternia to see how much he could save on his home insurance , and Halifaxâ€ ™ s use of Scooby Doo , where he and Shaggy escape from a monster by going into a conveniently placed branch to learn about the rewards of a Halifax current account .
It is impossible to watch those adverts and not feel a part of your soul dying .
Scooby and Shaggy did not survive 48 years of groundskeepers haunting abandoned fairgrounds just so they could say â€œzoinksâ€ � at a 18.9 % variable rate on a Clarity Credit Card .
Scrappy Doo did not die for this .
Halifax is the worst offender by far in this new genre .
It makes Top Cat , a cat who lives in a trashcan , get a mortgage .
Why ?
Why would Top Cat want a mortgage ?
He eschews citywide bureaucracy frequently in his get - rich - quick schemes
â€ “ why would he want to be tied down to a fixed address ?
Officer Dibble would get a search warrant within hours and the jig would be up .
Itâ€ ™ s just unrealistic .
And donâ€ ™ t get me started on the most recent Thunderbirds - Halifax crossover , in which Parker wins the lottery and abruptly quits on Lady Penelope .
Are we to believe that Parkerâ€ ™ s loyalties to Lady Penelope are so flimsy ?
Iâ€ ™ m sorry , but the Parker I know wouldnâ€ ™ t just up sticks and leave .
Up until RoboArnie , I had thought this genre of advert was a lazy attempt to tie your beloved childhood heroes to dull financial products .
But watching that Austrian head whizz and whirr around the supermarket floor as confused shoppers held back tears , I realised it was something much darker , something much more relevant to our generation .
The message of these adverts is simple : no one can escape the drudgery of modern life â€ “ not even your childhood heroes .
Think about the Arnie of the 1980s â€ “ fun , over - the - top , muscly , controlled by no one , telling guys with pipes in their chest to â€œlet off some steamâ€ � .
Now look at what he has become in 2017 â€ “ a disembodied head on wheels , muscles sliced off , his catchphrases twisted and mangled to encourage you to check out your PPI claim .
Your favourite form of childhood escapism
â€ “ be it an action film , cartoon , puppet or Iggy Pop
â€ “ has been wrenched from its fantasy world and forced , painfully , into our dull , responsibility - laden universe of financial products and comparison websites .
No one can escape â€ “ not Arnie , not Shaggy , not Scooby , not even Harvey Keitelâ€ ™ s character from Pulp Fiction , who now exclusively helps hen parties who have broken down in the English countryside for some reason .
Time comes for us all .
So thank you , the FCA , Halifax and MoneySupermarket .
You have created a new subgenre of art that is more terrifying and despair - inducing than anything Hollywood could dream up .
May the rolling wheels of RoboArnie haunt your every trip to Tesco .
â€¢ Jack Bernhardt is a comedy writer and occasional performer"
"With the Channel 4 series of dramas based on his short stories starting , Philip K Dick has cemented his reputation as one of the most adapted science fiction authors of the modern age .
The most famous big - screen outing of recent years was Ridley Scottâ€ ™ s Blade Runner , released in 1982 , the year the author died .
But there has also been Total Recall , starring Arnold Schwarzenegger ( and its 2012 remake ) ; Minority Report ( 2002 ) , with Tom Cruise ; the Richard Linklater â€œrotoscopedâ€ � version of A Scanner Darkly , which overlayed animation on live - action footage of Keanu Reeves ; and 2011â€ ™ s The Adjustment Bureau .
PKD , as heâ€ ™ s usually known , most recently came to prominence thanks to the Amazon TV series based on his 1962 alternative history novel The Man in the High Castle , which posited an America controlled by the Nazis on the east coast and the Japanese on the west after the second world war .
Electric Dreams , the 10-part Channel 4 series , features adaptations of PKDâ€ ™ s short stories , each with a different screenwriter .
The contemporary appeal is obvious .
His stories often deal with themes of corporate greed , authoritarian control , artificial intelligence , drugs and how technology can be used to both elevate and subdue individuals and populations .
Charlie Brookerâ€ ™ s phenomenally successful series
Black Mirror owes a big debt to PKD and his dystopian visions .
Indeed , life seems to become more and more like a PKD story ; in the days before Electric Dreams is aired weâ€ ™ ve had shrill news stories about sex robots that could be hacked to carry out murder , and the unveiling of a new iPhone that unlocks itself through facial recognition .
Increasingly it feels as if this is PKDâ€ ™ s world , and we just live in it .
Two complaints often arise in any conversation about the author , though .
One , he was awful at titles â€ “ at least , marquee - friendly titles .
Blade Runner ( an aside
; the forthcoming film Blade Runner 2049 , while not based directly on a PKD work , is eagerly awaited for continuing the story of Deckard , played in the original by Harrison Ford ) was called in its novel form Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ?
; Total Recall was
We Can Remember It for You Wholesale ; and the 1995 Screamers was based on a short story called â€œSecond Varietyâ€ � , while The Adjustment Bureau had only just a slight tweak from the original title of Adjustment Team .
The other point is more contentious : that PKD actually wasnâ€ ™ t a very good writer .
There will be protests from the self - confessed Dickheads who adore him and , personally , I think the criticism is a little unfair .
Thereâ€ ™ s a sparseness to his prose , for sure , and some of his dialogue is clunky and awkward .
He certainly doesnâ€ ™ t have the narrative flair of contemporaries such as Ray Bradbury .
But what PKD had , and what Hollywood has known for decades and TV is switching on to now , was ideas .
Weâ€ ™ re often more forgiving of beautiful literary prose with little substance , or that rehashes old ideas in a fresh way , than we are of writers who turn out new concepts but perhaps in a less stylish manner .
PKD was a high - concept writer , and sometimes it feels as though ideas were bursting out of his mind at such a pace that he didnâ€ ™ t have time for the intricacies of wordplay .
His UK publisher Gollancz has republished the Electric Dreams stories in an anthology with introductions by the writers who have brought them to TV .
What stands out in almost all cases is that theyâ€ ™ ve taken PKDâ€ ™ s central idea and built a narrative around it .
This is typical : Blade Runner , Total Recall , Minority Report â€ ¦ they all have at their heart the original concept from the source material , but PKD adaptations that slavishly follow the text are rare .
The Man in the High Castle has already stretched to two seasons , far outstripping the original book .
Ronald D Moore , the writer behind the Battlestar Galactica reboot , has adapted PKDâ€ ™ s â€œExhibit Pieceâ€ � ( retitled â€œReal Lifeâ€ � ) for Electric Dreams , and he says : â€œVery little remains of this story in the show , but the heart , and perhaps more importantly the brains behind the episode originate in this tale.â€ �
Should we think any less of Dick for this ?
Is writing just words assembled in a pretty order , or is it ideas and concepts and things that no one has ever thought of before ?
The answer , of course , is that the best writing is both ."
"Linda Hamilton is the latest name to return to the Terminator films , more than 25 years since her last appearance as the seriesâ€ ™ robot - battling heroine Sarah Connor .
The actorâ€ ™ s return was announced by Terminator creator James Cameron at a private event celebrating the franchise , according to the Hollywood Reporter .
Hamilton will reprise her role as Connor in the as - yet - untitled sixth instalment of the series , which will see her reunited with Arnold Schwarzenegger , whose own appearance in Terminator 6 was confirmed earlier this year .
Cameron will produce and Deadpoolâ€ ™ s Tim Miller will direct the film , which is being treated as a direct sequel to 1991â€ ™ s Terminator 2 : Judgment Day , and is being eyed up as the first instalment of a new trilogy .
â€œAs meaningful as she was to gender and action stars everywhere back then
, itâ€ ™ s going to make a huge statement to have that seasoned warrior that sheâ€ ™ s become return , â€ �
Cameron said of Hamiltonâ€ ™ s comeback .
Hamilton , who was briefly married to Cameron in the late 1990s , has not appeared in the franchise since T2 , although she did provide a voiceover for the fourth film in the series , Terminator : Salvation .
Speaking at the time of that filmâ€
™ s release , she said that the franchise should have ended after Judgment Day .
â€œI thought it was perfect with two films .
It was a complete circle , and it was enough in itself .
But there will always be those who will try and milk the cow.â€ �
Now it seems that Hamilton is open to the idea of more sequels , although her role in Terminator 6 will not be as the female lead , with Cameron saying that he was searching for â€œan 18-something woman to be the centrepiece of the new story .
We will have characters from the future and the present .
There will be mostly new characters but weâ€ ™ ll have Arnold and Lindaâ€ ™ s characters to anchor it ,
â€ � he said .
Cameron said that he hoped Hamiltonâ€ ™ s return as Sarah Connor would send out a message about the lack of older female actors in action films .
â€œThere are 50-year - old , 60-year - old guys out there killing bad guys , â€ � he said ,
â€œbut there isnâ€ ™ t an example of that for women.â€
�
The director has long argued the merits of Connor as a female protagonist .
In an interview with the Guardian last month he compared her â€œstrong , troubledâ€ � personality with the character of Wonder Woman in the recent reboot , which he described as â€œa step backwardsâ€ � for gender roles in action films , and an example of â€œmale Hollywood doing the same old thingâ€ � .
Cameronâ€ ™ s comments drew a response from Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins who said that he had an â€œinability to understand what [ the character ] is or stands forâ€ � because â€œhe is not a womanâ€ � ."
