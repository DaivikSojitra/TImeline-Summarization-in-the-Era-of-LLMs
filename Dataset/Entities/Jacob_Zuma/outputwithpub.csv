1999-06-18,"South Africa 's new president , Thabo Mbeki , unveiled his cabinet yesterday , doubling the number of women but otherwise largely reshuffling the ministers who served under Nelson Mandela .
In a surprise move he appointed the deputy leader of the African National Congress , Jacob Zuma , as deputy president after the Inkatha leader , Mangosuthu Buthelezi , turned down the post .
The ANC had offered him the job on condition it was allowed the dominant role in running his stronghold , KwaZulu - Natal province .
But Chief Buthelezi retains his cabinet portfolio as minister of home affairs .
The Inkatha leader was clearly angry at the turn of events .
Afterwards he denied wanting to be deputy president .
Asked if he was happy to be reappointed home affairs minister he snapped : "" Why should I not be ? ""
Mr Mbeki increased the number of women in the cabinet to eight out of 29 ministers , but otherwise drew heavily on Mr Mandela 's cabinet . ""
Clearly one of the things we are saying is they have worked very well , "" he said .
But the new president dumped several older and more lacklustre ministers .
He retained the finance minister , Trevor Manuel , who has won praise at home and abroad for his tight fiscal policies .
The same is true of the trade minister , Alec Irwin .
Although a communist , he has proved a vigorous free marketeer in trade negotiations .
In a sign that he is consolidating control , Mr Mbeki appointed the best man at his wedding 25 years ago , Essop Pahad , to the post of minister in the presidency - his enforcer in the "" super - presidency "" formed after Mr Mbeki stripped his deputy 's office of many powers .
The president 's appointments to the key ministries of justice , and safety and security , will not bolster confidence that he is serious about his promise to tackle pervasive crime and reform an inept and underfunded police force .
The appointment of Penuell Maduna as justice minister drew criticism from the Democratic party , which said Mr Maduna had proved a weak energy minister under Mr Mandela , and had failed to reform the mining sector .
The new safety and security minister , Steve Tshwete , was an unimpressive sports minister .
The new deputy president 's ex - wife , the controversial but talented Nkosazama Zuma , was appointed foreign minister .
The elevation confirms Dr Zuma as one of the most powerful women in South Africa , and even as a potential presidential contender ."
2001-04-24,"The South African security minister 's claim that the police are investigating plots in the African National Congress to "" physically harm "" president Thabo Mbeki and remove him from power has been almost universally dismissed as nonsense .
But unlikely though Steve Tshwete 's assertion to a Johannesburg Sunday newspaper may be , it revealed a deeper and more disturbing truth about the South African presidency ; it is consumed by suspicion of even well - founded criticism and fear of a challenge to Mr Mbeki 's leadership .
The allegation even prompted a bizarre and unexpected denial by the deputy president , Jacob Zuma , that he is trying to oust Mr Mbeki .
But disenchantment in the ANC has led to a secret pamphlet from one branch of the party calling for Mr Mbeki to be a "" one - term president "" .
Mr Tshwete told the Johannesburg Sunday Times that police intelligence units were investigating alleged "" plots "" against the president from high inside the party .
The impression left is that there is a threat to Mr Mbeki 's safety .
Mr Tshwete told the paper : "" As the state department charged with protecting the safety and security of this country , we have to ensure that these plots do not culminate into something ugly .
As far back as last year , we picked up clandestine activities involving certain individuals and we are monitoring this on a day - to - day basis to ensure that the president is safe . ""
But few in the ANC believe that there is a serious threat to Mr Mbeki 's safety .
Rather , Mr Tshwete 's comments are read as a warning to anyone who may think of challenging the president 's leadership at the party congress next year that they are under surveillance .
Mr Mbeki came to power nearly two years ago , heralded as an able technocrat with grand plans for Africa 's renaissance .
But his presidency has been marked by perpetual crises and growing questions about his judgment as reflected in the calibre of those he has chosen to surround himself with and bizarre allegations , such as his claim that there was a CIA plot to destabilise him because he was a threat to the international economic order .
Mr Mbeki 's sensitivity to criticism has grown as the ANC allies , such as the trade unions , have become increasingly prepared to chastise the government publicly for its handling of issues such as Aids and Zimbabwe .
It has been increased by the public airing of allegations about his personal life .
Stories of his alleged womanising have been circulating inside the ANC for months .
They are now discussed in newspapers and on the radio .
Three weeks ago the ANC 's national executive committee met to discuss the alleged plots against Mr Mbeki .
Among the matters of concern was the circulation inside the party of the pamphlet calling for "" one president , one term "" .
The document is believed to have originated in the ANC branch in North West province .
The regional premier , Popo Molefe , has denied any knowledge of the pamphlet , but he is known to be among the party leaders most disenchanted with Mr Mbeki .
Then , a few days after the national executive meeting , Mr Zuma issued his unexpected denial that he was after his boss 's job .
"" We have been aware of some elements in various guises who have been trying to isolate the president by creating the impression that some of his trusted comrades are plotting against him , "" he said .
"" It is clear that as we move towards the national conference of the ANC , less than two years from now , these faceless forces that have a presence in various places and levels of our society are working harder to create confusion among our members and mislead the country in general . ""
Mr Zuma 's statement was probably prompted by a party leak last year accusing him of being at the forefront of another "" plot "" against the president .
Shortly afterwards an ANC official delivered a file of unsubstantiated allegations against Mr Zuma to a Johannesburg daily newspaper .
Months earlier , similar accusations of conspiring against Mr Mbeki were levelled against Cyril Ramaphosa , the former union leader who was in the running to succeed Nelson Mandela .
The alleged plots are not confined to the ANC , or even South Africa .
Last month the party 's secretary general , Thenjiwe Mthintso , claimed that the European Union and governments in the developed world had mounted their own campaign to discredit Mr Mbeki .
She said that criticism of his policies on Zimbabwe and Aids were used as "" entry points to discredit the president - they wish to prove that the ANC is incapable of leading ...
[ that ] Africans are not capable "" .
Sceptics wonder whether South Africa is that high up the agenda in Washington , Whitehall or Brussels .
More to the point , Mr Mbeki 's economic policies could not be more pleasing to the west .
But nothing has fed suspicion as much as the public airing of allegations about the president 's personal life .
Stories about Mr Mbeki 's alleged philandering have been circulating in the establishment for years .
But a renowned South African journalist , Max du Preez , gave them wider currency on a radio discussion programme .
Mr Du Preez was a vigorous and brave opponent of apartheid who , as editor of a weekly Afrikaans magazine , exposed the white regime 's death squads .
The point he made on the radio was that there has been so much discussion about Mr Mbeki 's personal life in the ruling party that it had become of political significance , because it affected how the country was governed .
Winnie 's letter "" This issue has been discussed , it is the hot topic of gossip in black high society , the political elite , journalists know about it , his whole security establishment know and talk about it and is concerned about it , "" he said .
"" Should we again be a little group of elite who knows this side of our president like happened in the past ?
We all knew about the previous [ apartheid - era ] cabinet and did n't talk about it . ""
The allegations about Mr Mbeki 's personal life first surfaced publicly in a letter from Winnie Madikizela - Mandela to the South African deputy president , repeating a number of specific charges .
""
The facts , as I discovered upon investigation , were that these rumours had been making the rounds in Luthuli House [ ANC headquarters ] for some time , "" she wrote .
But while the ANC made no comment on Mrs Madikizela - Mandela 's letter , it denounced Mr Du Preez as a racist , a "" commissar for apartheid "" , and declared "" war "" on him . ""
The ANC has learned that among some sections in our society respect and dignity is accorded only to those with a certain type of pigmentation and being black and powerful qualifies one to be the recipient of a barrage of insults and abuse , "" Mr Mbeki 's spokesman , Smuts Ngonyama , said .
The party even suggested introducing a new , and almost certainly unconstitutional , law against defaming the president .
What it did not do was to deny the that allegations were true .
"" It does indicate a certain mentality that I thought only existed in Zimbabwe , "" said Mr Du Preez .
"" Clearly , in the ANC 's reaction , they are again confusing the interests of the party with the interests of the state . """

2003-08-25,"South Africa was in uproar yesterday after prosecutors refused to press corruption charges against the deputy president , Jacob Zuma , over allegations that he received payments from a French company bidding for arms contracts .
The chief public prosecutor , Bulelani Ngcuka , said a special anti - corruption unit had uncovered "" prima - facie evidence of corruption "" , but he had decided not to prosecute because he was not absolutely certain the government would win the case .
The opposition Democratic Alliance said Mr Zuma was "" fatally wounded and he should stand down "" .
But Mr Zuma countered by saying he wanted a chance to clear his name .
"" The statement is equivalent to a judgment against me , "" he said .
"" The purpose ... is to leave a cloud hanging over my integrity . ""
Mr Zuma is a long - term friend of President Thabo Mbeki and widely regarded as a potential successor .
Investigators had been considering allegations that Mr Zuma discussed receiving payments from the French company Thomson CSF , renamed Thales in 2000 , which was bidding for arms contracts .
The company denies the allegations .
Mr Ngcuka said he had decided to prosecute South Africa 's Nkobi group of companies , which is controlled by Mr Zuma 's financial adviser , Schabir Shaik , and Thomson CSF , on charges of contravening company law .
He had handed over evidence to the French authorities .
The French foreign ministry refused to comment on the case , explaining that it was not in its jurisdiction ."
2004-10-10,"It has been dubbed Hamlet without the prince , a trial where the accused is absent but which could determine if he is to rule South Africa .
The stage is a courtroom in Durban which from tomorrow will decide if there is something rotten about the Deputy President , Jacob Zuma .
An adviser to Zuma goes on trial for corruption and fraud and , if he is convicted , the Zulu tipped as South Africa 's next leader , will be deemed a crook and expected to fall .
The most important trial since apartheid ended is a test not just for Zuma but the young democracy because it pits rival parts of the state and the ruling African National Congress against each other .
Victory for the 62-year - old deputy will keep him on course to succeed President Thabo Mbeki as the continent 's most important man .
Defeat will see him shamed and perhaps jailed in a subsequent trial .
Commentators say it is a defining moment in South Africa 's journey to a system of democratic accountability with clear lines between party , state and personal interests . '
The trial will set the standard for public morality : the way those in the public eye - including those in business and civil society - go about playing their roles , ' said Mondli Makhanya , editor of the Johannesburg Sunday Times .
Durban 's high court will host just one defendant , Schabir Shaik , who faces two counts of corruption and a third of fraud in relation to arms deals and alleged bribes .
The 47-year - old businessman denies the charges .
Zuma has not been charged with anything , but according to a leaked copy of Shaik 's 45-page charge sheet the deputy president 's name is cited on every second page in relation to 238 payments from Shaik totalling £ 108,000 .
Prosecutors say these were bribes to Zuma in the form of cash , bonds , loan repayments , living allowances , clothing , school and university fees for his children , in return for help obtaining government contracts .
Zuma says the payments were loans .
Prosecutors say that documents , computer disks and more than 100 witnesses will show that from 1995 the two men formed a partnership whereby Zuma used his political clout to benefit Shaik 's company , Nkobi Holdings .
It is alleged that in 2000 the patron of the ANC 's moral regeneration campaign solicited an annual £ 43,000 bribe from one of Shaik 's clients , a French arms company , Thomson - CSF / Thales .
It was one small part of a multi - billion pound arms deal which critics say became a trough for senior ANC officials and their friends .
South Africa 's equivalent of the FBI , the Scorpions , started investigating Zuma almost three years ago .
The probe sparked a political firestorm .
Zuma is extremely popular with the trade unions and the party rank - and - file .
Affable and shrewd
, he is the government troubleshooter when it needs to smooth difficult issues such as HIV / Aids , spending constraints or the flashpoint province of KwaZulu - Natal .
But he has opponents within the movement , including , some claim , Mbeki .
Whether too left - wing , too populist , too independent or too Zulu for the Xhosa - heavy elite , it seems clear that senior figures want to block Zuma from the top job .
Allies wonder if dirty tricks are behind the leaking of court documents which have led to a trial by media .
When the Scorpions said they had a prima facia case but not enough to prosecute Zuma , his friends accused the chief investigator of being an apartheid - era spy , a claim rejected by a judicial commission .
An ANC member since the age of 16
, Zuma was an intelligence operative for the movement 's armed wing during apartheid .
While dodging police - and probable torture - he formed a bond with Shaik , another freedom fighter , whose job was to smuggle money .
With little formal education , Zuma is not said to be especially numerate and after the ANC took power he allowed Shaik to run his financial affairs .
At some point , say prosecutors , that relationship turned corrupt .
Analysts say that South Africa 's nation - building faces the same challenge to cut some roots of the struggle before they turn rotten ."
2004-10-12,"South Africa 's deputy president , Jacob Zuma , began a fight for his political life yesterday when he was repeatedly named in corruption charges against his friend and financial adviser , Schabir Shaik .
Although Mr Zuma was not charged , he sent lawyers to the high court in Durban for the opening of the case , which could destroy his ambition to be president and put the African National Congress in turmoil .
The prosecution said that Mr Zuma , 62 , was bribed by Mr Shaik to manipulate aspects of South Africa 's controversial purchase of warships , aircraft and other armaments mainly from European companies .
Mr Shaik , 47 , is charged with two counts of corruption and a third of fraud .
The trial is expected to last several months and involve more than 100 witnesses from 10 countries .
If he is convicted , commentators say , Mr Zuma 's position will be untenable .
Both men have denied doing anything wrong , and hinted that the inquiry was driven by political foes intent on denying Mr Zuma the presidency .
The two have defended their friendship as one forged in the liberation struggle , when both were underground activists .
A money smuggler for the ANC , Mr Shaik became a businessman when the movement won power and managed his friend 's finances as he climbed the political ladder .
Yesterday the prosecution withdrew charges against Thint Holdings , a French arms company which was known as Thomson - CSF / Thales when it was one of Mr Shaik 's clients , apparently because it had offered its cooperation . ""
The withdrawal was part of the strategy towards the ultimate end , "" a spokesman for the public prosecutor said .
The charge sheet says that from 1995 Mr Shaik 's company Nkobi Holdings paid Mr Zuma the equivalent of £ 108,000 in cash , bonds , loan repayments , living allowances , clothing , school and university fees for his children in return for his help in obtaining government contracts .
It was also alleged that in 2000 Mr Zuma solicited an annual bribe of £ 43,000 from Thomson - CSF / Thales to deflect the investigation of irregularities .
Campaigners said this was just the tip of the iceberg of sleaze surrounding the purchase of submarines , frigates , aircraft and other equipment .
After opening argument Judge Hillary Squires adjourned the trial to allow broadcasters to make a case today for televising the proceedings .
Their lawyers said the trial was of major public importance and had implications for "" matters of governance "" .
The prosecution and defence oppose the judge lifting the normal ban on cameras .
Flanked by lawyers , Mr Shaik made no comment outside the court .
Mr Zuma was not in Durban and continued his official duties .
Today he is due in Uganda for talks on Burundi 's peace process ."
2005-06-02,"South Africa 's popular deputy president , Jacob Zuma , was confronted with calls for his resignation yesterday after his former financial adviser and friend was found guilty of corruption in a case that has gripped the nation .
The verdict against Schabir Shaik , Mr Zuma 's longtime associate , gravely damaged the deputy president 's standing , according to analysts and legal experts , as well as his prospects of succeeding Thabo Mbeki as leader of the country .
Following the judgment , the National Prosecuting Authority said it was considering pressing charges against Mr Zuma .
The main opposition party , the Democratic Alliance , tabled a motion of no confidence shortly after the verdict , demanding Mr Zuma 's resignation .
Two other parties also demanded that he quit .
Yesterday 's judgment brought to a climax an eight - month trial , the most prominent of several corruption cases since South Africa reached majority rule in 1994 .
The case centred on charges that Shaik paid Mr Zuma in return for government contracts and that he solicited a bribe from a French arms firm that would be paid to Mr Zuma , who would protect the company 's interests in a multi - billion - dollar arms sale to the South African government .
Public interest was so great that the verdict was broadcast live on national television and radio .
It took three days for Judge Hillary Squires to read out his 165-page verdict .
The judgment was damning , finding "" not only convincing but overwhelming "" evidence of a corrupt relationship between Mr Zuma and Shaik , who now faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison .
Sentencing is expected today .
Shaik , once known as "" the banker for the African National Congress "" during the anti - apartheid struggle , was found to have paid Mr Zuma 1.2 m rand ( £ 109,000 ) in bribes from one of his companies , without the knowledge of shareholders .
The verdict was also harsh on Mr Zuma .
Testimony showed that he was perpetually short of money and relied on Shaik to provide him with funds to build a luxury house , pay school fees and even give him 500 rand ( £ 45 ) spending money at the airport . ""
The evidence ... clearly shows a readiness in both Shaik to turn to Zuma for help and Zuma 's readiness to give it , "" said Judge Squires , who added that Mr Zuma knew he would have to give something in return for the money .
"" Instead of just stabilising the situation and managing Zuma 's chaotic finances so debts could be paid off , Shaik made it possible for Zuma to continue living beyond his means without anyone knowing the quid pro quo he [ Shaik ] would ask for , "" said Judge Squires .
"" No sane or rational businessman would conduct his business on such a basis without expecting some benefit . ""
Mr Zuma did not face charges and was never summoned as a witness , but his name and financial affairs were mentioned almost as frequently as Mr Shaik .
Legal experts said the judge 's verdict directly implicated Mr Zuma .
The judge ruled that Shaik persuaded the French arms company Thint Holdings ( formerly Thomson CSF ) to pay a bribe of 500,000 rand ( £ 45,000 ) a year to Mr Zuma .
In return Mr Zuma was to promote the French firm 's participation in a 30bn rand ( £ 2.7bn ) arms deal .
Judge Squires declared that Mr Zuma knew all about the deal and had received one payment .
Mr Zuma , 63 , is immensely popular among voters , particularly the trade union movement .
But he is now likely to be regarded as a political liability by many in the ANC .
Others in the party want to protect South Africa 's image as a safe - and relatively honest - destination for investment .
"" It 's explosive for the deputy president , "" said constitutional law expert Pierre de Vos .
"" The facts are there to convict him . ""
Mr Zuma was on government business in Zambia yesterday and did not comment on the ruling .
The ANC gave a cautious welcome to the ruling , saying it showed "" the maturity of our democracy "" ."
2005-06-14,"South Africa 's deputy president , Jacob Zuma , who was tipped to become the next leader of Africa 's economic powerhouse , was dismissed yesterday after being implicated in a corruption scandal .
Mr Zuma 's fall from grace will trigger a struggle to succeed the president , Thabo Mbeki , and threatens to open a rift in the ANC .
The deputy president has not been charged or convicted of any crime but his reputation was tarnished after his friend and financial adviser , Schabir Shaik , was found guilty of corruption and fraud .
In a damning judgment , Judge Hillary Squires found "" not only convincing but overwhelming "" , evidence of a corrupt relationship between Shaik and Mr Zuma , 63 .
In a speech to the parliament in Cape Town , Mr Mbeki said the judge 's ruling required him to act .
He said : "" I have come to the conclusion that the circumstances dictate that in the interest of the honourable deputy president , the government , our young democratic system and our country , it would be best to release the honorable Jacob Zuma from his responsibilities as deputy president of the republic and member of the cabinet . ""
As corruption in Africa comes under the spotlight before the G8 summit , the president had to act quickly to reassure investors .
Tony Leon , the leader of the main opposition Democratic Alliance , said : "" We have shown the world that South Africa is not among those nations who allow corruption to unravel the fabric of their country 's soul . ""
But Mr Zuma still has support among the ANC 's rank and file .
Supporters want him to have his day in court , while some suspect the white judge 's motivation .
Mr Zuma , who remains the ANC 's deputy president , said yesterday that freedom and democracy were "" more important than us as individuals "" .
The high court in Durban found Shaik paid Mr Zuma in return for government con tracts and solicited a bribe from French arms firm Thint Holdings to pay Mr Zuma .
In return , he was meant to deflect inquiries about a 1999 arms sale .
The national prosecuting authority said it was considering a further investigation .
The court found Shaik paid 1.2 m rand ( £ 97,000 ) to Mr Zuma to fund a lavish lifestyle .
Testimony showed he was always short of money and relied on Shaik to build a luxurious house and pay school fees . ""
Instead of just stabilising the situation and managing Zuma 's chaotic finances so debts could be paid off , Shaik made it possible for Zuma to continue living beyond his means without anyone knowing the quid pro quo [ Shaik ] would ask for , "" Judge Squires said .
"" No sane or rational businessman would conduct his business on such a basis without expecting some benefit . ""
Mr Mbeki , who has pledged to stamp out corruption , said yesterday he continued to hold Mr Zuma in "" high regard "" .
"" We have worked together under difficult conditions for 30 years , "" the president said .
He thanked him for services rendered and "" sparing neither strength nor effort "" to ensure "" a better life for all South Africans "" .
Mr Mbeki is required under South African law to step down at the end of his second presidential term in 2009 and Mr Zuma had been widely expected to succeed him .
The president did not immediately announce a replacement .
The ANC 's national chairman and defence minister , Mosiuoa Lekota , is the most likely successor .
Another candidate is the foreign minister , Nkosazana Dlamini - Zuma , Mr Zuma 's former wife .
Mr Zuma , a Zulu , mediated between the ANC and the Zulu - dominated Inkatha Freedom party in the early 1990s to head off a potential civil war .
He joined the ANC 's military wing in the 60s and rose through the ranks .
He was imprisoned for 10 years on Robben Island and spent many more years in exile .
It was there that he befriended Shaik who was known as the "" ANC 's banker . """

"" Watching President Thabo Mbeki deliver the axe to Jacob Zuma 's political neck [ on Tuesday ] was agonising .

2005-06-20,"The political career of Jacob Zuma , the man once tipped to succeed Thabo Mbeki as South Africa 's next president , was on the ropes yesterday after he was charged with corruption .
Mr Zuma was dismissed as deputy president last week , following the conviction of his financial adviser for corruption and fraud .
President Mbeki 's decision to sack him was praised by the South African media , and regarded as proof of his determination to tackle corruption .
But the downfall of the popular politician has provoked an outpouring of sympathy from the public .
A spokesman for the national prosecuting authority said : "" We have decided to bring criminal charges . ""
On the basis of the evidence available , we think we have a case that can be successfully prosecuted .
Mr Zuma must be ready to appear in court some time this week .
"" The former deputy president has denied any wrongdoing and hinted that he is the victim of a political conspiracy .
Last week crowds attending annual Youth Day rallies protested loudly at his dismissal and sang anti - Mbeki songs .
At one rally , the ANC party chairman for KwaZulu - Natal had to be escorted to safety by police after he was pelted with missiles by a crowd proclaiming their support for Mr Zuma .
Schabir Shaik , a friend of Mr Zuma from the anti - apartheid years , was convicted this month of fraud and corruption .
The judge in the case said the two had a "" generally corrupt "" relationship .
The high court in Durban found that Shaik had paid Mr Zuma bribes in return for government contracts and that he had solicited a bribe from a French arms company , Thint Holdings , that would be paid to the deputy president .
In return , Mr Zuma was expected to deflect corruption investigations relating to a 1999 arms sale to the South African government .
In a speech to parliament last week , Mr Mbeki accepted that his deputy had not been charged with an offence , but said he was acting "" in the interest of our young democratic system "" in firing him .
Mr Mbeki is often contrasted unfavourably with his former deputy .
Mr Zuma , who received no formal education and started work at 15 , is regarded as affable and humorous , while the president has an aloof , intellectual image .
Analysts said the decision to charge Mr Zuma was further evidence of South Africa 's determination to root out corruption , boosting Mr Mbeki 's standing when he meets G8 leaders at next month 's summit at Gleneagles . ""
The kinds of people who are worried about governance and corruption should be pleased with the decision , "" Tom Lodge , a political scientist at the University of the Witwatersrand , told Reuters .
Others said a not guilty verdict could position Mr Zuma for a comeback in the race to succeed Mr Mbeki when his second term ends in 2009 ."
2005-06-20,"The man sacked last week as South Africa 's deputy president and once tipped as a future leader is to face corruption charges , it was announced today .
Jacob Zuma would not be arrested but would appear in court later this week , a spokesman for the National Prosecuting Authority told the South African Press Association .
The criminal charges stem from a guilty verdict returned in a fraud case last week on Mr Zuma 's friend and financial advisor , Schabir Shaik .
The judge in that case , Hilary Squires , portrayed Mr Zuma , 63 , as an active participant in Shaik 's shady dealings , saying there was "" overwhelming "" evidence of a corrupt relationship between the two men .
Thabo Mbeki , the South African president , sacked his deputy soon after .
As corruption in Africa comes under the spotlight before the G8 summit , the president had to act quickly to reassure investors .
In South Africa , however , the decision sparked controversy .
The widely popular politician , who until recently was seen as Mbeki 's heir apparent , has denied any wrongdoing and hinted that he is the victim of a political conspiracy .
Speaking for the National Prosecuting Agency ( NPA ) , Makhosini Nkosi said : "" Justice Squires made adverse remarks on the nature of the relationship between Shaik and Zuma .
The NPA has concluded its study of the judgment and taken into consideration aspects of it that relate to former deputy president Zuma . ""
An application for leave to appeal by Shaik and others , and its likely impact on the merits of the case against Zuma were taken into consideration .
"" Taking into consideration all evidence at its disposal , the NPA is of the view that there is a reasonable prospect of a successful prosecution . "" The high court in Durban found Shaik paid Mr Zuma in return for government contracts and solicited a bribe from French arms firm Thint Holdings to pay Mr Zuma .
In return , he was meant to deflect inquiries about a 1999 arms sale .
The national prosecuting authority said it was considering a further investigation .
Although Mr Zuma was not called as a witness and there were no charges against him in the Shaik trial , the court found Shaik paid 1.2 m rand ( £ 97,000 ) to Mr Zuma to fund a lavish lifestyle .
Testimony showed Mr Zuma was always short of money and relied on Shaik to build a luxurious house and pay school fees . ""
Instead of just stabilising the situation and managing Zuma 's chaotic finances so debts could be paid off , Shaik made it possible for Zuma to continue living beyond his means without anyone knowing the quid pro quo [ Shaik ] would ask for , "" the judge said .

"" I have come to the conclusion that the circumstances dictate that in the interest of the honourable deputy president , the government , our young democratic system and our country , it would be best to release the honorable Jacob Zuma from his responsibilities as deputy president of the republic and member of the cabinet , "" he told MPs .
Mr Zuma , a Zulu , mediated between the ANC and the Zulu - dominated Inkatha Freedom party in the early 1990s to head off a potential civil war .
He joined the ANC 's military wing in the 60s and rose through the ranks .
He was imprisoned for 10 years on Robben Island and spent many more years in exile .
It was while in exile that he befriended Shaik , who was known as the "" ANC 's banker . ""
Speaking to the South African press yesterday , Mr Zuma again protested his innocence , and said he had refused to resign as Mr Mbeki 's deputy . ""
Why should I have left ?
If I was guilty - if I knew I at any given time was guilty -
I am sure I would have made it as easy as anything . """
2005-06-22,"South Africa 's president , Thabo Mbeki , today appointed the country 's first woman deputy president to fill a post left vacant by a corruption scandal .
Phumzile Mlambo - Ngcuka replaces
Jacob Zuma , who was fired last week after being implicated in illegal activities during the trial of his financial adviser .
Ms Mlambo - Ngcuka , 49 , was formerly mineral and energy affairs minister .
She played a key role in developing the country 's black economic empowerment strategy designed to give blacks a greater share in the post - apartheid economy .
President Mbeki appointed deputy minister of trade and industry , Lindiwe Hendricks , to take over the minerals and energy portfolio .
"" As you know we have to appoint a new deputy president and therefore we have appointed the minister of minerals and energy as our new deputy , "" President Mbeki told a Cape Town news conference .
"" We thought that this gave us an opportunity further to strengthen the participation of women in the executive . ""
Ms Mlambo - Ngcuka is married to a former prosecutions chief Bulelani Ngcuka , who provoked a storm of controversy in 2003 when he told journalists that there was evidence of corruption by Mr Zuma .
Supporters of Mr Zuma say the comment is evidence of a plot to ensure he never becomes president .
Mr Zuma , who remains popular with the governing African National Congress 's rank and file , was once considered most likely to succeed President Mbeki at the helm of Africa 's economic and diplomatic powerhouse .
The National Prosecuting Authority dropped efforts to charge Mr Zuma in 2003 , saying the case was unwinnable .
The body decided to review the case after Schabir Shaik , Mr Zuma 's financial adviser and friend , was convicted earlier this month on two counts of corruption and one of fraud .
Mr Zuma , who denies any wrongdoing , now faces his own trial .
President Mbeki also appointed two new trade and industry deputy ministers ; Rob Davies , who chairs the National Assembly 's finance committee , and Elizabeth Thabethe , who chairs the environment committee .
The new cabinet members will be sworn in tomorrow ."
2005-06-22,"A former schoolteacher who was elected to parliament in South Africa 's first free elections is to be sworn in today as the country 's first female deputy president .
Phumzile Mlambo - Ngcuka , 49 , the mineral and energy affairs minister , replaces Jacob Zuma , who was dismissed last week after being implicated in a corruption scandal .
As a minister , Mrs Mlambo - Ngcuka won praise for transforming South Africa 's mining industry , giving black businessmen a greater share of an industry that had traditionally exploited cheap African labour .
Mrs Mlambo - Ngcuka 's appointment gives her a head start in the race to succeed President Thabo Mbeki when he steps down .
"" She 's known to be very effective , "" Susan Booysen , a professor of politics at Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University in Port Elizabeth , told Reuters . ""
But the pressures are going to be very significant .
There is no mercy in that job . ""
Her appointment may fuel claims by supporters of Mr Zuma that he was the victim of a conspiracy .
Mrs Mlambo - Ngcuka is married to Bulelani Ngcuka , a former national public prosecutor , who provoked controversy when he told journalists in 2003 that although there was prima facie evidence of corruption against Mr Zuma , the case was not strong enough to go to court .
Mr Zuma 's supporters claimed the comment was evidence of an attempt to tarnish his reputation to prevent him from becoming president .
South Africa 's national prosecuting authority reviewed the case against Mr Zuma after his former financial adviser , Schabir Shaik , was convicted and jailed on sleaze charges this month .
The former deputy president was charged with corruption on Monday , less than a week after President Mbeki dismissed him from office .
Mrs Mlambo - Ngcuka began her career as a teacher , before working at the world office of the Young Women 's Christian Association in Geneva , where she promoted education and job creation programmes .
She later returned to South Africa under apartheid , where she worked with a group encouraging economic self - reliance among squatter women in Cape Town .
She was elected to parliament in 1994 and became deputy trade and industry minister two years later .
She took over at minerals and energy in 1999 .
There , she reformed the industry that laid the foundations of Africa 's biggest economy .
As a part of the ANC 's attempt to redress the economic wrongs of apartheid , she helped introduce a black empowerment charter which aims to put a quarter of the mining industry in black hands by 2014 .
Companies will receive mining licences in South Africa , the world 's biggest producer of gold and platinum , only if they meet targets that include having more black managers and improving conditions for communities near their mines . ""
Within government circles , trade unions and large sections of business , she is regarded as the most productive minister , with a record on delivery , "" the Financial Mail magazine wrote last year .
One recent incident has proved damaging to her reputation .
When activists called for an investigation into illnesses among workers at a nuclear plant , she said South Africa needed laws to prevent organisations "" spreading panic "" .
The remark was seen as an attack on free speech .
The deputy trade and industry minister , Lindiwe Hendricks , succeeds Mrs Mlambo - Ngcuka as mineral and energy affairs minister .
Mr Mbeki said the cabinet changes were an opportunity to strengthen the role of women in the executive ."
2005-10-11,"The corruption trial of South Africa 's former deputy president Jacob Zuma was postponed yesterday until November 12 , while hundreds of supporters cheered him outside Durban magistrates ' court .
Mr Zuma was sacked by President Thabo Mbeki in June after his financial adviser was convicted of corruption , but he remains so popular that his impending court case has split the ANC .
The state prosecution has requested more time for its investigation .
Mr Zuma is facing two corruption charges , and further counts of fraud and perjury may be added ."
2005-11-05,"South Africa 's former deputy president Jacob Zuma was indicted for corruption yesterday .
Mr Zuma was dismissed as deputy president in June , but remains number two in the ruling African National Congress .
The charges include accepting bribes from French arms firms for lucrative defence contracts and corruption in connection with his former financial adviser , who is serving 15 years in jail for fraud and corruption .
Mr Zuma was once thought to be favourite to take over from Thabo Mbeki .
Mr Zuma denies the charges and has said he still wants to be president .
The trial will begin next year ."
2005-11-22,"The turmoil at the heart of the African National Congress deepened yesterday when South Africa 's former deputy president , Jacob Zuma , confirmed that he was being investigated for rape .
Mr Zuma was fired in June when he was implicated in a fraud case involving his financial adviser , and he was indicted last month on two counts of corruption .
He denies the rape allegations .
The ANC 's secretary general , Kgalema Motlanthe , said yesterday that the party took the allegations "" very seriously "" , but would await the outcome of the "" judicial process "" .
However , the allegations effectively end Mr Zuma 's hope of succeeding Thabo Mbeki as South Africa 's next president , according to political analysts close to the ANC .
The rape claim against Mr Zuma , whose corruption trial is set for next July , has exacerbated tensions within the party over who will succeed Mr Mbeki as leader .
South Africa 's constitution prohibits Mr Mbeki seeking re - election for a third term , and the ANC is scheduled to elect a new leader in 2007 .
The ANC statement confirming that Mr Zuma is under police investigation for rape came after a three - day meeting of its national executive council .
The session was so heated that Mr Mbeki cancelled all appointments on Sunday , including a meeting with the visiting king of Nepal .
The ANC has been rocked by bitter rivalries since Mr Mbeki fired Mr Zuma , who is popular with grassroots party members .
After Mr Zuma was fired from the government , the ANC also tried to sack him from his position as second in command of the party , a decision which was only reversed by a revolt by his supporters .
Thousands of Mr Zuma 's supporters gathered for all - night vigils before his court appearances on corruption charges last month in the eastern port city of Durban .
They demonstrated against Mr Mbeki , saying he had trumped up the charges against Mr Zuma .
Some burned T - shirts bearing Mr Mbeki 's portrait .
Mr Zuma had received the support of key backers of the ANC , including the Confederation of South African Trade Unions , the South African Communist party and the ANC Youth League .
But the groups have remained silent since the new allegations surfaced in a newspaper on November 13 .
Mr Zuma confirmed that an allegation of rape has been lodged by a female family friend who was a guest at his Johannesburg home .
Police are investigating to determine if formal charges should be filed against him .
Political commentator William Gumede said : "" This appears to be the beginning of the end for Jacob Zuma 's political career .
He has lost considerable support within the ANC , even those who backed him after the corruption charges are finding it difficult to back him now .
They accept they were backing a losing horse . ""
Mr Zuma 's demise will intensify the competition to become the next leader of the ANC .
The winner is virtually assured of becoming the country 's next president .
The frontrunners include the new deputy president , Phumzile Mlambo - Ngcuka , union leader turned businessman Cyril Ramaphosa , central bank governor Tito Mboweni and Mr Motlanthe , according to Mr Gumede ."
2005-12-06,"The former deputy president of South Africa , Jacob Zuma , has been charged with rape , an allegation he strongly denies .
Mr Zuma appeared at Johannesburg magistrate 's court today and was formally charged .
He was released on 20,000 rand ( £ 1,826 ) bail and will appear back in court on February 13 .
"" I wish to state clearly that I am innocent of these charges , "" Mr Zuma said .
"" I regard these allegations against me very seriously as I abhor any form of abuse against women . ""
Last month , local newspapers reported allegations that Mr Zuma had raped a family friend at his home in Johannesburg .
The former deputy president was dismissed from his position in June following charges of corruption , although he remains deputy leader of the ruling African National Congress .
He was sacked after a judge found that Mr Zuma and his convicted financial adviser , Schabir Shaik , had a "" generally corrupt "" relationship .
Mr Shaik is appealing against his conviction .
Mr Zuma , 63 , announced that he would suspend his participation in party leadership structures during the rape trial .
The ANC said today that Mr Zuma remained innocent until convicted in court .
Party leaders are meeting tonight to prepare a full response to the allegations .
Political analysts say the rape and corruption charges have ruined Mr Zuma 's hopes of becoming South Africa 's next president .
The country has one of the highest rape rates in the world .
Before the charges were brought , the popular deputy president was widely tipped to succeed president Thabo Mbeki in 2009 .
"" This country does n't forgive a charge of rape , even though it is an allegation at this point .
It is seen in very bad light , "" political analyst Susan Booysen of Johannesburg 's Witwatersrand University told Reuters .
Nadira Omarjee of advocacy group
People Opposing Women Abuse said : "" Any hopes for the presidency have now been quashed - I do n't think women are going to support a suspected rapist . ""
The Congress of South African Trade Unions and South African Communist Party , which have been strong supporters of Mr Zuma , today called for a speedy trial but did not comment on the case ."
2005-12-07,"South Africa was thrown into political turmoil yesterday when the former deputy president , Jacob Zuma , was charged with rape , a development which has all but eclipsed his chances of leading the country .
The man who once seemed destined to rule the continent 's economic and political powerhouse could be jailed for life if convicted of raping a 31-year - old woman at his Johannesburg home last month .
The ruling African National Congress is now riven by its worst convulsions since taking power in 1994 , and institutions such as the prosecuting authority and the intelligence services have also been dragged into the affair .
The political turmoil has exposed rancour within the former liberation movement over the enrichment of a small group of individuals favoured in the name of racial empowerment .
Mr Zuma 's allies were leading critics of the "" waBenzi "" , a derogatory term for the newly flush class of people who drive Mercedes Benz .
Commentators said the liberation hero , already reeling from a financial scandal , was finished as a political force and no longer a contender to succeed President Thabo Mbeki . ""
He does not need to be convicted for his political reputation to be destroyed , "" said Aubrey Matshiqi , an independent analyst .
"" All sorts of salacious details will emerge in the trial . ""
At a brief hearing at a Johannesburg magistrate 's court Mr Zuma , 63 , said he would suspend some of his activities within the ANC but would retain his position as the party 's deputy president until the case was resolved .
"" I wish to state clearly that I am innocent of these charges , "" he said in a statement .
"" I regard these allegations against me very seriously as I abhor any form of abuse against women . ""
He was freed on £ 1,800 bail and ordered to return in February for trial .
Mr Mbeki sacked his deputy from the government in June after a court found that he had had a corrupt relationship with a convicted fraudster , for which Mr Zuma was due to face a corruption trial next year .
Last month a local newspaper published a bombshell : an Aids activist friend of the Zuma family had told police she was raped during an overnight stay at their Johannesburg home in early November .
Anonymous media briefings from purported Zuma aides said sex did take place but that it was consensual - itself a damaging admission since the married politician was a father figure to the alleged victim .
Yesterday 's indictment read : "" Whilst the complainant was sleeping , the accused came to her room and offered her a massage .
After she declined the offer , he removed the duvet that covered her and proceeded to have sexual intercourse with her against her will and without her consent .
"" Supporters in the trade unions , the Communist party and the ANC youth league said the accused should be deemed innocent until proven guilty but in reality their support had dissipated , said Mr Matshiqi . ""
Mr Zuma 's participation in the ANC presidential race has come to an end . ""
The opposition Democratic Alliance called on Mr Zuma to quit as ANC deputy president , adding : "" It also would appear that this latest charge puts paid to Mr Zuma 's chances of becoming the next president of South Africa . ""
Before the scandals broke , Mr Zuma appeared to have the credentials to take over as South Africa 's leader in 2009 , when Mr Mbeki steps down .
After serving 10 years on Robben Island with Nelson Mandela , Mr Zuma went into exile and led the movement 's guerrilla force until apartheid 's collapse in 1994 .
A Zulu who provided a balance to the ANC 's Xhosa - heavy leadership , he exuded a warmer persona than the aloof , technocratic style of Mr Mbeki and the deputy appealed to those impatient for faster redistribution of the country 's wealth .
Critics said he lacked the formal education and polish for the top job .
His downfall started as a corruption scandal when a judge found that his chief financial adviser had solicited a large bribe for him from a French arms company .
Supporters suspected the revelation was a plot by Mr Mbeki to marginalise his rival to boost his chances of retaining a degree of political power by remaining president of the ANC itself , a post with no constitutional limitation .
Mr Zuma 's successor as the country 's deputy president , Phumizile Mlambo - Ngcuko , is seen - however unfairly - as being more malleable , because she is a woman and as a beneficiary of Mbeki 's patronage .
With Mr Zuma mounting a comeback despite his looming corruption trial the affair turned byzantine when the head of the National Intelligence Service and two other senior spymasters were suspended on instructions from the president , seeming after being caught illegally spying on one of Mr Mbeki 's closest advisers .
There was widespread concern that both sides were misusing state institutions to gain leverage .
Then came the rape allegation and the end , said Business Day , of the Zuma tsunami .
"" It has shrunk to a ripple . ""
Commenting before yesterday 's charge , the newspaper said : "" Mbeki is sweeping away his enemies with a ruthlessness and a resolve we are unlikely to see in our politics for many a year . ""
The political crisis within the ANC comes at a time when South Africa is prospering to an unprecedented degree .
It has been boom time for the country and , to an even greater extent , for a small group of favoured individuals previously in the leadership who have been enriched in the name of racial empowerment .
The nature of their enrichment is central to an understanding of what is happening to the former liberation movement . ""
Another great week for the waBenzi , "" announced a recent headline in one local newspaper , adding : "" Usual suspects in deals worth billions .
"" The beneficiaries represent a line - up of ANC officials .
The "" billions "" were awarded by share deals set up by financial giants and justified as representing a racial re - distribution of wealth .
While there is no evidence of wrongdoing where so - called "" black economic empowerment "" deals are concerned , the potential for patronage and hence corruption is obvious and suspicion inevitable .
For supporters of Mr Zuma it placed his alleged crime as deputy president - of soliciting a bribe in return for political protection - in a different perspective .
Now that he is facing a rape charge they will have to seek a new champion .

2005-12-08,"South Africa 's ruling African National Congress suspended its deputy leader , Jacob Zuma , 63 , at an emergency meeting yesterday pending his trial for rape .
The party stopped short of sacking him , prompting rebukes from opposition politicians concerned about the country 's commitment to women 's rights .
Mr Zuma is to be tried in in February for allegedly assaulting a 31-year - old woman at his Johannesburg home last month .
Once considered a frontrunner to succeed the president , Thabo Mbeki , he is facing a separate trial next year over allegations of corruption ."
2006-01-18,"South Africa 's government yesterday sought to deflect new corruption allegations by defending the use of a military jet for a United Arab Emirates holiday taken by the deputy president , Phumzile Mlambo - Ngcuka .
President Thabo Mbeki , who dismissed former deputy Jacob Zuma in June after a bribery scandal , is under pressure to crack down on corruption before local elections on March 1 .
A presidential spokesman confirmed the UAE trip was private , although the deputy president inspected infrastructure projects to help her promote economic development in South Africa ."
2006-02-13,"The trial of Jacob Zuma , the former deputy president of South Africa accused of raping a family friend , was today adjourned after the judge agreed to stand down to avoid allegations of bias .
On the trial 's opening day , Mr Zuma 's defence lawyers said Judge Bernard Ngoepe had issued an arrest warrant against the defendant in an unrelated case involving bribery allegations .
The warrant led to him being sacked from the government last June .
After legal arguments in the Johannesburg courthouse , Judge Ngoepe agreed to withdraw despite concerns Mr Zuma would be seen as having the power to choose who presided over the case .
"" I have concluded that protection of the credibility of the judiciary and , above all , the acceptability of its judgments , are factors which should weigh with me heavily , "" Judge Ngoepe said .
He added that because the trial was only in its preliminary stages , his decision to stand down would not be too disruptive .
A new judge was not immediately named , but one of two deputies of Judge Ngoepe is likely to be chosen .
A hearing was set for tomorrow , at which a defence request for a two - week postponement will be heard by the new judge .
Mr Zuma 's lawyers had told the court Judge Ngoepe could "" create the perception "" of bias .
Earlier , up to 1,000 supporters of Mr Zuma and a small number of women 's rights campaigners staged noisy demonstrations outside the courthouse .
Police smuggled the 31-year - old woman who claims Mr Zuma raped her into the court building through a side entrance .
According to the charge sheet , she visited his home on November 2 , and was invited to stay the night .
After she had gone to bed , Mr Zuma allegedly entered the room , woke her up and offered her a massage .
When she declined , he allegedly raped her .
Mr Zuma , who once seemed certain to succeed the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , denies the charge .
Mr Mbeki sacked the 63-year - old in June after he was implicated in the bribery scandal .
The dismissal opened a rift within the governing African National Congress , in which Mr Zuma retains support .
Although he retains the title of ANC deputy president , Mr Zuma withdrew from leadership duties in December after being charged with rape .
"" We are sending out a strong message of support and solidarity to survivors of rape and violence , "" Carrie Chelver , a spokeswoman for People Opposing Woman Abuse , said .
"" This sounds like a party , "" Ms Chelver said , referring to supporters of Mr Zuma dancing to a pop song written for him . ""
Rape is not a party . ""
"" Jacob Zuma did n't rape that woman , "" a Zuma supporter , Lucy Hanwani , said outside court .
"" He was framed because they do n't want him to be president .
He fought for us long ago .
He will deliver what we want - houses , education . ""
Security was tight for today 's hearing , with streets around the court building closed .
Mr Zuma is due to stand trial in the corruption case in July after being implicated in a bribery scandal surrounding his friend and financial adviser , Schabir Shaik .
The judge in that case said Shaik made payments to Mr Zuma totalling around 1.2 m rands ( £ 111,700 ) to fund a lavish lifestyle .
He also said Mr Zuma was aware of Shaik 's efforts to facilitate a yearly payment of 500,000 rands to the ex - deputy president of the French arms firm Thint Holdings - formerly Thomson CSF - to deflect investigations into a 1999 weapons deal with the South African government .
Shaik is appealing against his conviction .
Mr Zuma 's appearances in the corruption case drew large , sometimes unruly crowds in support of him , and the Friends of Jacob Zuma Trust Fund had promised a strong showing today .
However , a growing number appeared to have reserved judgment on the rape allegation , a more politically damaging charge in a country which has high levels of violence against women ."
2006-02-14,"Three - thousand South Africans demonstrated yesterday in support of the former deputy president Jacob Zuma on the first day of his trial on rape charges .
Squads of riot police controlled the sometimes rowdy crowd , closing off the street in front of Johannesburg high court and separating about 50 women 's rights activists protesting against rape .
Mr Zuma , 63 , is charged with raping a 31-year - old Aids activist and longtime family friend in November last year .
He denies the charge .
At the opening of the trial yesterday , the presiding judge , Bernard Ngoepe , said he would step down from the high - profile case after Mr Zuma 's lawyers had called for him to withdraw , arguing that his impartiality was in question because he had issued warrants for police to search Mr Zuma 's home and his lawyer 's office in a separate corruption case .
Judge Ngoepe said although he was worried a leading politician would be seen to have the power to choose who judged him , he felt the need to avoid even the semblance of bias was paramount .
Mr Zuma is due stand trial on two corruption charges in July .
The rape and corruption charges have badly dented his ambitions to succeed President Thabo Mbeki ."
2006-02-16,"The rape trial of South Africa 's former deputy president , Jacob Zuma , was thrown into disarray yesterday when it was claimed that the politician had fathered a child with the sister of the judge expected to hear the case .
Defence lawyers objected to the appointment of Judge Jeremiah Shongwe reportedly because his sister Minah had an affair with Mr Zuma three decades ago , which produced a son , Edward , now 29 .
The revelation jolted what has been billed as the country 's most significant trial since apartheid , with an accusation of sexual violence tangled with a power struggle within the African National Congress .
Mr Zuma , 63 , denies raping a 31-year - old family friend at his Johannesburg home last year .
His supporters claim the case is an attempt to destroy his prospects of succeeding President Thabo Mbeki .
The trial got off to a shaky start on Monday when the presiding judge , Bernard Ngoepe , stepped down after defence lawyers said his impartiality was in doubt because last year he issued warrants for police to search Mr Zuma 's home in a separate corruption case .
Judge Ngoepe indicated that Judge Shongwe would take over but on Tuesday defence lawyers objected and the trial was postponed to March 6 .
Yesterday the Star , a Johannesburg daily , revealed the apparent reason : Judge Shongwe was the uncle of Mr Zuma 's son .
Edward , whose parentage is openly acknowledged within the Zuma clan , was said to regularly attend family functions .
Mr Zuma 's lawyer , Mike Hulley , declined to confirm or deny the report but said his client "" had some issues "" with the judge and that the appointment would be "" undesirable "" .
Neither judge nor defendant were available for comment .
Some legal experts said the Johannesburg high court might struggle to find a neutral and suitably senior judge .
A Zulu patriarch who headed the ANC 's intelligence service during the liberation struggle , Mr Zuma cultivated the party 's grassroots with a populist touch that unnerved his more technocratic and conservative rivals , including President Mbeki .
Mr Mbeki sacked his deputy last year after he was embroiled in a financial scandal .
A corruption trial is due to start in July .
Mr Zuma was enjoying a tentative comeback last November when he was charged with rape , an accusation that cost the support of many followers .
Like many Zulus he has two wives , in addition to a deceased wife and a divorced wife , and at least 10 children .
Potentially damaging revelations about his sex life were expected at the trial .
The alleged rape victim is an Aids treatment activist who is HIV positive .
While she was spending a night at the Zuma family home it is claimed that the politician climbed into her bed , offered a massage and then forced her to have sex .
Dozens of anti - rape protesters outside court this week were vastly outnumbered by more than 1,000 Zuma supporters ."
2006-03-07,"The rape trial of South Africa 's sacked deputy president Jacob Zuma began yesterday with graphic testimony from a sobbing HIV - positive Aids activist who claimed she was forced to have sex with him against her will .
The 31-year - old woman , a long - time family friend , alleged that Mr Zuma raped her without a condom , in a case that could scuttle the popular politician 's career and which has bitterly divided South Africa 's ruling African National Congress .
Mr Zuma , 63 , pleaded not guilty .
He was once widely viewed as South Africa 's next president but his ambition may have been thwarted by this rape case and separate corruption charges for which he will stand trial in July .
More than 2,000 supporters of Mr Zuma demonstrated outside the Johannesburg courthouse , dancing to Zulu songs and claiming that he was being framed .
A smaller band of about 100 women protested against rape and violence against women .
The complainant , who can not be named under South African law , said that she had known Mr Zuma since she was five and that she called him "" uncle "" and he called her "" daughter "" .
She said when she stayed at his home in the upmarket Forest Town suburb of Johannesburg on November 2 last year , he offered to "" tuck her in "" bed and then to massage her .
She said she told him "" no "" but he persisted . ""
At that point I opened my eyes .
That was when I saw that he was naked , "" the tearful woman told a hushed courtroom .
"" I thought ' Oh no , uncle can not be naked .
He is on top of me and I am in his house . '
I thought ' This ca n't be happening . '
And at that point I faced reality that I was just about to be raped .
"" She said he proceeded to rape her while holding her hands above her head .
The plaintiff said she waited for two days to report the alleged rape to police because she regarded Mr Zuma as "" family "" and had later come under pressure from various people , including one who offered money , to drop the case . ""
One said : ' Do you know what this will do to the ANC ?
It will rip the lives of people . '
I felt very pressured .
"" The woman said she had discussed the fact that she is HIV positive with Mr Zuma several times .
She said he had not used a condom .
Mr Zuma sat impassively throughout the woman 's testimony but he appeared smiling and confident during the lunch break .
His lawyer outlined his defence in which the politician agreed that he had sex with the woman but he maintained that it was with her consent . ""
The woman visited my home on November 2 on her own volition .
We had sex for some time .
It was consensual , "" Mr Zuma 's statement said .
"" At no stage did the complainant say no to any of the actions we performed .
At no stage did I believe that the sexual intercourse was against the will of the complainant .
She was at all times at liberty to say so and to voice her disapproval . ""
Mr Zuma 's statement added that the complainant had made "" similar false rape charges against others "" and had later withdrawn them .
One of South Africa 's most popular politicians , Mr Zuma was fired as president Thabo Mbeki 's deputy last year amid a corruption scandal for which he will stand trial in July .
He was later hit with the separate rape charge .
Mr Zuma 's supporters say both charges are part of a vendetta by his political enemies in the ruling African National Congress , where he remains widely popular .
If convicted of rape , Mr Zuma could face 15 years in prison but if he wins an acquittal and is also found not guilty of the graft charges he would stand a fair chance of resuming his political career ."
2006-04-04,"The former South African deputy president Jacob Zuma said during his trial for rape yesterday that his accuser led him to believe she wanted sex by complaining that she had no boyfriend and wearing a knee - length skirt when she visited his house .
Mr Zuma , who used to head South Africa 's National Aids Council , said he was HIV negative but saw little risk in intercourse with the HIV - positive Aids activist because transmission from women to men is harder than the reverse .
Mr Zuma denies raping the family friend , and says the claim is part of a plot to destroy his presidential hopes ."
2006-04-16,"The current rape trial of South Africa 's former deputy president , Jacob Zuma , has exposed a troubling side to a country hailed for its democracy and successful economy .
Mr Zuma , who spent his 64th birthday in court last week , is accused of raping a 31-year - old family friend at his Johannesburg home last November .
He admits having sex , but says it was consensual and claims the charge is part of a conspiracy to stop him succeeding President Thabo Mbeki .
The judge will decide whether he is a rapist .
Later this year another judge in a separate trial will decide whether Mr Zuma , who has been linked to a convicted fraudster , is corrupt .
If acquitted in both trials it is up to the African National Congress to decide whether Mr Zuma , who remains the party 's deputy leader , takes over when Mr Mbeki steps down as party leader next year and as the country 's president in 2009 .
It is unlikely Mr Zuma will stage a comeback , though there is enough murk in his power struggle with Mr Mbeki - a sorry saga of smears , hoax emails and spies - to convince supporters that their man was victimised when fired as deputy president last year .
Regardless of the verdict , the rape trial has exposed Mr Zuma as unfit for public life .
Since it began he has played the Zulu card , bussing in ethnic kin from KwaZulu - Natal to rally outside the court , chanting that their "" 100 % Zulu boy "" has been framed by Xhosas in the ANC .
Ethnic clashes cost thousands of lives before apartheid fell in 1994 .
By appealing to Zulu grievance
Mr Zuma is stirring embers best left untouched .
In his testimony Mr Zuma said the complainant sent sexual signals by wearing a knee - length skirt , and that once a woman is aroused Zulu culture compels a man to satisfy her desire .
Both claims are damaging in a country plagued by one of the world 's highest rates of sexual violence .
The defendants ' supporters shout "" Burn the bitch "" when the accuser enters court .
Mr Zuma , who has two wives , admitted having unprotected sex even though the alleged victim had HIV .
As a precaution he showered afterwards .
For the man who once headed the moral regeneration campaign and the national Aids council to say this beggars belief .
Abstain , be faithful or wear a condom , he once preached .
The hypocrisy is bad enough , but to discount the transmission risk and advocate showering as a form of safe sex is not only ludicrous , but dangerous in a country with more than 5 million people with HIV and a daily death toll exceeding 600 .
Mr Zuma has betrayed those who looked to him for leadership ."
2006-05-07,"South Africa 's most controversial court case since the end of apartheid culminates today with a verdict in the rape trial of the former deputy president Jacob Zuma .
Mr Zuma stands accused of raping a 31-year - old family friend .
His career hangs on the verdict , but his reputation has already been sullied by revelations that he knowingly had sex with an HIV - positive woman without using a condom .
She says it was rape ; he says it was consensual .
Mr Zuma , who faces a 15-year sentence , is also awaiting a separate trial for corruption and fraud in July .
Public interest in the rape case is so high that the verdict by Judge Willem van der Merwe will be broadcast live on television and radio .
The judge has said it will take him six hours to read the judgment .
Far from avoiding publicity , Mr Zuma , 64 , convened rallies in his home town , Durban , on Saturday and Johannesburg on Sunday .
He held hands with ministers praying for his acquittal and danced to Zulu songs singing his praises .
He told the crowds he was not able to comment on the case , but expressed gratitude for their support . ""
It gives me the strength to go on , "" he said .
During the trial he said his accuser , an Aids activist , had signalled she was willing to have sex by wearing a knee - length skirt and sitting without crossed legs .
He said he reduced his risk of infection by taking a shower after intercourse .
The accuser , who can not be named under South African law , was grilled over her sexual history .
She said she had been previously raped at the ages of five , 13 and 14 .
Several men testified that she had falsely accused them of rape .
Outside the court 3,000 of Mr Zuma 's supporters set fire to her portrait , shouting "" burn the bitch "" , and angrily threatened her .
The case is thought to have damaged South Africa 's efforts to prevent rape and reduce the spread of Aids , both of which are among the world 's highest .
Mr Zuma has retained undeniable popularity , particularly among the least educated and unemployed , but his support from the trade unions has weakened .
The verdict will largely determine whether he can pursue his ambition to succeed Thabo Mbeki as president in 2009 .
If acquitted , his supporters are already pressing for him to be reinstated as the ANC 's deputy president .
Mr Mbeki sacked Mr Zuma as the country 's deputy president in July last year when he faced charges of corruption .
After being charged with rape in November , Mr Zuma stepped down from any active role in the ANC .
His accuser has a difficult future .
Whatever the verdict , she faces the prospect of violent reprisals and is expected to leave the country for her own safety .
Political analyst Judith February said the case had great significance for South Africa .
"" This is not just about whether or not Jacob Zuma is guilty of rape .
It is about what calibre of leadership we want .
Do we want leadership in the battle against Aids and the fight against rape and violence against women ?
Do we want to uphold the freedoms enshrined in our constitution ?
Will women feel free to press charges of rape when this woman has been burned in effigy , stoned and must leave the country ?
This trial raises these very uncomfortable questions . """
2006-05-08,"The former South African deputy president Jacob Zuma was today cleared of raping an HIV - positive female friend in a case that has alarmed Aids campaigners and jeopardised his political future .
The 31-year - old woman had accused him of rape after they had unprotected sex at his home in November last year , but a judge ruled today that the encounter was consensual .
The case has threatened Mr Zuma 's hopes of becoming president , and health campaigners say his evidence during the trial has undermined years of promoting safe sex in a country where six million people have Aids .
As a former head of the South African national Aids council , Mr Zuma shocked many people by arguing , against scientific evidence , that there was little danger of him contracting HIV from unprotected sex .
He said taking a shower after having intercourse with the woman had reduced the risk of transmission .
Despite the allegations against him and a separate corruption trial - which goes to court later this year - Mr Zuma remains deputy president of the African National Congress and enjoys wide popularity in the rank and file of the party .
A crowd of several thousand of his supporters cheered wildly outside the Johannesburg high court today as it became clear a "" not guilty "" verdict was being returned after the judge read a lengthy judgment for several hours .
Some of the crowd sang "" Zuma , my president "" outside the court , where the tight security included a police helicopter hovering overhead .
The verdict was broadcast live on television and radio .
Mr Zuma , aged 64 , remained seated , showing no reaction as he was cleared .
Judge Willem Van der Merwe said he had difficulty accepting the prosecution 's version of the sexual encounter and rejected the accuser 's argument that she saw Mr Zuma as a father figure .
He said she could have left immediately after the alleged rape but chose to stay the night and wandered around the house for more than an hour the next morning , making herself food and using the phone before leaving for work .
The judge also said she had a history of making rape claims that turned out to be false and that he did not believe Mr Zuma would risk raping her when a police guard and his daughter were nearby .
Mr Zuma 's supporters have argued the allegations were part of a political plot to destroy any hope of him succeeding Thabo Mbeki as president in 2009 .
His critics say that as well as raising questions about his understanding of Aids , his evidence at the trial raised questions about his attitude towards women .
Mr Zuma , who was imprisoned on Robben Island during the apartheid era , claimed his accuser had encouraged him with mobile phone messages and flirtatious behaviour and did not resist his advances .
The woman said she "" froze "" when faced with his advances and that she would never have agreed to having sex without a condom .
Mr Zuma had also alleged that the woman was sending him a sexual invitation by wearing flimsy clothing when she said goodnight to him .
Outside the court , anti - rape activists have built a "" wall of shame "" , adorned with posters against sexual violence and a kanga - the traditional African wrap .
"" This kanga is not an invitation [ to sex ] , "" said one poster .
Women 's groups said the case had increased awareness of rape in South Africa , where the reported rape rate is 114 cases for every 100,000 people , compared to a rate of 32 every 100,000 in the US .
However , television footage of the alleged victim being heckled as she arrived in court and the aggressive cross - examination of her sexual history has prompted concern that the trial will deter women from reporting rape crimes ."
2006-05-08,"At times it resembled a circus , with demonstrators dancing outside the court and a song praising the defendant becoming a best - selling CD , but the trial of Jacob Zuma was a milestone for South Africa .
The mix of politics , sex and HIV / Aids drilled into the country 's core and exposed cracks beneath the post - apartheid sheen of democracy and economic growth .
In 26 days of testimony , the world learned about fractious rulers , overt chauvinism and shocking disarray in the fight against Aids , problems left unchanged by yesterday 's acquittal .
Mr Zuma , 64 , claimed that the charge of raping a 31-year - old family friend at his Johannesburg home last November was part of a conspiracy to block him succeeding Thabo Mbeki as president .
Mr Zuma was fired as deputy president several months earlier over links to a convicted fraudster , for which he will face a separate trial later this year , but was mustering a potential comeback until the rape allegation .
He suggested he had been framed to stop him rallying the trade unions , Communist party and youth league into a grassroots ANC rebellion against Mr Mbeki 's centralised leadership .
Such tensions within the ruling alliance were well known but the trial flushed out details of smears , surveillance and rogue intelligence chiefs , which revealed just how bitter and desperate the succession battle had become .
It also widened tribal fissures , with Mr Zuma 's supporters declaring their "" 100 % Zulu boy "" was a victim of Xhosas who had a stranglehold on the party .
Mr Zuma 's acquittal sets the stage for a renewed bout of infighting all the more troubling because it is largely invisible .
Control of the party , and therefore the country , will be determined behind closed doors by rival ANC cabals .
Since apartheid ended in 1994 , the ANC has used its thumping electoral wins to champion women 's rights , giving South Africa one of the world 's highest proportions of female parliamentarians and cabinet ministers .
Mr Zuma , who has two wives , as is common in Zulu culture , admitted having had sex with the complainant but said she had consented , citing , among other things , her knee - length skirt and that she had not crossed her legs .
Regardless of the verdict , equality advocates said Mr Zuma had betrayed a proprietary attitude to women that is widespread among South African men and fuels an extraordinarily high level of sexual violence , with more than 150 rapes reported daily .
When the complainant , an HIV - positive Aids activist , entered court Mr Zuma 's supporters repeatedly shouted , "" burn the bitch "" - without rebuke from Mr Zuma or other senior ANC figures .
"" There can be no doubt that the rape trial has damaged his reputation , not only in South Africa but abroad , "" Judith February , an analyst at the Institute for Democracy in South Africa , told Reuters .
"" The issue is not only the legal process but the court of public opinion .
It is difficult to recover from a process that has laid bare somebody 's character .
""
Many commentators said the trial 's most enduring legacy would be the revelation that the man once chosen to lead the moral regeneration movement and the national Aids council had had unprotected sex with someone he knew had HIV .
Mr Zuma explained this by saying there was no condom handy , the risk of a male contracting the virus from a female was low , and that he had showered after intercourse as a precaution .
Aids experts ridiculed the explanation , which they said would undermine the fight against a virus that has infected more than 5.3 million South Africans and kills more than 600 every day .
The government claims to run an extensive campaign of HIV education and treatment , but critics say the efforts are largely smoke and mirrors for a leadership still in denial about the gravity of the pandemic .
Mr Mbeki has toned down but not retracted his controversial views questioning the cause of Aids and the safety of anti - retroviral drugs , sowing confusion which the activist groups , such as the Treatment Action Campaign , say has crippled the country 's response .
Until Mr Zuma 's testimony , it was difficult to believe the disarray in Aids policy could get any worse ."
2006-05-09,"I spent two hours at Bush House last night taking part in a BBC World Service live phone - in on the acquittal of the former South African Deputy President , Mr Jacob Zuma , on rape charges .
The programme is called World Have
Your Say and is one of the more successful attempts by the World Service to go interactive .
For someone like me who has listened to it all his adult life , it is a remarkable development to watch the BBC grow from its "" ex cathedra "" stance - when it delivered to listeners throughout the world what it thought they needed to know - into a medium that enables the world to talk to the world .
The presenter , Ros Atkins , moderated as I joined three contributors from South Africa , who were on the phone , to discuss the acquittal , whilst telephone calls and emails flowed in , agreeing or disagreeing with us and stating the listeners ' own points of view .
Some of the telephone calls were of poor quality but they were mostly usable .
Ironically , the worst call , in terms of audibility , was made from London !
"" I am afraid we 'll have to call you back '' , Ros told the listener .
Eventually , they got him on a better line and he did have his say .
Reactions to the verdict around the world were illuminating .
Someone said South African democracy had been strengthened because the case had demonstrated the independence of the judiciary .
Another was angry that a big man who had used his position to abuse a young woman had got off .
The acquittal would deter women who are raped in South Africa - who are numbered in their thousands - from seeking justice .
We were told from South Africa that while the elite , especially those who control the media , saw the acquittal as a bad thing for the country , a large section of the ordinary public was happy that Zuma had got off .
Many had seen the trial as a political weapon with which his political opponents wanted to deprive him of the power that his popularity accords him in the ANC and the country .
But almost everyone was extremely critical of the fact that he made love to an HIV - infected woman without protection and that although he used to head the government body in charge of education on HIV , he asserted the ignorant and potentially harmful view that if one had a shower after making love to an HIV - infected person , one would not contract HIV / Aids .
In fact , after this case , it is difficult to see how Zuma , even if he is also acquitted of the corruption charge that he will be facing in July , can be the president of South Africa , after Mbeki .
He would be a laughing stock all over the world . ""
His Excellency the president of South Africa , Mr Heal - HIV - With - A - Quick - Shower "" would be the greeting that most people would throw at him in their minds every time he set foot on their soil or appeared on TV .
Which is very sad , for one does not rise up to become head of intelligence in the ANC by being stupid .
Nor should 10 years on Robben Island be eclipsed by the stains of one unfortunate shag ."
2006-05-09,"The former South African deputy president Jacob Zuma yesterday apologised to the nation for having unprotected sex with a woman who was HIV positive .
Speaking at a press conference after his acquittal on a rape charge , Mr Zuma said he hoped that his trial would not be a setback for the campaigns against Aids and rape .
"" I erred in having unprotected sex , "" he said .
"" I should have known better and should have acted more cautiously . ""
I unconditionally apologise to all the people of our nation and I pledge to continue supporting the struggle against HIV and Aids and the struggle against gender - based violence . ""
Mr Zuma , 64 , said his supporters were wrong to vilify the 31-year - old who accused him of rape .
He said he harboured no ill will towards her and extended a "" hand of friendship "" to the anti - rape activists who demonstrated during the trial .
The judge ruled that Mr Zuma and his accuser had sex by mutual consent .
"" I am back as deputy president of the ANCa
"" Mr Zuma said .
He faces a separate trial in July for corruption .
Although he faces an uphill battle in reviving his political career , he said if he were nominated by the ANC to run for president in 2009 he could not refuse ."
2006-05-09,"South Africa , as someone said long ago in a book that was promptly banned , is "" a very strange society "" .
But the new South Africa is in many ways even stranger than the old , and nothing shows it more embarrassingly than the trial of Jacob Zuma , the former vice president of South Africa , on the charge of raping a family friend .
When Alan Drury wrote of our strangeness , he was thinking of the old South Africa , of racial persecution and of effortless cruelty , laced with the sorts of absurdities that took the top of your head off if you thought about them too much .
A world on the far side of sanity .
The trial is over and Jacob Zuma has been acquitted .
But that is not the end of the story .
It is not the beginning , either , because violence in South Africa is at the heart of this case and violence is so pervasive , and so fundamental to the way people react to each other , that I sometimes think that hitting , shooting or raping are the terrifying means by which South Africans stay in touch .
The only way they stay in touch .
The Zuma trial in these past weeks has laid bare , again , the awful underside of what passes , terrifyingly , for "" normal "" life .
Terrifying because this is how it is for a lot of the time , though of course , we prefer not to say so .
The accuser of Jacob Zuma , a 31-year - old family friend , was HIV - positive , and in the course of the trial it was she who seemed to be in the dock , she who had to explain and defend her sexual history .
Outside the court , meanwhile , crowds of people in Zulu beadwork and Zuma T - shirts proclaimed their devotion to the big man JZ , our home - grown "" Zulu Boy "" , while cheerfully calling for her head .
Intimidation ?
Yes ,
but of a peculiarly South African kind - fear - mongering dolled up in its scary festive best .
"" Burn the bitch ! "" demanded the dancers in the streets , and as they danced , waving mock AK47s , they were holding up pictures of the woman who had dared to bring the rape charge .
And , often , after another round in court , the accused would join his supporters in the hit song
Awulethu Umshini Wam ( Bring Me My Machine Gun ) .
What was to have been a trial about possible rape was revved up into a political rally , with supporters of Zuma bussed to Johannesburg all the way from Kwa - Zulu Natal , hundreds of miles away .
The idea being to frighten and then destroy those who oppose you - the philosophy at the heart of traditional South African politics , new and old , even if those struggles sometimes play out as revolutions or rugby matches or rape trials .
It is not surprising that supporters of the woman who brought the charge of rape , from organisations such as the One - in - Nine Campaign , and a group called Powa ( People Opposing Women Abuse ) , were sometimes led away by the police , fearful for their safety .
What they had to say was quite obliterated by an army of Zuma supporters ; they were outplayed , you might say , and certainly outgunned .
This was a pity because what such people were trying to say was that there is too much rape in South Africa , too many murders , a plague of violence .
One in nine is said to be the number of rapes actually reported to the police .
Like all statistics , this is probably wrong ; and the best way to express the stratospheric figures of rape and other forms of violence , especially against women and children , would be to say simply that they are much too high .
To use other figures , again , almost certain to be hopelessly inaccurate , it is thought that a woman or a child is raped every 26 seconds .
These figures may be terrifying but all they do is to is to feed the general feeling of helplessness in the face of the seemingly insatiable energy in and among South Africans for violence in all forms .
And , besides , statistics do not lend themselves to singing and dancing , and they do not carry guns .
In law , Zuma 's accuser may not be named , but that does n't help .
She has been named , often , her identity is no secret and she was and is under police protection .
But it will not help much now that the case is over .
Her family home has been attacked twice and the woman herself burnt in effigy .
The fury directed at Zuma 's accuser was , in part , because she had had the gall to bring a charge against a popular leader but also because she was seen as being in cahoots with those forces
Zuma and others believe are out to destroy him - Thabo Mbeki , and an anti - Zuma faction within the ruling party .
Zuma 's fans had a message for Mbeki . ""
Tell him , "" they said in the streets outside the courthouse , "" that we are sick of him , tell him that .
Tell him we still believe JZ will be president . ""
There are those who say such a thing is now impossible .
But they do n't know how persuasive messages are when delivered with an AK47 .
Politics in my country may be described as big talk backed by even bigger guns .
The acquittal was a famous victory for the former vice - president .
He was cleared of all charges and his accuser dismissed as a fantasist .
Though Judge van der Merwe had some harsh things to say about unprotected sex with an HIV - positive partner , he did not remark on the fact that Zuma , when vice president , was in charge of the moral regeneration of the nation or that he once headed up the South African National Aids Council .
He did , however , revisit Rudyard Kipling 's poem
If , and told Zuma that he had been rather reckless .
Self - control was the answer , said the judge .
"" And if you can control your body and your sexual urges , then you are a man , my son . ""
What did not get the attention it deserved was that the woman in court had been raped three times before : when she was five , at 13 , and again at 14 .
Nor did the judge dwell too much on the bizarre nature of Zuma 's defence .
He testified that far from being a sexual attack on his part , the woman had been determined to have sex with him , and the niceties of Zulu culture demanded that he comply because not to have done so when the woman so clearly wished him to do so would be regarded , again in Zulu sexual etiquette , as the equivalent of having raped her .
As someone who had sometimes satirised South Africa , that sort of thing brings on in me a kind of dazed admiration .
How on earth could you make up something like that ?
South Africa always outstrips its writers .
Take that judge .
In one of the great tragicomic moments in legal theatre , it turned out that Judge Willem van der Merwe only got the job because no one else would have it .
The trial was due to be heard by the Judge President , Bernard Ngoepe .
But he said the case was too "" political "" and he 'd really rather not .
Next up was his deputy , Judge John Magapelo , but he declined the job for "" personal reasons "" .
Then Judge Jeremiah Shongwe looked like he would be lumbered with it but explained that he could n't do it either because the whole thing was rather too close to home - Zuma , Shongwe explained , was the father of a child by the judge 's sister , some three decades earlier while he had been in exile .
Behind it , under it , all around the trial was the question , known and avoided in South Africa - of Aids and its relentless spread .
In a country where by some counts six million people carry the virus , and many will succumb , the subject is still a deadly secret .
Zuma had sex with an HIV - positive partner and then took a shower .
Thabo Mbeki took a look at the science of the virus and simply refused to recognise it .
"" We can not blame everything on a single virus , "" he told a journalist in 2003 .
There was also poverty , starvation , suicide and substance abuse . ""
Personally , I do n't know anyone who has died of Aids . ""
This is truly a world apart , a very strange society .
It does not consider what is but what people say should be , and the race is to the swift and the well - armed .
Aids kills more people in South Africa than anywhere else in the world .
Yes , it does .
And yet the trial of Zuma was not about Aids .
Or rape , or violence .
It was about power , about the struggle between Zuma and his people and Mbeki and his backers , as to which has the country 's interests more truly at heart .
Zuma left the court a free man and felt himself to be rather like Christ , crucified by the media and sinister forces who had stitched him up .
It is said that the woman at the heart of it has been advised to - and will have to - leave the country .
And there is a cruel logic to it .
Not just because she may well be in physical danger , but because in a terrible way she is irrelevant to the ongoing struggle for power .
Even Zuma 's demeanour at his trial underscores how brutal , how dreamy , how weird are those things that pass for normal in South Africa .
I will return to the battle against Aids , said Zuma ; I will even use my own lapse into unprotected sex as a warning to others not to follow my example .
He went on to compare his ordeal to the crucifixion .
But it is not Jesus Christ he resembles so much as David Blaine - the great escape artist .
With this difference .
David Blaine , tied up underwater , failed to escape and had to be rescued .
Zuma seems able to defy the laws of gravity - he slipped his chains .
And , believe it or not , to many in South Africa he has come up smelling of roses ."
2006-05-09,"South Africa 's ruling African National Congress was thrown into chaos last night after its former deputy president Jacob Zuma was acquitted of rape charges and announced he would resume his political career , posing a challenge to the president , Thabo Mbeki .
Greeted by deafening cheers as he left court a free man , Mr Zuma made it known that he intended to resume his duties as deputy president of the ANC despite being suspended from the post last year .
He faces a separate trial on charges of corruption and fraud in July , but the rape charge was widely seen as the most damaging to his political ambitions to succeed Mr Mbeki in 2009 .
For 4,000 supporters who had gathered outside the courthouse during the six - hour verdict , there was no doubt that Mr Zuma was back . ""
Thank you , thank you , I am warm among the people who love me , "" Mr Zuma said in Zulu , to a gathering of several thousand a few blocks away .
Karima Brown , political editor of Business Day newspaper , said : "" Jacob Zuma is back .
This poses a serious dilemma for the ANC leadership .
Now Zuma is marching back into Luthuli House [ the ANC party HQ ] .
He will demand to be reinstated as deputy president and the others will find it difficult to block him ...
This is a major victory for Zuma 's political career . ""
Mr Zuma 's release is certain to reignite the succession battle in the ANC , in which he had been the frontrunner until last year .
His supporters accused Mr Mbeki of using the rape charges to sideline their hero and to ensure that the next leader would continue his centrist policies .
The ANC , in a joint statement with its alliance partners the Cosatu trade unions and the South African Communist party , said it welcomed and accepted the verdict after a "" distressing "" trial . ""
The trial process confirms that our democratic institutions , which we fought for over many years , are on a firm footing . ""
Pandemonium erupted when the not guilty verdict was announced .
Ten men in leopardskin skirts jumped on the benches , dancing and singing My President , a song praising Mr Zuma .
Others ululated , weeping tears of joy .
Judge Willem van der Merwe accepted as "" plausible "" the explanation from Mr Zuma , 64 , that he had had consensual sex with a 31-year - old Aids activist who is HIV - positive .
The judge found that the woman "" has a history of making false allegations of rape "" .
He referred to testimony that she was emotionally troubled and in need of professional counselling .
The judge reprimanded Mr Zuma for having sex with an HIV - positive woman without a condom .
"" I find it inexcusable that the accused would have unprotected sex with a woman so many years younger than him , who is the child of one of his comrades .
That intercourse endangered her health and his , "" said Judge van der Merwe .
He went on to adapt Rudyard Kipling 's poem
If , saying , "" If you can control your body and your sexual urges , then you are a man , my son . ""
Mr Zuma 's supporters paid little heed .
"" That woman was a liar .
Zuma did n't do it .
Zuma is my leader .
I do n't like Mbeki any more .
He tried to pull other people down .
Mbeki tried to pull Zuma down , "" said Ngitheni Mnyandi .
Women 's rights activists criticised the acquittal , calling it a blow to efforts to reduce South Africa 's rates of rape , among the highest in the world .
Six women from the group People Opposing Women Abuse were escorted from the court by police for their safety .
"" It is a setback for our battle against rape and gender violence but we will not give up , "" said Delphine Serumaga .
Mr Zuma 's accuser can not be named under South African law , but her identity is widely known and her family 's home has been attacked twice .
She is said to be afraid for her safety and has already packed her bags to leave South Africa , the Star newspaper reported .
Backstory Jacob Zuma was South Africa 's deputy president for six years before being sacked in June after he was implicated in a corruption trial .
A former member of the ANC 's military wing , Zuma rose to become head of intelligence .
Like Nelson Mandela , he was imprisoned on Robben Island for conspiring to overthrow white rule , spending 10 years in jail before going into exile .
An ethnic Zulu , Zuma 's position in the ANC strikes a balance in an organisation perceived to be dominated by the Xhosa tribe of Mandela and Thabo Mbeki .
Zuma , 64 , is popular among ANC rank and file and its leftist and trade union allies , and was leading contender to succeed Mbeki as president in 2009 ."
2006-05-09,"Jacob Zuma , South Africa 's former deputy president , is a one - man wrecking crew .
Although acquitted of rape he has confessed to misdeeds that have inflicted deep damage to his country .
The judge found that Zuma had taken part in consensual sex .
The merits of that finding will long be argued over .
His accuser is clearly a traumatized woman , the victim of sexual abuse since the age of five .
Zuma 's defence lawyers had to attack and undermine her to prove his innocence ; but in the process they have ensured that rape victims will have greater reason to shrink from lodging criminal complaints - to avoid harrowing public cross - examination , and even more so because of the mob screams of "" Burn bitch "" when the accuser came to court and two attacks on her family 's home .
South Africa already has the world 's worst rate of rape , with 50,000 complaints to the police each year , and unknown numbers unreported .
Not only rape , but HIV / Aids , with nearly 6 million infected in a population of 45 million .
Zuma was previously the head of the National Aids Council and the moral regeneration movement , which propagandized single - partner sex .
It goes beyond humbug that he had unprotected sex with a woman whom he knew was HIV - positive and that he said he had a shower afterwards in the belief it would reduce his chance of infection .
What a devastating blow to Aids prevention .
What a rotten role model , to have a man revered by many for his role in the liberation struggle admit to such ignorant and risk - filled behaviour .
No wonder , also , that the South African government has been so erratic in coping with Aids .
It could not have been otherwise if someone like Zuma has been involved in the decision - making process .
Zuma has also let the tribal genie out of the bottle .
Tribal rivalry has long been a fact of life and was exploited by apartheid governments which applied divide and rule tactics to undermine the growth of African unity : that was the basis of the Bantustans which separated blacks into tribal mini - states .
The African National Congress from its start in 1912 worked hard to overcome tribal divisions .
Despite this , tension between the Zulus , who make up the single biggest ethnic group in the country , and the Xhosas remains just below the surface .
Zuma played the ethnic card during the trial , claiming that "" Zulu culture "" demanded that he could not leave an aroused woman unsatisfied and that 's why he had sex with her .
Of course this has given rise to mocking jokes about "" Zuma culture "" .
But it is also serious because Zuma supported the claims of his followers that he was being hounded as a "" 100 % Zulu boy "" by the Xhosas who hold leadership positions in the ANC and the government .
The consequences could prove calamitously divisive , especially as he says he intends going ahead with his bid to succeed Thabo Mbeki as president in 2009 .
A couple of years ago , Zuma , 64 , was described by a trade union leader as an "" unstoppable tsunami "" on the way to the presidency .
He was widely admired for the ten years he spent as a prisoner on Robben Island and his role , in exile , as a leader of the ANC 's military operations .
Last week , the Johannesburg Mail&amp;Guardian newspaper said that the rape trial , whatever its outcome , "" has shaken our world "" .
It described the political damage as "" incalculable , with the ruling ANC now an openly divided and faltering movement "" .
The Communist party and the Congress of South African Trade Unions ( Cosatu ) had "" floundered and fractured "" in the face of the charges against the man they had ardently backed as the next president .
More and worse will come .
On July 31 , Zuma goes on trial on corruption and fraud charges .
These flow from the trial last year of his friend and financial adviser , Schabir Sheik , who was found , as the judge said , to have had a "" generally corrupt relationship "" with Zuma .
When that verdict was given President Mbeki fired Zuma as his deputy president ( but kept him on as deputy president of the ANC ) .
It was a brave action , and Mbeki stood his ground in the face of the torrent of criticisms , which followed from Zuma supporters inside the ANC and its linked bodies .
Zuma 's rape acquittal will strengthen the attacks on Mbeki .
Accusations will mount that the coming corruption trial is a political plot to smear Zuma to prevent him from becoming president .
This will overshadow whatever evidence is presented in court .
The judge will have to be strong and focused .
Therein lies hope .
For as the ANC , the Communist party and Cosatu said yesterday about the rape acquittal : "" The trial process confirms that our democratic institutions , which we fought for over many years , are on a firm footing . """
2006-05-14,"Jacob Zuma , South Africa 's former Deputy President , a man who really knows his stuff , having headed South Africa 's National Aids Council and the Moral Regeneration Movement , says that showering offers ample protection against Aids .
It must come as a huge relief to all those worried about STDs .
Just keep up the personal hygiene and all will be well .
All in all , it 's been a pretty good couple of weeks for deputy leaders on two continents .
Admittedly , South Africa 's did lose his job after being charged with raping a friend 's daughter .
But following his acquittal last week , champagne corks must be popping .
His accuser was already in a minority , what with one in nine rapes in South Africa not being reported at all .
It 's not hard to understand why .
According to Judge Willem van der Merwe , in charge of the case , Mr Zuma would not have risked forcing himself on the 31-year - old woman in question when his own daughter was in the house and police were on guard outside .
Being examined from a different perspective ( how about the victim 's , for example ? ) might inspire an altogether different presumption - that it offered an ideal environment to commit such an act .
The judge did n't consider it equally likely that , as a family friend , Zuma 's accuser would be unlikely to make such a personally traumatic claim were it not true .
Then again , wafting , around the house wrapped only in a piece of cloth , otherwise known as the traditional kanga , she was obviously asking for it .
And then there 's our own Carry On caper - to put it mildly .
John Prescott , our Deputy Prime Minister , is no rapist , but surely the most public sexual adventurer of recent times .
Yet there he is , still in his job and getting paid the same salary for less work .
Why , it almost looks like he 's been offered a bonus for his boorish behaviour .
Tony Blair 's near exoneration of his deputy does n't send out altogether positive signals to those with an eye to the rights of women .
In many ways , South Africa today acts as a metaphor for the feminist movement .
So much expected and , ultimately , so little delivered .
Coupled with the death of a young female helicopter pilot in Iraq , such events actually only serve to illustrate that the progress achieved by the feminist movement has left women in an impossible situation .
Legislation decrees that we are free to work , to have children , to run homes and be treated as equals in society .
But if even here in the UK , a quarter of violent crime is perpetrated against women in acts of domestic violence , a third of rapes go unreported and equal pay still leaves 43 per cent of women earning half the average male salary .
It 's hard to see how anyone can sit back and declare the battle for equality over .
For women trying to make the most of their so - called emancipation , such ' progress ' has left us like hamsters on a wheel , endlessly treading but moving only in circles .
We 're not having it all , as is regularly reported , but doing it all .
Yes , we have legislation defending us from discrimination and equal pay , but those are surely basic human rights ?
It 's increasingly clear that if our world remains defined by 2,000 years of male rule , with just a few minor adjustments in the past four decades , it 's not ultimately going to be an environment in which women can flourish .
At an Intelligence 2 debate in central London the other night , respected literary figures such as Tim Lott and Howard Jacobson tried to persuade an audience that ' We Are All Feminists Now ' .
Only men would have the cheek to try and defend the proposition .
They were soundly defeated by an audience whose swing vote against the motion represented the largest majority in the history of Intelligence 2
So why is it that it 's always women out there banging the drum for change ?
Until men display a similar degree of outrage that their wives , mothers , sisters and daughters continue to be violated and discriminated against , and penalised for their need to work flexible hours in order to raise children , there is little hope for a better world .
Ultimately , it 's their own sex that Zuma and Prescott betray with their behaviour .
Actually , I 'd rather have a coconut ...
It has been a good week for bad living .
Hot on the heels of an American report that moderate coffee drinking is actually good for you comes the news that Rolling Stones guitarist and celebrated hellraiser Keith Richards is now recovering from his recent surgery .
I 'm happy to hear it and
just a little amused that it took a sporty clamber up a coconut tree to do to Richards what a lifetime of Class A drug abuse had failed to achieve by rendering him in need of brain surgery .
Not only can I take comfort that my coffee and red wine - littered diet is now positively virtuous and the most likely route to longevity , but , thanks to Keef 's example , I 'm considering taking up some serious vices , although some might say that , in the case of Richards , the drugs had already taken their toll .
At 62 , only a brain scrambled by illicit substances would be foolhardy enough to consider tree - climbing in the first place ."
2006-05-15,"Jacob Zuma was reinstated as deputy president of South Africa 's ruling African National Congress yesterday .
His political comeback began when he was found not guilty last Monday of raping a 31-year - old HIV - positive Aids educator , and yesterday 's announcement boosts his uphill struggle to succeed Thabo Mbeki as the country 's president when Mr Mbeki 's second term expires in 2009 .
After the court case , Mr Zuma , 64 , who did not use a condom during intercourse with the woman , issued an astutely expansive "" apology to the nation "" for having consensual but unsafe sex .
He pledged to campaign against rape , violence against women and the spread of HIV .
But despite his political skill and vocal grassroots supporters , particularly among the ANC Youth League , Mr Zuma faces formidable obstacles , including a corruption trial in July .
He is charged with receiving bribes from a French arms firm , Thales .
His financial adviser has already been found guilty of the charge , which caused Mr Mbeki to sack Mr Zuma as the country 's deputy president last year .
Sixty - four per cent of South Africans do not want Mr Zuma to be president , according to a poll by the Sunday Times , the country 's largest newspaper .
"" Zuma is on the comeback trail , but has huge hurdles - the corruption trial and the opposition of many civil society groups , "" wrote Karima Brown , political editor of the Johannesburg newspaper Business Day .
"" He has opened a wide rift within the ANC over who should succeed Mbeki . ""
Mr Mbeki said last week that he would like his successor to be a woman ."
2006-05-19,"South Africa , as someone said long ago in a book that was promptly banned , is "" a very strange society "" .
But the new South Africa is in many ways even stranger than the old , and nothing shows it more embarrassingly than the trial of Jacob Zuma , the former vice - president of South Africa , on the charge of raping a family friend .
When Alan Drury wrote of our strangeness , he was thinking of the old South Africa , of racial persecution and of effortless cruelty , laced with the sorts of absurdities that took the top of your head off if you thought about them too much .
A world on the far side of sanity .
The trial is over and Jacob Zuma has been acquitted .
But that is not the end of the story .
It is not the beginning , either , because violence in South Africa is at the heart of this case and violence is so pervasive , and so fundamental to the way people react to each other , that I sometimes think that hitting , shooting or raping are the terrifying means by which South Africans stay in touch .
The only way they stay in touch .
The Zuma trial these past weeks has laid bare again the awful underside of what passes , terrifyingly , for "" normal "" life .
Terrifying because this is how it is for a lot of the time , though of course we prefer not to say so .
The accuser of Jacob Zuma , a 31-year - old family friend , was HIV - positive , and in the course of the trial it was she who seemed to be in the dock , she who had to explain and defend her sexual history .
Outside the court , meanwhile , crowds of people in Zulu beadwork and Zuma T - shirts proclaimed their devotion to the big man JZ , our home - grown "" Zulu Boy "" , while cheerfully calling for her head .
Intimidation ?
Yes ,
but of a peculiarly South African kind - fear - mongering dolled up in its scary festive best .
"" Burn the bitch ! "" demanded the dancers in the streets , and as they danced , waving mock AK47s , they were holding up pictures of the woman who had dared to bring the rape charge .
And , often , after another round in court , the accused would join his supporters in the hit song ""
Awulethu Umshini Wam ( Bring Me My Machine Gun ) "" .
What was to have been a trial about possible rape was revved up into a political rally , with supporters of Zuma bussed to Johannesburg all the way from Kwa - Zulu Natal , hundreds of kilometres away .
The idea being to frighten and then destroy those who oppose you - the philosophy at the heart of traditional South African politics , new and old , even if those struggles sometimes play out as revolutions or rugby matches or rape trials .
It is not surprising that supporters of the woman who brought the charge of rape , from organisations such as the One - in - Nine Campaign , and a group called Powa ( People Opposing Women Abuse ) , were sometimes led away by the police , fearful for their safety .
What they had to say was obliterated by an army of Zuma supporters ; they were outplayed , you might say , and certainly outgunned .
This was a pity because what such people were trying to say was that there is too much rape in South Africa , too many murders , a plague of violence .
One in nine is said to be the number of rapes actually reported to the police .
Like all statistics , this is probably wrong ; and the best way to express the stratospheric figures of rape and other forms of violence , especially against women and children , would be to say simply that they are much too high .
To use other figures , again almost certain to be hopelessly inaccurate , it is thought that a woman or a child is raped every 26 seconds .
These figures may be terrifying but all they do is to is to feed the general feeling of helplessness in the face of the seemingly insatiable energy in and among South Africans for violence in all forms .
And , besides , statistics do not lend themselves to singing and dancing , and they do not carry guns .
In law , Zuma 's accuser may not be named , but that does n't help .
She has been named , often , her identity is no secret and she was and is under police protection .
It will not help much now that the case is over .
Her family home has been attacked twice and the woman herself burnt in effigy .
The fury directed at Zuma 's accuser was , in part , because she had had the gall to bring a charge against a popular leader but also because she was seen as being in cahoots with those forces
Zuma and others believe are out to destroy him - Thabo Mbeki , and an anti - Zuma faction within the ruling party .
Zuma 's fans had a message for Mbeki . ""
Tell him , "" they said in the streets outside the court , "" that we are sick of him , tell him that .
Tell him we still believe JZ will be president . ""
There are those who say such a thing is now impossible .
But they do n't know how persuasive messages are when delivered with an AK47 .
Politics in my country may be described as big talk backed by even bigger guns .
The acquittal was a famous victory for the former vice - president .
He was cleared of all charges and his accuser dismissed as a fantasist .
Though Judge van der Merwe had some harsh things to say about unprotected sex with an HIV - positive partner , he did not remark on the fact that Zuma , when vice - president , was in charge of the moral regeneration of the nation or that he once headed up the South African National Aids Council .
He did , however , revisit Rudyard Kipling 's poem ""
If "" , and told Zuma that he had been rather reckless .
Self - control was the answer , said the judge .
"" And if you can control your body and your sexual urges , then you are a man , my son . ""
What did not get the attention it deserved was that the woman in court had been raped three times before : when she was five , at 13 , and again at 14 .
Nor did the judge dwell too much on the bizarre nature of Zuma 's defence .
He testified that far from being a sexual attack on his part , the woman had been determined to have sex with him , and the niceties of Zulu culture demanded that he comply because not to have done so when the woman so clearly wished him to do so would be regarded , again in Zulu sexual etiquette , as the equivalent of having raped her .
As someone who has sometimes satirised South Africa , that sort of thing brings on in me a kind of dazed admiration .
How on earth could you make up something like that ?
South Africa always outstrips its writers .
Take that judge .
In one of the great tragicomic moments in legal theatre , it turned out that Judge Willem van der Merwe only got the job because no one else would have it .
The trial was due to be heard by the Judge President , Bernard Ngoepe .
But he said the case was too "" political "" and he 'd really rather not .
Next up was his deputy , Judge John Magapelo , but he declined the job for "" personal reasons "" .
Then Judge Jeremiah Shongwe looked like he would be lumbered with it but explained that he could n't do it either because the whole thing was rather too close to home - Zuma , Shongwe explained , was the father of a child by the judge 's sister , some three decades earlier while he had been in exile .
Behind it , under it , all around the trial was the question , known and avoided in South Africa - of Aids and its relentless spread .
In a country where by some counts 6 million people carry the virus , and many will succumb , the subject is still a deadly secret .
Zuma had sex with an HIV - positive partner and then took a shower .
Thabo Mbeki took a look at the science of the virus and simply refused to recognise it .
"" We can not blame everything on a single virus , "" he told a journalist in 2003 .
There was also poverty , starvation , suicide and substance abuse . ""
Personally , I do n't know anyone who has died of Aids . ""
This is truly a world apart , a very strange society .
It does not consider what is but what people say should be , and the race is to the swift and the well - armed .
Aids kills more people in South Africa than anywhere else in the world .
Yes , it does .
And yet the trial of Zuma was not about Aids .
Or rape , or violence .
It was about power , about the struggle between Zuma and his people and Mbeki and his backers , as to which has the country 's interests more truly at heart .
Zuma left the court a free man and felt himself to be rather like Christ , crucified by the media and sinister forces who had stitched him up .
It is said that the woman at the heart of it has been advised to - and will have to - leave the country .
And there is a cruel logic to it .
Not just because she may well be in physical danger , but because in a terrible way she is irrelevant to the ongoing struggle for power .
Even Zuma 's demeanour at his trial underscores how brutal , how dreamy , how weird are those things that pass for normal in South Africa .
I will return to the battle against Aids , said Zuma ; I will even use my own lapse into unprotected sex as a warning to others not to follow my example .
He went on to compare his ordeal to the crucifixion .
But it is not Jesus Christ he resembles so much as David Blaine - the great escape artist .
With this difference .
David Blaine , tied up underwater , failed to escape and had to be rescued .
Zuma seems able to defy the laws of gravity - he slipped his chains .
And , believe it or not , to many in South Africa he has come up smelling of roses ."
2006-07-04,"Jacob Zuma , the ANC leader recently cleared of a rape charge , has launched the largest defamation claim in South African history .

Prosecutors have requested that the case be postponed until next year , a move that Mr Zuma 's lawyers have vowed to oppose ."
2006-09-03,"The struggle for the future leadership of South Africa heated up at the weekend when , for the first time , the former deputy president Jacob Zuma launched an open attack on President Thabo Mbeki , accusing him of over - centralising power .
The attack by the man Mr Mbeki fired came amid concern that the president might have a heart problem after his admission to a clinic for tests last week .
The president 's woes were compounded when it was disclosed that he had bought an expensive house in Johannesburg , giving the impression that he was preparing for his retirement .
Mr Zuma laid into Mr Mbeki in a speech to the country 's largest teachers ' union in which he also criticised the government 's HIV - Aids policy .
The speech was described as a turning point in Mr Zuma 's campaign to win the ANC presidency next year .
A spokesman for Mr Mbeki said he was in good health and would be at work this week .
Mr Mbeki 's wife , Zanele , threatened to sue the Democratic Alliance for invasion of privacy after they turned up with a group of journalists in tow to inspect the family 's new house , said to be worth about 22 m rand ( £ 1.6 m ) , in the luxurious suburb of Houghton .
The chief whip of the alliance , Douglas Gibson , asked where he had got the money to afford the house .
Suspicions were raised when it emerged that Mrs Mbeki had used a pseudonym when hiring a building contractor .
The only comeback against his chief tormentor from Mr Mbeki was in the form of a rebuke to those he described as the "" children "" of the Congress of South African Students for an attack they had made on Archbishop Desmond Tutu .
The retired archbishop had advised Mr Zuma not to stand for the post of ANC president at next year 's party congress .
In an online column Mr Mbeki writes , he demanded , almost with pathos : "" What is it that gives the very young the audacity to repudiate what our senior citizens say ? ""
Mr Zuma faces a court appearance this week on corruption charges .
If he is acquitted , his drive for power could create a crisis of confidence for South Africa ."
2006-09-20,"The dismissal of corruption charges against Jacob Zuma , former deputy president of South Africa , is not so much an embarrassment for the prosecution service of South Africa as a disaster of monumental proportions .
The prosecution had gone to court to ask for yet another postponement of the trial , which arose out of defence contracts awarded by the South African government to a French firm in 1999 .
But high - court judge Herbert Msimang , sitting in Pietermaritzburg , said the state 's case against Zuma had gone "" from one disaster to another "" .
The prosecution , he said , had failed to follow proper guidelines : "" There were clear guidelines which should have informed their decision to proceed .
They ignored those guidelines at their own peril , "" Judge Msimang said .
His ruling stopped short of completely dismissing the case , as it left open the possibility that state prosecutors could refile charges against Zuma at a later date .
Hundreds of Zuma supporters , who had gathered outside the courthouse , broke into cheers and danced on hearing news of the ruling .
They were rejoicing because it renews their hope that Mr Zuma can join the contest to become leader of the African National Congress , and then president of South Africa , when the current president , Thabo Mbeki , retires in 2009 .
Earlier this year , Mr Zuma was acquitted of a charge of rape after a sensational trial , during which details of a sexual encounter he had with a family friend were made public .
Zuma claimed that the encounter was by mutual consent , but during the trial his prestige suffered when he disclosed his opinion that if he had a shower after having sex with a woman he knew was HIV positive , he would not contract the disease .
As someone expected to take part in educating the public on how to prevent HIV and Aids , his attitude enraged a large section of the South African intelligentsia , and he was forced to apologise .
But his popularity with the "" masses "" of South Africa - who honour him for the work he did for the ANC as its intelligence chief during the struggle against apartheid - does not appear to have suffered much .
Many South Africans still believe that his "" trials and tribulations "" stem from a conspiracy to prevent him from becoming president of South Africa .
They see him , perhaps illusorily , as a man of the people who is more concerned with the people 's welfare than the current "" elitist "" ANC leadership - which has become assimilated into the white political and economic structures that were formerly used to oppress the African majority .
Certainly , any further attempt to seek his exclusion from high political office on the basis of criminal charges , will be seen by many of his fellow countrymen as a clumsy way of trying to undermine his political future .
And it could divide the ANC permanently ."
2006-09-20,"Jacob Zuma 's bid to become the next president of South Africa was boosted today after a judge dismissed corruption charges against him .
The move came after the prosecution said it was not ready to proceed with a case against the popular former deputy president .
Judge Herbert Msimang said the prosecution had "" limped from one disaster to another "" and had failed to follow the correct procedure .
He said he had no choice but to dismiss the current indictment , setting off celebrations by Zuma supporters in the court .
But the judge stopped short of completely dismissing the case .
Prosecutors will now have to decide if they have enough evidence to bring a new indictment against Mr Zuma , amid growing doubts that the state could secure a conviction .
Mr Zuma , who was acquitted of rape charges in an unrelated case earlier this year , was fired last year by President Thabo Mbeki when it became clear he would have to stand trial on corruption charges .
The 64-year - old former guerrilla leader had pleaded innocent to charges that he was aware of efforts by his financial adviser Schabir Shaik to secure him yearly bribes of 500,000 rand or £ 36,000 from a French company to deflect corruption investigations into a large South African arms deal .
The investigations focused on a multibillion - pound deal to buy ships , submarines , helicopters , jets and other arms in 1999 .
Shaik , a close friend of Mr Zuma , was convicted for fraud and corruption last year and sentenced to 15 years in prison .
His appeal will be heard next week .
Mr Zuma was concerned that any further delays in the already - protracted case will hamper his hopes of succeeding Mr Mbeki , who still has two and a half years left in his final term .
He remains deputy leader of the ruling African National Congress and has recently stepped up his campaign to become ANC leader next year , which would automatically make him a contender for the country 's presidency .
Mr Zuma , who has attracted support from leftist groups , claims the charges against him are the result of a political conspiracy by forces within the ANC to derail his candidacy .
The eventual outcome of the trial could go a long way toward deciding who will be the next president .
"" An acquittal would give Zuma an enormous boost .
It would be an enormous vindication , "" Susan Brown , a political analyst with South Africa 's Institute for Peace and Reconciliation , told Associated Press .
Sipho Seepe , a political analyst , told Reuters : "" Obviously this judgement frees Zuma , and all those people who were n't sure if he was guilty will now throw their weight behind him . ""
He added : "" Politically Mbeki is no match for Zuma .
Mbeki may have state power but Zuma has the political power . ""
The National Prosecuting Authority expressed its disappointment at today 's decision , but vowed to continue pursuing the case ."
2006-09-21,"A South African judge threw out corruption charges against the controversial former deputy president Jacob Zuma yesterday , freeing him to pursue what is expected to be a popular but highly divisive campaign to become the next president .
The dismissal of the case was greeted with jubilation by Mr Zuma 's supporters , who say he was the target of a politically motivated prosecution because of his opposition to Thabo Mbeki 's economic and Aids policies .
Mr Zuma remains deputy president of the African National Congress , and the charges against him had led to the party 's worst internal wrangling since it came to power 12 years ago .
Judge Herbert Msimang dismissed the charges of accepting bribes from a French weapons company after the prosecution said its case was still not prepared , even though Mr Zuma first appeared in court nearly a year ago , and asked for a further postponement .
Charges against the French firm , Thint , were also thrown out .
The judge said the state 's case had "" limped from one disaster to another "" and that he had no choice but to halt the trial .
Prosecutors could refile charges at any time , but such a move would be likely to inflame accusations that the accusations are politically motivated .
"" I said I was innocent , "" Mr Zuma told supporters outside the Pietermaritzburg courtroom .
"" Everything has been brought to finality .
If there are any others who would like to bring me back to court they must start afresh . ""
In court , Mr Zuma 's supporters chanted "" Mr President "" at him , while outside others brandished a makeshift coffin with a photograph of Mr Mbeki attached .
Delegates at the annual conference of South Africa 's trades union confederation jumped on chairs and sang Mr Zuma 's trademark song Awuleth'umshini wami
( Bring me my machine gun ) .
The ruling leaves Mr Zuma as the favoured candidate to succeed Mr Mbeki as leader of the ANC next year , a position that virtually guarantees election as president in 2009 .
But Mr Zuma , 64 , who is strongly backed by unions , communists and other opponents of the present government 's business - oriented policies , has proved a divisive figure .
Mr Mbeki sacked him as deputy president last year after a judge said Mr Zuma had a "" generally corrupt "" relationship with his financial adviser , Schabir Shaik , who is serving 15 years in prison for fraud and corruption over a £ 2.1bn weapons deal .
The prosecution alleged that Mr Zuma had asked Mr Shaik to secure a 500,000 rand ( £ 37,000 ) a year payment from Thint to deflect investigations into the controversial arms purchases .
But support for Mr Zuma has grown , despite the corruption allegations and a rape trial earlier this year .
He was acquitted of rape but drew stinging criticism after he admitted knowingly having sex with an HIV - positive woman without using a condom , and for telling the court that he took a shower after sex as a means of protection from Aids .
Mr Zuma 's prosecution divided the ANC along lines likely to be reflected in the succession battle .
Mr Mbeki 's opponents inside the party have been increasingly drawn to Mr Zuma as the most likely candidate to prevent the outgoing president from handpicking a successor .
The quashing of Mr Zuma 's corruption trial coincided with the annual conference of the trades union confederation , Cosatu , which has called for the former deputy president to be reinstated . ""
The overwhelming majority of the working people , the poor , the marginalised , should be very happy today , "" said Cosatu 's secretary general , Zwelinzima Vavi .
"" This was all a politically conspired case to prevent him from advancing his political career . ""
Mr Zuma has considerable but not unanimous support within the trade union movement , particularly because of his criticisms of Mr Mbeki 's economic policies that emphasise economic growth over redistribution of wealth .
Without explicitly endorsing Mr Zuma , Cosatu has encouraged its members to take part in the ANC 's succession battle in an effort to bring the party back to policies that benefit the poor .
Cosatu , as a member of an alliance with the ANC and Communist party , will play an influential role in choosing the next leader .
State prosecutors remained defiant yesterday that they had been right to pursue the case . ""
As the prosecuting team has assured the court , it has a strong and winnable case against the accused , "" a spokesman said .
Government lawyers are expected to decide within six weeks whether to launch a fresh prosecution ."
2007-11-08,"The bitter power struggle between President Thabo Mbeki and his former deputy , Jacob Zuma , for control of the ruling African National Congress intensified today when a South African court opened the way for Mr Zuma to be charged with corruption over a multibillion dollar weapons deal .
The court of appeal 's ruling that the seizure by police of incriminating documents from Mr Zuma 's home and office was legal was expected to undermine his campaign as the favoured candidate to unseat Mr Mbeki as party leader at an ANC congress next month , and to become South Africa 's president in 2009 .
The court also said investigators could have access to papers about a meeting between Mr Zuma and a French arms company , Thint , at which it is alleged payment of a substantial bribe was discussed .
After today 's rulings , the former deputy president said he would seek leave to appeal to the supreme court .
Prosecutors said the rulings would allow them to finalise the case against Mr Zuma which follows the conviction of his financial advisor , Schabir Shaik , two years ago for bribing him on behalf of Thint .
The prosecution argued that the two had a "" generally corrupt "" relationship .
Mr Zuma and Thint were charged with corruption shortly afterwards but the case was dismissed a year ago on technicalities .
Today 's court ruling came six weeks before the ANC leadership election in which Mr Zuma , a former political prisoner on Robben Island alongside Nelson Mandela , appeared to be the only candidate capable of defeating Mr Mbeki .
Mr Mbeki is constitutionally barred from running again for president of the country in 18 months but there is no legal obstacle to him remaining leader of the ANC .
If he were to win next month 's party vote , he would probably be able to anoint his successor as South Africa 's president and he would have considerable influence in parliament because the party 's MP 's would be answerable to him .
But Mr Mbeki faces strong opposition within the party led by the trade union confederation and the Communist party , members of the ruling tripartite alliance with the ANC , because they are unhappy with the present government 's market - oriented economic policies .
They have thrown their weight behind Mr Zuma despite the corruption allegations that have dogged him for years .
He was South Africa 's deputy president until Mr Mbeki sacked him after Mr Shabir 's conviction , but he remains deputy leader of the ANC .
The two men 's relationship grew increasingly embittered as Mr Zuma 's supporters accused the presidency of pursuing the graft investigation to keep him from succeeding Mr Mbeki .
Andrew Feinstein , a former ANC MP who was blocked by the party leadership from completing a parliamentary investigation into corruption in the £ 2bn arms deal and has recently published a book about it , said that the allegations against Mr Zuma were not among the most serious involving the weapons contracts , but they did demonstrate the scale of the alleged graft .
"" If the alleged corruption by Mr Zuma is proven , it does show that all aspects of the deal are riddled with corruption , small and large , "" he said .
However , Mr Feinstein said that even if the ANC deputy leader was charged it would not necessarily be fatal to his bid for the presidency .
"" One would expect that if he was charged before December it would inhibit his challenge but it could add last minute momentum to his campaign .
It 's arguable that his campaign was its most strongest when he was under investigation before and he claimed that he was being targeted by the presidency .
I do think he 'll project himself again as the victim of the ANC establishment represented by Mbeki , "" he said .
Mr Zuma 's reputation was further damaged last year when he was tried for the rape of the 31-year - old daughter of a dead friend .
He was found not guilty but astounded many during the trial by admitting that he knew the woman was HIV - positive and that he did not use a condom but said that he had had a shower afterwards and believed that that would be enough to prevent infection .
At the time , Mr Zuma was head of South Africa 's national Aids council ."
2007-11-09,"The bitter power struggle between President Thabo Mbeki and his former deputy , Jacob Zuma , for control of the ruling African National Congress intensified yesterday when a South African court opened the way for Mr Zuma to be charged with corruption over a multi - billion dollar weapons deal .
The court of appeal 's ruling that the police seizure of allegedly incriminating documents from Mr Zuma 's home and office was legal was expected to undermine his campaign as the favoured candidate to unseat Mr Mbeki as party leader at an ANC congress next month and so become the country 's president in 2009 .
The court also said investigators could have access to papers about a meeting between Mr Zuma and a French arms company , Thint , at which the payment of a substantial bribe was allegedly discussed .
After yesterday 's rulings the former deputy president said he would seek leave to appeal to the supreme court .
Prosecutors said the rulings would allow them to finalise the case against Mr Zuma , which follows the conviction of his financial adviser , Schabir Shaik , two years ago for bribing him on behalf of Thint .
The court ruling comes six weeks before the ANC leadership election in which Mr Zuma , a former political prisoner on Robben Island alongside Nelson Mandela , appears to be the only candidate capable of defeating Mr Mbeki .
Mr Mbeki is constitutionally barred from running again for president of the country in 18 months ' time , but there is no legal obstacle to him remaining as the ANC 's leader .
If he were to win next month 's party vote he would probably be able to anoint his successor as South Africa 's president and would have considerable influence in parliament , because the party 's MPs would be answerable to him .
But Mr Mbeki faces strong opposition within the party , led by the trade union confederation and the Communist party , members of the ruling tripartite alliance with the ANC , because they are unhappy with the present government 's market - oriented economic policies .
They have thrown their weight behind Mr Zuma , despite the corruption allegations that have dogged him for years .
He was South Africa 's deputy president until Mr Mbeki sacked him after Mr Shabir 's conviction , but he remains the ANC 's deputy leader .

2007-11-25,"Lizzie Jandjies tucked herself tight into the top corner of Dan Qeqe stadium as she waited for presidential hopeful Jacob Zuma to arrive in the South African township of Zwide in the flat hinterlands of Port Elizabeth .
Beyond the stadium were houses of breeze block and corrugated iron ; homes that were an aspiration to the neatly dressed Jandjies .
Circumstances , she said , had led her from a childhood here to an ' informal settlement ' about 30 minutes ' drive away .
In Moeggefukkel pledges of mains water have been put off until 2012 and supplies ( 14p for 25 litres ) must be carried from nearby houses .
There is no electricity and the dark hours are terrifying . '
There is no protection , ' she said . '
Criminals come in the night , kick in the door , steal everything and sometimes kill . '
So Jandjies waited , not entirely patiently , for Zuma , the imposing Zulu populist .
She hopes that the hero of the struggle against apartheid , a man who in the past two years has faced rape and corruption charges and who entertains the crowd by singing awulethu ' mshini wami ' - ' get my machine gun ' - might hurry up what South Africans call ' development ' .
But as yet his private jet had failed to streak the blue above .
Jandjies may not share the wealth of South Africa 's English , Afrikaner , Indian and middle - class black and mixed race populations , but she does share , alongside their fear of crime , a desire for change , though not everyone feels Zuma is the right man .
On 16 December , delegates to the 52nd national conference of the African National Congress will meet in Polokwane , formerly Pietersburg , in the province of Limpopo .
There they will decide if President Thabo Mbeki should have a third term as president of the African National Congress ( ANC ) and , with it , power over the party 's MPs .
Polokwane is close enough to the border with Zimbabwe to offer delegates some cautionary guidance ( and Zimbabwean refugee waiters will no doubt be a further reminder ) .
For in South Africa 's fragmented society , it is common to hear citizens , as they watch the once great liberation movement begin to tear itself apart , raise the subject of Robert Mugabe 's descent into dictatorship .
As Siphiwe Zulu , an ANC branch chairman in Soweto , put it : ' There is a problem of African leaders who want to stay in office too long . '
Such views will cut Mbeki deeply .
He , after all , is the man who has tried to foster an African renaissance , overturning Western views of a continent predetermined to failure .
His supporters point out that he does not want to remain President after the 2009 elections - the constitution prohibits that - but only president of the party .
Mbeki - strategic , smart , with a love of poetry - is determined , so insiders say , not to cling to power but to see off his uneducated , militant and pugilistic old comrade Zuma , because he believes him to be unsuited to power .
Come midday at Dan Qeqe stadium , uplifted voices could be heard near the gate .
Down the path came 100 people , holding banners that read ' Thabo Mbeki , ANC president 2007 - 2012 ' .
They packed into the stand alongside the 1,500 Zuma supporters and sang ' Jacob Zuma is a criminal ' .
For the Eastern Cape is Mbeki country .
It was in Zwide 's hard - scrabble dirt that Mbeki 's father Govan , a hero of the struggle , was buried in 2001 .
By turning up , Zuma was sending a signal - that it was he , JZ , who carried lifelong Communist Govan Mbeki 's concern for South Africa 's poor .
Yet South Africa 's future does not rest solely on these two frontrunners .
Other names will be available to delegates in Polokwane : Zuma 's estranged wife , the Foreign Minister Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma , and the former Gauteng premier Tokyo Sexwale ( star of South Africa 's The Apprentice ) .
Most intriguing , in the shadows and as yet silent , is the trade unionist turned multimillionaire Cyril Ramaphosa . '
I do n't remember a time when the leadership was openly contested , ' said a senior unionist .
Such open conflict within the ANC is unknown and is proving hard for some to bear .
As I stood watching each side mock the other in the stand , an old man in a grey suit elbowed me in the ribs .
He could barely speak English , but was insistent with those words he had : ' One ANC .
Must stay together . '
There were tears in his eyes .
It was never going to be an easy job , replacing Nelson Mandela as President .
And Mbeki is , as one South African newspaper put it , ' a hard man to love ' .
It was n't always so .
In exile Mbeki would debate South Africa 's problems over bottles of fine single malt in hotels from Lusaka to Lagos , developing his belief in an African renaissance where ' our rebirth as a continent must [ begin ] with the rediscovery of our own soul ' .
Now , though , says his biographer Mark Gervisser , the dreams expressed in exile have had to be deferred by the realities of South Africa 's problems .
Mbeki 's war against those ' determined to prove everything in the anti - African stereotype ' is now focused on those who , for honourable reasons , criticise obvious cronyism and corruption .
He has opened himself to attack by expressing scepticism about the link between HIV and Aids , in part because he believes it plays to the Western view of Africans as , in his words , ' natural born , promiscuous carriers of germs ... doomed to inevitable mortal end because of our unconquerable devotion to the sins of lust ' .
It would take 800 South Africans dying every day of Aids before he made anti - retrovirals widely available .
And still he grumbles that the true cause is poverty , as Gervisser 's biography , released last week , reveals .
Meanwhile , his belief in an African renaissance has been tested against his loyalty to old friends .
He , all but alone in the ANC , was close to Mugabe during the battle with the late Ian Smith 's regime .
He has protected Jackie Selebi , the chief of police and South African head of Interpol , against charges of corruption , and he has failed to fire his alcoholic Health Minister , Manto Tshabalala Msimang , despite suggestions she used her influence to receive a new liver and the revelation that she once stole an anaesthetised patient 's watch .
Yet , set against this , Mbeki has presided over an economy that has grown by 5 per cent a year , where property prices have recovered after an initial white flight , where the Springboks once more brought home the rugby World Cup , where two million new homes have been built , and where the government 's Black Economic Empowerment scheme has established a black middle class . '
People see a lot of change , ' said Siphiwe Zulu , the ANC branch chairman in the Soweto neighbourhood of Zola ( which he described as containing ' the poorest of the poor , old ladies and old - timers ' ) . '
Most of the streets were without tar .
There were no street lights .
Now there is even a shopping mall . '
( Soweto also has a country club and its own chapter of the Hell 's Angels . )
A black elite has formed , led by Ramaphosa .
The former head of the National Union of Mineworkers stepped back from politics in the 1990s to , in the words of Richard Holbrooke , the former US ambassador to the UN , ' show the way to a generation of black South Africans who would gradually control the South African economy ' .
Through mining , media and a variety of other interests , he has become one of the richest men in the country .
Unsurprisingly , the organisations that the ANC is allied to - the Congress of South African Trade Unions , the South African Communist Party and the ANC 's own youth league - feel such wealth is n't trickling down fast enough . '
Black economic empowerment is enriching a very few , ' said Blade Nzimande , general secretary of the Communist Party . '
It is not even creating a black bourgeoisie , it is creating a small group of black people indebted to the capitalist class ...
A majority of Communist members would prefer Jacob Zuma . '
Apart from the convoy of black cars that rolled on to the rugby pitch , traffic cops stationed at the intersections and the phalanx of bodyguards , Zuma struck a modest note when he finally turned up at Dan Qeqe six hours late .
He told the crowd - once the Mbeki supporters stopped singing - that the ANC needed a strong leader , and then he promised to support whoever was chosen .
Even more than dissent , the ANC dislikes the smell of ambition .
Just before Zuma pulled in , another figure had appeared at my side .
Thylani Grootboom , an Mbeki supporter , wanted something understood , reinforcing his point with a jabbing finger : ' Campaigning for yourself , it 's against the culture of the ANC . '
Zuma 's weakness in the run - up to the Polokwane conference is the sense , increasingly pervasive , that he is putting himself forward too much .
Born eight days apart from Mbeki , Zuma did not come from anti - apartheid royalty .
He was raised by his widowed mother who worked as a domestic .
He showed immense courage as head of the underground in KwaZulu Natal and an intelligence that negated his lack of a formal education .
Gervisser says that he is ' fearless , affable and loyal ' .
As with all the potential candidates , it is impossible to extract a policy , because policies are supposed to be the preserve of the party itself .
Instead there is character .
In 1994 Zuma managed to convince Mandela that Mbeki would be a better deputy than Ramaphosa , yet as time passed Mbeki has increasingly believed that Zuma lacks the judgment for top office .
He believes , according to Gervisser , that a Zuma presidency would destroy his dream of renaissance .
Certainly Zuma has had his difficulties .
The charge of raping a 31-year - old family friend was dropped , but he hardly delighted doctors when he shrugged off the unprotected sex ( he knew she was HIV positive ) by saying that the shower he took afterwards ' would minimise the risk of contracting the disease ' .
He led the National Aids Council at the time .
Charges of corruption may prove trickier yet .
A £ 4bn arms purchase of ( among other weaponry ) fighters , corvettes and submarines from European companies ( among them BAE Systems ) has poisoned the South African political pool .
Zuma has been accused of taking payments .
Whether this derails him remains to be seen .
Andrew Feinstein was the senior ANC MP on a parliamentary committee that looked into allegations surrounding the arms deal and he has just published a book , After the Party , that offers a rare insight into the ANC 's methods . '
Mbeki has far more to lose from a thorough investigation than Zuma , ' he said . '
Zuma 's misdemeanours were relatively small , amounting to a payment of 500,000 rand ( £ 35,000 ) to protect a French arms company from any investigation , while Mbeki either directly solicited , or condoned soliciting , money for the ANC in return for contracts . '
In other words , Zuma can make Mbeki 's life very difficult in court .
From a new life in London , Feinstein laments what has ' become of [ a ] once proud organisation ' .
The ANC , he writes , is no longer driven by ' lofty ideals but by issues of personality , power and patronage ' .
Mbeki clings to power in the hope he can use patronage to deliver someone he trusts into the presidency in 2009 .
Zuma grasps for power through the force of his personality .
Meanwhile , Ramaphosa denies wanting the job but does just enough to stay in the running , waiting to be drafted as a compromise .
Attempting to guess who will be leader of the ANC in a month 's time would be foolish .
Branches are currently choosing delegates for the trip to Polokwane and telling them who to vote for but when the moment comes , the votes are secret . '
Some people are behaving as if the world is coming to an end on 16 December , ' said Nzimande . '
People are being offered jobs , money is going round . '
Meanwhile , crime grows worse .
Last week was , apparently , the beginning of the ' heist season ' .
It is now too dangerous to walk up Table Mountain .
And the online crime page of South Africa 's Independent newspaper ( iol.co.za ) provides the chattering classes with a deepening well of the blackest humour .
Lizzie Jandjies had often chuckled as we waited for Zuma , but not at levels of crime .
As the populist 's convoy swept away from Zwide , she prepared for the journey back to her house without electricity , water or a door to stop a determined boot .
She was , she said , pleased that the rival supporters had been satisfied with trading songs of disdain : ' I 'm just glad it did n't become violent . '
Rivals for power Thabo Mbeki , 65 Intellectual who spent the apartheid years in exile , he was widely distrusted by colleagues .

2007-12-03,"President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa may be forced to call a general election if he loses the leadership of the African National Congress to the party 's deputy president , Jacob Zuma - or face a vote of no confidence in parliament , it was reported yesterday .
The ANC will choose a new leader at the party 's conference on December 16 - 20 .
Analysts say Mbeki , who is not allowed to run for a third term as state president , wants to remain head of the ANC to influence the country 's politics and help pick his successor .
Although Zuma is facing trial on corruption charges after recently beating rape charges , Mbeki has lost substantial ground to him in the race for the party 's leadership .
If Zuma wins he is almost certain to become South Africa 's next president in elections due in 2009 .
Zuma 's lead in the ANC contest offers the prospect of the country being run by two competing presidents - a party president and a state president .
In an interview published yesterday in the Sunday Independent newspaper , Mbeki insisted he would not become a lame duck president .
Asked specifically about the possibility of a general election , he was quoted as saying : "" I have not thought about that one .
We have n't got there yet .
I do n't know .
It 's possible .
It 's possible , yes indeed . ""
The Sunday Times in Johannesburg said the Zuma camp planned to oust Mbeki with a vote of no confidence if he refused to call a general election .
The party goes into this month 's conference deeply split over Mbeki 's policies .
He has helped sustain an economic boom but is accused of promoting a culture of cronyism and of using state institutions to purge opponents .
He denies this .
The rivalry between Mbeki and Zuma has plunged the ANC into one of the worst crises in its history and overshadowed efforts to fight crime , Aids and poverty .
Zuma was South Africa 's deputy president for six years before Mbeki sacked him in 2005 after he was implicated in a corruption trial .
That case was thrown out on a technicality , but a court ruling this month allowed prosecutors to recharge Zuma .
He was acquitted of rape charges in a separate case .
Despite controversy that has hurt his reputation , Zuma has made a dramatic comeback , maintaining wide support from the trade unions , who accuse Mbeki of helping big business and neglecting the poor .
But the graft case , involving kickbacks for an arms deal , still hangs over him ."
2007-12-14,"President Thabo Mbeki is facing humiliating defeat in his attempt to remain leader of the ruling African National Congress by the man he sacked as South Africa 's deputy president , Jacob Zuma , ahead of the party 's conference which opens on Sunday .
In the most significant political upheaval since the ANC won power with the collapse of apartheid in 1994 , Zuma has put together a seemingly unassailable coalition from the party 's left wing and other factions that want get rid of Mbeki .
The often bitter and sometimes dirty leadership race has divided the party and the country .
Mbeki had fought hard to retain control of the ANC even after he is constitutionally obliged to step down as South Africa 's president in 2009 .
But support for him has collapsed in recent weeks as his authoritarian style , market oriented economic policies and controversial positions on Aids and Zimbabwe took their toll .
However , Zuma , 60 , can not count on becoming the country 's next president even though normally the ANC leader would be a near certainty to be the party 's candidate and thus win the general election .
Prosecutors are deciding whether to charge Zuma with corruption over a £ 4bn weapons deal , which would most likely derail his presidential bid .
His financial advisor , Schabir Shaik , is serving a 15-year jail sentence for facilitating bribes to Zuma from an arms company .
Mbeki sacked Zuma as deputy president when they came to light .
Some of Zuma 's critics have accused him of seeking the presidency in order to forestall a prosecution .
That accusation has been given added weight by talk within the Zuma campaign of trying to push Mbeki from office and engineer an early general election .
Such a move would take a vote in parliament , and it is not clear if Zuma could muster a majority of ANC MPs .
If not , power would be divided between Mbeki as president and Zuma as ANC leader for the next 18 months , extending the struggle that has split the party like at no other time since 1994 .
The contest has grown increasingly bitter and controversial with both camps accusing the other of buying votes with job offers and cash .
Mbeki has attacked Zuma as unfit for office because of the corruption allegations and his trial last year for rape .
Zuma was acquitted but drew widespread criticism when he admitted to unprotected sex with a young family friend who he knew was HIV positive .
Zuma said he took a shower instead of using a condom , prompting outrage among Aids campaigners given that he was , at the time , head of the country 's National Aids Council .
Last week , Mbeki said he approved of a statement by the former archbishop of Cape Town , Desmond Tutu , who said that the ANC "" must not elect someone who the country will be ashamed of "" .
Zuma responded by attacking Mbeki for centralising power and exercising undue influence over the judiciary and parliament , also criticising the vast gap that continues to exist in South Africa between those who live in "" grinding poverty "" and the "" rolling opulence "" of the rich .
He also took a dig at Mbeki 's policy of "" quiet diplomacy "" in Zimbabwe . ""
When history eventually deals with the dictators , those who stood by and watched the deterioration of nations should bear the consequences , "" Zuma said in a speech this week .
Mbeki told the Mail and Guardian newspaper in Johannesburg that he has never known such acrimony within the ANC , and rejected charges that people within the party are afraid of him . ""
Do I look as if I 've got horns ?
It 's said that I block and inhibit open discussion
- that 's puzzling to me , it 's completely untrue , "" he said .
Zuma has received about 60 % of the nominations from the ANC 's branches , which will decide the race .
He has also won the backing of the unions , the party 's women 's and youth leagues , and of Tokyo Sexwale , a billionaire businessman who pulled out of the race and brought his supporters to Zuma 's camp .
Zuma , a populist who has at times declared himself a socialist , has been working hard to shore up the confidence of businessmen at home and abroad who fear that his populist rhetoric and backing from the unions and Communist party will lead to a shift away from Mbeki 's market - based economic policies ."

But Mbeki appears to have squandered that advantage through his manipulation of power to pursue his critics while protecting allies accused of corruption ."
2007-12-17,"All indications are that Jacob Zuma will emerge today as the new president of the African National Congress , elected by delegates gathered here at Polokwane , Limpopo Province , South Africa .
Former president Nelson Mandela 's message to the conference emphasised the need for unity and for the leadership battle to be conducted with decorum and discipline .
But as Steven Friedman described here earlier , decorum and discipline have been in short supply .
It is sweltering hot despite torrential rain at times , but the temperature among the delegates is higher .
The radio phone - in programmes are jammed with Zuma supporters denouncing Mbeki and the other ANC leaders for having "" forgotten "" them ; with demands for "" working - class leadership "" and "" the socialist revolution now "" .
Partly , this is a reflection of Zuma 's working - class status and the fact that ordinary Africans find him vastly more approachable than the aloof , arrogant Mbeki , but the phone - in chorus sounds organised .
It is a fairly safe bet that the well - organised SACP ( Communist party ) has got its activists lined up to flood the radio stations with calls .
It is precisely their role in the coalition behind Zuma that creates such vast uneasiness in business circles and poses such questions about future policy under Zuma .
Zuma is a genial and congenial man , temperamentally always ready to compromise for the sake of unity and consensus , but the problem is that neither he nor , a fortiori , his key advisers , trust the Mbeki - ites one inch .
And it is hard to see why they should .
On Sunday , as the conference opened , the pro - Mbeki the Weekender led with a story of how the special police unit , the Scorpions , had unearthed yet further damning evidence against Zuma and were considering a whole new set of corruption charges .
Over and over again , the Weekender has carried leaks from Mbeki 's office and this was , without doubt , another one .
Yet Zuma has been under investigation for over seven years .
Quite a coincidence that this new breakthrough in the case should come out exactly on the right day to try to influence conference delegates .
This sort of manipulation of the police , the state Department for Public Prosecutions and the media in order to damage opponents with smears that will probably not be backed up with evidence , is entirely typical of the Mbeki style .
Yet , he professes wide - eyed astonishment that anyone could think that he would ever do such a thing ...
For the Zuma - ites , the message is clear : to leave Mbeki in any position of authority - including that of state president - is to risk endless further such attempts to damage them .
At the very least , to secure such a deal , Mbeki would have to give a guarantee that all such underhand methods of political warfare would stop .
This seems highly unlikely .
Such a guarantee would be tantamount to an admission that he has indeed been guilty of such manipulation in the past - and this kind of manipulation seems second nature to Mbeki .
There 's a real question of whether he could stop even if he wanted to .
Voting has to take place on the leadership positions within the next six hours or so .
Tension could hardly be greater .
Latest word was that senior ANC leaders were locked in last - minute negotiations aimed at trying to give sitting president Thabo Mbeki the party 's chairmanship as a consolation prize and so as not to humiliate him completely .
It is possible this comes too late : the Zuma - ites have the majority and the bit between their teeth , and there seems little doubt that their supporters will vote a straight list of Zuma - ites for all the six top jobs ( president , deputy - president , chairman , treasurer - general , secretary - general and assistant secretary - general ) .
But what the Mbeki - ites have to bargain with is the fact that if Zuma simply evicts Mbeki and all his followers , he could take over a mortally disunited party .
This piece was corrected for a factual error ( the Weekender , instead of the Sunday Independent newspaper ) at the request of the author at 16:45 on December 17 ."
2007-12-17,"Delegates in South Africa 's ruling African National Congress met in closed session today ahead of a delayed vote in the party 's most bitter leadership election since it came to power .
Supporters of president Thabo Mbeki 's arch - rival , Jacob Zuma , continued to dominate the conference .
The conference chairman and defence minister , Mosiuoa Lekota , struggled to be heard above the chanting of Zuma supporters during this morning 's session .
It is still not clear whether the results of the leadership contest will be known today , as the conference programme is running behind schedule .
Delegates were scheduled to vote yesterday but the opening proceedings took longer than expected after Zuma 's supporters objected to an electronic count of the vote on the grounds that it could be rigged .
ANC spokesman Smuts Ngonyama said the nomination process for the election could take place this afternoon , but only after "" the issue of [ vote ] counting is truly acceptable to everyone "" .
Mbeki was jeered and humiliated yesterday as he made a last - ditch attempt to retain control of the ANC .
More than half of the 4,000 delegates were on their feet singing for Zuma and demanding that Mbeki go .
The president 's supporters mostly sat in glum silence , apparently no longer able to muster the belief that their man can keep control of the party .
Mbeki is constitutionally obliged to step down as South Africa 's president at the 2009 general election , but there is no legal obstacle to him remaining as party leader , which would give him considerable sway over who the ANC chooses as its presidential candidate .
Some of Zuma 's support is drawn from those in the party who say Mbeki has centralised and misused power , and that it would be damaging to democracy for him to stay on .
Mbeki opened the conference with a speech that mixed what he regards as his achievements in running a stable economy and poverty alleviation with thinly veiled attacks on Zuma , who is likely to face corruption charges for allegedly accepting bribes from a French arms company .
Mbeki alluded to the accusations by suggesting that the ANC has "" gravitated away from its moral axis "" and calling for a leadership "" seized by ethical fervour "" .
Mbeki condemned "" patronage and lust for power "" which drew derision from some of his opponents , who accuse him of both .
There were jeers when he denied centralising power or abusing his office to pursue opponents .
But the clearest sign of his waning power came immediately after the speech when the audience erupted at the mention of Zuma 's name and sang and danced in support of their candidate .
Mbeki sat stunned on the podium and the party leadership made a futile effort to stop the show of support for Zuma .
In a show of disrespect unusual in the ANC , delegates also booed some of Mbeki 's closest allies as they arrived .
But while Zuma had the upper hand at the conference , he was under renewed pressure over corruption allegations after the South African Broadcasting Corporation revealed that prosecutors had submitted an affidavit to the constitutional court alleging that as South Africa 's deputy president he took payments totalling 4 m rand ( £ 285,000 ) over 10 years from a French weapons company .
Zuma has asked the court to invalidate search warrants used to seize documents central to the investigation .
If he loses that case , he is likely to face corruption charges that would probably block his attempts to become the country 's next president .
But Zuma 's supporters said that the timing of the revelations and the source , because the SABC is widely viewed as an Mbeki mouthpiece , showed that they were politically motivated . ""
Allegations do n't mean the man is guilty until the court says the person is guilty , "" Zuma told the SABC .
"" If I 'm taken to court and the judge says ' Zuma , we find you guilty ' , as I walk out of court I will say to the ANC ' I 'm stepping down ' . """
2007-12-17,"Thabo Mebeki or Jacob Zuma ?
Many South African journalists and bloggers are unimpressed by these two very different candidates fighting for leadership of the ANC at the party 's conference in Polokwane .
"" What a grim choice , "" writes Andrew Kenny in the Citizen .
"" The prospect of Mbeki 's continued racial obsessions , mad ideas on Aids , support for Mugabe and conspiracy mania makes the heart sink .
If I were forced to choose , I 'd choose Zuma .
But he also seems to support Mugabe and , unlike Mbeki , might start taking us down the Zimbabwe road . ""
A friend of Peter Bruce in Business Day also does n't like either candidate .
He reckons "" the best outcome for the country would be Thabo Mbeki losing and Jacob Zuma being found guilty on corruption charges after a gruelling trial a few months later .
Then neither could run the country "" .
But Bruce himself reckons there is little doubt that Zuma will be elected leader and then become president .
"" I hope Zuma appreciates what an awesome society he is inheriting from Mbeki .
I wonder if he 'll continue suing newspapers and cartoonists if he wins .
There 's a streak of intolerance and even cruelty behind the cheerful Zuma exterior that we have yet fully to appreciate . ""
Charlene Smith , on the Mail and Guardian 's Thought Leader comment site , says it will be remarkable if Mbeki wins .
"" If he does , I do not want to be in Polokwane , because it is a decision that will not be believed either there or in other parts of the country .
If he loses , history will commend him if he calls an early national election and goes with dignity .
He has made so many enemies that it is hard to see what post he could assume here or internationally . ""
Blogger Pierre de Vos on Constitutionally Speaking reckons
Mbeki appears "" baffled and out of touch with reality "" .
Discussing a rare interview with Mbeki , De Vose says : "" It seems absurd for the president now to feign hurt and confusion when he acted in so many ways to bully or humiliate his opponents ...
What about Archbishop Tutu who was vilified and in effect called a coconut creation of the white media when he criticised Mbeki ? ""
Martin Williams , acting editor of the Citizen , claims there is ironic justice in Mbeki being undone by the populist Zuma . ""
Analyse Zuma 's speeches .
He says very little of substance but he 's a master demagogue .
The masses love him .
And Mbeki is genuinely bewildered , "" he writes .
Meanwhile , live - blogging at the conference in Polokwane , Ndumiso Ngcobu is bored by Mbeki 's droning speeches .
"" Is this guy trying to get as many people as possible not to vote for him ? "" he asks .
Dominic Mahlangu for South Africa 's the Times reports shock at the irreverent booing that has greeted Mbeki and his cabinet .
Juanita for Inside IOL captures the chaotic nature of the conference and the uncertainty about when the result will be be known .
There are even rumours that votes wo n't be counted until Friday .
It 's all an example of democracy gone wrong , according to Wired Gecko .
He writes : "" If anything the ANC leadership race is a good illustration of where democracy can be more harmful than beneficial .
Take a party with a huge majority in parliament , throw in a leadership race between an incumbent who has n't fulfilled his potential and a disgraced challenger who has tremendous popular support and we have a recipe for disaster and there is nothing we can do to stop it .
All we really can do is watch it happen , like watching an accident about to occur . ""
But academic Steven Friedman on Thought Leader says the rowdiness at the conference is healthy . ""
Yes , things were a little rough at times , but no more so than at any vigorous , democratic meeting where a great deal is at stake ...
The fact that this is the first ANC conference since its unbanning in 1990 where delegates challenged decisions from the floor does not show what is at wrong at Polokwane - it shows what has been wrong at all the other meetings . """
2007-12-17,"The South African president , Thabo Mbeki , was jeered and humiliated yesterday as he made a last - ditch attempt to retain control of the ruling African National Congress in the party 's most bitter leadership election since it came to power 13 years ago .
Supporters of Mbeki 's arch - rival , Jacob Zuma , dominated the opening of the ANC conference , exuding confidence that victory was certain as more than half of the 4,000 delegates were on their feet singing for Zuma and demanding that Mbeki go .
The president 's supporters mostly sat in glum silence , apparently no longer able to muster the belief that their man can keep control of the party .
Delegates were scheduled to vote yesterday evening and a result was expected today .
But the divisions in the party were evident as soon as the conference opened , when Zuma 's supporters objected to an electronic count of the vote on the grounds that it could be rigged .
Mbeki is constitutionally obliged to step down as South Africa 's president at the 2009 general election but there is no legal obstacle to him remaining party leader , which would give him considerable sway over who the ANC chose as its presidential candidate .
Some of Zuma 's support is drawn from those in the party who say Mbeki has centralised and misused power , and that it would be damaging to democracy for him to stay on .
Mbeki opened the conference with a speech that mixed what he regards as his achievements in running a stable economy and poverty alleviation with thinly veiled attacks on Zuma , who is likely to face corruption charges for allegedly accepting bribes from a French arms company .
Mbeki alluded to the accusations by suggesting that the ANC has "" gravitated away from its moral axis "" and calling for a leadership "" seized by ethical fervour "" .
Mbeki condemned "" patronage and lust for power "" which drew derision from some of his opponents , who accuse him of both .
There were jeers when he denied centralising power or abusing his office to pursue opponents .
But the clearest sign of his waning power came immediately after the speech when the audience erupted at the mention of Zuma 's name and sang and danced in support of their candidate .
Mbeki sat stunned on the podium and the party leadership made a futile effort to stop the show of support for Zuma .
In a show of disrespect unusual in the ANC , delegates also booed some of Mbeki 's closest allies as they arrived .
But while Zuma had the upper hand at the conference , he was under renewed pressure over corruption allegations after the South African Broadcasting Corporation revealed that prosecutors had submitted an affidavit to the constitutional court alleging that as South Africa 's deputy president he took payments totalling 4 m rand ( £ 285,000 ) over 10 years from a French weapons company .

2007-12-18,"South Africa 's ruling African National Congress today elected the controversial Jacob Zuma as its new leader , handing the president , Thabo Mbeki , a humiliating defeat .
Zuma polled 60.6 % of the votes ( 2,329 ) , while Mbeki received 1,505 votes , with eight ballot papers spoiled and one abstention .
Zuma 's supporters had been preparing for the predicted victory all day , ordering in crates of beer and carrying T - shirts in support of their man - garments that had been banned from the conference .
He will now expect to be nominated as the ANC 's candidate for president in the 2009 general election , with Mbeki reduced to a lame duck for his remaining time in power .
But Zuma 's progression to the presidency could be upset by a corruption investigation into a multi - million pound arms deal , which prosecutors say is likely to result in charges .
Mbeki is barred by the constitution from seeking a third term as South Africa 's president , but if he remained as party leader , he would have had influence over the party 's choice of candidate .
The populist Zumu , an ethnic Zulu , has won over millions of black South Africans who have seen little improvement in their lives during post - apartheid rule , and who call his promised sweeping reforms the ' Zunami ' .
He is also backed by trade unions and the Communist party .
But the former Archbishop of Cape Town , Desmond Tutu , had urged voters not to elect Zuma , and business leaders said it would be "" a calamity "" if he won , fearing that as president he would introduce left wing reforms .
Voting was delayed for three hours today by computer problems , after being postponed for two days by demands from the Zuma camp for a manual count of the ballots because it said computers were unreliable and susceptible to rigging .
Zuma , who rose to the post of head of intelligence in the ANC 's military wing , earned notoriety when he was put on trial last year for the rape of the 31-year - old daughter of a family friend .
Although he was acquitted , he provoked outrage when he told the court he saw little risk in having unprotected sex with the HIV - positive Aids activist because he had showered afterwards ."
2007-12-18,"There comes a moment in each politician 's career when they realise that their time is up .
That moment came for Thabo Mbeki on Sunday night .
After listening for two and a half hours to his otiose pleas for unity , delegates at the ANC national conference erupted in a frenzy of support for his arch - rival Jacob Zuma .
The defiance of the rank and file was a calculated act of humiliation for the man who always behaved as if he were their born leader .
The sight of 4,000 delegates singing the Zuma theme song "" Bring me my machine gun "" brought the president close to tears .
Attempts by Mbeki loyalists to end his nightmare went unheeded .
These scenes were unprecedented for a former underground movement which prided itself in its discipline and collective displays of loyalty .
If the ANC 's message was brutal , it was also necessary and in its way democratic .
The party was saying it had grown tired of the president 's arrogance , his aloofness , the way he centralised power , surrounded himself with a small clique of boyars and alienated himself from the grassroots .
As one delegate put it , Mbeki won the government but lost the party .
Mr Mbeki may have lost his bid to be re - elected leader of his party .
His power to influence the party 's choice of candidate for the presidential elections has declined , if not withered , as a result .
But neither mean that Mr Zuma is a shoo - in as South Africa 's next president .
True , it is quite a comeback for the man who only last year was acquitted of raping a family friend .
But not all the anti - Mbeki feeling swirling around the marquee in the grounds of the University of Limpopo is automatically pro - Zuma .
Mr Zuma may be a device for getting rid of Mr Mbeki , but once deployed , a section of his vote will want to have another look at the man it nominates as presidential candidate .
Mr Zuma will enjoy substantial powers of patronage as party leader , not least over the ANC 's MPs in parliament , who could bring forward the date of the presidential elections .
But Mr Mbeki remains the country 's president until 2009 and will want to hang on to every minute of his expiring mandate .
It gives him enough time to revive corruption charges against Mr Zuma , which are being considered by the National Prosecuting Authority .
The only question is which comes first : the election or the next trial .
Zuma loyalists began yesterday to play down the differences between a Mbeki and a Zuma presidency .
And it is true that , despite the contrasts between the character and education of both men , they may not be that different in policy .
Mr Zuma , backed by trade unions and the communist party , will worry market analysts .
But even if Mr Zuma as president paid more than lip service to re - distribution , South Africa would remain a market economy .
Its policies on Aids might get tougher .
Mr Zuma has called for Aids and crime to be treated as national emergencies , even though his personal habits may fall short of this goal .
He testified at his trial that he had unprotected sex with an HIV - positive woman and then took a shower in the belief that it would protect him from the virus .
A Zuma presidency - with its links to trade unions - might be less tolerant of Robert Mugabe 's tyranny in Zimbabwe .
That , for the moment , is for the future .
The ANC still has to navigate its way through the uncharted waters of a bitter split in its ranks .
Even if Mr Zuma manages to shrug off corruption charges , South Africa deserves a better choice than a dubious populist as its leader .
Mr Zuma has shown he can whip up a frenzy of support .
That is a long way from being able to give his country the leadership it deserves .
The first two presidents of a free South Africa have seen their country grow richer and stronger - if not fairer .
South Africa 's choice of its third will shape a continent whose hopes and potential have repeatedly been destroyed by bad leadership of the sort Jacob Zuma appears to offer .
· This article was amended on Monday December 24 2007 .
When we said that the ANC still had to navigate its way through "" unchartered "" waters we meant to say "" uncharted "" .
This has been corrected ."
2007-12-18,"The ruling African National Congress is finally expected to elect its next leader today after days of bitter wrangling between rival factions in support of President Thabo Mbeki and his arch rival , Jacob Zuma , over the conduct of the vote .
Zuma 's supporters , confident that their man will sweep to victory , rowdily disrupted and dominated the ANC five - yearly conference for a second day by dancing and singing his trademark song - Bring Me
My Machine Gun - while Mbeki 's delegates fought back by chanting the president 's name .
Both sides also held large rallies outside the meeting .
On Sunday , Zuma 's supporters humiliated Mbeki by jeering parts of his opening speech and some senior party officials .
Smuts Ngonyama , the ANC spokesman , characterised the meeting as a "" very vibrant conference "" .
"" The behaviour of some people is completely foreign to the culture of the ANC , "" he said .
Others said that rivalries between the two camps , which have deepened since Mbeki sacked Zuma as the country 's deputy president two years ago over corruption allegations , have worsened .
Mluleki George , the deputy defence minister and an Mbeki supporter , accused Zuma 's delegates of threatening their opponents .
"" When we came here , we thought there would be discipline , but intimidation is beginning to affect our people , "" he said .
The postponement of the ballot , which was scheduled to be held on Sunday , reflected the breakdown of trust within South Africa 's ruling party amid the most significant political upheaval since the ANC won power with the collapse of apartheid in 1994 .
If Zuma wins the party leadership he would normally expect to be nominated as the ANC 's candidate for president in the 2009 general election but that could be upset by a corruption investigation prosecutors say is likely to result in charges .
Mbeki is barred by the constitution from seeking a third term as South Africa 's president but if he remained party leader he would have influence over who was the party 's candidate .
The ANC leadership ballot was delayed after Zuma 's camp demanded that all votes for the party 's leader and national executive be manually counted because of its suspicion that a computer count is vulnerable to rigging .
Mbeki 's aides accused Zuma of opposing an electronic count because it would expose illegitimate voting by delegates not entitled to cast a ballot .
Yesterday , 96 delegates from Gauteng province , mostly Zuma supporters , were disqualified from the voting roll of about 4,000 delegates .
Some senior ANC members said they believed the outcome of the vote will be closer than Mbeki 's opponents predict .
The upheaval in the conference has brought the ANC secretary general , Kgalema Motlanthe , to the fore as a leading contender to be Zuma 's deputy president after he had to step in to stop hundreds of delegates from jeering the conference chairman , Mosiuoa "" Terror "" Lekota .
That would position him to take over party leadership and become its presidential candidate in 2009 if , as seems likely , Zuma is indicted for allegedly accepting bribes from a French arms company .
It has not gone unnoticed at the conference that it was Motlanthe who set off the most humiliating moment for Mbeki when the secretary general said "" Viva JZ "" after the president 's speech and sent Zuma 's supporters into a frenzy of songs and dancing ."
2007-12-18,"Jacob Zuma and his supporters are today preparing to celebrate an expected victory against the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , in a bitter battle for leadership of the ANC amid reports that Mbeki 's colleagues tried to persuade him to withdraw from the contest to avoid humiliation .
As delegates finally began voting today at the ANC 's conference in Polokwane , the Zuma camp is understood to have ordered hundreds of crates of beer for a planned victory party .
But it is still unclear whether the votes of up to 4,000 delegates will be completed by the end of the day .
The Zuma - supporting ANC Youth League has demanded that votes be counted manually instead of electronically because of suspicions of vote - rigging .
A row about the voting process delayed the conference , which is running two days behind schedule .
Meanwhile , the Times newspaper of South Africa claimed today that ANC officials , including the director general Frank Chikane , advised Mbeki to bow out of the race to avoid an embarrassing defeat in the poll . ""
The reality is that the tsunami is unstoppable , "" Zuma supporter Jappie Mateis said after voting , referring to the tidal wave of support for his candidate , popularly called the "" Zunami "" .
But the Mbeki camp remained defiantly optimistic in face of vocal support for Zuma at the conference .
Thami Ntshawuzana , from Mbeki 's stronghold in Eastern Cape province , said : "" We are confident .
We 've done our numbers and we are going to win . ""

2007-12-18,"The ruling African National Congress finally held its leadership election today , with the populist but controversial Jacob Zuma widely predicted to hand President Thabo Mbeki a humiliating defeat .
Party officials said the count of the ballots cast by the 4,000 delegates to the ANC 's national conference was expected to be completed in the evening .
Zuma 's supporters were already preparing for victory , ordering in crates of beer and carrying T - shirts in support of their man - garments that have been banned so far from the conference .
But the Mbeki camp said it was still confident of winning despite a report in the South African press that some of his closest aides had advised him to pull out of the race to avoid an embarrassing defeat .
Zuma 's arrival at voting station was met with wild applause , while some of Mbeki 's cabinet ministers were heckled .
One of the voting delegates , Jim Mkandawire , said he had no doubt about a Zuma victory .
"" We have done it , as we have been saying all along .
Zuma is an unstoppable tsunami , "" he said .
"" I love Mbeki but believe that politics in the ANC is like a relay .
He has to hand over the stick to another person . ""
Jane Mathe said after voting that it was time for change .
"" I 'm happy that the long wait is over , "" she said .
This is the last kicks of a dying horse . ""
But the deputy defence minister , Mluleki George , said Mbeki could still win .
"" The moment of truth has arrived ...
We are confident we will pull out the victory , "" he said .
A Johannesburg newspaper , the Times , reported on Tuesday that Mbeki had rejected advice from ANC officials to withdraw from the leadership race in order to avoid the humiliation of "" an overwhelming victory "" for Zuma .
The paper reported that members of the ANC 's national executive committee told Mbeki "" that he should consider pulling out of the race because of the open hostility directed at him by most of the delegates on the first day of the party 's national conference "" .
Among those who advised Mbeki to stand down was his director general , Frank Chikane , whom the paper quoted as telling the president : "" The writing is on the wall .
You can see the mood . ""
The conference has proved a long humiliation for Mbeki , who has at times been jeered and subjected to dancing and singing in support of Zuma .
The usual deference shown to the president fell away as the political energy on the conference floor swung behind his opponent while Mbeki 's supporters sat sullen and seemingly unable to muster the belief that their own man could win .
One indication of how things may go came with a vote by delegates on Monday to throw out Mbeki 's proposal to amend the ANC 's constitution for equal numbers of men and women in the top positions in the party .
Zuma 's camp saw that as a ploy to defeat his male - dominated list .
Voting was delayed for three hours today by computer problems , after being postponed for two days by demands from the Zuma camp for a manual count of the ballots because it said computers were unreliable and susceptible to rigging .
If Zuma wins the party leadership , he would normally expect to be nominated as the ANC 's candidate for president in the 2009 general election , but that could be upset by a corruption investigation , which prosecutors say is likely to result in charges .
Mbeki is barred by the constitution from seeking a third term as South Africa 's president , but if he remained as party leader , he would have influence over the party 's choice of candidate ."
2007-12-19,"Whatever else is said about Jacob Zuma - the man who thought a shower prevented HIV infection , and who said that a woman he was accused of raping asked for sex because of the way she was dressed - no one is underestimating his political prowess any more .
Two years ago , Zuma , 65 , was widely written off after President Thabo Mbeki sacked him as South Africa 's deputy president over corruption allegations .
He was acquitted at the rape trial but his views on Aids and women seemed to do nothing for his standing .
But Zuma has worked his way back to defeat Mbeki for control of the ANC , and have a shot at becoming South Africa 's next president , by connecting with ordinary voters , a large part of the ruling party 's base and the trade unions in a way that Mbeki has never been able to .
Zuma joined the ANC at 17 , and then its military wing , Umkhonto we Sizwe ( MK ) .
He was arrested by the apartheid - era police and jailed for 10 years on Robben Island alongside Nelson Mandela .
On his release he fled South Africa for Swaziland and Mozambique where he rose to become head of MK 's intelligence branch .
He returned home shortly after the ANC was unbanned in 1990 .
The contrasts with Mbeki have been important in Zuma 's comeback .
He lacks formal education and the outgoing president 's intellect , but does not want for confidence .
He is comfortable not only in his own skin but wearing a leopard 's while wielding a ceremonial stick .
Mbeki rarely wears traditional dress and is so obsessed with race that some have speculated about an inferiority complex .
Zuma 's opponents have painted him as a leftwing firebrand .
He has embraced the trade unions , which have condemned Mbeki 's market - oriented economics .
He has appeared at a Communist party meeting wearing a cowboy hat with a hammer and sickle badge .
However , he has studiously avoided economic policy statements and pointed out that it is the party that decides financial strategy not one man .
In recent weeks , Zuma has flown to the US and Europe to reassure foreign investors there will not be dramatic economic policy changes .
But there is a strong chance that Zuma 's fightback could be for nothing .
The corruption allegations against him - that he took bribes from an arms company - are serious and extensive .
If he is charged , many of his backers in the ANC will quickly pull away .
A conviction would probably spell the end of the comeback for good ."
2007-12-19,"Jacob Zuma , the Teflon politician of South Africa , has performed one of the most stunning comebacks in the country 's history .
Despite having been sacked by Thabo Mbeki in 2005 for alleged corruption , remaining the target of an ongoing corruption investigation , and having faced accusations of rape , he yesterday swept to the leadership of the ruling African National Congress , defeating the incumbent , President Mbeki .
Zuma 's challenge is to keep the deeply divided ANC together , while delivering on his promises to a disparate and expectant support base .
As if this were not enough , he will have to convince South Africa 's anxious establishment - black and white - that his Lazarus - like rise does not herald the apocalypse .
What is obvious from the fractious party conference is that Africa 's oldest and most respected liberation movement is split into two camps .
Even Nelson Mandela , who did not attend , felt compelled to send a message to delegates saying he was ashamed of the infighting in the movement , for whose ideals he went to prison for 27 years .
Archbishop Desmond Tutu pleaded with delegates not to vote for someone who will embarrass the country .
The scale of the internal conflict made it impossible for a compromise candidate to emerge .
A younger , more dynamic generation of ANC leaders , proposing radical change to outdated traditions , were too much for many ANC apparatchiks .
At a time when South Africa is crying out for democratic renewal , an overhaul of stagnant political culture and institutions , and fresh ideas in the face of poverty , unemployment and inequality , this conservatism has potentially grave consequences .
How , then , did Zuma make it to the top ?
His success was born largely of ANC grassroots supporters ' belief that Mbeki has failed to translate the country 's remarkable economic success into prosperity for the impoverished black population .
Two weeks before the ANC conference , Mbeki angrily denounced an independent study saying poverty has doubled among the poorest since 1996 .
He has rebuffed demands by party activists ( demands supported , indeed , by the white opposition parties ) for improved income support .
His now notorious position on HIV Aids , meanwhile , leaves many regarding him as out of touch , cold and uncaring .
Zuma has adroitly used the grassroots calls for change to his advantage , selling himself as a pro - poor , sympathetic , man - of - the - people candidate , in contrast to the wooden , aloof Mbeki .
The glue that holds Zuma 's coalition within the ANC together , however , is dislike for Mbeki .
Unable to find someone among their own ranks with the stature to lead the ANC , they have settled on Zuma , despite his controversial past , as long as he gives voice to their policy proposals .
Before the ANC conference , key elements within the Zuma camp resolved to ballot members on a breakaway from the ANC in the event of a Zuma loss .
Although South Africa wo n't plunge into anarchy , the chances are that Zuma 's ascendancy to the presidency will herald a period of political uncertainty that until recently few thought possible , given the ANC 's record of maturity .
The Zuma victory means that the period between now and the likely 2009 general election , when Mbeki 's constitutionally limited two - term presidency ends , will be one of heightened tensions between a lame duck Mbeki and a resurgent party leader in Zuma .
Although Zuma has indicated that he will not seek a vote of no - confidence in Mbeki to trigger an early election , many of his supporters on the ANC 's left have and will continue to demand that he do so .
As if that were not enough , South Africa could yet confront the unprecedented spectacle of the ruling party leader spending time in court fighting off corruption , fraud and bribery charges .
National prosecutors indicated in the lead - up to the conference that they have more compelling evidence against Zuma in South Africa 's controversial multi - billion rand arms deal .
For all the doubts that hang over Zuma 's character , many argue that he offers a critical conduit for the poor 's grievances .
These people are going to be disappointed .
The ragbag collection of groups that back Zuma ranges from socialists and trade unionists to supporters of virginity testing and the death penalty .
Dashed expectations may be the catalyst for a breakup of the ANC - a breakup which is debatably overdue and can only be good for democracy .
For all its shortcomings , the process completed yesterday has been ultimately constructive .
The achilles heel of most African liberation movements has been their failure to have competitive elections , either out of fear of division , or deference to the sitting leader .
Importantly , both these stifling taboos have now been broken in the ANC .
The election has been insufficient and stifled , but even the limited democratic space it has opened is a step forward .
Zuma will almost certainly face tougher scrutiny and more urgent demands to deliver .
And , critically , a precedent has been set : grassroots members can vote out unresponsive leaders .
William Gumede 's book Thabo Mbeki and the Battle for the Soul of the ANC has just been published .

2007-12-19,"Jacob Zuma , the populist politician , humiliated President Thabo Mbeki with a sweeping victory in the election for leader of the governing African National Congress yesterday .
Zuma , who survived a rape trial and his dismissal as the country 's deputy president by Mbeki over corruption allegations , took 60 % of the nearly 4,000 votes at the party 's national conference in a dramatic political comeback .
His victory potentially opens the way for him to become South Africa 's next president at the 2009 general election if he is not blocked by a longstanding graft investigation .
The vote amounted to a repudiation of Mbeki , a man who has dedicated his life to the ANC but who was seen as increasingly authoritarian , power hungry and out of touch with ordinary South Africans .
Zuma 's supporters at the conference celebrated the news of his victory by singing and dancing and waving signs saying that if Mbeki stayed it would be like Zimbabwe .
Zuma 's allies also won other important party leadership posts , forcing out the Mbeki camp .
Jim Mkandawire , a delegate who voted for Zuma , said before the result that it was time for a change .
"" We have done it , as we have been saying all along .
Zuma is an unstoppable tsunami , "" he said .
"" I love Mbeki but believe that politics in the ANC is like a relay .
He has to hand over the stick to another person . ""
Mbeki made a gesture of reconciliation in what has been a bitter and at times dirty campaign by accompanying Zuma on to the platform after his victory was announced .
Mbeki was defeated by Zuma 's organisation among the poor who believe they have been neglected while the ANC elite became rich , and by those disturbed at his efforts to retain control of the party even after he ceases to be the president in two years .
But Zuma 's victory may prove to be the beginning of a fresh power struggle with Mbeki as the two men battle for dominance for the remainder of the president 's term until the general election .
Mbeki is likely to influence whether the director of public prosecutions charges Zuma for allegedly accepting substantial bribes from a French weapons company .
Zuma 's financial adviser has already been jailed for funnelling him the payments .
Zuma 's camp has accused Mbeki of pursuing the graft investigation as a political vendetta and has warned that it might use the ANC 's domination of parliament to force an early general election if charges are brought .
Meanwhile , Mbeki can be expected to resist attempts by Zuma and the new ANC leadership to dictate government policy for the remaining 17 months of his term .
Despite the public splits in the ruling party , some senior ANC officials said the vote was a victory for broader South African democracy because it would remind future presidents that they do not wield power without accountability in a political system so dominated by one party .
Mac Maharaj , who served as transport minister in Mbeki 's cabinet but has become a critic of the president , said the vote would begin to reverse the effect of a leader who stifled debate by portraying critics as enemies of the people .
"" My perception is that the democratic debate in South Africa began to close down in the public space and the ANC , and that in a democracy where the ANC is so crucial it is important that the debate is opened up .
That is happening now , "" he said .
"" It 's a message that came from on the ground .
They 're saying there is that disconnect .
I think it 's a very positive thing for democracy that we 're going through this process . ""
The ANC secretary general , Kgalema Motlanthe , sought to defuse concerns about the implications of a Zuma win .
The Mbeki camp has warned that Zuma would shift economic policy to the left , reverse years of growth and job creation , and drive away foreign investors .
But Motlanthe said policy is decided by the party not one man . ""
Policy will not change in the economic area where investors are interested .
There are basic economic policies that will not change ... "" he said .
Maharaj said Zuma was likely to move away from centralising power and would be more responsive to the party and its allies in the trade unions . ""
He has courted and been courted by all sides .
If he has made a promise it is only that he will conduct matters in a way that is more consultative and embracing , "" he said .
A Johannesburg newspaper , the Times , reported yesterday that Mbeki rejected advice he got from ANC officials to withdraw from the race to avoid defeat .
But Mbeki , true to his style , fought to the end ."
2007-12-19,"There is a sweet and instructive irony about Tuesday night 's landslide victory for Jacob Zuma and his cohorts in the ANC party elections .
It dates back to February 2 1989 and a brief letter sent by PW Botha to the leader of the parliamentary caucus of the then ruling National party .
The previous month , President Botha had suffered a stroke .
He was released from hospital barely a week later and was convalescing for six weeks , the country waiting anxiously to see whether "" the great crocodile "" was capable of taking up the reins of power again .
The February 2 letter said simply : "" Arising from the setback to my health , I would appreciate it if you would present this letter to the caucus .
In my opinion , the office of state president and the office of leader of the National party should now be separated .
I would accordingly appreciate it if the caucus of the National party would now fill the post of leader so that I can be put in a position to continue only with the office of state president .
The state presidency will then , to a considerable degree , become a unifying force in our country .
"" The caucus went ahead and elected FW de Klerk as leader of the party and the leadership of the country , in the form of this odd couple , staggered along for nine months until Botha finally threw in the towel and stormed off into retirement .
It is said that nature abhors a vacuum - and it could equally be said that in politics nature abhors two centres of power .
There are , of course , huge differences between "" PW "" and President Mbeki - not least Botha 's love for the rough and tumble of the hustings and Mbeki 's naivety where elections are concerned ( I am open to contradiction , but I believe Mbeki has never even contested an election until Tuesday night 's debacle ) .
But human nature is , of course , much the same and the temptation to cling onto power must be almost as overwhelming for Mbeki as it was for Botha .
The consequences of such a decision are predictable and were captured in a cartoon described by De Klerk in his autobiography : "" PW Botha was depicted at the window of Tuynhuys ( the presidential residence ) outside of which a large crowd had gathered .
An aide informed him that the people had come to say goodbye .
Botha 's response was : Where are they going ? ""
In Mbeki 's case , there is a touching belief in some quarters here that both he and the country might be saved from Zuma by the pending charges of corruption in connection with an infamous arms deal .
It is a belief founded in a failure to understand that not only do the wheels of justice grind slowly , but also that when a putative state president is the accused , "" slow "" is the closest thing to a standstill .
No doubt Mbeki could hang on , like Botha , for nine months .
But , as with Botha , his duty as head of state is obvious : to resign within a matter of days and go to the country in the desperate hope that an alternative can be found both to himself and to Jacob Zuma ."
2007-12-19,"South Africa has woken up to a political revolution this morning , after Jacob Zuma and his team have swept aside President Mbeki and his group to take over all executive positions within the ruling ANC .
The striking thing about the voting for the top six jobs was the way in which delegates voted monolithically for the Zuma list , reflecting how deep the divisions were within the party .
This morning sees the elections to the party 's national executive committee ( NEC ) that will now have 80 seats , half of whom must be women .
Already we have seen the complete humbling of such major Mbeki figures as his deputy - president , Phumzile Mlambo - Ngcuka , who was not even nominated for her old job and was then thrashed even in the race for treasurer general ; Mosiuoa Lekota , the sitting party chairman , who was thrown off the executive completely ; and the crown prince of the Mbeki camp , Joel Netshitenzhe , who suffered a similar fate .
Thus Mbeki 's decision to run for yet another term himself was not only a personal disaster , but has dragged down with him many of the team he had assembled around him .
It is likely that the elections for the NEC will see this trend continue , with several cabinet ministers particularly in the sights of the Zuma camp .
They will want to defeat Mbeki 's much - hated fixer , Essop Pahad , effectively the country 's prime minister for the last eight years ; Alec Erwin , the regime 's vicar of Bray who is a byword for opportunism and was loudly confident of an Mbeki victory until the last ; Manto Tshabalala - Msimang , the popularly detested health minister , and others seen as being particularly close to Mbeki such as Charles Nqakula , the minister for safety and security ( ie the police ) .
The latter , as well as the minister of justice , Bridget Mabandla , also face a tough decision over the impending prosecution of the chief of police , Jackie Selebi , a strong Mbeki - ite accused of corruption and involvement in organised crime .
Selebi 's probable disgrace will be particularly embarrassing , since he is also the first African head of Interpol .
Another who could well fall is Ronnie Kasrils , the minister for intelligence , since the Zuma camp see him as having used the national intelligence agency for Mbeki 's partisan purposes .
Such a night of the long knives poses immediate questions for the stability of the government , for it would make it clear that the majority of ministers no longer have the confidence of their own party .
It is , indeed , difficult to see how the government can regain its balance , unless Zuma re - enters it in a senior position , presumably as deputy president again .
This , in turn , could only happen if it is clear there will be no more attempts to put him on trial for corruption - which , in turn , would mean that Mbeki might have to acknowledge that the case against Zuma has been politically driven , and promise to desist in future - a further humiliation pregnant with danger for himself .
Mbeki is , in other words , not at the end of his troubles .
For years , people have been frightened to criticise him or mention any of the skeletons in his cupboard .
Already , there are signs that people are now willing , for the first time , to be open about the fact that he was a complete failure when forced to undergo military training and , indeed , showed little sign of courage in that regard .
No doubt more dirt about him will now surface .
He has made many enemies and they now have little to fear .
Most threatening of all would be attempts to reopen the inquiry into the assassination of the communist leader , Chris Hani , and to connect Mbeki to it .
Mbeki 's opponents on the left have repeatedly hinted that they suspect Mbeki of involvement in the death of their hero and have demanded a fresh inquiry .
Those who feel this way are in the pound seats this morning ."
2007-12-20,"South Africa 's director of public prosecutions said today there is sufficient evidence to charge Jacob Zuma , the newly elected leader of the African National Congress , with corruption for allegedly accepting substantial bribes from a French arms company .
Mokotedi Mpshe told a Johannesburg radio station that a final decision on when to charge Zuma is "" imminent "" . ""
The investigation is complete .
All that we are doing now is to tie the loose ends , "" he said .
"" The investigation , with the evidence we have now , points to a case that can be taken to court . "" If Zuma is charged it is likely to prove a major obstacle to his ambitions to become South Africa 's president at the 2009 general election and extend his bitter power struggle with the country 's president , Thabo Mbeki .
Last week , the South African Broadcasting Corporation reported that prosecutors have submitted an affidavit to the constitutional court alleging that Zuma took illegal payments totalling 4 m rand ( £ 285,000 ) over 10 years .
The timing of Mpshe 's comments , coming hours before Zuma is expected to make his first speech to the ANC 's national conference as party leader , has compounded suspicions in his camp of a conspiracy by Mbeki 's office to block Zuma from becoming president .
Zuma humiliated Mbeki in this week 's ANC leadership election , defeating him with more than 60 % of the vote and sweeping the president 's allies out of all the top party posts .
Zuma has said he will not resign unless he is convicted .
His supporters have threatened to try and force an early election .
Some of Zuma 's critics have accused him of seeking the presidency in order to forestall a prosecution .
But as president he would not have immunity and there will be many in the ANC who will recoil at the prospect of a man facing a corruption trial leading the country .
Mbeki sacked Zuma as South Africa 's deputy president two years ago when he was first charged with corruption .
Those charges were dropped last year but Zuma 's financial advisor , Schabir Shaik , was convicted for facilitating bribes to him on behalf of a French company , Thint , and sent to prison for 15 years .
The prosecution argued that the two had a "" generally corrupt "" relationship and Zuma remained under investigation .
Last month , the court of appeal opened the way for Zuma to be charged again when it ruled that the seizure by police of incriminating documents from his home and office was legal .
The court also said investigators could have access to papers about a meeting between Zuma and Thint at which it is alleged payment of a substantial bribe was discussed .
On Wednesday , the ANC 's national conference decided to disband the elite unit that has been investigating Zuma , known as the Scorpions
It is not clear what impact that would have on the cases against Zuma or South Africa 's police chief , Jackie Selebi , who was charged with corruption and over ties to organised crime .
The indictment was dropped after Mbeki intervened by the DPP has been putting together new charges .
Zuma was tried separately for rape last year , but was acquitted ."
2007-12-20,"Jacob Zuma makes his first address as leader of the ruling African National Congress today as the party waits to find out the intentions of the man it elected largely on the basis that he is not Thabo Mbeki .
Zuma has courted a host of constituencies from business interests to the Communist party and Afrikaner nationalists , but avoided making commitments to any of them , preferring broad brush promises .
Investors have been assured he will maintain business - friendly economic policies , while the unions and communists have been promised job creation , land reform and poverty alleviation .
The first issue will be who decides .
While Zuma has won control of the party , and through it wields considerable influence in parliament , Mbeki remains South Africa 's president for 17 months unless an early election is called .
"" Who now governs ?
"" asked Mac Maharaj , a former Mbeki cabinet minister . ""
Is it the party as policy maker or the party representatives in government ?
That 's going to be difficult to resolve . ""
Zuma and his allies say the ANC sets policy , not the government .
A Zuma victory brings the ANC back closer to its ruling alliance partners - the 1.9 million - member trades union confederation , Cosatu , and the Communist party - which were largely ignored by Mbeki .
The new ANC secretary general , Gwede Mantashe , is also the Communist party chairman .
Three of the six newly elected top ANC national executive members are former trade union leaders .
Blade Nzimande , the Communist party leader , yesterday laid out what his party expects from Zuma by taking a dig at Mbeki 's aloof style and failure to connect with the people .
"" We must avoid the dangers of a technocratic , not to mention corporate , culture and aloofness , "" he said .
The unions hope to get policies that produce more jobs and less poverty .
Mbeki 's government has spent more per capita on poverty alleviation than almost any country , transforming the lives of many poor people who have gained access to decent housing , water , electricity and health clinics .
But the strategy has been undermined by insufficient numbers of skilled people to implement it , corruption and incompetent ANC officials .
While the focus has been on Zuma 's economic policies , he may have more immediate influence in other areas .
He wants Aids to be regarded as a national emergency , in a dig at Mbeki 's stalling over the disease , which claims nearly 1,000 lives a day in South Africa .
Zuma is pressing for stronger measures on crime and challenged Mbeki 's "" quiet diplomacy "" in dealing with the Zimbabwean leader , Robert Mugabe .
Zuma favours direct pressure for a free election ."
2007-12-20,"Now that the ethically challenged Jacob Zuma has soundly defeated Thabo Mbeki to become president of South Africa 's ruling party , the next questions are whether he 'll become the country 's next democratic president and if he does , what kind of policies can South Africans and the world expect from him ?
The answer to the first hinges on whether he can keep a fractious ANC together and stay out of jail .
Zuma may not be a unifier , but he has the support of two crucial ANC constituencies : the trade unions and leftist elements .
As for staying out of jail , his legal team is heading off a court date for long - delayed corruption charges , and it looks as if he may succeed in portraying the corruption charges as an Mbeki - led plot .
As for how he 'll govern , much has been said already about his style .
That he is the opposite of Mbeki : more consultation with the ANC 's allies ( or appearance of consultation ) , less aloof , more charismatic .
However , there is less surety as to what he 'll do the about the fundamental issues in South Africa : the paradox of 5 % average economic growth accompanied by 30 - 40 % unemployment ; the fact that South Africa remains the most unequal society in the world , and that while the black middle class now surpasses the white in numerical terms , black people comprise the overwhelming majority of the poor ; and Aids sufferers .
Also unclear is how Zuma may reimagine South Africa 's role as a regional hegemony .
Unfortunately we wo n't learn a lot from Zuma himself .
He does not write a lot or give memorable speeches like Mbeki , whose weekly online Letter from the President column was - until Zuma 's election - a must - read for South Africa 's political and media elites .
He blames South Africa 's media for his legal troubles , so rarely gives interviews .
Zuma is often called a populist , and much is made of his association with key trade union leaders and leftists .
If his public utterances were taken at face value , however , Zuma will not radically overhaul economic policy in a redistributive direction .
As he recently told the BBC , "" The ANC is going to move as it moves and change its leadership as the time comes , but keeping its direction - so nothing is going to change . ""
He has reportedly offered even more specific assurances in private to key South African and international business figures .
Zuma certainly has problematic sexual politics : on trial for the rape of an HIV positive family friend ( he was acquitted ) , he claimed to have showered after sex to prevent possible infection .
At the same time , he has since taken an Aids test , something Mbeki in his denialism refused to do .
So Zuma is unlikely to indulge in quack Aids theories and will probably fire the health minister , Manto Tshabalala - Msimang , who has promoted garlic and beetroot as Aids remedies .
South Africa has been criticised for its quiet diplomacy towards the crises in neighbouring Zimbabwe and the despotism of its leader , Robert Mugabe .
Zuma told two German journalists last year , if "" If the people love him ... how can we condemn him ? ""
About China 's growing economic influence on the continent : "" There is not a single country in the world that is not interested in doing business with China at the moment , including Germany .
And no one is seriously concerned about human rights .
But Africans are criticised for wanting to do business with China . ""
So even though many were alarmed to hear him singing
Bring Me My Machine Gun in Zulu , a Zuma presidency may indicate more a change in style than in substance .
Over the next few days Zuma and those in his circle will probably fill in more of the blanks about his vision for South Africa .
For now , we can content ourselves with knowing he can carry a tune ."
2007-12-21,"Celebrations of Jacob Zuma 's trouncing of President Thabo Mbeki and his supporters at the ANC 's Polokwane Conference had barely started when South Africa 's chief prosecutor announced that there was sufficient evidence to recharge Zuma for fraud and corruption .
The prosecutors acted so precipitously as a pre - emptive strike against a resolution passed by the ANC conference the previous day calling for the country 's National Prosecuting Authority to be placed under the control of the Justice Department .
Such a move would reduce the prosecutors ' independence and open them to far greater political pressure .
But do the prosecutors have a case against Zuma or is this a cynical gambit born of humiliating defeat by Thabo Mbeki and his allies ?
Zuma 's financial adviser , Schabir Shaik , is currently serving 15 years for fraud and corruption .
His main crime , amongst others , was to solicit money for Jacob Zuma from one of the companies which had won a contract in South Africa 's controversial multi - billion pound arms deal .
As the judgment states , in return for half a million rand a year , Zuma was to promote the interests of the company and protect them from investigation in relation to the deal .
As the ranking ANC member on parliament 's Public Accounts Committee , I was intimately involved in this investigation .
Zuma , then the country 's deputy president and leader of government business in parliament , was initially supportive of our efforts .
However , within a day or two of receiving confirmation of the arrangement with the arms company , he withdrew his support and , a couple of weeks later , sent the committee a withering letter in which he castigated us for daring to question the integrity of the executive and the "" prestigious , international [ arms ] companies "" .
The ANC then systematically neutered the investigation and closed down discussion of the arms deal in parliament .
Today , the UK 's Serious Fraud Office is investigating £ 75 m of "" commissions "" allegedly paid by BAe Systems on the deal , and German prosecutors are probing $ 25 m of alleged payments by Thyssen Krupp to senior South African officials and politicians .
The South African prosecutors allege that a total of R4 m was paid to Zuma by Shaik in relation to the arms deal and a number of other ventures .
In the Shaik trial , the judge described the relationship between the two men as one of "" mutually beneficial symbiosis "" .
That Jacob Zuma has a case to answer is beyond question .
Whether the new leadership of the ANC , and the government , will allow charges to be laid and a trial to take place remains to be seen .
The stakes could not be higher .
If Zuma is charged , found guilty and sentenced to a jail term , he will be barred from serving as a member of parliament .
This will end his ambitions of becoming South Africa 's president when Thabo Mbeki steps down in April 2009 .
The political space will be opened for the ANC 's newly - elected deputy president , Kgalema Motlanthe , and two senior ANC leaders unsullied by the Mbeki years , Cyril Ramaphosa and Tokyo Sexwale .
After an unedifying succession battle that has seen the ANC reach its moral nadir , it is essential for South Africa 's democracy that Jacob Zuma has his day in court .
If found not guilty , he will become the country 's next president .
If guilty , he will have to suffer the consequences of his alleged misdemeanours , including the end of his political ambitions .
However , if a trial is prevented by political machinations , a dark shadow of suspicion will always hang over Jacob Zuma and the ANC he leads ."
2007-12-21,"Jacob Zuma 's honeymoon as the new leader of the African National Congress was cut short yesterday when prosecutors said they were preparing to lay corruption charges against him that could see him sent to prison for years .
But the timing of the comments , just hours before Zuma 's victory speech to his party aimed at reassuring South Africans and business interests that there will be no radical shift to the left , drew accusations of a conspiracy to prevent him from becoming president .
The director of public prosecutions , Mokotedi Mpshe , told a Johannesburg radio station that a final decision on when to charge Zuma for allegedly accepting bribes from a French arms company was "" imminent "" . ""
The investigation is complete .

Last week , prosecutors submitted an affidavit to the constitutional court alleging that Zuma took illegal payments totalling 4 m rand ( £ 285,000 ) over 10 years .
If Zuma is charged it will be a major obstacle to his ambitions to become president at the 2009 general election and will extend his bitter power struggle with President Thabo Mbeki .
Yesterday , Zuma declined to discuss the issue , although he has said he will not resign unless he is convicted .
"" I think I want to cross that bridge when I get there , "" he said .
"" Any answer I give will simply be guesswork ...
I do n't think I would like to engage that issue . ""
But Matthews Phosa , also newly elected to the top echelons of the ANC and sitting at Zuma 's side , said Mpshe 's statements were "" improper "" and amounted to trial in the court of public opinion .
The Communist party , which threw its weight behind Zuma 's election as ANC leader , described the timing as "" odd "" , an "" abuse of power "" and alleged that he was facing "" a political trial "" .
Zuma 's allies have long accused Mbeki of using the prosecutors ' office to pursue his arch rival .
Zuma humiliated Mbeki in this week 's ANC leadership election , winning more than 60 % of the vote and sweeping the president 's allies out of all the top party posts .
Mbeki sacked Zuma as South Africa 's deputy president two years ago when he was first charged with corruption .
Those charges were dropped last year but Zuma 's financial adviser , Schabir Shaik , was convicted for facilitating bribes to him on behalf of a French company , Thint , and sent to prison for 15 years .
The prosecution argued that the two had a "" generally corrupt "" relationship and Zuma remained under investigation .
In his first speech as ANC leader , Zuma made no mention of the corruption investigation as he sought to allay concerns among some business interests that there would be a radical and more populist change in economic strategy .
He said there would not be a fundamental shift because policy was decided by the party , not one man .
"" There is therefore no reason why the domestic or international business community or any other sector should be uneasy , "" he said .
The ANC delegates were buoyant at the change in leadership and repeatedly cheered Zuma although a contingent from Mbeki 's stronghold in the eastern Cape was notably absent .
Zuma praised Mbeki , calling him a friend and a brother .
Seeking to dispel fears about rival power centres , he promised to work with the president .
But he also made some pointed remarks that were clearly aimed at his defeated opponent who lost the election in part because he was deemed to be aloof and out of touch with the party and the poor . ""
A lesson we have learnt from this conference is that if the leadership fails to resolve issues , or to grasp the feelings of the membership on issues that concern the movement and instead appears to perpetuate the problems , the membership takes over and asserts its authority , "" he said .
Zuma promised to combat crime , calling it counter - revolutionary , and to pick up the pace of land reform to redistribute 30 % of agricultural land in the next seven years .
He also promised a more caring approach towards dealing with HIV / Aids .
After the speech , Zuma 's supporters broke into his trademark song , Bring Me My Machine Gun .
Some of Zuma 's critics have accused him of seeking the presidency in order to forestall a prosecution .
But as president he would not have immunity and there will be many in the ANC who will recoil at the prospect of a man facing a corruption trial leading the country .
Last month , the court of appeal opened the way for Zuma to be charged again when it ruled that the seizure by police of incriminating documents from his home and office was legal .
The court also allowed investigators access to papers about a meeting between Zuma and Thint at which , it is alleged , payment of a bribe was discussed ."
2007-12-22,"Thabo Mbeki was yesterday accused of double standards after he said he will not interfere with any prosecution for corruption of Jacob Zuma , who defeated the president in the race for the leadership of the African National Congress this week .
Zuma 's supporters said the president 's seemingly high - minded approach was a double standard because he has stalled other investigations and prosecutions of his allies .
On Thursday , the director of public prosecutions ( DPP ) said his office is preparing to charge Zuma with accepting bribes from a French arms company and for tax evasion .
Last week , it submitted an affidavit to the constitutional court alleging that Zuma took illegal payments totalling 4 m rand ( £ 285,000 ) over 10 years .
"" All of us in the ANC have insisted , and that includes Jacob Zuma , that the law must take its course , "" said Mbeki .
"" The entirety of the ANC would accept that to the extent that the law enforcement authorities , the national prosecuting authority , have a case against anybody they should proceed in that regard .
I do n't know what the national prosecuting authority intend to do , they have n't said anything to me . ""
Mbeki sacked the last DPP after he charged one of the president 's political allies , the country 's police chief , Jackie Selebi , over alleged links with organised crime , corruption and for perverting the course of justice .
Charges against Selebi were dropped and the new DPP has yet to say whether they will be reinstated .
Asked whether Zuma should resign if he is charged , Mbeki said : "" It 's difficult but it 's important to make the point that everybody 's innocent until they are proven guilty . ""
The fact that an allegation is made should not be presumed to be correct .
I 'm saying it 's difficult to relay that message
but we have to insist on this .
"" If Zuma is charged it is likely to prove a major obstacle to his ambitions to become South Africa 's next president at the 2009 general election .
Mbeki also said he will not leave office early despite his defeat and the removal of many of his inner circle , including seven cabinet ministers , from the ANC 's national executive .
"" I 've no reason to assume that there is anything to stop the government serving the full term for which it was elected .
So I expect the government to serve until 2009 , "" he said .
Zuma 's sweep of the national executive amounts to a further repudiation of Mbeki 's policies and style with a shift to the left ."
2007-12-28,"Jacob Zuma , who defeated South Africa 's president , Thabo Mbeki , to become African National Congress leader this month , has been served with prosecution papers for alleged corruption , his lawyer said today .
The charges involved were "" various counts of racketeering , money laundering , corruption and fraud , "" Michael Hulley said in an email to the AFP news agency . ""
According to the indictment , which was served on Mr Zuma 's Johannesburg residence in his absence , the trial is to proceed on 14 August 2008 , "" he added .
A corruption trial could derail Zuma 's attempt to gain the ANC presidential ticket and succeed Mbeki at the 2009 presidential election , despite his crushing victory in the ANC leadership vote just over a week ago .
Charges were expected , with prosecutors saying soon after the ANC vote that they had sufficient evidence to indict Zuma for allegedly accepting substantial bribes from a French arms company .
The timing of this initial revelation , hours before Zuma made his first speech to the ANC 's national conference as party leader , prompted suspicions of a conspiracy by Mbeki 's office to stop Zuma from becoming president .
Zuma humiliated Mbeki in the leadership election , defeating him with more than 60 % of the vote and sweeping the president 's allies out of all the top party posts .
Zuma has said he will not resign unless he is convicted .

Zuma was tried separately for rape last year , but was acquitted ."
2007-12-29,"South Africa 's political crisis deepened yesterday when the ANC 's new leader , Jacob Zuma , was told that he would go on trial on August 14 for corruption .
Zuma 's lawyer , Michael Hulley , confirmed than an indictment had been served at Zuma 's Johannesburg home by the national prosecuting authority , popularly known as the "" Scorpions "" .
He said Zuma had not been at home .
The charges are being brought in connection with a South African arms deal involving British , French and German contractors .
The indictment accused Zuma of "" various counts of racketeering , money laundering , corruption and fraud "" , Hulley said .
Zuma , 65 , defeated South African president Thabo Mbeki last week in a bitterly contested election for the leadership of the African National Congress .
The battle left deep rifts in the 85-year - old party , which former president Nelson Mandela led to victory over the racist apartheid state .
Zuma was handing out presents to children yesterday at an annual Christmas party at his home village in KwaZulu - Natal .
He would not answer reporters ' questions on the matter .
Zuma , who was acquitted of rape last year , has denied corruption and has said prosecutors are trying to smear him for political reasons .
Describing the timing of the move as "" most peculiar "" , Hulley said : "" One can not imagine the need for such haste , and the serving of the indictment over this Christmas period , when much of the world - commercial , legal and otherwise - is at rest . ""
He added : "" This lends credence to the long - held view that the Scorpions are influenced and their prosecution informed by political considerations .
These charges will be vigorously defended , in the context of the belief that the Scorpions have acted wrongly and with improper motive calculated to discredit Zuma and ensure that he play no leadership role in the political future of our country . ""
The decision to go ahead with the prosecution of Zuma , little more than a fortnight after he won the top post in the liberation movement , will inevitably place more strain on the alliance of the South African Communist party , the ANC and the country 's most powerful labour federation , the Congress of South African Trade Unions .
It will also fuel speculation that a split in the ANC could be on the cards if Mbeki persists in his refusal to stand down as head of state .
Mbeki fired Zuma as the country 's deputy president in 2005 after Zuma 's financial adviser was convicted of trying to elicit bribes .
Prosecutors contend Zuma was aware of efforts to secure payments for him from French arms company Thint Holdings in exchange for stopping investigations into a multibillion - dollar arms deal with the government .
Charges against Zuma were thrown out last year on a technicality .
But last week the country 's top prosecutor said he had enough evidence to go back to court , an announcement that overshadowed Zuma 's victory over Mbeki .
It had been expected that no further action would be taken in the Zuma case pending the outcome of an appeal to the constitutional court .
This was against a ruling by the supreme court of appeal that documents held in Mauritius could be used by the state in the prosecution of Zuma .
Earlier yesterday Zuma demonstrated his popularity , especially in KwaZulu - Natal , when more than 5,000 people turned out for his Christmas party ."
2008-01-02,"South Africa is drowsing uneasily through its midsummer break , aware that the stage has been set for a period of what could almost be anarchy .
On the one hand , President Mbeki , though humbled by his crushing defeat at the ANC conference in Polokwane in December , seems determined to fight his elected successor , Jacob Zuma , every inch of the way .
On the other hand , Zuma 's supporters , who now have a huge majority on the ANC executive , are furious at the way corruption charges were laid against Zuma in the midst of the Christmas festivities and are talking openly of removing Mbeki from office and "" punishing "" members of the government who do not obey the party .
At Polokwane there seemed a chance that Mbeki would accept defeat with good grace .
That chance has now gone .
He seems in denial about almost everything .
He insists that the impression of him being aloof and inaccessible was untrue - though it was the overwhelming view .
He castigates the conference delegates for their bad behaviour which , he says , shows they do n't really understand what the ANC is all about - and seems , indeed , on the verge of questioning their legitimacy as delegates altogether .
He has gone ahead and appointed an SABC board stuffed with his own supporters .
The SABC chairman , Dali Mpofu , an unconditional Mbeki - ite , at first was reported to have told all and sundry that Mbeki 's defeat meant he too would be resigning , but now ( after Mbeki 's intervention ? ) insists this is not so .
Mbeki is clearly relying heavily on his control of the public media in the battle now clearly ahead .
He is reported to be in a "" petulant and vindictive "" mood and appeared to be slurring his words badly in one TV interview .
The ANC executive meets on January 7 and will invite Mbeki to attend .
He is likely to find himself denounced bell , book and candle and to be ordered to respect the party discipline he has hitherto always preached .
It is an open question how he will take this .
Zuma 's supporters are convinced that Mbeki is behind the fresh set of charges against Zuma and will probably demand that the Director of Public Prosecutions be sacked .
But in addition to the Zuma - Mbeki stand - off there are many others .
Thus Ronnie Kasrils , the minister for intelligence , was thrown off the ANC executive but Billy Masethla , the spy boss he sacked at Mbeki 's behest , has been triumphantly voted on .
All the top six of the Communist party leadership have been voted into prominent positions on the ANC executive and are demanding , inter alia , the nationalisation of Sasol , the country 's biggest industrial corporation .
It is difficult to see how the country can be governed all the way to the next elections in May 2009 if the ANC executive , the NEC , and the government are at one another 's throats .
ANC MPs have been keeping quiet but they may find themselves called in to vote Mbeki out of office .
Meanwhile , they have to debate Mbeki 's state of the nation address - and contemplate all manner of new legislation including proposals to limit press freedom .
No one is sure what will happen but the NEC meeting on January 7 will doubtless tell us a lot ."
2008-01-08,"Yesterday 's key meeting of the ANC national executive committee ( NEC ) - the first since Jacob Zuma 's thumping victory over Thabo Mbeki at the party 's Polokwane conference in December - was shrouded in secrecy , with the media kept at a minimum distance of 400 metres behind locked gates as the meeting dragged on all day and late into the evening .
The universal speculation as to how the triumphant Zuma - ites would greet the vanquished Mbeki - an ex - officio NEC member - turned to astonishment as it became clear that both Mbeki and his closest associate and spin - doctor , Joel Netshitenzhe , had excused themselves from the meeting .
Moreover , Nkosasana Dlamini - Zuma , the foreign minister ( ex - wife of Zuma and close Mbeki ally ) , excused herself after only half an hour in order to assist Mbeki with the day 's diplomacy - involving visiting Chinese and Thai dignitaries .
No one could ever remember Mbeki missing an NEC meeting or scheduling other business to have priority over it .
This was interpreted as a sign of contempt and a deliberate snub to Zuma .
The fact that Netshitenzhe - who has no diplomatic role - also stayed away further strengthened this impression .
The 86-member NEC was expected to elect an overwhelmingly pro - Zuma national working committee , the 28-strong ANC party inner cabinet which meets every two weeks and has hitherto decided government policy .
This , in turn , will accentuate a situation where there are two centres of power , which , in theory , everyone had said they wanted to avoid .
There will now be two cabinets - the governmental one meeting in Pretoria , consisting almost wholly of men and women voted off the NEC , and a party one , sitting in Johannesburg , consisting of people who see themselves not just as the future government but the authentic voice of the hegemonic party .
The new ANC secretary general , Gwede Mantashe ( who is also the Communist party chair ) , announced that the NEC had decided straightforwardly that Jacob Zuma would lead the ANC 's campaign in the 2009 elections .
The NEC , he said , had "" grave misgivings "" about the timing and nature of the corruption charges just laid against Zuma .
Meanwhile , the NEC wanted there to be no doubt that it was taking the mandate of Polokwane seriously .
Mbeki - ites , who still hope to head Zuma off somehow when the party has formally to choose its presidential candidate in August , described Mantashe 's statement as "" a declaration of war "" .
The NEC has also decided to launch its own investigation of the arms deal .
Meanwhile , Mbeki 's continuing resistance to a Zuma takeover is inflaming opinion among many Zuma - ites , who would like to force him out .
This could be done by a parliamentary vote of no confidence , requiring 201 votes - the ANC has 265 seats , so the whip could be cracked and MPs informed that those who did n't sign up to the motion could not hope to find another position on the party list in 2009 .
Thus far , Zuma and his senior backers are holding off from such a move - which could produce great political and market uncertainty .
But it is difficult to see how a showdown can averted for long if Mbeki attempts to ignore the party and carry on governing regardless .
The next step would be for the NEC to "" instruct "" Mbeki to attend and then further instruct him on one policy after another .
Mbeki would be very foolish if he allows matters to come to such a pass while the Zuma - ites have the wind in their sails .
Moreover , as one talks to those who , until a few months ago , were strong anti - Zuma voters within the ANC , one is struck by the fact that most of them have now accepted the inevitability of a Zuma leadership - and also by their utter fury at Mbeki whom they blame for having produced the situation they now face .
Their mood is pretty much like Oliver Hardy 's : "" another fine mess you 've got us into "" .
Mbeki may have had 40 % of the vote at Polokwane but it 's not clear he would get 25 % now ."
2008-01-09,"Jacob Zuma , newly - elected president of South Africa 's ruling African National Congress , created further flutters last weekend by announcing that he is to marry a fourth wife .
Already he has paid lobola ( the bride - price ) and his native village , Nklandla , deep in Zululand , is preparing excitedly for the ceremony where Zuma , aged 65 , will we d Nompumelo Ntuli ( "" MaNtuli "" ) , 33 , who is already the mother of two children by Zuma - one of years , one of 11 months .
( All told , Zuma is credited with 20 children by nine different women . )
Zuma has been more or less explicitly rejected as a future president by the likes of Archbishop Desmond Tutu as someone "" the country ca n't be proud of "" .
This is largely because of the abortive rape case against Zuma in which he admitted having casual sex with a girl young enough to be his daughter whom he knew to be HIV positive - and then then taking a shower as a precaution against Aids .
The general image thus created is that Zuma is an unreformed old African patriarch , always ready for a roll in the hay and none too concerned about safe sex .
Feminist and conventional Christian opinion professes itself deeply shocked by such mores while educated black opinion is somewhat hypocritically ashamed of such an open display of traditional African social behaviour which went out of fashion , publicly at least , once the white missionaries hit their stride in the 1820s .
The problem is that everyone knows that polygamy has never really ceased and that Zuma is actually much closer to the African norm than the monogamous Tutu .
It has always been perfectly normal for African men to keep one wife in the countryside , another in town and quite possibly several other girlfriends as well .
Typically , migrant workers fall down on the matter of child support but their dream is doubtless to emulate just what Zuma is doing .
Some years ago , I interviewed Bishop Stanley Mogoba , then head of the radical Pan - African Congress .
He expressed horror at the fact that no one in government had what he regarded as a "" normal "" monogamous marriage - they were all divorced , separated , had multiple partners , large numbers of girlfriends , enjoyed casual sex and so on .
President Mbeki was always mentioned at the apex of all this - in the words of one of his trade union critics , "" a legendary womaniser "" .
When I talked to Zuma himself about it , he very much confirmed this picture . ""
Many of them have wives , girlfriends and children that they try to hide .
I think that 's terrible .
I love all my wives and children and I 'm proud of them , so I 'm completely open about it
, that 's the only difference . ""
This certainly seems to be true - one often sees Zuma 's children clustered around him , regarding him with great affection .
It seems unlikely , then , that this latest open polygamy will disturb Zuma 's large popular following .
But it will confirm the unease with which he is held among black intellectuals and white , "" coloured "" and Indian progressives , particularly the vocal feminists among them .
This is of considerable political significance , for these groups provide the bulk of the ANC 's educated cadres and sympathisers .
Zuma 's left wing sympathisers are , at least , quietly relieved that his attempt to marry a Swazi princess fell through .
It was always a matter of deep discomfort for the left that Zuma was on such close terms with the Swazi king , one of the most reactionary and feckless leaders in the region , a sworn enemy of democracy and trade unions who will not allow any political parties to exist .
This marriage seems to have fallen through both because of Zuma 's legal and image troubles at the time and the high lobola being demanded .
Of course , should Zuma become president he could presumably rise above both the image and the lobola hurdles and so a royal alliance can not be completely ruled out .
Meanwhile , the impending nuptials also pose another question .
Who , under Zuma , will be the First Lady - and run the President 's Fund , until now the charitable preserve of Zanele Mbeki , the president 's wife .
Already Zuma 's first and oldest wife , Sizakele Khumalo , has declared that she would like to be First Lady - though the notion of this role being assumed by an illiterate old Zulu woman happy to live in a polygamous marriage is the stuff of feminist nightmares .
But though MaNtuli would be prettier and more educated , some will turn their noses up Zuma 's attempt to make an honest woman of her and continue to regard her balefully as a 33-year - old mistress of a 65-year - old man who ought to know better ."
2008-01-11,"Prosecutors are to charge South Africa 's police chief , Jackie Selebi , with accepting bribes from a convicted drug trafficker in return for protecting narcotics shipments , passing on confidential intelligence reports from Britain and interfering with a murder investigation .
Selebi , also the current head of Interpol , is expected to be forced to resign as police commissioner after he failed in a high court bid in Pretoria today to block the charges on the grounds this would tarnish his reputation .
A judge ruled that the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if Selebi was not prosecuted , delivering another embarrassing blow to the ruling African National Congress after its new leader , Jacob Zuma , was charged a fortnight ago with bribery , fraud , racketeering , money laundering and tax evasion .
The director of public prosecutions , Mokotedi Mpshe , said the police commissioner will now be indicted but did not say when . ""
The charges against him are based on a strong prima facie case supported by the testimony of a range of witnesses and corroborated by real evidence , "" he said .
The charges allege that Selebi accepted at least 1.2 million rand ( £ 90,000 ) from Glen Agliotti , a convicted drug trafficker who is awaiting trial accused of murdering a corrupt mining magnate , Brett Kebble .
Selebi is alleged to have helped protect drug shipments into South Africa by "" turning a blinding eye "" .
According to the indictment , he also passed on to Agliotti confidential UK intelligence reports about his trafficking .
Selebi has vigorously denied the accusations .
Agliotti , nicknamed "" the landlord "" for his extensive role in South Africa 's narcotics trade , last month pleaded guilty to smuggling two tonnes of Pakistani hashish into the country under a plea bargain that saw him receive a suspended 10 year prison sentence and a fine in return for agreeing to be a witness against drug syndicates .
It is not clear if he has also agreed to testify against Selebi .
Agliotti is also accused of murder over the death of Kebble , who was shot six times in his Mercedes in 2005 by a team of assassins .
Kebble is believed to have stolen millions of pounds from his mining companies and had close ties to criminal syndicates .
The charges against Selebi allege that he tipped off Agliotti that he was being investigated over the killing and gave him information about the case .
Scrutiny of Selebi 's relationship with the drug trafficker began after it was revealed that within minutes of Kebble 's death , Agliotti called the police commissioner on his mobile phone .
Further questions arose when it was revealed that the police handed over the dead man 's car to a close friend of Agliotti 's immediately after the murder and before forensic tests could be done .
The car was then cleaned , destroying crucial evidence .
Although Selebi described Agliotti as no more than an acquaintance , the drug trafficker 's diary reveals they had regular meetings .
Among the other evidence used by prosecutors is a 144-page dossier submitted by Paul O'Sullivan , a former British military intelligence agent who headed security at South African airports .
It describes "" a massive criminal syndicate , with tentacles into and out of Selebi 's office "" and accuses Selebi of "" wining and dining the Mafia set "" and of protecting criminal interests .
In his court application , Selebi claimed there is a "" scandalous plot "" against him , an accusation that has resonance in the ANC which is trying to assert political control over the independent investigations unit , known as the Scorpions , which has targeted Selebi , Zuma and other senior party figures .
The new ANC leadership met earlier this week to discuss placing the Scorpions - a part of the national prosecutors ' office rather than the police - under the police commissioner 's authority after accusing the investigations unit of pursuing a political agenda against the party in league with the press ."
2008-01-11,"South Africa 's police chief today asked the high court in Pretoria to block looming corruption charges against him , as the ruling African National Congress sought to gain control over an investigations unit targeting senior figures , including the new party leader Jacob Zuma .
The highly unusual application by Jackie Selebi , also the current head of Interpol , asks the court to prevent him being charged and to reveal the names of witnesses and their evidence in connection to his alleged ties to a convicted drug trafficker awaiting trial for murder .
The national prosecutor 's office told the court that it intends to charge the police commissioner with corruption and defeating the course of justice .
The ANC is struggling to rein in the independent investigations unit , known as the Scorpions , which has targeted Selebi , Zuma and other senior party figures .
Zuma was charged a fortnight ago with bribery , fraud , racketeering , money laundering and tax evasion .
The new ANC leadership met earlier this week to discuss placing the Scorpions - a part of the national prosecutors ' office rather than the police - under Selebi 's authority after accusing the investigations unit of pursuing a political agenda against the party in league with the press .
It also alleges that the unit is staffed by investigators who served the apartheid regime and are pursuing a "" reactionary rightwing "" agenda .
Two days after the meeting , Selebi 's force arrested Gerrie Nel , the head of the Scorpion 's investigation into the police chief , accusing him of corruption .
Nel said there were "" ulterior motives "" behind his arrest .
The opposition Democratic Alliance said it bore the appearance "" of a witch - hunt to protect Selebi "" .
The looming charges against Selebi relate to his relationship with Glen Agliotti , a convicted drug trafficker who is also accused of murdering a corrupt mining magnate , Brett Kebble .
Agliotti , nicknamed "" the landlord "" for his extensive role in South Africa 's narcotics trade , last month pleaded guilty to smuggling two tonnes of Pakistani hashish into the country under a plea bargain that saw him receive a suspended 10-year prison sentence and a fine in return for agreeing to be a witness against drug syndicates .

Scrutiny of Selebi 's relationship with Agliotti began after it was revealed that within minutes of Kebble 's death , Agliotti called the police commissioner on his mobile phone .
Selebi said Agliotti had driven to the site of the killing while Kebble was still slumped behind the wheel of his car and then called to request an investigation .
Further questions arose when it was revealed that the police handed over the dead man 's car to the head of his security firm , Clint Nassif , immediately after the murder and before forensic tests could be done .
The car was than cleaned , destroying crucial evidence .
Nassif is a close friend of Agliotti and was recently arrested on fraud charges .
Although Selebi described Agliotti as no more than an acquaintance , the Scorpions seized a diary in which Agliotti details regular meetings with the police commissioner .
Among the other evidence used by the Scorpions is a 144-page dossier submitted by Paul O'Sullivan , a former British military intelligence agent who headed security at South African airports until he fell out with the police chief .
It provides "" evidence of a massive criminal syndicate , with tentacles into and out of Selebi 's office "" and accuses Selebi of "" wining and dining the Mafia set "" and of protecting criminal interests .
Arrest warrants were issued against Selebi last September but withdrawn after President Thabo Mbeki sacked the director of public prosecutions , ostensibly for failing to consult the justice minister sufficiently over the matter .
But Mbeki 's critics accused him of misusing his power to block Selebi 's arrest while permitting the Scorpions to lay charges against his arch rival , Zuma .
The new director of public prosecutions convened a panel to reconsider the charges against Selebi , which decided the police chief "" had a case to answer "" .
Selebi has vigorously denied any criminal activity but has never fully explained his relationship with Agliotti , who was apparently left untroubled by the police to help run a major importation drug ring and only brought to book by the Scorpions .
In his court application , Selebi claimed there was a "" scandalous plot "" against him , an accusation that has resonance in the ANC .
The Scorpions , initially popular for their heavy - handed tactics in going after organised crime and major white - collar criminals , saw its support diminish in the ANC after it pursued investigations into Zuma and his former financial advisor , Schabir Shaik , who is serving 15 years in prison for accepting bribes from a French arms firm and for bribing Zuma .
The investigations unit also filed the charges that saw the ANC 's chief whip in parliament , Tony Yengeni , who was sent to prison for fraud over bribes from a weapons company .
Zuma 's supporters are keen to follow through on a decision by the ANC policy conference last year to see the Scorpions stripped of its independence and placed under the control of the police commissioner .
After its meeting this week , the ANC national executive issued a statement that "" expressed its concern and grave misgivings about the timing of these charges [ against Zuma ] , and the general conduct of the NPA in this case , including inconsistency in the application of its mandate and leaking of information to the media "" .
The national executive also elected Yengeni to its powerful national working committee .
Helen Zille , leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance , said Yengeni 's election confirmed that the ANC "" has been irreversibly captured by populists , careerists and convicted criminals "" ."

2008-02-07,"South Africa 's public morale has been shattered in the last month , first by Thabo Mbeki 's comprehensive defeat by Jacob Zuma 's coalition at the ANC 's Polokwane conference , and then by the power cuts that brought the country 's entire mining sector to a halt .
In fact both events had been highly predictable for some time .
Ever since the ANC National General Council overthrew Mbeki 's attempt to force Zuma 's resignation as ANC deputy president in 2005 , the writing was on the wall for the Mbeki regime .
And major power cuts have been an almost daily fact of life in many urban centres since 2005 .
On any serious analysis even South Africa 's ability to stage the 2010 World Cup was extremely dubious .
The key facts were : •
The monopoly state electricity supplier , Eskom , predicted with complete accuracy that by the end of 2007 it would not have sufficient power not just to face peak demand but normal base load .
•
Already South Africa 's reserve electricity supply was down to 8 - 10 % instead of the international benchmark of 15 - 20 % .
•
Electricity consumption grows more or less pari passu with economic growth .
With the economy growing at around 5 % per annum , electricity demand would increase by over 25 % by 2010 , so that well before the World Cup the country would be utterly incapable of delivering normal services across the board .
•
It takes seven to eight years to build a major new power station , so even if emergency construction began in 2005 ( and it did n't ) there was no hope of changing the situation before 2010 .
Now the bell has really tolled and public opinion is aghast at the enormity of this failure of governance - the government had for six years deliberately banned the building of new power stations , even when Eskom begged to be allowed to do so .
An immediate result has been a sharp increase in racist sentiment , noticeable in private conversation everywhere .
On the one hand there is outrage and contempt for "" the incompetence of black government "" and on the other , more sadly , a collapse in self - confidence about black government among many Africans who are only too well aware that power failures never happened under apartheid , but are only too typical of independent Africa .
Until now the ANC has dismissed as mere white racism and "" Afro - pessimism "" any view that the ANC might behave no better than African nationalists elsewhere .
But there 's really no arguing that something has gone very seriously wrong when ANC activists throw out not just Mbeki but virtually his whole cabinet and all but two provincial premiers - in effect the country has rejected its entire executive authority .
Or when the mines cease to work altogether , in a way not witnessed in the previous century .
At this stage the government is desperately pretending that neither crisis really exists .
The ANC government will go smoothly on with just a few personnel changes ; and people will make sensible electricity savings and the World Cup and economic growth will go ahead as planned .
Samuel Johnson ( no relation ) said that no man ought to be asked to believe in six impossible things before breakfast .
This would appear to be a case in point .
Since the Polokwane conference the Rand has fallen by 13 % against the Pound but has now rallied to be down just 9.8 % .
But there is a widespread fear of a currency collapse .
After all , SA is running a current account deficit of over 8 % of GDP , which has to be funded by inward investment .
It is difficult to believe that political uncertainty and power cuts wo n't affect such investment negatively , in which case the Rand must fall .
The Reserve Bank has no wish to raise interest rates in an already gloomy situation , so the fall could be steep and the inflationary ( and political ) consequences considerable .
Meanwhile we are told Fifa are "" closely monitoring "" the situation , but since it is now clear that if the World Cup is held here - and all the stadiums get built on time despite power cuts and all get huge back - up generators - they will still occur in a country where all other services work only spasmodically .
Even now one faces , on a daily basis , non - working traffic lights , escalators , lifts , ATMs , shops and garage tills , let alone lights , hot water and cooked meals .
Power demand will grow by at least another 8 % by 2010 .
The World Cup will , remember , be held in the midst of South Africa 's winter when night temperatures in Johannesburg , Pretoria and Bloemfontein can all fall to near freezing .
But since the government is never going to face reality , this tough question has now landed on Sepp Blatter 's plate .
He will no doubt wish to raise heaven and earth rather than take the games away from South Africa and face the fury of the Afro - bloc that elected him .
But the alternative might , quite possibly , make raising heaven and earth seem a rather bracing option ."
2008-02-09,"Thabo Mbeki and the Battle for the Soul of the ANC by William Mervin Gumede 476pp , Zed Books , £ 16.99
When Thabo Mbeki , South Africa 's president , was humiliatingly rejected as ANC party leader in favour of his rival and former ally , Jacob Zuma , late last year , it was the sudden nadir of a political life marked by two decades of basking in international acclaim for his success in moulding a new and unrecognisable country from the apartheid years , after Nelson Mandela 's honeymoon transition .
How could this eloquent , brilliant man , honed for years as the new South Africa 's crown prince , have lost out to someone whose reputation was overshadowed by corruption charges and decidedly old - fashioned attitudes to women ?
The brutal war of succession last year brought into the open the contradictory faces of the ANC :
the robust force of grass roots democracy , versus the tight central control by the president and his men .
When the ANC delegates booed Mbeki in Polokwane in December , he was not the first president to get that treatment , though in his case it was spontaneous , not manufactured from above .
William Mervin Gumede recounts how Mandela was "" heckled and jeered by Mbeki supporters "" at an ANC national executive committee meeting when he voiced his concerns over his successor 's policies on HIV / Aids .
For months before , Gumede writes , Mbeki refused to take phone calls from Mandela , or to meet him to discuss the spiralling crisis of confidence in his government , brought on largely by Mbeki 's bizarre denial of the facts about the disease which had killed nearly 2 million South Africans , and left tens of thousands of children orphaned .
Mandela was not the only senior political figure to suffer Mbeki 's Siberia treatment , or worse , when they dared to criticise him .
Gumede recounts some of these stories , placing them in the context of a president who governed with all the authoritarianism and secrecy of the ANC 's tough years in exile that had been his formation .
Andrew Feinstein 's short book , After the Party : A Personal and Political Journey inside the ANC ( published in South Africa by Jonathan Ball ) , tells the story of his own experience of just such a dramatic falling - out .
Feinstein , an MP , was the most senior ANC member of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts ( Scopa ) , which was the flagship of the ANC government 's commitment to curb corruption .
He was forced out in the wake of the government 's refusal to allow an unfettered investigation by Scopa of a billion - dollar arms deal .
Major international weapons firms , including Britain 's BAE Systems , were embroiled in the political and corruption scandal .
The arms companies were accused of paying bribes to senior ANC politicians and government officials , and of helping to fund the ANC 's 1999 election campaign .
Feinstein quotes a diatribe by Mbeki 's close adviser Essop Pahad against the Scopa group : "" Who the fuck do you think you are , questioning the integrity of the government , the ministers and the president ? ""
In the wake of this scandal , Mbeki personally penned a bizarre attack on the Guardian 's Chris McGreal for his reporting of it , unable to recognise that this might not be a good use of time for a head of state trying to shore up his credibility .
Some of the most extraordinary chapters of recent South African history have seen big figures from the anti - apartheid days suffer dizzying falls from grace over corruption .
A bewildering series of serious charges and counter - charges , apparent smear campaigns , even the accusation of a "" plot "" against Mbeki by some of the biggest political names in the country ( which came to nothing ) , are reported by both Gumede and Mark Gevisser in his Thabo Mbeki :
The Dream Deferred ( Jonathan Ball ) .
Some readers may drown in the detail of their books , but the indelible impression of dirty internecine battles in the leadership , and inside the security services , is overwhelming .
Aids , Zimbabwe and an economic policy that lost South Africa half a million jobs are the three shadows that have haunted Mbeki 's presidency and cost him support he could ill afford to lose .
An even longer shadow is the corruption that has brought a Mercedes - riding elite into prominence in a society scarred by deep poverty and youth unemployment .
Gevisser 's writing on Mbeki 's attitudes to Aids , his obsessions with "" Afro - pessimism "" ( the assumption that Africa is an irretrievable mess ) and drug companies plotting with the CIA against him should be a separate short book .
No one else has written with such insight on this saga .
Gumede has a harsh analysis of the mistakes made in all three key policy areas , and describes how the early ANC commitment to wealth redistribution metamorphosed into black empowerment for a tiny elite and a home - grown neoliberalism at least partly under the guidance of former communists .
Much of his book is taken up with the personal power plays that brought Mbeki the prized succession to Mandela and then ruthlessly consolidated it .
But it is Gevisser who tells the story of the 1989 SACP congress , held in Cuba and chaired by Mbeki , fresh off a plane from Bermuda where he had had the first meeting with a South African government official - this was after three years of indirect covert communication with the National party government , unknown to most of his colleagues .
The congress adopted a strategy paper called "" The Path to Power "" written by Joe Slovo and calling for a "" seizure of power "" through "" mass insurrection "" .
A baffled Cuban host is described as asking one delegate "" Are you speaking to your comrade Thabo ?
While you are going on about insurrection , he 's been briefing us on negotiations .
"" Mbeki 's extraordinary ability to operate along parallel and often contradictory policy lines , so well described by Gevisser , meant the acute tensions inside the ANC leadership in the 1980s were contained - in one head .
Mbeki , with Pahad , had learned to tough it out , but it was not his style to fight for trust .
Mbeki 's story , as told in these books , is one of success - in winning first the succession , then the leadership of the continent and a respected place in international forums - bought at a great price personally , as well as politically inside South Africa .
It is a Shakespearean tale of power struggles , paranoia , betrayals , secrets , lies and , above all , hubris ."
2008-02-12,"The elite South African anti - crime unit that targeted the new African National Congress leader , Jacob Zuma , in a corruption investigation is to be disbanded .
The party claims the FBI - style force known as the Scorpions employed "" Hollywood tactics "" against Zuma when raiding several of his and his lawyer 's properties in 2005 .
Zuma , who deafeated the country 's president , Thabo Mbeki , for the ANC leadership , is due to stand trial later this year charged with bribery , fraud , racketeering , money - laundering and tax evasion .
It is not clear how the disbandment will affect the trial .
The security minister , Charles Nqakula , announced the decision to parliament today .
To cheers from ANC deputies , he said : "" The Scorpions will be dissolved and the organised crime unit of the police will be phased out and a new amalgamated unit created . ""
Nqakula insisted that tackling organised crime remained a key government priority .
"" We need proper measures , better human and material resources to achieve our goals in the fight against all crime , "" he said .
The Scorpions represents the investigation arm of the national prosecuting authority .
However , police view the unit as invading its jurisdiction .
At December 's ANC conference , which elected Zuma as leader , delegates voted to scrap the unit amid claims it had tried to smear Zuma and deny him the leadership .
The move is interpreted as a sign of renewed infighting between Mbeki and Zuma factions .
Mbeki , who established the Scorpions in 1999 , is due to hand over power next year , depending on the outcome of Zuma 's trial .
Outraged opposition deputies branded the disbandment as an ANC attempt to control over parliament and President Mbeki . ""
This announcement once again shows that the country is now run , not by parliament , but by those few in Luthuli House [ ANC headquarters ] , "" said Dianne Kohler Barnard , spokeswoman for the Democratic Alliance .
The Scorpions also led the inquiry into South Africa 's police chief and head of Interpol , Jackie Selebi , who has been charged with corruption for accepting bribes from a convicted drug trafficker in return for protecting drug shipments , passing on secret reports from the UK and interfering with a murder inquiry .
Although the disbandment must be still be ratified by parliament , given the ANC 's domination , the move seems inevitable ."
2008-02-20,"Nearly half of South Africa 's health professionals ( of all races ) are likely to emigrate in the next five years , with a quarter wanting to leave in the next two years , according to a survey published this week .
The findings more or less sum up the collapse in the public mood occasioned by the victory of Jacob Zuma on the one hand and the catastrophic power failures on the other .
Health professionals are a key group because they have probably the greatest potential mobility
but there is no doubt that the plunge in the national mood has seen many people who had never thought about it before openly considering emigration .
It is , for example , easy to meet middle class whites in their sixties actively considering whether to relocate to Europe or elsewhere - although everything one knows suggests that emigration at such an age is inadvisable except in dire circumstances .
What has happened is a loss of faith .
Plenty was going wrong before : the state of education , health , and law and order were all visibly declining and the government was clearly incapable in many areas .
But while the economy boomed and the president , whatever his other faults , spoke in an educated voice , there was a tendency to balance off the pros and cons .
Zuma 's rise suggests we may soon have a semi - literate peasant as president , a man mainly concerned to keep adding to his harem , and without any administrative or executive ability .
Simultaneously , the revelation of how completely the government has failed to prevent a completely predictable power crisis has caused many to feel that we will soon be confronted with infrastructural breakdown on the large scale seen elsewhere in Africa .
In a modern economy like South Africa this is a truly frightening scenario , which explains the note of hysteria - even panic - that one hears in many comments .
There has been a rapid collapse in business and consumer confidence , a sharp scaling down in economic growth forecasts , and a large sell - off by foreign investors .
Confidence that the country can stage a successful soccer World Cup in 2010 has never been lower .
The government has certainly scored a spectacular own goal .
Nobody believes very much of what it says any more .
The press treats both Mbeki and Zuma with virtual contempt and there is no doubt that whoever takes power next will never have the following wind of favourable domestic and international opinion that Mandela had in 1994 or Mbeki had in 1999 .
The ANC , once on a pedestal as a heroic liberation movement , is now mainly seen as a band of opportunists and ideologues , keen to get their hand in the till .
And yet ... the fact is that with better management , price increases and a rush to install new capacity , the country could scrape through the power crisis ; with the commodity boom showing no sign of stopping , 5 % growth could resume without the government doing much to deserve it .
And provided Fifa are willing to step in and manage the World Cup for themselves - the local management is laughable and corrupt - there 's still a chance of getting through it without a complete shambles .
In a word , things could get better and make the present panic seem overblown .
But it is hard to see the loss of faith being repaired .
No one is likely to believe in the government much again .
This is a real problem , even if the rural masses continue to vote the ANC blindly back to power .
Perhaps the best one can hope for is an Italian situation where no one ever trusts or believes the government , where everyone tries to keep as much as possible in the black economy , and where the situation is almost always desperate - but not serious ."
2008-02-28,"The row over Jacob Zuma 's attendance last Thursday at the Forum for Black Journalists shows no sign of dying away .
The outrage expressed by the white journalists who tried to attend the meeting but were turned away is focused largely at the FBJ itself , which they feel should simply not exist .
It was understandable , the argument goes , that organisations such as the FBJ might exist under apartheid when black people shared all sorts of discriminatory experiences that were exclusively their own and which they might want to discuss , but what place does a racially exclusive organisation have in a post - apartheid South Africa ?
Everyone knows that any attempt to form a whites - only association in almost any sphere would be struck down by both the courts and an outraged public opinion .
The two black journalists who were allowed to attend the FBJ , but did so only in order to protest and walk out , Yusuf Abramjee and Kieno Kammies , have reported the whole matter to the SA Human Rights Commission , including the fact that they were insulted as "" coconuts "" - a common racial slur in such situations ( black on the outside , white on the inside ) , asking whether such language is itself not racist and discriminatory .
This will embarrass the SAHRC which has been thunderous against acts of racial discrimination by whites , but loath to confront similar behaviour by blacks .
The secondary target is Zuma and the fact that he saw nothing wrong in attending such a meeting .
South Africa has had nearly 10 years of putting up with Thabo Mbeki 's continuous playing of the race card , his sponsorship of such racially exclusive groups as the Native Club ( for soi - disant intellectuals ) and his huge chip on the shoulder in all matters racial ; so there were many who hoped that the more relaxed and avuncular Zuma would scrap all such games and observe the non - racism which is the ANC 's official philosophy .
It adds salt to the wound that Zuma himself has been loud in his outrage that his former persecutor , Bulelani Ngcuka ( then the public prosecutor ) , first attempted his character assassination by calling together a racially exclusive group of black journalists to badmouth Zuma , to say there was plenty of evidence against him but perhaps not quite enough to convict him .
In fact , the whole affair is overheated .
Abby Mekoe , the SABC journalist who runs the FBJ , seems to have no other supporters - indeed , to be a one man band - and this is the first meeting of the FBJ that anyone 's heard of .
Mekoe is a loyal Mbeki - ite and it is quite possible that the whole manoeuvre was deliberately set out to in order to snare Zuma .
And while it is true that associations such as the Black Lawyers Association and the Black Management Forum still exist , they have an appalling reputation for racial backbiting on the one hand and minimal professional expertise on the other .
It is noticeable that when members of the black elite need a good lawyer ( Zuma being a case in point ) , they immediately hire top white lawyers or , occasionally , top Indian lawyers , while no black businessman would be much interested in investing in any enterprise run by the BMF .
But at least it could be argued that black lawyers , managers and accountants are as yet a tiny minority and that their insecure minority status gives them reason for racially based organisations , but the same is hardly true in journalism .
Black editors and black journalists are now the majority in their profession , and it would be hard to find a more thoroughly non - racial venue than the average newsroom .
One reason why some of the bitterest criticism of the FBJ has come from black journalists is precisely because they see such initiatives as an attempt to corral them into a politically disciplined group .
In the eyes of Mbeki , all criticism comes either from white journalists and editors or blacks who are manipulated by whites or sell - outs ; that is , in his view , all proper black journalists support the ANC government .
This sort of nonsense worked to a degree 10 years ago , but black editors and journalists have long since matured into a group of considerable ability and sophistication , well able to see such tactics for what they are - and to scorn them utterly .
Many of the editors who were most outspoken and independent - minded in their criticism of Mbeki were black , and they see such independence as essential to their profession - and to their own professionalism .
In fact , what the incident shows is two things .
First , Zuma has an almost infallible talent for putting his foot in his mouth .
One gasps at the ineptitude of his own advisers who ca n't see how damaging it is for him to agree to attend the FBJ - or to allow himself to be humiliated by the BBC 's Fergal Keane .
Keane used to give fawning interviews to Mandela and Mbeki , but now opens by asking Zuma whether he is "" a crook "" .
Zuma is a genial man , keen to be friendly and show his human side , but he desperately needs a media adviser who can steer him onto more neutral ground .
Second , South Africans are slowly growing up about race .
There were gasps of horror this week when the football chief Irwin Khoza , chairman of the World Cup local organising committee , got fed up with one black journalist and said he should stop behaving "" like a kaffir "" .
Khoza refused to withdraw his use of what South Africans now call , with almost religious horror , "" the K - word "" .
It was , he said , in common use in the townships and what it meant was behaving like a witless buffoon .
Strikingly , there were several articles by black journalists supporting Khoza .
This is , indeed , far healthier than rushing off to the SAHRC and asking for someone to be hung , drawn and quartered for using terms which , however unpleasant , are part of everyday speech .
( Similarly , "" charra "" is an unacceptable word for Indian - used by Indians themselves all the time . )
Maturity in such matters is the achievement of balance , not the reinforcement of taboos .
And that 's what South Africans need to do about race ."
2008-03-11,"The grouping that elected Jacob Zuma as ANC president in Polokwane last December was supposed to provide the new leadership team for South Africa , but it is currently racked by disputes : the way ahead seems murkier than for a long time past .
The disputes are : 1 ) .
Zuma keeps giving media interviews or talking to special interest groups , where he seeks to reassure opinion .
He does this by telling them what they want to hear - that he 's happy to legislate for greater labour flexibility , that he wants a compact with business , that he favours a referendum on the death penalty and so on .
As soon as he has done this , other members of his coalition shout with rage and he immediately backs down completely .
The result is not just that no one knows what his future policies would actually be but cynicism about him grows .
He is seen both as a man with no real ideas of his own ; someone opportunistically telling whoever he meets what they want to hear ; and someone completely in hock to the unions and the left , who are able to snap him back onto line when he wanders .
2 ) .
Zuma 's cold war with Mbeki , who remains president till May 2009 , continues .
Mbeki quietly refuses to allow Zuma to have the secretarial or administrative backup he 's supposed to have , or to allow the state to pay his legal bills , and continues to lay booby - traps in his path .
Zuma has just been in Mauritius , trying to prevent the courts there from releasing records about him which might sink him in his corruption trial .
Mbeki is flying there this weekend - theoretically for the island 's 40th independence celebration , but in fact to meet the justice minister and president .
He is the only visiting African head of state to attend and he will doubtless try to lobby for the anti - Zuma records to be released .
3 ) .
Because of the above situation , some Zuma supporters want him to use his muscle to depose Mbeki right away .
Others , notably Kgalema Motlanthe , Zuma 's deputy , and Mathews Phosa , the ANC treasurer , say that the regular presidential and court processes should take their course .
The problem is that if Zuma were found guilty then probably one of these two men would replace Zuma and become South Africa 's next president .
Not a few within Zuma 's coalition would prefer that .
They used Zuma as a battering ram to get rid of Mbeki but Zuma 's foot - in - mouth behaviour , his clowning around and his embarrassingly public and ever - growing harem of wives have all made them wonder .
But no one wants to move publicly against Zuma .
He controls the crowds and thus the attack dogs , rather as Mugabe controlled and used the war vets .
4 ) .
Meanwhile , no one has any idea as to how the country should be governed .
Zuma 's two most obvious backers , the Cosatu unions and the SA Communist party , would like to see him as a Hugo Chávez , but they represent too narrow a slice of the political spectrum to really get their way .
The educated black elite is watching aghast , pleased by Mbeki 's fall but desperately wanting something better than Zuma .
Moreover , with the country facing a major crisis over electricity blackouts for at least five years ahead , a slowing economy , runaway crime and many other obvious problems , no one really believes Zuma 's confident promise that the ANC will decide everything and it will be business as usual .
5 ) .
The increased prominence of Phosa and Motlanthe and Zuma 's public gaffes have led to anguished cries that "" the ANC "" must take control of their media exposure .
This would , actually , be a good idea
but there is no central body able to do such a thing and certainly not one able to discipline the party 's three most prominent leaders .
This situation could go on for some time but the country is drifting , rudderless .
At the beginning of this crisis there were less than 13 Rands to a Pound .
Now there are more than 16 ."
2008-03-18,"An ugly situation is developing on South Africa 's university campuses where a witch - hunt is threatened , with white academics as its likely victims .
To appreciate the situation one must begin with the huge drop in national morale caused first by the election of Jacob Zuma - a semi - literate on trial for corruption - as president of the ruling ANC , and then by the swingeing power cuts in January which forced the government to admit it had completely miscalculated and the country would , as a result , have to look ahead to perhaps seven years of worsening power cuts .
In effect this was greeted by both black and white communities as a sort of admission that the ANC government was incompetent to run a modern state .
This was the sort of thing one had seen happen in African states far to the north but which , the ANC had promised , would never happen here .
Suddenly the whole vista of African governance failure became all too believable .
One could almost see African heads go down .
For this was their government and its failure , now so evident , is personally felt .
The disappointment , hurt and demoralisation was patent : so perhaps it 's true that "" Africans ca n't govern "" , perhaps the whites were right about that .
One certainly would n't have had power cuts under a white government .
And the worst of it is that it means jobs will be lost , more skills will be lost as key whites emigrate , the whole spiral will be downward .
The result was not just demoralisation but a complete demobilisation .
Everything was now called into question - even whether the end of white rule had been such a good thing .
Then came the affair of the racist student video at the University of Orange Free State .
This achieved massive media exposure - the highlights of the video were re - shown almost every night for weeks past .
No matter that it was all meant as a joke , that the women cleaners were merely faking having to eat food that had been urinated on - that was irrelevant : what came across was that there were still whites so brazen in their racism that they were willing to create scenes like that , who thought it funny to have Africans eat urine or shit .
It led to a furious re - mobilisation along racial lines .
This was why we fought the struggle .
This was why we ca n't forget apartheid and white racism are still the main enemy and always will be .
Thus , the university incident occurred at just the right moment to be used as a major psychological stimulus to push black opinion across the slough of despond .
Now university vice - chancellors - most of them black - are on the warpath .
Professor William Makgoba , the head of the University of KwaZulu - Natal , who has already publicly likened white males to baboons and displaced superannuated apes , pushed aside in the evolutionary struggle , has demanded that action be taken to confront racism and cleanse the universities of it once and for all .
His call has been taken up by Prof Mahlo Mokgalong ( VC , University of Limpopo ) : "" There has been too much bonhomie , courtesy , deference .
Root out the problem now .
If staff do not want to co - operate , well , they should go .
This applies to students too .
And , yes , to VCs .
"" His words have been whole - heartedly endorsed by Prof Saleem Badat ( VC , Univ of Rhodes ) .
Only Prof Loyiso Nongxa ( VC , Univ .
of Witwatersrand ) has said that he finds the agitation for such a campaign "" depressing and troubling "" .
He points out that the UOFS students were a tiny minority and that there is no evidence of a general problem on other campuses .
The vice - chancellors are meeting to discuss the problem and in particular the proposal to set up a special task team to pursue the problem .
There are also proposals that every student , on admission , should be required to take an oath against racism .
It is clear that in all the excitement such notions as academic freedom and academic tenure are likely to get trampled .
Some fear a sort of McCarthyite witch - hunt in which the most likely targets are white academics who are thought to be out of line for one reason or another .
Of particular significance is the situation at the Uniiversity of KwaZulu - Natal , the country 's second largest , where attempts by white faculty members to get the vice - chancellor , Prof Makgoba , to respect resolutions of the university senate have led to bitter scenes in which Makgoba , who refuses to comply and in effect rules by fiat , has labelled all those who wish to uphold senate resolutions as racists .
Already there have been many threats to sack , suspend or demote academics who question Makgoba and the situation on the campus was put to me as follows : "" You should not underestimate the degree of realistic fear ( paranoia would not be an appropriate word ) on the campus . ""
After all , the vice - chancellor has already made it clear that he regards the white male majority of the academic staff as "" baboons "" .
Naturally , all such academics curse the UOFS students who set all this off - and say they are to be condemned .
All four of those students have now left that university but amidst the rising crescendo of agitation this seems a mere detail .
Most academics are keeping their heads right down and just praying that the typhoon will blow itself out ."
2008-03-26,"Jacob Zuma , the new president of the African National Congress , has pulled off a major coup with his visit to Angola , which finished yesterday .
The background to the visit is that relations between President Thabo Mbeki and the government of Angola 's president , Eduardo Dos Santos , have long been extremely frosty .
Angola , though a poor and war - torn state , is growing at an annual compound rate in excess of 25 % due to its burgeoning oil industry , and Dos Santos , feeling his enhanced importance , has not appreciated Mbeki 's somewhat lordly approach .
Last year , the so - called Browse Mole Report was circulated , clearly inspired by the Mbeki government , in which Zuma - Mbeki 's deadly rival - was accused of plotting a possible coup using his links with the ANC 's former guerrilla arm , Mkhonto we Sizwe ( MK ) , with financial support from Angola and Libya .
This was tantamount to an accusation that Dos Santos was supporting subversion in South Africa .
Zuma led a major ANC delegation ( including the former intelligence boss , Billy Masetlha ) on his four - day visit in which he conferred with Dos Santos on a wide range of issues .
Mbeki 's nose is doubtless out of joint not only because of the clear amity between Zuma and Dos Santos ( who provided Zuma 's delegation with his private plane to fly them back to Johannesburg ) , but also because it was , to all intents and purposes , a state visit .
The visit was formally to observe the 20th anniversary of the battle of Cuito Cuanavale in which Cuban , Namibian and Angolan forces inflicted a significant reverse on the armed forces of apartheid South Africa .
Zuma promised to erect a memorial to the MK soldiers who had died in Angola and thanked the Angolans for their "" unequalled "" support of the anti - apartheid struggle - for no country suffered greater casualties and dislocation than Angola .
Zuma also said that he and Dos Santos planned to increase trade and investment links between the two countries , with South Africa investing in Angola 's minerals , agriculture and tourism industries .
Given Angola 's undoubted riches and rocketing growth , there are bound to be considerable opportunities .
Thus Zuma has pulled off a major coup .
He has appeared as a presidential statesman , doing good for his country 's economy and foreign relations ; he has appeared able to cultivate an important friend where Mbeki had failed ; and he has emphasised his own association with the MK guerrillas , the military heroes of the armed struggle , while Mbeki had no role in MK .
Mbeki , who is used to being the country 's sole statesman , has , in effect , been elbowed off the stage , and the country has been given a glimpse of how it might benefit from a Zuma presidency .
None of which will sit well with Mbeki .
Zuma has quite openly ( and , doubtless , correctly ) accused Mbeki of being behind the long - running attempt to convict him of corruption .
This latest visit will only add to the tension between the two men ."
2008-04-14,"The ANC president Jacob Zuma 's public criticism of Robert Mugabe 's government for its failure to release two week - old presidential election results in neighboring Zimbabwe , contrasts sharply with South African president Thabo Mbeki 's announcement this weekend - following a meeting with Mugabe at the regional summit called to address the post - election crisis in Zimbabwe - that there is "" no crisis "" in Zimbabwe .
Zuma 's statement certainly breaks with his previous position .
In the past when confronted with Mugabe 's despotism , he noted : "" If the people love him ... how can we condemn him ? ""
Zuma 's statement also appears more in tune with reality .
Anyone who 's been following the news knows that Mbeki is wrong .
As independent observers of the elections have noted : in the run - up to the elections the ruling Zanu - PF used the police and army to intimidate opposition supporters , the government banned critical media ( al - Jazeera , whose correspondent is openly pro - Zanu - PF , was the only non - African TV news station allowed to report the elections ) , packed the electoral commission , and prevented Zimbabwean exiles from voting .
The truth , however , is that Zuma will have little influence on Mugabe or Zanu - PF partly because the faction that took control of the ANC under Zuma has more in common with the Zimbabwean opposition .
Zuma became ANC president through a loose coalition in which the leadership of South Africa 's largest trade union federation played a central role .
It has not helped that MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai on his visit to South Africa last week actively sought out Zuma 's advice or that key MDC leaders laud the current ANC leadership as a "" more trade - union backed ANC "" .
This analysis is shared by Mbeki 's brother , Moeletsi , who spent his political exile in independent Zimbabwe before returning to South Africa .
More importantly , political power in the ANC is now shared by two duelling factions : the Zuma - controlled ANC on the one hand and on the other , a government dominated by Mbeki loyalists .
The second faction still holds the cards on government policy , including when it comes to Zimbabwe ( the two leading government - ANC figures mediating on Mbeki 's behalf are both in his camp . )
Nevertheless , all this does not matter much since the leaders of the 12-nation Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) supports Mbeki as the preferred negotiator between Zanu - PF and the MDC .
Mbeki therefore enjoys more of a structural relationship with Mugabe that Zuma does not have .
So Zimbabweans and those with an interest to ( at least ) see the electoral crisis resolved ( that the ballots be counted openly for one ) , should keep putting pressure on Mbeki .
One other note :
Mbeki finds himself in a difficult position .
This is partly of Mbeki 's own doing .
He has not endeared himself to the Zimbabwean opposition as an honest broker with his policy of "" quiet diplomacy "" , which has effectively served as cover for Mugabe and the armed forces , the ruling party and its paramilitaries to abuse the people of Zimbabwe .
On the other hand , however , Mbeki 's supporters ( and defenders ) point out that he has had to thread softly around Mugabe ( and the latter 's inner circle , including senior army officers who have publicly stated their refusal to serve an MDC government ) who appear impervious to the opinions or arguments of even its allies and who are now more than ever wounded by their evident defeat in last month 's elections .
They are armed , wealthy and have some support and could return to the repression of the early 2000s ( with their farm invasions , and violence against and displacement of opposition supporters ) .
Nevertheless , that alliance - sources from inside Zimbabwe indicate - seems fraught at present ( some generals seemed willing to "" talk "" to MDC leader Tsvangirai and Mugabe 's candidature was not unanimously supported within Zanu - PF ) , while Mugabe is in perhaps the weakest position in his own party since he lost the 2000 presidential referendum vote .
As a result this may also be an opportune time for Mbeki to seize the initiative and abandon his policy of quiet diplomacy and force Mugabe to negotiate openly with the MDC ."
2008-04-21,"Jacob Zuma , president - elect of the ANC , appears to be using his influence with South Africa 's trade unions to break the deadlock in Zimbabwe , which is an interesting development in the crisis .
It is possible that Zuma was behind the decision by the 300,000-strong South African transport and allied workers union ( Satawu ) not to unload the Chinese vessel carrying arms for the Zimbabwe government .
"" We are concerned that the current standoff could mean the arms would fall into the hands of those who want to use military force against the people of Zimbabwe , "" Randall Howard , Satawu general secretary , said last Friday .
"" The South African government can not be seen as propping up a military regime . ""
Like Zuma , his backers in the powerful confederation of South African trade unions ( Cosatu ) , have been calling for the election results to be released .
Zuma has used the situation to assert his authority by publicly breaking ranks with Thabo Mbeki . ""
The region can not afford a deepening crisis in Zimbabwe , "" Zuma said last week .
Zuma has good reasons for opposing Mbeki 's policies on Zimbabwe , not least in his role as champion of the poor , who feel most threatened by the wave of illegal immigration from Mugabe 's failed state .
And there may be another important motivating factor for Zuma to act now .
As analyst Mark Schroeder , regional director for sub - Saharan Africa at Stratfor Strategic Forecasting said last week : "" If Jacob Zuma could broker some kind of resolution in Zimbabwe that the international community , particularly Britain and the United States would be happy with , that would probably go a long way to alleviate concerns that other countries have regarding Zuma 's own leadership ability . ""
Schroeder 's comments have been widely reported , but few people probably know that his organisation is said to have been influential in shaping US foreign policy since 9/11 .
Stratfor , which lists the CIA as one of its clients , also facilitated a recent trip by Jacob Zuma to the US .
But if Zuma is to succeed Mbeki as president of South Africa after the elections next year , he will still need to beat the corruption charges hanging over him , for his part in a series of arms deals .
A trial date is set for September .
His supporters claim that he was set up on charges of corruption , and for rape , in a case which saw him acquitted .
The MDC 's Morgan Tsvangirai has been in talks with Zuma , and last week Tsvangirai called for Mbeki to "" stand aside . ""
This may be taken by Zuma supporters as an endorsement of their candidate , although Zuma ruled out a role as mediator .
Meanwhile , Mbeki argues that his statement that "" there is no crisis in Zimbabwe "" has been misinterpreted , and he recently used his position as current president of the security council to resist any calls to discuss Zimbabwe at the UN .
Last Thursday Mbeki defended his policy of "" quiet diplomacy , "" saying that "" loud diplomacy "" was no diplomacy , a comment thought to be aimed at Gordon Brown .
Mbeki is now calling for talks between the MDC and Mugabe 's Zanu - PF to resolve the situation .
However , he is increasingly discredited and isolated both in South Africa and internationally .
As the Chinese ship left South African waters on Friday with its cargo of weapons , an hour after the Durban high court suspended the ship 's conveyance permit , there was a glimmer of hope on the horizon .
Could this be Zuma 's moment , and is a Zuma presidency in South Africa really a price worth paying for a speedy resolution to the crisis in Zimbabwe ?"
2008-04-22,"The president of South Africa 's ruling party , Jacob Zuma , today described the delay in the announcement of Zimbabwe 's election result as unacceptable , his strongest comments to date on the crisis .
The intervention by Zuma , who is due to meet Gordon Brown in London tomorrow , came as the Zimbabwean opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , called on all African leaders to acknowledge that he won last month 's disputed presidential vote .
Tsvangirai adopted a conciliatory tone towards President Robert Mugabe , describing him as a "" liberation hero "" and indicating that he would be allowed to make an "" honourable exit "" .
Zuma , who heads the African National Congress , told Reuters that Africa should send a mission to Zimbabwe to end the delay in publishing results from the March 29 election . ""
It 's not acceptable , "" he said .
"" I do n't think the constitution says : ' If you like , you can hold the results ' , "" said Zuma . ""
The electoral commission must issue the results because it is actually destroying its own credibility as an institution that is supposed to be neutral . ""
His forthright comments will distance him further from the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , who has called for "" quiet diplomacy "" and been criticised for playing down the gravity of the crisis .
Zuma called on other African leaders to "" unlock this logjam "" . ""
Concretely this means African countries should identify some people to go in there , probably talk to both parties , call them and ask them what the problem is , as well as the electoral commission , "" he said .
Zuma toppled Mbeki as head of the ANC in December and he suggested that his political rival 's mediation efforts needed a boost . ""
When I say leaders should go [ to Zimbabwe ] , I 'm saying that we are fully aware that Mbeki is the mediator , "" Zuma said .
"" But ... what I 'm saying when I say other leaders should come , is that ... given the gravity of the situation , we should add other leaders to assist what Mbeki is doing in Zimbabwe . ""
The opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) says Tsvangirai , won the presidential poll and the party 's candidates took a majority in the Zanu - PF - dominated parliament .
A partial recount of the parliamentary vote in 23 constituencies is being carried out , which the MDC has denounced as illegal .
Tsvangirai told a news conference in Accra , Ghana : "" Robert Mugabe is a liberation hero on our continent and he must be convinced to make a graceful exit ...
We believe the time has come for him to have an honourable exit . ""
"" We are calling ... on every head of state in Africa to stand in defence of the people of Zimbabwe , "" Tsvangirai told a news conference in Accra , Ghana . ""
Robert Mugabe is a liberation hero on our continent and he must be convinced to make a graceful exit .
In fact , we have no intention of violating his rights .
We believe the time has come for him to have an honourable exit . ""
Meanwhile , a shipment of arms headed for Zimbabwe may be recalled to China , Beijing 's foreign ministry said today .
The South African Transport and Allied Workers Union refused to handle the weapons because of concerns that Robert Mugabe 's government might use them against opponents in Zimbabwe 's post - election stalemate .
The freighter left South Africa after a judge on Friday barred the arms from passing through the country and Mozambique authorities stopped it from docking over the weekend .
Zambia 's president , Levy Mwanawasa , yesterday urged other countries in the region to bar the An Yue Jiang from entering their waters .
A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman , Jiang Yu , defended the shipment as "" perfectly normal "" but said it may be heading back because of its failure to unload .
She said the contract for the cargo was signed last year and was "" unrelated to recent developments "" .
A spokesman for the International Transport Workers ' Federation ( ITF ) said it believed the ship was "" en route to Angola at reduced speed to conserve fuel "" and could take days to reach the capital , Luanda .
"" We just want the government to grant that they are not going to transit the arms , they 'll refuel with an understanding that the ship returns to China , "" he told theguardian.com .
Yesterday , the director of the Institute of Angolan ports told Luanda Radio : "" This ship has not sought a request to enter Angolan territorial waters and it 's not authorised to enter Angolan ports . ""
But the ITF spokesman said that because the ship was in "" real danger "" due to the lack of fuel , it should be allowed to dock without unloading its cargo .
US intelligence agencies are tracking the vessel and American diplomats have been instructed to press authorities in at least four nations — South Africa , Mozambique , Namibia and Angola — not to allow it to dock .
Two officials , speaking anonymously , said diplomatic efforts were now concentrated on Namibia and Angola , who were being told that allowing the An Yue Jiang to dock could harm their relations with the US .
The state department 's top Africa official , Jendayi Frazer , plans to visit the region this week to underline US concerns about the shipment and the failure to publish results from the March 29 presidential elections ."
2008-06-02,"South Africa 's judiciary has been thrown into crisis after the country 's highest court accused a top judge of an "" improper attempt "" to influence the outcome of a case involving corruption allegations against the leader of the ruling African National Congress , Jacob Zuma .
Opposition parties have called for the immediate resignation of the most senior judge in the Cape , John Hlophe , after the constitutional court said he approached some of its justices over the Zuma case , and reported him for investigation to the Judicial Services Commission ( JSC ) , which oversees South Africa 's judges .
The allegations against Hlophe come as the independence of the judiciary is increasingly under political pressure , particularly since Zuma , who is positioned to become the country 's next president , was charged with corruption , racketeering and tax evasion over the South Africa 's largest - ever weapons deal .
The ANC 's moves to disband the independent investigation unit which indicted Zuma , and has prosecuted other senior party officials for corruption , has been widely condemned as an erosion of the rule of law .
President Thabo Mbeki 's attempts to block prosecution of the country 's now suspended police chief , Jackie Selebi , for corruption and links to organised crime have also been criticised .
The constitutional court issued a statement accusing Hlophe of attempting to influence its pending decision over the legality of raids on Zuma 's property and that of a French weapons company , Thint , two months after a high court judge found that Zuma had maintained a "" generally corrupt relationship "" with a former financial adviser convicted of soliciting bribes from the arms firm .
Although the constitutional court statement did not reveal how many judges were approached by Hlophe , or the exact nature of his attempts to influence them , its unprecedented move suggests there is little doubt that they regarded it as a blatant attempt to affect the course of justice . ""
The judges of this court view conduct of this nature in a very serious light , "" the statement said .
Among those who endorsed the statement is the chief justice , Pius Langa , who has previously defended Hlophe during an official investigation into his undeclared acceptance of money from a private company while ruling on a legal case involving the same firm .
The opposition Democratic Alliance said the latest allegations "" shakes the very foundations of our constitutional democracy "" and called for Hlophe to step down immediately .
The Cape Bar Council said it viewed the matter as "" one of extreme emergency and extreme concern "" .
Hlophe told the South African press that the accusations are "" utter rubbish "" and that it is "" inconceivable "" that he had the power to influence the constitutional court .
The court 's statement said there was no suggestion that Zuma or Thint were aware of Hlophe 's alleged approach to the judges .
But , in what appears to be a broader warning over threats to the independence of the judiciary , the constitutional court statement goes on to say that independent courts , applying the law "" impartially and without fear , favour or prejudice "" , are a cornerstone of South Africa 's new democracy . ""
Any attempt to influence this or any other court outside proper court proceedings therefore not only violates the specific provisions of the constitution regarding the role and function of courts , but also threatens the administration of justice in our country and indeed the democratic nature of the state , "" the statement says .
"" This court - and indeed all courts in our country - will not yield to or tolerate unconstitutional , illegal and inappropriate attempts to undermine their independence or impartiality .
Judges and other judicial officers will continue - to the very best of their ability - to adjudicate all matters before them in accordance with the oath or solemn affirmation they took , guided only by the constitution and the law . ""
Hlophe was the subject of a curtailed inquiry by the JSC last year after he "" inappropriately "" failed to disclose that he accepted money from a management company while ruling in favour of it in a legal case .
The commission said his explanation was "" unsatisfactory "" but discontinued the inquiry without explanation .
A former constitutional court judge , Johann Kriegler , said that Hlophe was guilty of "" grossly improper conduct "" and was not fit to be a judge . ""
Judge Hlophe is not a fit and proper person to be a judge .
His retention of office constitutes a threat to the dignity and public acceptance of the integrity of the courts , "" Kriegler wrote .
Eight senior members of the Cape Bar , including former judges , backed Kriegler and publicly called on Hlophe to resign .
They said the commission 's decision to end the inquiry was "" puzzling "" . ""
Public confidence in the JSC as principled upholder of judicial independence and integrity may not have been served by these events , "" they said in a letter to a Cape Town newspaper ."
2008-07-19,"Five hundred guests and a Xhosa choir , singing '
Here is our hope ! '
, greeted Nelson Mandela yesterday for a formal celebration of his 90th birthday at his home in Qunu , in the Eastern Cape .
Mandela walked into the party tent outside his homestead with his successor as South Africa 's President , Thabo Mbeki , and African National Congress leader Jacob Zuma .
Zuma called the gathering a celebration of ' a life and legacy of a father , grandfather , comrade , warrior , soldier , nation builder and statesman ' .
The former Zambian president , Kenneth Kaunda , and George Bizos , a veteran of the struggles against apartheid , also attended the festivities .
Nobel Peace Prize winner Mandela had celebrated privately with family on Friday , his actual birthday .
The former President was imprisoned for nearly 30 years for his fight against apartheid .
He was released in 1990 ."
2008-08-04,"Jacob Zuma , leader of the ruling African National Congress , yesterday asked the high court to quash corruption charges against him in a case that is likely to decide whether or not he will be South Africa 's next president .
Zuma faces more than a dozen charges of racketeering , corruption , money laundering and fraud - involving about 4 m rand ( £ 285,000 ) - as part of a wider investigation into alleged bribery in the country 's largest weapons - buying deal .
But the ANC accuses prosecutors of "" political persecution "" and the judiciary of "" mobilising "" against Zuma in a confrontation that some see as one of the severest tests to date of South Africa 's newly established democratic institutions .
On Friday the chief justice , Pius Langa , in a thinly veiled reference to vitriolic criticism by Zuma 's supporters , warned that personal and political attacks on the judiciary threatened to subvert the "" very foundation of democracy "" .
Zuma 's lawyers told the high court that the prosecution was illegitimate because it reversed an earlier decision by a former director of public prosecutions not to pursue the case .
Pierre Moynot , the head of the South African arm of Thint , a French weapons manufacturer , is charged with bribing Zuma .
Zuma 's former financial adviser , Schabir Shaik , is serving a 15-year prison term for procuring bribes on Zuma 's behalf .
The judge in the case said there was "" overwhelming "" evidence of a corrupt relationship between Shaik and Zuma .
That case led President Thabo Mbeki to sack Zuma as the country 's deputy president , opening a bitter rift between the two men that has Zuma 's supporters accusing the president of pursuing a political prosecution against him .
A conviction would not only see Zuma sentenced to a long jail term but scupper his attempt to replace Mbeki as president in next year 's election .
The case before the Pietermaritzburg high court , even if unsuccessful , is likely to delay a full trial .
The ANC leadership has attempted to pressure the judiciary by alleging a judicial conspiracy against Zuma after the constitutional court ruled last week that prosecutors legally seized documents crucial to their case .
The Communist party secretary - general , Blade Nzimande , called the constitutional court judgment "" vindictive "" .
The controversy deepened after Langa gave his speech in which he called for an end to attacks on the judiciary , in part because the judge presiding over the ANC leader 's case , Chris Nicholson , was in the audience .
Another vocal Zuma supporter , Zwelinzima Vavi , leader of South Africa 's trades union confederation , said : "" We believe he is innocent .
We believe he 's being treated unfairly .
He 's not above the law but hands off our president . ""
Nelson Mandela waded into the row with a call at the weekend for the institutions of South Africa 's recent democracy to be respected ."
2008-08-04,"More than 1,000 people turned out today to cheer Jacob Zuma , the leader of South Africa 's ruling African National Congress party , as he arrived in court to try to get corruption and fraud charges against him dropped .
Followers staging a vigil sang the anti - apartheid song Bring Me My Machine Gun - now a Zuma anthem - as they awaited the hearing in Maritzburg , in KwaZuluNatal province .
They stood chanting as their hero appeared , smiling and dressed in a grey suit .
The ANC leader , and state president - in - waiting , hopes to stop prosecutors putting him on trial later this year .
If the case goes ahead , it could overlap with general elections next year , threatening instability in Africa 's largest economy and jeopardising Zuma 's hopes of succeeding Thabo Mbeki as leader of South Africa .
Zuma denies charges of corruption , fraud , money laundering and racketeering , saying he will stand down if convicted .
The allegations stem from a multibillion - rand arms deal involving the French company Thint in 1999 .
Zuma 's lawyer , Kemp J Kemp , argued in court today that the South African authorities had failed to follow constitutional procedures .
The ANC leader 's supporters say the charges are politically motivated .
His strong union links worry some investors in South Africa , who believe Mbeki is more pro - business .
Zuma won the ANC leadership from Mbeki last December .
He was fired as deputy president in 2005 after being implicated in a corruption case in which his former financial adviser was convicted .
Charges against Zuma were dismissed for technical reasons , but the National Prosecuting Authority charged him with corruption again soon after he took over as ANC head .
The party said in a statement : "" Throughout the investigation and prosecution of this case , the ANC president has had his rights repeatedly violated by institutions of the state . ""
A placard held up outside the court read : "" More of persecution than prosecution . ""
Zuma tried to quash the prosecution before it reached court , but last week the constitutional court upheld a ruling that raids on Zuma and his lawyer were valid , and that thousands of seized documents could be used against him .
The hearing is expected to finish tomorrow ."
2008-08-04,"Jacob Zuma , president of the African National Congress , was in court yet again today when he appeared before Justice Chris Nicholson in Pietermaritzburg .
Nicholson has to rule on a very technical question of whether or not the corruption and fraud charges levelled against Zuma by the national prosecution service can go ahead or not .
Zuma 's supporters in the Communist party , the trade unions and the ANC have vowed to pack Pietermaritzburg city centre and create as much pressure as they can on the court .
Indeed , there is much wild talk among the Zuma - ites about how the judges are "" mobilising "" against their champion and how they "" will not tolerate "" an adverse verdict .
Such talk has created considerable worries about how safe the rule of law is likely to be under a Zuma presidency and the long list of charges against Zuma has also convinced many that he is an extraordinarily crooked man .
Such concerns have been strengthened by two recent legal developments – the constitutional court 's ruling that documents seized by the state from Zuma 's attorneys may be used against him and the decision of a Mauritian court that documents securely held on that island may be released for use against Zuma .
Such developments give the impression of a legal net closing upon JZ , as he is popularly known .
In fact , such impressions are somewhat misleading on several counts .
First , Zuma is not more corrupt than a whole raft of ANC politicians .
Yesterday the Sunday Times ( Johannesburg ) published allegations that President Mbeki received a R30 m ( £ 2 m ) bribe from the arms deal .
Mbeki 's office denies this
but there is no suggestion of a presidential libel writ .
Second , the wild threats of Zuma 's supporters essentially reflect the fact that they all assume that provided their man becomes president they will all gain greater power , nice jobs and a chance to get their hand in the till .
They feel they have earned this by successfully defeating Mbeki at last year 's ANC conference in Polokwane and any threat to a Zuma presidency is therefore seen as a belated and illegitimate attempt to prevent them from joining the gravy train .
They are not really making points about the rule of law or the judicial system so much as declaring their sincere determination to become rich .
In fact the Zuma strategy has been to do everything possible to seek legal delays .
Even if Nicholson comes down against Zuma today , the constitutional court 's ruling puts vast numbers of documents back into play .
It should be easy for Zuma 's team to demand six months to study them .
And already Zuma 's attorney , Michael Hulley , has said that if Zuma loses today , he will appeal , a process likely to take two years .
But Zuma is likely to become South Africa 's next president in April or , at the latest , May next year .
He can then appoint a new public prosecutor who immediately withdraws the case against Zuma and , if necessary , the ANC majority in parliament could ram through a constitutional amendment preventing the prosecution of a sitting president .
So , barring an unforeseen mishap , Zuma is almost home and dry .
No wonder that , at the weekend , he gave a speech in which he said he 'd like to be a one - term president , but in which he also visualised a possible second term as well ."
2008-08-05,"Jacob Zuma , the African National Congress leader , will have to wait until next month to find out whether corruption charges against him will be dropped after a judge in South Africa today reserved his judgment .
Zuma , who is likely to succeed Thabo Mbeki as president next year , is accused of racketeering , corruption , money - laundering and fraud .
He has asked the high court in Maritzburg , KwaZulu Natal , to dismiss the charges , which are part an investigation into wider bribery allegations surrounding the country 's biggest arms deal in 1999 .
The hearing had been expected to end today , but the judge , Chris Nicholson , said he was "" minded to give judgment in about a month 's time on the 12th of September "" .
The delay comes amid rising political tensions in South Africa 's hard - won democracy .
A bitter rift has opened between Mbeki and Zuma , whose supporters accuse Mbeki and the country 's judiciary of pursuing a political prosecution .
Zuma 's lawyers yesterday argued that the prosecution was illegitimate as it reversed an earlier decision by a chief prosecutor in 2003 not to pursue the case .
The prosecuting lawyer , Wim Trengove , today said some of the objections made on Zuma 's behalf were "" scurrilous and irrelevant "" and "" apparently for public consumption with no bearing on the case "" .
Senior ANC figures packed court benches and a large crowd of supporters demonstrated outside for a second day , accompanied again by the anti - apartheid song
Bring Me My Machine Gun , which has become a Zuma anthem .
Pierre Moynot , head of the South African arm of Thint , a French weapons manufacturer , is charged with bribing Zuma .
Zuma 's former financial adviser Schabir Shaik is serving a 15-year prison sentence for securing bribes on Zuma 's behalf .
The judge in that case said there was "" overwhelming evidence "" of a corrupt relationship between Shaik and Zuma .
The case led Mbeki to sack Zuma as deputy president in 2005 .
If Nicholson decides to let the case go ahead , Zuma could face trial later this year - leaving South Africa in a legal and political quandrary , because proceedings would be unlikely to end before elections next year that are certain to be won by the ANC .
As ANC leader , Zuma is expected to become president ."
2008-08-11,"German industrial giant MAN Ferrostaal has issued an unequivocal denial that it made payments to South Africa 's president Thabo Mbeki , the ANC leader Jacob Zuma and other ANC members following a report in the country 's best - selling newspaper , the Sunday Times .
MAN Ferrostaal said : "" These allegations are wrong and entirely unfounded . ""
Legal action is being considered .
( Via IOL )"
2008-09-12,"Jacob Zuma today took a giant step towards South Africa 's presidency after he was effectively cleared of corruption charges .
He must now be considered the overwhelming favourite to succeed Thabo Mbeki as president in 2009 – having spent years winning over the millions of black South Africans who have gained little from post - apartheid rule .
The 66-year - old will be delighted by the decision of judge Chris Nicholson , who ruled that government prosecutors were wrong to charge Zuma with corruption .
The ANC leader will no doubt see it as yet another victory against a plot to keep him from office .
Just how the enigmatic politician has continued to build his influence , despite numerous court appearances , has to be a cause for concern .
At his trial for rape in 2006 , of which he was acquitted , Zuma revealed beliefs that might not be expected to boost the career hopes of a would - be president .
He told the court that his accuser , the 31-year - old daughter of a family friend , had led him to believe she wanted sex by complaining that she had no boyfriend , and by not crossing her legs while wearing a knee - length skirt .
He saw little risk in unprotected sex with the HIV - positive Aids activist , the court heard , because he had showered afterwards .
The nature of his defence did nothing to endear him to women 's equality campaigners , nor those fighting the rampant spread of Aids in southern Africa - particularly as he is chairman of the country 's Aids council .
But it did little to dampen the enthusiasm of his supporters , who provided a jamboree atmosphere outside the Johannesburg courthouse during last year 's trial , chanting "" Burn the bitch "" as his accuser arrived in court .
Pandemonium erupted when the not - guilty verdict was announced .
Ten men in leopard - skin skirts jumped on the benches , dancing and singing My President in his praise .
Zuma was born in Inkandla , KwaZulu - Natal province , in 1942 .
After his father 's death at the end of the second world war he accompanied his mother to Durban , where she became a domestic worker .
He received no formal schooling .
Influenced by a relative who was a fervent union member , he joined the African National Congress in 1959 .
Zuma rose in the ANC 's military wing to become head of intelligence .
Like Nelson Mandela , he was imprisoned on Robben Island for conspiring to overthrow white rule , spending 10 years in jail before going into exile .
As an ethnic Zulu , his position in the ANC strikes a balance in an organisation perceived to be dominated by the Xhosa tribe of Mandela and Thabo Mbeki , who is now president .
He retains a solid core of supporters , particularly among the least educated and unemployed .
Zuma , who has two wives as is common in Zulu culture , was South Africa 's deputy president for six years before being sacked in June 2005 over corruption allegations .
His financial manager , Schabir Shaik , a friend from the anti - apartheid years , was convicted of fraud and corruption .
The judge in the case said the two had a "" generally corrupt "" relationship .
Zuma 's support has traditionally come from his Zulu heartland , trade unions and left - leaning politicians who are increasingly unhappy with the free market macro - economic policies of Mbeki .
His supporters , stoked by a belief that the court cases are politically motivated , are increasingly coming from a broader church , including young people and even the women 's league of the ANC .
In December last year , one of South Africa 's most prominent businessmen , Tokyo Sexwale , a billionaire who until recently was also a candidate for the ANC leadership , threw his weight behind Zuma .
The media limelight that Zuma has both enjoyed and endured has allowed him to set out his stall , demonstrating his common touch .
He has shown a flair for dancing at political events , adopting an ANC anthem , the lyrics of which roughly translate as "" bring me my machine gun "" ."
2008-09-12,"Although South Africa 's high court today ruled the fraud and corruption charges against Jacob Zuma , leader of the country 's ruling African National Congress , were invalid because prosecutors had failed to follow proper procedure , the country and the ANC will be better off if Zuma lets go of his all - consuming obsession to become the country 's next president .
As president of the ANC , Zuma is in a position to be proposed by the party 's members at a yet - to - be - scheduled national nominations conference of the party , required by its constitution .
South Africa 's President Thabo Mbeki 's second , and last , term ends next year .
Judge Chris Nicholson 's decision in the Pietermaritzburg high court today clears a significant hurdle for 66-year - old Zuma , to secure the party 's nomination as presidential candidate .
Such is the ANC 's political dominance , that whoever the party chooses will be assured of victory in next year 's general elections .
Zuma faced 12 charges of fraud , corruption and racketeering , including receiving bribes totalling $ 500,000 from arms dealers .
Importantly , Judge Nicholson emphasised that he was not giving a verdict on whether Zuma was innocent or guilty and said prosecutors were free to bring charges again .
However , this is the second favourable judgment for Zuma on procedural grounds , and the increased political pressure is now likely to come from Zuma 's buoyant backers , who will make it very difficult for prosecutors to press their charges .
Zuma is now preparing a petition to have his case permanently dismissed , arguing that his right to a fair trial has now been irrevocably compromised .
Yet , not defending himself in court will forever leave a cloud of suspicion over Zuma .
Judge Nicholson ruled that the national prosecuting authority should have consulted Zuma – the basis of the ANC leader 's complaint – before they pressed corruption charges against him in 2007 .
Mbeki fired Zuma from his post as deputy president in 2005 when the latter 's financial advisor , Schabir Shaik , was found guilty of bribing Zuma and given a 15-year jail sentence .
What is not in dispute is that in power , Mbeki and his associates routinely abused public institutions to launch vendettas against their critics .
Judge Nicholson rightly said as much in his judgment .
Yet Zuma 's supporters have attacked the judiciary , democratic institutions , the media and critics to such an extent that the country 's not - yet - consolidated constitutional system , institutions and values are at the same risk now as they were from Mbeki 's previous manipulation of them .
South Africa 's most effective crime - fighting unit , the directorate for special prosecutions , called the Scorpions , which brought the corruption charges against Zuma in the first place , is about to be closed , following a Zuma dominated - ANC leadership decision , that they have been used as part of a political conspiracy to prevent him from becoming president , and so must be abolished .
Yet South Africa is facing a terrible crime wave .
Parliament is supposed to decide whether to close the Scorpions , rather than the ANC , which appears to remain largely ineffective under Zuma , as it was under Mbeki .
The answer to the abuse of security and intelligence institutions is not to close down the most effective ones , but to increase their democratic accountability .
Furthermore , although Zuma was acquitted of rape in 2006 , the appalling statements he made in his defence make him unsuitable for the South African presidency .
In a country struggling with high incidents of violence against women , he claimed that he could see by the way a woman sat or wore clothes that they were looking for sex and that he was obliged to return in kind .
Throughout the hearing of the rape case in court , his accuser was vilified outside the courthouse by Zuma 's supporters :
effigies of her were burned and she was called a bitch .
Zuma was remarkably silent about all this .
Making Zuma president of South Africa will not end the leadership vacuum in the ANC and the country , but may actually worsen it .
The ANC leadership must offer the job of presidential candidate to either the ANC deputy president , Kgalema Motlanthe , the party 's treasurer , Mathews Phosa , NEC member Cyril Ramaphosa or former Gauteng premier Tokyo Sexwale .
If necessary , Zuma could remain president of the party .
The lingering questions over his involvement in corruption , if he does not answer those allegations fully in court , and the affects of his supporters ' attacks on the judiciary , democratic institutions and the media , will continue to paralyse the government , erode public confidence and undermine democracy .
The urgent need for the rejuvenation of South Africa 's democracy , political culture and institutions will require fresh ideas , inclusivity , and a different cast of leaders at the top .
Above all , to tackle the pervasive air of corruption , total honesty is needed .
Zuma is too compromised .
The real reason why more reasonable members of the ANC left have embraced him , is their fear of being marginalised and the issues they stand up for , including the pressing issue of poverty , marginalised with them .
The marginalisation of poverty and the sidelining of talent of all of South Africa 's people , whatever their ideology or colour , which have sadly occurred under Mbeki 's presidency , are the real issues that must be addressed .
South Africa needs a less divisive and more unifying leader , and a clean break from the two factions –
Mbeki and Zuma – currently paralysing the ANC , government and South Africa .
All four leaders , Motlanthe , Phosa , Ramaphosa and Sexwale , also present a clear generational change , and the fresh blood and renewal we need ."
2008-09-12,"A South African judge today ruled that government prosecutors were wrong to charge Jacob Zuma , the head of the ruling African National Congress ( ANC ) , with corruption .
The controversial ruling effectively clears the way for the 66-year - old to succeed Thabo Mbeki as the country 's president .
Judge Chris Nicholson reserved strong criticism for prosecutors and political leaders , including Mbeki .
His ruling said there was reason to believe the decision to charge Zuma had been politically motivated and that the party leader should have been consulted before the national prosecuting authority sought his conviction .
As the head of the ruling ANC , Zuma , a former freedom fighter , is likely to run for president next year when Mbeki 's second and final term ends .
The party 's political dominance all
but assures its leader of victory in the presidential race .
Following a two - hour - long reading of his ruling , the high court judge said that the decision to "" prosecute the applicant [ was ] … invalid and is set aside "" .
"" I 'm not convinced that the applicant was incorrect in averring political meddling in his prosecution , "" he said , expressing concern that prosecutors were influenced by members of Mbeki 's cabinet .
He said it was "" improbable "" the ministers had acted without Mbeki 's knowledge and agreement , adding that the episode seemed to have formed part of "" some great political contest or game "" .
Leading ANC officials and Zuma supporters in the packed courtroom broke into cheers in scenes broadcast on national television .
The jubilant Zuma embraced his lawyer .
Nicholson warned that his ruling did not touch on guilt or innocence , and said prosecutors could file charges again once they had met the requirement of consulting with Zuma .
However , the national prosecuting authority will come under huge pressure not to file charges again .
Parliament is pushing through legislation to scrap its elite investigating unit , the Scorpions , in response to ANC anger over what it sees as a persecution of Zuma .
Even some business leaders have suggested that charges against Zuma should be dropped in the interests of future political stability in Africa 's economic powerhouse .
Tensions in South Africa have mounted over recent weeks , with Zuma supporters threatening to make the country ungovernable if his trial went ahead .
Influential ANC Youth League leaders said they were prepared to kill and die for Zuma .
He is hugely popular among poor South Africans who feel alienated by Mbeki 's perceived intellectual aloofness and are tired of waiting for their living conditions to improve 14 years after the end of apartheid .
Even though Mbeki is barred by the constitution from running again for the nation 's presidency , he competed against Zuma for the party leadership , apparently trying to exercise control over who should succeed him .
Mbeki 's spokesman , Mukoni Ratshitanga , said he could not immediately comment on the Zuma judgment because of its length .
"" One would have to look at the judgment before any comments are made , if comments are necessary , "" he added .
Zuma was initially charged with corruption in 2005 , but that case was dismissed on a technicality in 2006 .
He was charged again in December 2007 - days after being elected as the ANC president - with racketeering , corruption , money laundering and fraud related to a government arms deal in the late 1990s .
Zuma – who was acquitted of rape in 2006 - has used his legal battles to burnish his populist reputation , portraying himself as a victim of a plot by the elite to keep the son of a maid out of the president 's office ."
2008-09-12,"Jacob Zuma , the leader of the ANC overcame a big obstacle to becoming South Africa 's next president yesterday when a high court judge threw out fraud and corruption charges against him .
Judge Chris Nicholson criticised prosecutors and upheld Zuma 's claim that he was the victim of politically motivated charges , saying there was "" a ring of Kafka "" to the prosecution .
Zuma was accused of racketeering , money laundering , corruption and fraud relating to arms deals with Britain , France and Germany .
Nicholson threw out the prosecution on procedural grounds but ruled that there was nothing to prevent the state from relaunching the prosecution .
But his criticism of the group around Thabo Mbeki , the president , for their handling of the prosecution made it almost impossible for the state to continue pursuing Zuma in the courts .
In yesterday 's judgement Nicholson said his ruling had nothing to do with Zuma 's guilt , or innocence .
But he said that the decision to prosecute Zuma appeared to have been politically motivated .
"" I 'm not convinced that the applicant was incorrect in averring political meddling in his prosecution , "" he said .
He said Zuma should have been consulted before the national prosecuting authority resurrected corruption charges against him last year .
The entire episode appears to have formed part of "" some great political contest or game , "" Nicholson said .
"" There is a ring of the works of Kafka in this . ""
The decision to "" prosecute the applicant is invalid and is set aside "" , said the judge .
There was jubilation in court as the judge completed his two - hour verdict , broadcast live on national television .
Addressing an estimated 10,000 supporters outside the court house , Zuma said the case was a lesson to anyone who abuses power .
"" It is a victory for democracy , "" he said .
"" It is a victory for our justice system , "" he added , before yielding to pleas from the crowd to sing the anti - apartheid song
Bring Me My Machine Gun .
The ANC said the judgement vindicated their view that the prosecuting authority "" acted as though it was a law unto itself "" and that Zuma has been the "" subject of a vindictive prosecution "" .
Zuma , 66 , was charged in 2005 , but that case was dismissed on a technicality in 2006 .
He was charged again last December days after ousting Mbeki as ANC chief .
As head of the ANC , Zuma is to run for president next year when Mbeki 's second , and last , term ends , and is all but certain to win , given the ANC 's dominance .
Zuma , who had no formal schooling , is popular among poor South Africans who have become tired of waiting for their living conditions to improve 14 years after the end of apartheid .
But he also has sought to reach out to the white minority and to reassure investors and the business community that he would not lead South Africa down Zimbabwe 's ruinous path .
Some business leaders had even suggested that charges against Zuma should be dropped in the interests of the future stability of Africa 's most powerful economy .
There was particular nervousness over threats by Zuma supporters to make the country ungovernable should the case against him proceed .
Tensions had increased in recent weeks as influential ANC youth league leaders had vowed to "" kill "" and "" die "" for Zuma ."
2008-09-14,"For Thabo Mbeki , it could have been the day that restored a reputation battered by perverse policies on HIV / Aids and Machiavellian strategies : the signing of a deal he brokered to end Zimbabwe 's political crisis and silence those who scorned his "" quiet diplomacy "" with Robert Mugabe .
Instead , South Africa 's president will spend this week fighting for his political life as his party debates whether to remove him from office after a damning court ruling that accused Mbeki of apartheid - style tactics in illegally abusing the justice system to try and prevent Jacob Zuma from becoming the country 's next leader .
The agreement in Zimbabwe today is a major triumph for Mbeki who managed to press Mugabe into conceding many of his powers to Morgan Tsvangirai .
But that will count for little at home as leaders of Mbeki 's African National Congress decide his future following Friday 's ruling in which a high court judge , Chris Nicholson , threw out corruption charges against Zuma and said that the prosecution was the result of "" baleful political influence "" .
Nicholson said that Mbeki and members of his cabinet had abused the prosecuting authority in an attempt to remove Zuma from the "" titanic political struggle "" for control of the ANC .
The judge likened Mbeki 's actions to those of apartheid - era governments for inducing two successive heads of the prosecutions authority to commit "" a very serious criminal offence "" by pursuing a political prosecution . ""
In terms of the law , more especially emanating from the constitution , there is responsibility attributable to the president , "" the judge said .
Now Zuma and his supporters are preparing to take revenge on Mbeki .
The ANC national executive and its trade union confederation and Communist party allies are to discuss his future this week .
The ANC 's chief whip in parliament , Nathi Mthethwa , told Johannesburg 's City Press newspaper that it is not a question of if , but when , the party will move against Mbeki . ""
As a leader of the ANC , you can not be implicated of [ sic ] plotting the downfall of your comrade and people then pretend as if nothing has happened , "" he said .
A senior ANC leader told Johannesburg 's Sunday Times newspaper that Mbeki had to go . ""
The most obvious ( position ) would be to appoint a delegation that will ask him to step down , "" he said .
Another ANC official told the paper that Mbeki would "" be pushed on ( to ) his sword if he ca n't fall on his sword "" .
Mbeki can be removed through a vote of no confidence or by calling an early election .
The ANC holds 293 of the 400 seats in parliament so if the party leadership decided to force the president out it could almost certainly win the necessary majority among ANC MPs with an eye to their future selection as candidates at the next election .
If that happened , the speaker would become acting president until parliament elected a new president , almost certainly Zuma .
If an early election is called instead , Mbeki would remain president until the vote within 90 days ."
2008-09-17,"Prosecutors said yesterday that they would appeal against a judge 's ruling last Friday dismissing fraud and corruption charges against Jacob Zuma , the president of the African National Congress .
Zuma 's supporters have accused President Thabo Mbeki of using the corruption case to derail Zuma 's political ambitions .
As the ANC head , Zuma is in line to stand for president next year , when Mbeki completes his second and final term .
Zuma , 66 , was charged in 2005 , but that case was dismissed in 2006 .

2008-09-18,"The ruling African National Congress begins a meeting tomorrow to decide whether to remove Thabo Mbeki as South Africa 's president after a high court judge accused him of misusing the justice system in a bitter power struggle with his archrival , Jacob Zuma .
If the party leadership votes to "" recall "" Mbeki from office he will immediately be asked to resign .
If he refuses to go , parliament is likely to vote to remove him - bringing a premature end to a presidency launched on the vision of leading an African renaissance but long tainted by his policies on HIV / Aids and an authoritarian and vindictive style of governing .
Powerful ANC figures have thrown their weight behind the proposal to sack Mbeki after a high court judge effectively accused him of using apartheid - style tactics in engineering the prosecution of Jacob Zuma for corruption in order to block him from becoming party leader .
South Africa 's Business Day newspaper reported today that the ANC 's powerful national working committee resolved on Monday to seek Mbeki 's swift resignation .
Its recommendation now has to be approved by the party 's national executive , which meets over the next three days .
Zuma has been cautious about removing Mbeki from office .
Earlier this week he told party activists it was not worth wasting energy on a "" dead snake "" , indicating that he wanted to avoid a confrontation that would highlight divisions and could cost the party votes when there will be an election in May in any case .
"" We ca n't hold debates among ourselves that raise the temperature .
There is an administration that is coming to an end , so if you do so , you are like someone who beats a dead snake .
It died a long time ago , but you are still beating it ... wasting your energy , "" he said .
If Zuma remains set against sacking the president , it will be the most important test of his authority within the ANC since he ousted Mbeki as party leader late last year .
But the determination of some of Mbeki 's opponents to remove him from office was stiffened yesterday after the prosecutions authority said it would appeal against the high court quashing of the corruption charges against Zuma .
That infuriated some of Zuma 's supporters who said it was further evidence that prosecutors were acting on behalf of Mbeki .
The ANC 's treasurer general , Mathews Phosa , who was once accused by Mbeki of plotting a coup , hinted yesterday that the president will be forced to go .
Phosa noted that Mbeki had himself sacked Zuma as deputy president three years ago after a judge accused him of corruption . ""
The events of 2005 , when a judge also made a ruling and leaders , including the president , acted on that ruling , contain some guidelines for handling this situation , "" he said .
The ANC youth league and the party 's Communist allies are lobbying hard to remove Mbeki .
The secretary of the Young Communist League , Buti Manamela , said he believes the president will be forced out . ""
Come Monday , they are going to pronounce that President Thabo Mbeki is going to be released because he is no longer capable of leading the country , "" he said .
The ANC leadership is almost certain to be able to muster a simple majority in parliament for a vote of no confidence in the government , which would force an early election .
Most of the party 's MPs are likely to have an eye on ensuring selection as candidates for the next election .
Alternatively , the party could try to impeach Mbeki but that would require a two - thirds majority and the support of some opposition MP 's .
If parliament does remove Mbeki , the speaker , Baleka Mbete , will become acting president .
But Mbeki is not expected to go down without a fight .
His cabinet issued a statement today saying it will seek legal advice on the high court ruling and its accusations of political interference in the Zuma case .
Mbeki 's allies then suggested that the ANC could not move against him while the high court ruling is still under appeal . ""
Cabinet respects the judiciary and its decisions , "" the government spokesperson , Themba Maseko , told a media briefing after the meeting . ""
However , cabinet does not accept the suggestion that either the president or the executive interfered with the prosecuting decisions of the National Prosecuting Authority regarding the prosecution of any person or persons . ""
The judge may not have had all the facts in front of him when he reached that conclusion . """
2008-09-18,"Thabo Mbeki , the South African president , could be removed from office within days and replaced by an interim leader , it was reported today .
Local media said senior African National Congress ( ANC ) figures had decided Mbeki 's position was untenable after a court found that he influenced prosecutors to bring fraud and corruption charges against his rival and successor as the party 's president , Jacob Zuma .
The Johannesburg newspaper Business Day reported that the ANC 's powerful national working committee ( NWC ) resolved on Monday to lobby for Mbeki 's resignation , and that senior party leaders were discussing an exit strategy with Mbeki .
The website news24.com said Mbeki could be replaced by Baleka Mbete , the speaker of the national assembly , within days .
The party 's national executive ( NEC ) is due to meet tomorrow to discuss Mbeki 's future .
The NWC 's resolution has been sent to the executive , according to Business Day .
But the party 's national spokeswoman , Jessie Duarte , yesterday said it was premature to speculate about Mbeki 's removal .
"" This is too important an issue and no one except the NEC can take this decision .
Rumours that the leadership has already made a decision are nonsense , "" she told news24.com .
Mbeki 's position has come under pressure after a judge last week upheld claims by Zuma , who replaced Mbeki as ANC president and is almost certain to replace him as the country 's leader , that charges levelled against him were politically motivated .
Throwing out the case against Zuma , judge Chris Nicholson expressed concern that prosecutors were influenced by members of Mbeki 's cabinet and said it was "" improbable "" the ministers had acted without Mbeki 's knowledge and agreement .
Yesterday 's decision of the national prosecuting authority to seek leave to appeal against Nicholson 's judgment has only added to the fury of Zuma 's supporters .
The ANC youth league has publicly said it will press the NEC to remove Mbeki and that a majority of NEC members want Mbeki removed .
Zuma , who heads the NWC , initially showed caution about removing Mbeki .
He has refused to comment on the latest round of media reports .
Business Day reported sources close to Mbeki as saying he would launch a "" multi - pronged fightback campaign "" .
The South African government spokesman Themba Maseko today said Mbeki and his cabinet were considering a legal challenge to part of Nicholson 's judgment . ""
Cabinet has decided to seek legal advice on the inferences made by judge Nicholson that President Thabo Mbeki and the executive interfered with the NPA regarding the decision to prosecute Mr Jacob Zuma , "" he said ."

2008-09-19,"President Thabo Mbeki 's political future hung in the balance today as South Africa 's ruling party debated whether to force him from office .
Claims from a leading former judge that Mbeki should be put on trial for allegedly misusing his power to try to imprison the man likely to succeed him , Jacob Zuma , added to the uncertainty .
The African National Congress national executive began a three - day meeting at which Mbeki 's future will be decided after a high court judge accused the president and senior justice officials of an illegal conspiracy to charge Zuma for political ends .
Before the meeting , Mbeki launched a robust defence of his actions saying in a statement that the "" insults hurled "" at him are not based on facts .
The president said that "" for the record "" he denied any involvement in the decision to prosecute Zuma and that "" no evidence has been provided by those making the claim "" .
But Mbeki was delivered another blow before the meeting began when one of the country 's most respected former judges , Willem Heath , called for the president , his former justice minister , Penuell Maduna , and the former chief prosecutor , Bulelani Ngcuka , to be charged with crimes for pursuing a political prosecution .
Heath told a Johannesburg newspaper , the Mail and Guardian , that South Africans need protecting from the "" systematic abuse , detailed in the judgment , of organs of state by the president and his purported henchmen "" .
"" If the behaviour found by Nicholson is not addressed , the application of the principle of the separation of powers will remain at the whim of those who have seemingly been using it most effectively for personal gain , "" said Heath .
"" The findings of Judge Chris Nicholson … will profoundly impact on South Africa .

Some senior party officials said they would not support ousting Mbeki because of the damage it would do to the party .

The recalling or impeachment of the president will lead to the collapse of the current executive and would plunge the country into an ... unnecessary crisis .
The negative political and economic repercussions of such an induced collapse are too ghastly to contemplate . """
2008-09-20,"Thabo Mbeki 's ousting was painted yesterday by African National Congress secretary - general Gwede Mantashe as a means to salvage unity in the ruling party .
But his removal has everything to do with political score - settling aimed at clearing the name of Jacob Zuma , the presumed next President of South Africa after elections next year .
Opposition leader Helen Zille said the move ' has nothing to do with unity and everything to do with Zuma 's people now getting their hands on , and suppressing , paperwork detailing 783 bribes totalling 4.2 m rands ( £ 275,000 ) ' , allegedly paid between 1999 and 2005 when Mbeki sacked Zuma as deputy president .
But Mbeki 's departure is no surprise .
His presidential post has been under threat ever since December last year when the ANC conference in Polokwane humiliatingly elected Zuma to the ANC presidency .
He should have resigned then , rather than wait for Judge Chris Nicholson - in his judgment 10 days ago over the credibility of the Zuma case - to imply that Mbeki had interfered with the judiciary to nail his old rival .
In the end Mbeki , the past master of co - option who since succeeding Nelson Mandela in 1999 has brought old apartheid foes into line , cut a lonely figure as his destiny was sealed .
The assertion by Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo - Ngcuka that she would resign in solidarity had no impact .
What the Zuma camp is believed to have obtained - during a week of furious behind - the - scenes negotiations - is a pledge from Finance Minister Trevor Manuel that he would stay on .
Highly regarded internationally , Manuel is the rambunctious Zuma camp 's ticket to international credibility .
At home it is easy to confuse the will of ordinary South Africans - millions of whom have not had a taste of the country 's annual 4 per cent growth rate in Mbeki 's nine years - with the vengeful offensive of the Zuma camp , personified by ANC Youth League leader Julius Malema , who ever since the Polokwane conference has been pledging to ' kill ' and ' crush ' in Zuma 's name .
Malema frightens people , and it will be an early test of Zuma 's political credibility if he manages to shed him now .
Mbeki , the black Englishman with sharp intellect and Machiavellian tendencies , has impressed abroad more than at home .
He devised the African Renaissance , put Africa on the G8 agenda and oversaw the creation of the African Union .
Like the late , great Prime Minister Jan Smuts - who established the League of Nations but was unpopular domestically - Mbeki revels in international diplomacy , though the jury is still out on his work for Zimbabwe .
While Mbeki was seeming to fly the flag for South Africa , he was denying the link between HIV and Aids at home .
Thousands died while the government until four years ago blocked free access to anti - retrovirals even as drug prices were dropping .
His seeming determination to be ' in denial ' over South Africa 's rampant crime problem may also have claimed lives .
Mbeki , always aloof and uncomfortable on the hustings , never connected with the ANC 's grassroots .
He neglected the party , whose left - wing alliance partners - the South African Communist party and the Cosatu trade union movement - picked up the pieces and shored up Zuma 's revenge .
At provincial level , the disarray has grown into infighting .
Almost every week , at local party meetings , militants come to blows or are killed .
The control of resources and patronage has trumped political ideology .
Mbeki loyalists - those who remain - suggest that Zuma 's camp is the one that operates on patronage .
But there is also evidence of the reverse .
Mbeki has made a career out of co - opting his rivals or , failing that , of drumming them out of politics .
He succeeded in 2001 with Tokyo Sexwale and Cyril Ramaphosa after accusing them of plotting to depose him .
But sacking the stubborn , self - made and populist Zuma over corruption allegations in 2005 turned out to be his worst mistake .
The arms deal scandal left Zuma tainted , but Mbeki is tarred too ."
2008-09-21,"No one at the top of the ruling African National Congress admits it directly but the caretaker government that will take over after President Thabo Mbeki formally resigns will have one primary task - to keep the man the party wants to make the next elected president , Jacob Zuma , out of jail .
But to do that the new administration will have to do what the party accused Mbeki of when it toppled him this weekend - exerting political influence over the justice system .
The ANC secretary general , Gwede Mantashe , hinted as much in announcing that an important factor in the party 's decision to "" recall "" Mbeki was the national prosecutor 's plan to appeal against a high court judgment that threw out corruption charges against Zuma .
The judge , Chris Nicholson , accused Mbeki , members of his cabinet and the chief prosecutor of using apartheid - style tactics to prosecute Zuma as part of the "" titanic political struggle "" for control of the ANC .
With that ruling , Zuma 's supporters thought their man was off the hook and that , as the ANC leader , he had a clear run to be elected the country 's next president in May.
But then prosecutors announced their decision to appeal , a move the ANC leadership saw as an attempt by Mbeki to keep alive the judicial pursuit of Zuma . ""
The biggest worry of the ANC had been the question of a reversal of the closure of the chapter that the Nicholson judgment seemed to have promised , "" said Mantashe .
"" If pursued it will continue to be a point of division for the ANC .
We share ( people 's ) desire for stability and we believe our decision is in the interests of making that security "" .
The official opposition , the Democratic Alliance , said that , far from creating stability , forcing a sitting president from office in order to manipulate justice could only create insecurity .
The DA leader , Helen Zille , noted that while the high court stopped the prosecution because of alleged interference by Mbeki it did not clear Zuma of charges of taking bribes from a French arms company bidding for contracts in South Africa 's biggest weapons deal .
"" The move is clearly an attempt to find the political solution to Jacob Zuma 's legal problems that his supporters have been calling for , "" she said .
"" Replacing President Mbeki with a Zuma proxy will open the way for them to ensure that he does not have to face court to answer the 783 allegations of corruption against him .
If Zuma is put above the law it will do more to undermine the constitution than anything else .
"" It is untenable for Jacob Zuma to assume the presidency without being acquitted of these charges by a court of law .
Judge Nicholson 's judgment was not an acquittal . ""
But even if the prosecution goes ahead , it is unlikely to come to court before the general election and few in the ANC or outside of it imagine that a sitting president would allow himself to be put on trial .
One option for Zuma is for the interim president who will take over from Mbeki for the remainder of his term , or Zuma himself after next year 's election , to declare an amnesty for crimes associated with the arms deals .
Zuma is not the only one tainted by the scandal .
The ANC itself banked millions of pounds .
Zuma had threatened that if he was forced into court he would begin to name names .
An amnesty would get those others off the hook as well , including Zuma 's former financial adviser , Schabir Shaik , whose conviction in 2005 for bribing Zuma on behalf of a French arms company earned him 15 years in prison and launched the titanic battle with Mbeki that has brought down the second president of the post - apartheid era ."
2008-09-21,"Thabo Mbeki yesterday resigned as South Africa 's president and said he will leave office on a date set by parliament , after he was toppled by his own party following a long and bitter power struggle with his former deputy , Jacob Zuma .
Mbeki called an emergency meeting of his cabinet as many of his ministers threatened to resign in solidarity after the African National Congress on Saturday told the president to agree to step down or face being removed by parliament .
Mbeki handed his resignation letter to the speaker of parliament yesterday and in an unusually humble speech broadcast on national TV broadcaster SABC said he had decided to quit out of loyalty to the party that is rejecting him .
"" I have been a loyal member of the African National Congress for 52 years .
I remain a member of the ANC and therefore respect its decisions .
It is for this reason that I 've taken the decision to resign as president of the republic , "" he said .
But Mbeki "" categorically "" denied the central accusation against him that was the immediate cause of his forced resignation .
ANC leaders moved against the president after prosecutors said they would appeal against a high court decision that threw out corruption charges against Zuma , and accused Mbeki and his officials of abusing the courts as part of the power struggle over control of the party .
The president said he and his cabinet had not interfered in decisions as to who to prosecute . ""
This applies equally to the painful matter relating to the court proceedings against the president of the ANC , comrade Jacob Zuma , "" he said .
The constitution requires the deputy president , Phumzile Mlambo - Ngcuka , to take over as acting president , or the cabinet to appoint one from among themselves as soon as Mbeki resigns .
Within 30 days , parliament then selects an interim president to complete the rest of Mbeki 's term before a general election in about nine months .
The ANC is believed to favour a close Zuma ally for the role , the speaker of parliament and party chairperson , Baleka Mbete .
Zuma , who won the leadership election against Mbeki for control of the ANC late last year , is not a member of parliament and therefore can not be appointed .
But it is clear that he and his faction will soon be in charge of the government , solidifying a shift in power that began when Mbeki was removed as party leader .
It marks the end of nine years of Mbeki rule that began with the promise of South Africa leading an African renaissance , but ended with the humiliation of a president toppled by his alienation of much of his own party , in part because of policy differences with the left , but also because of his vindictive style of rule .
But many South Africans also see Mbeki 's downfall as principally intended to protect Zuma from prosecution for allegedly accepting bribes related to a multibillion - dollar arms deal .
The outgoing president set out what he sees as his legacy in building the economy , bringing peace to parts of Africa and empowering women .
However , Mbeki acknowledged that despite consistent economic growth , millions of South Africans remain mired in poverty .
Mbeki 's resignation was welcomed by many .
Critics of the president 's widely derided policies on Aids , such as Zackie Achmat , head of the Treatment Action Campaign , say he has abandoned hundreds of thousands of people in need of lifesaving treatment and should be called to account .
"" This is long overdue , "" said Achmat .
"" Personally , I would have liked to see him impeached for causing the deaths of many hundreds of thousands of people living with HIV ; for the corruption of the arms deal ; for the undermining of every independent state institution .
"" The leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance , Helen Zille , accused the ANC of putting its own political battles ahead of the national interest .
"" It is revenge , pure and simple .
It has everything to do with the internal battles of the ANC and nothing to do with the interest of South Africa , "" she said .
FW de Klerk , the last white president of South Africa , who negotiated an end to apartheid , was also critical of Mbeki 's dismissal .
"" All that I would like to say at the moment is that it is unfortunate that a sitting president should be forced from office before the end of his term , "" he said ."
2008-09-22,"Although Kgalema Motlanthe has been named as South Africa 's caretaker president , his rule could run beyond next year 's elections .
He is understood to be favoured by Jacob Zuma to become his deputy should Zuma become president .
Motlanthe , a left - leaning intellectual , is seen as a highly skilled political operator and the brains behind the Zuma faction .
He risked his political reputation by publicly defending Zuma in the face of corruption allegations after he was sacked by Thabo Mbeki as the country 's deputy president in 2005 .
During Zuma 's numerous court appearances , Motlanthe repeatedly said that his job was to "" accurately and as faithfully as possible "" reflect the views of ANC members .
The antipathy between Mbeki and Motlanthe became apparent during the row in 2005 over a series of hoax emails purporting to reveal a political conspiracy against Zuma .
Motlanthe insisted the emails were authentic and a plot existed .
Mbeki rejected any suggestion that a conspiracy existed and said the emails were fakes .
Motlanthe further angered Mbeki by rejecting his calls for action to be taken against the axed deputy health minister , Nozizwe Madlala - Routledge .
Motlanthe has never sought the limelight .
An article last year in South Africa 's Times newspaper described him as "" calm , respected and trust - inspiring "" with a "" ponderous "" political style that was highly regarded by most ANC members . ""
His is a patient and considered decision - making style with high regard for process and consultation .
He demonstrates a deep knowledge of the ANC way of doing things , coupled with a habit of constantly drawing on ANC historical knowledge and theoretical foundations , "" says the paper 's website .
Motlanthe is the youngest of 13 children .
His exact date of birth is unknown , but he is believed to be about 58 .
Initially influenced by the revolutionary ideologies of the Black Consciousness Movement of Steve Biko , he became a student activist , trade unionist and a soldier in the ANC 's now - disbanded military wing , UmKhonto we Sizwe .
Motlanthe was detained in 1976 for 11 months for pursuing the aims of the ANC liberation movement .
In 1977 , a year after the 1976 Soweto uprising , he was sentenced to 10 years ' imprisonment .
He was jailed on Robben Island with Nelson Mandela .
In 1992 he was elected as secretary general of the National Union of Mineworkers , where he honed his political skills .
He was elected as secretary general of the ANC in 1997 , when Cyril Ramaphosa left politics for business after losing to Mbeki in the bitter battle to succeed Mandela .
Motlanthe was elected as the ANC 's deputy president in December 2007 , beating the Mbeki camp 's choice of Nkosazana Dlamini - Zuma , the former wife of Jacob Zuma .
Mbeki later appointed him as a minister without portfolio in a step towards a smooth transition to a future Zuma government ."
2008-09-22,"South Africa 's ruling African National Congress made a significant shift to the left today by choosing a close ally of Jacob Zuma to replace his long - standing rival , Thabo Mbeki , as president .
Kgalema Motlanthe , a left - leaning intellectual , former political prisoner and trade unionist , is the current deputy ANC president is seen as the driving intellectual force behind Zuma .
His appointment comes after Mbeki formally resigned yesterday following a long and bitter power struggle with Zuma , his former deputy .
ANC MPs confirmed Motlanthe 's appointment during a meeting of the party 's parliamentary caucus , according to Reuters .
Khotso Khumalo , an ANC spokesman , said parliament would vote on the new president in the next few days .
The ANC - dominated assembly is almost certain to give its official approval to Motlanthe 's appointment .
Zuma said the name of the acting president would be formally announced "" at an appropriate moment "" , but added that Motlanthe , would be "" equal to the task "" if given "" that responsibility "" .
Zuma promised a smooth transition of power , saying the party 's policies would not be changed .
"" Our economic policies will remain stable , progressive and unchanged , as decided upon in previous ANC national conferences , "" he said .
He said the decision to ask Mbeki to resign as president had been one of the most difficult in the history of the ruling party .
Zuma is expected to become president after next year 's elections but is barred by the constitution from taking over immediately because he is not a member of parliament .
He praised Mbeki and his government and said the ANC would continue to "" give tasks "" to the ousted leader "" as a cadre and senior leader of the movement "" .
However , the political struggle that ousted Mbeki was criticised today by Archbishop Desmond Tutu , considered a beacon of moral authority in South Africa , who warned that the country risked becoming a "" banana republic "" .
Tutu , a Nobel laureate , said that although Mbeki had made enemies because of "" his intolerance of challenges and dissent "" , his enemies were "" gloating as they rub his nose in the mud "" .
He said : "" There is nothing principled about that .
It is good old - fashioned tit for tat .
The way of retribution leads to a banana republic . ""
Tutu voiced concern that Zuma still faces corruption allegations , and said they would remain until he was tried for allegedly accepting bribes in a huge arms scandal that erupted nearly a decade ago .
The archbishop had strained relations with Mbeki after criticising his government for doing too little to alleviate poverty .
But he has also upset Zuma supporters by saying he is not suitable to become president after being accused of both rape and corruption .
Mbeki called an emergency meeting of his cabinet as many of his ministers threatened to resign in solidarity after the ANC on Saturday told the president to agree to step down or face being removed by parliament .
Mbeki handed his resignation letter to the speaker of parliament yesterday , and in an unusually humble speech broadcast on the national TV broadcaster SABC , he said he had decided to step down out of loyalty to the party that was rejecting him .

However , he acknowledged that despite consistent economic growth , millions of South Africans remained in poverty .
Many commentators welcomed his resignation , including critics of the president 's widely derided policies on Aids .
Zackie Achmat , head of the Treatment Action Campaign , said Mbeki had abandoned hundreds of thousands of people in need of lifesaving treatment , and should be called to account .
"" This is long overdue , "" said Achmat .
"" I would have liked to see him impeached for causing the deaths of many hundreds of thousands of people living with HIV , for the corruption of the arms deal , [ and ] for the undermining of every independent state institution . ""
The leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance , Helen Zille , accused the ANC of putting its own political battles ahead of the national interest .
"" It is revenge , pure and simple .
It has everything to do with the internal battles of the ANC and nothing to do with the interest of South Africa , "" she said .
FW de Klerk , the last white president of South Africa , who negotiated an end to apartheid , was also critical of Mbeki 's dismissal .
"" It is unfortunate that a sitting president should be forced from office before the end of his term , "" he said ."
2008-09-22,"The South African government is poised to shift to the left after the ruling African National Congress indicated that its deputy leader , Kgalema Motlanthe , a prominent trade unionist , will become interim president following Thabo Mbeki 's forced resignation .
The ANC will not publicly confirm Motlanthe 's selection until parliament is formally informed and votes in the new president , for the remaining nine months of Mbeki 's term , on Thursday .
But yesterday the ANC leader , Jacob Zuma , hinted that Motlanthe was the choice and party officials did not deny it .
"" I am convinced , if given that responsibility , he would be equal to the task , "" Zuma told reporters .
However , it appeared that Mbeki has not given up the political wrangle with Zuma after a Johannesburg radio station reported that the outgoing president has attached his name to a legal petition seeking to overturn the high court ruling earlier this month that threw out a long - standing corruption case against Zuma and accused Mbeki of misusing the judicial system to keep his rival from power .
It was that ruling that prompted the ANC leadership to vote to remove Mbeki .
Motlanthe , who was jailed for 10 years by the apartheid regime , played a leading role in ousting Mbeki and installing Zuma as ANC leader last year .
He is backed by the trade union movement and the Communist party , which were critical of Mbeki 's economic policies and want to see greater wealth distribution , an end to privatisation of state assets and greater poverty relief .
Although technically an interim president , Motlanthe is such an integral part of ANC policy - making he can be expected to begin to lay out the path of the Zuma presidency that is likely to follow after the general election in about nine months .
The ANC forced Mbeki to accept Motlanthe into the cabinet as a minister without portfolio in July , ostensibly to smooth the way for the change in administration next year .
But it was clear that the party 's deputy leader was there to keep an eye on Mbeki and to ensure he carried through changes in ANC policies introduced after Zuma took charge of the party .
Zuma said the decision to "" recall "" Mbeki was "" one of the most difficult "" in the history of the ANC . ""
Comrade Mbeki has devoted decades of his life to the ANC and our country .
The decision to recall him was not taken lightly , but it has to be taken in the interest of making the country move forward , "" he said .
Motlanthe , 59 , was a follower of the Black Consciousness Movement and was first jailed in 1976 during the student protests against the teaching of Afrikaans in black schools which set off years of unrest that played a primary role in bringing down apartheid .
He was arrested again a year later and sentenced to 10 years on Robben Island .
After his release he was elected secretary general of the National Union of Mineworkers and later held a similar post in the ANC .
The ANC used a constitutional clause to bypass a requirement for the deputy president , Phumzile Mlambo - Ngcuka , to replace Mbeki .
She was loyal to the outgoing president and resigned yesterday ."
2008-09-23,"By forcing out President Thabo Mbeki so vindictively , the ANC leadership may have to sacrifice Jacob Zuma , the party leader , to prevent a backlash that could break up the party ahead of next year 's general elections .
Today – as expected – a third of Mbeki 's cabinet resigned in anger with the way he has been treated , deepening the biggest political crisis since South Africa became democratic in 1994 .
Since Mbeki 's resignation on Sunday , Zuma had pleaded with Cabinet ministers not to resign – with limited success .
Some ANC leaders have said they will form their own party , to challenge a Zuma - led ANC in next year 's general election .
This shows the extent of the dissatisfaction among the ANC rank - and - file , even those who have been traditionally critical of Mbeki , who had only four months left on his presidential term .
Other ANC members are now planning mass protests across the country .
The only way to unify the ANC is not to have Zuma president of South Africa , and make Kgalema Motlanthe , the caretaker president , the permanent candidate .
Zuma may be popular , and have a hardcore , loud and militant support base who are prepared to "" die "" to have him president , but at the same time , a large proportion of the ANC 's membership disapprove of him with equal gusto .
They are unlikely to vote for the ANC when he is the presidential candidate .
For the ANC to think that Mbeki 's forced exit will "" unify the party "" , as ANC general secretary
Gwede Mantashe said when he announced Mbeki 's sacking , is to be in denial , the favourite response to crises , of the very man they ousted .
It is unlikely that those who determinedly moved to oust Mbeki understood the significance of what they have done .
They have unleashed a political hurricane , which they can not control .
Mbeki was fired by the Zuma group in charge of the ANC , because they feared he would set up a commission investigating corruption related to the controversial arms deal , in which Zuma is implicated , or recharge him .
Zuma has 16 charges of corruption against him .
Judge Chris Nicholson , who cleared Zuma on a technicality , emphasised he did not give a verdict on the charges , but proposed the prosecutors recharge Zuma , provided they do so by following the proper procedures .
The prosecutors have been under such an attack from the Zuma camp now that their very credibility may rest on recharging Zuma .
In any event , they know that if Zuma comes to power , the prosecuting unit may be broken up .
Furthermore , a number of private prosecutions against Zuma have been lined up – so it is difficult to see how Zuma is going to extricate himself out of the very real criminal charges , which have already seen his former financial advisor sent to jail for 15 years .
Following Mbeki 's forced exit , the Zuma coalition , consisting of five distinctly different groups , who were all opposed to Mbeki , have lost the glue that held them together – opposition to Mbeki .
Furthermore , with Mbeki gone , all of them are now focusing on securing their own interests in the leadership vacuum .
Within the Zuma coalition , not all are set on securing the presidency of South Africa for Zuma .
Those who are include : the ANC youth league , the pro - Zuma black economic empowerment business oligarchs – both hoping to secure patronage ; the communist party ( SACP ) and the trade unionists ( Cosatu ) , who nave no alternative presidential candidate of their own , think they can manipulate Zuma in power ; and those ANC leaders who are being investigated by the national prosecuting authority for corruption , because , they argue that if Zuma 's case is quashed – especially when he comes to power , theirs will also .
Now the Zuma coalition are divided between those who want Zuma at all costs to become president , such as those seeking a pardon for corruption or patronage , versus those who are prepared to look for a unifying ANC leader that will be pro - poor – the latter include the more serious elements of Cosatu and the SACP .
Yet , Zuma is not entirely in control of his own coalition : rather they may actually be in charge of him .
He opposed efforts to oust Mbeki , because he feared he will inherit a divided party , unprepared to run a general election .
However , he was rudely overruled by his own militants .
Furthermore , in the week when Mbeki detractors within the Zuma coalition moved to oust him , all the old presidential rivals of Mbeki , Cyril Ramaphosa , Mathews and Tokyo Sexwale , again took centre stage within the ANC , dwarfing Zuma , almost like a decade ago .
Until yesterday , the Zuma camp , in control of the ANC had planned to appoint Baleka Mbete , the speaker of parliament , and the ANC 's chairwoman , and a more pliable supporter , as interim president , to smooth the way for Zuma and to create an environment for Zuma 's legal charges to be withdrawn .
However , Motlanthe 's elevation as interim president shows that divisions with Zuma 's coalition are now deepening .
Motlanthe was the choice of those in the Zuma coalition who are more interested in keeping the ANC united , and securing a pro - poor government focus , rather then putting Zuma into the presidency .
They have long seen him as an alternative candidate for the presidency if Zuma stumbles over his legal hurdles .
Motlanthe does things by the book .
Motlanthe is also one of the few ANC leaders with support in both the Mbeki and Zuma camps .
Zuma rightly perceives him as a serious rival .
In this crisis , there may be openings for other young Turks of Motlanthe 's generation .
To contain the young Turks –
Motlanthe , Phosa , Sexwale and Ramaphosa
, Zuma has promised to stay as president for one term only , and then allow a competitive election for the leadership between them .
But Mothlante will now have inside track , because he is already an MP , while the others , including Zuma are not .
He will be presiding president for six months , which is enough to show his credentials not only as a unifying figure , but a source of new ideas , energy and principle , and to contrast this to the divisive potential of a populist Zuma .
It will be ironic if it takes the ANC to go through such a destructive process , if it eventually get some sense and appoint Motlanthe or any other of the younger talent , Phosa , Sexwale and Ramaphosa as new leader , such an obvious solution to unite the ANC and the country again , and should have been done a long time before ."
2008-09-23,"Responding publicly to calls from his Communist party and trade union allies to depose Thabo Mbeki , Jacob Zuma – speaking in the wake of the court decision that ruled that he had been the victim of a political plot by Mbeki – insisted that there was no need "" to beat a dead snake "" .
Most observers had interpreted the repeated calls for Mbeki 's resignation since Zuma became party leader as mere posturing on the part of Zuma 's supporters .
By the weekend , however , a humiliated Mbeki had announced his resignation as South Africa 's second democratic president .
While Mbeki 's ousting has sparked waves of political resignations , he probably had more admirers outside South Africa than within .
He was George Bush 's "" point man "" in Africa and was a favorite of the international markets .
But on the things that affected the majority of people in South Africa the most – Aids and poverty – Mbeki presided over disastrous policies .
One of the key aims of the Zuma ANC faction was to achieve state power .
They have achieved the first step in that direction now .
Mbeki , who also personified for them what was wrong with the ANC 's leadership style ( secretive , vindictive , personal and distant rule ) , is now gone .
As they can not install their man in the presidency as yet ( for one thing , Zuma is not a member of parliament ) , they 'll ride out the next seven months until elections in April 2009 .
Pressure will be on them to act presidential , promote national unity and unite their own party .
They are not in danger of losing the elections .
The current batch of opposition parties are sadly irrelevant in South Africa , save in one of the nine provinces , the Western Cape , but the ANC would want to shore up its legitimacy among South Africa 's poor ( historically ANC supporters ) who increasingly associate the ANC with rapacious wealth accumulation , corruption and power struggles and may withdraw from electoral politics .
The party may have weathered the first round in that transition : ANC deputy president Kgalema Motlanthe 's pending inauguration as caretaker president until general elections has been welcomed without exception .
Though he is close to the Zuma camp , he has a reputation as a mediator and comes across as above the fray .
The longer challenge is keeping the Zuma camp together .
A motley crew of charismatic personalities with a penchant for speaking out of turn or prone to ridiculousness is at the front of the anti - Mbeki group .
ANC Youth League leader Julius Malema has said he 'd "" take up arms "" and "" kill for Zuma "" .
He also accused the country 's judges of being "" drunk "" and "" taking decisions in beer halls "" .
Zwelinzima Vavi , the head of the trade union federation Cosatu , has uttered some of the same sentiments .
For now , the ANC Youth League ( whose leaders publicly criticised Motlanthe when he defended the independence of the judiciary ) has been reined in , according to reports from South Africa .
The ANC Youth League was also quick to put its name to a media statement that implored members of Mbeki 's cabinet not to follow Mbeki .
Zuma 's alliance with the trade unions and communists are tenuous .
The ANC president is defined more by his "" anti - Mbeki "" persona to these activists , rather than for his own politics , which are hardly left wing on a range of issues , including sexual politics , and though he has been exonerated of any specific corruption charges , he is still associated with corruption .
Since Mbeki 's resignation , Zuma – playing to the markets – has promised that the government 's economic policies would remain unchanged .
Though Zuma 's reassurances are predictable , it 's not the kind of blank cheque on policy that his allies want to hear as their support for Zuma is largely premised , in their public rhetoric at least , on a critique of Mbeki 's economic policies .
Once the raison d'etre for the Zuma camp – their antipathy for Mbeki – runs its course , it is unclear what the grouping 's future is .
Cosatu and the SACP also have problems of their own .
Blade Nzimande , the SACP leader , purged anyone suspected as either pro - Mbeki or critical of Zuma .
So did Cosatu , whose members may be wondering what the federation 's primary business is .
Despite all the talk of "" unity "" from Zuma , expect the purging of cabinet and provincial and local government and party leaders perceived to be close to Mbeki , to continue .
Since Mbeki 's resignation , at least 11 cabinet members , including deputy president Phumzile Mlambo - Ngcuka – who owed their jobs to Mbeki – have followed him out of government .
Others who resigned include close Mbeki allies like Alec Erwin ( public enterprises ) and Mosiuoa Lekota ( defence ) .
The Zuma camp succeeded in having the leadership of the pro - Mbeki Western Cape provincial government leadership removed .
( The nine provincial governments are akin to state governments elsewhere . )
Two other provinces with pro - Mbeki leaderships have been targeted next : the North - West and Eastern Cape .
These struggles are often violent .
In the Western Cape , a provincial leader was stabbed in the neck .
Over the weekend , police reported three men shot ( one in the head and two in the leg ) at an ANC meeting in the Eastern Cape .
And Mbeki is still not going quietly into the night .
He gave notice to the constitutional court on Monday to file an appeal – both in his personal capacity and as head of the South African government – against the judge 's decision in Zuma 's latest trial that the executive may have interfered in Zuma 's trail .
Some of his supporters , largely limited in his home province in the Eastern Cape , have threatened to form a breakaway party ( it worth remembering that he received 40 % of delegates ' votes at the December 2007 ANC national conference ) .
But first they 'd have to convince Mbeki to leave the ANC ."
2008-09-25,"Kgalema Motlanthe was sworn in as South Africa 's president yesterday , putting allies of Jacob Zuma firmly in control of the government after they toppled Thabo Mbeki at the weekend .
After a week of the most dramatic political upheaval since the collapse of apartheid , which saw a sitting president swept out of power in a matter of days , Motlanthe sought to reassure South Africans and the financial markets that there would be no dramatic policy changes .
The new president pledged to maintain Mbeki 's business - oriented economic strategy which has been criticised by many of Zuma 's backers , including the unions and Communist party , potentially opening the way for further strife within the ruling African National Congress .
"" Mine is not the desire to deviate from what is working .
It is not for me to reinvent policy .
Nor do I intend to reshape either cabinet or the public service , "" Motlanthe told parliament after his inauguration . ""
In a turbulent global economy , we will remain true to the policies that have kept South Africa steady , and that have ensured sustained growth .
"" That assurance was reflected in Motlanthe 's cabinet which retained many former ministers including Trevor Manuel as finance minister .
His resignation after Mbeki was removed sent the Johannesburg stock exchange and rand plummeting as investors feared the loss of the world 's longest - serving finance minister , who has overseen continuous economic growth .
Manuel said he had merely offered his resignation to allow the president flexibility in choosing his cabinet .
But others saw the move as a warning against any significant policy change , despite the pressure from the left , that appears to have been responded to in Motlanthe 's speech .
Perhaps the most important cabinet change was the removal of Manto Tshabalala - Msimang as health minister .
She fronted Mbeki 's heavily criticised HIV / Aids policies , blocking the distribution of life - saving drugs in public hospitals and drawing derision at international conferences by suggesting garlic and lemon as a suitable treatment .
The leaders of other political parties praised Motlanthe as a man of integrity , humble and hardworking .
Pieter Mulder of the mostly Afrikaner Freedom Front -
Plus , alluded to the possibility that Motlanthe could supplant Zuma , who is the ANC president , as the party 's candidate for president in May 's general election .
He told parliament a story of two Afrikaner voortrekkers who harness their oxen in the dark only to discover in the morning that they had also harnessed a lion .
Their problem , said Mulder turning towards the new president , was that having harnessed the lion they now had to find a way to let it go .
The story provoked much laughter and a smile from Zuma who could hardly have missed Mulder 's point .
Some of the forces that coalesced around Zuma largely regarded him as a vehicle to drive Mbeki out .
The unions and the Communist party in particular were seeking to pull Zuma to the left of where the outgoing government was .
But their support falls behind Motlanthe more naturally as he is a former leader of the National Union of Mineworkers and trade union confederation stalwart .
Motlanthe says he has no presidential ambitions but he would be an attractive presidential candidate for the ANC in May if Zuma 's legal problems continue .
There are already questions over the degree of Zuma 's authority as party president .
He publicly opposed removing Mbeki from office so either he was duplicitous or was unable to influence other ANC leaders .
But if Motlanthe does not shift economic policy to the left , there is a strong possibility the ANC will split .
Amid all the praise for Motlanthe , there was little for Mbeki .
Tony Leon , foreign affairs spokesman for the opposition Democratic Alliance , compared his downfall to several Shakespearean tragedies . ""
His presidency and the forces behind its collapse seem to combine the ambitions of Lady Macbeth , the jealously of Othello , the backstabbing of Iago and , ultimately in its last act , the impotent rage of King Lear , "" he said .
But Robert Mugabe , Zimbabwe 's president , described Mbeki 's removal from office as "" devastating "" ."
2008-09-25,"The South African parliament is expected to install Kgalema Motlanthe as president today after the ruling African National Congress forced out his predecessor Thabo Mbeki .
Mbeki resigned as head of state on Sunday on the orders of the ANC leadership following a long and bitter power struggle with his former deputy , Jacob Zuma .
The toppling of Mbeki has plunged South Africa into its deepest political crisis since the end of apartheid .
Almost a third of South Africa 's cabinet resigned in a show of loyalty to Mbeki , although some - including the influential finance minister , Trevor Manuel - said they would serve under Motlanthe if asked .
Motlanthe , a former trade unionist and freedom fighter , is expected to act as a caretaker leader until elections next year , when Zuma is likely to become president .
Mbeki 's presidency was fatally weakened after a high court threw out a long - standing corruption case against Zuma and accused Mbeki of misusing the judicial system to keep his rival from power .
But following Mbeki 's resignation , political divisions within the ANC have continued to deepen and speculation has mounted that it may not survive as a single party .
Motlanthe , who was jailed for 10 years by the apartheid regime , played a key role in ousting Mbeki and installing Zuma as ANC leader last year .
He has a broad - based support across the ANC , and it is hoped he may be able to heal rifts in the party .
Baleka Mbete , South Africa 's speaker of parliament , is expected to be appointed as deputy president .
Yesterday , Robert Mugabe , the president of neighbouring Zimbabwe , described the resignation of Mbeki as "" devastating "" .
Mbeki was frequently criticised for taking a soft line with Mugabe and the brutality of his regime , although earlier this month Mbeki did manage to broker a power - sharing deal to end Mugabe 's authoritarian grip on power .
"" It 's devastating news that President Thabo Mbeki is no longer the President of South Africa , but that is the action of the South African people , "" the state - controlled Herald newspaper quoted Mugabe as telling reporters in New York , where he is attending the United Nations general assembly ."
2008-10-08,"South Africa 's ruling African National Congress is on the brink of splitting after senior allies of the toppled president , Thabo Mbeki , said yesterday that they were "" serving divorce papers "" on the new party leadership under Jacob Zuma because it had abandoned the movement 's founding principles and put "" our national democracy in danger "" .
Mosiuoa Lekota , a former political prisoner and party chairman who quit as defence minister when Mbeki was forced out as president last month , said he and other disillusioned officials planned to canvass for support within the ANC in a process that seems to be "" leading logically "" to the creation of a new political party to run in next year 's general election .
"" This is probably the parting of the ways , "" said Lekota .
Lekota accused the new leadership of hijacking the ANC and "" eliminating our internal democracy "" in order to make Zuma the ruling party 's candidate at the election and to stop him facing trial on corruption charges . ""
These elements who are not committed to these principles of the ANC may well decorate themselves with the name ANC but they are not ANC ...
The current leadership have shown they are not ANC , "" he said .
Lekota was flanked by the former deputy defence minister Mluleki George but is not clear how many senior officials he can carry with him , although he said there are significant numbers of rank and file members who oppose the existing leadership .
Lekota 's influence was severely undermined after he failed to assert control as chairman of the party conference that saw Mbeki deposed as ANC leader last year .
The ANC leadership quickly derided Lekota 's move , accusing him and his supporters of being bitter at losing control of the party .
ANC spokeswoman Jesse Duarte said the dissidents were "" launching a stillborn organisation "" because they had no future in the party .
"" They were never willing to accept the will of the members of the ANC and they have therefore pursued other avenues to advance their careers , "" she said .
Zuma warned ANC members that they did not have a blank cheque to destabilise the party .
While any new political party will face a formidable challenge to take significant support from the ANC , despite growing disillusionment among ordinary voters , the bitterness of Lekota 's attack on Zuma and his allies reflects the deep schisms that could see other factions break away , particularly on the left over economic policy .
"" There has been elevated to national importance interests of individuals rather than the interests of our country , "" said Lekota .
He accused the new party leadership of betraying the ANC 's Freedom Charter , which formed the basis of the liberation struggle , by demanding that there be a "" political solution "" to prevent Zuma facing trial for corruption which could see him sent to prison for years . ""
South Africans are getting arrested from time to time .
They have to appear before the courts and they have to bring evidence to prove that they are innocent or not .
Now we are saying , no , in a particular case - of the state versus the president of the ANC - there must be a political solution .
What has happened to the clause in the Freedom Charter : all shall be equal before the law ?
"" he said .
Lekota also said that the Zuma camp had introduced tribalism into the party 's internal politics with a campaign projecting Zuma as "" 100 % Zulu boy "" and promoted violence with Zuma 's trademark song , Bring Me My Machine Gun . ""
Leaders of the ANC stand on public platforms singing songs that advocate violence and the collection of weapons .
To what end ?
To promote what policy of the ANC ?
"" he said .
But Lekota 's accusation that the new ANC leadership is "" eliminating internal democracy "" with a purge of Mbeki 's supporters and attacks on Zuma 's critics will ring hollow among many of Mbeki 's critics who were hounded with a vicious vilification campaign by the former president 's backers .
Confirming that he has virtually made up his mind to launch a rival party , Lekota said it would challenge Zuma at the ballot box .
"" Of course we have to contest the elections next year ...
the people of our country must choose between ourselves and those who have taken a different route , "" he said ."
2008-10-08,"Senior allies of the toppled South African president , Thabo Mbeki , today laid the ground for a breakaway party from the ruling African National Congress because they said its leaders have abandoned the movement 's founding principles and put "" our national democracy is in danger "" .
Mosiuoa Lekota - a former political prisoner on Robben Island , the ANC chairman for a decade and defence minister for 12 years until he resigned after the new party leadership under Jacob Zuma removed Mbeki as president last month - said he and other disillusioned officials will hold a consultative conference within the party that would seem to "" be leading logically "" to a "" divorce "" .
"" This is probably the parting of the ways , "" he said .
Lekota was flanked by the former deputy defence minister , Mluleki George , but did not name any other senior ANC officials as backing the move .
However , he said there are significant numbers of rank - and - file members who oppose the existing leadership .
Any new political party will face a formidable challenge to take support from the ANC despite growing disillusionment among ordinary voters , particularly a party led by the people who have governed for the past eight years .
But the bitterness of Lekota 's attack on the leadership that toppled Mbeki from the top of the ANC last year and then as South Africa 's president reflects the deep schisms within the ruling party that could see other breakaway factions , particularly on the left over economic policy .
Kgalema Motlanthe , the ANC 's deputy leader , was appointed interim president after Mbeki was ousted but , for now at least , the party intends to make Zuma its candidate at next year 's presidential election .
Lekota accused the new leadership of hijacking the ANC and "" eliminating our internal democracy "" in order to make Zuma president and to stop him facing trial on corruption charges .
"" There has been elevated to national importance interests of individuals rather than the interests of our country .
Every meeting , every public appearance , is about how some individual or the other must be made president of South Africa as if the presidency of South Africa is something hereditary , "" he said .
The former ANC chairman said that the new party leadership was also betraying the ANC 's Freedom Charter , which formed the basis of the liberation struggle , by demanding that there be a "" political solution "" to prevent Zuma facing trial for corruption which could see him sent to prison for years . ""
South Africans are getting arrested from time to time .
They have to appear before the courts and they have to bring evidence to prove that they are innocent or not .
Now we are saying , no , in a particular case - of the state versus the president of the ANC - there must be a political solution .
What has happened to the clause in the Freedom Charter : all shall be equal before the law ?
If one deviates from that clause are we then going to have a political solution for each and every criminal case that arises in this nation or is it only for this particular individual ? "" said Lekota .
Lekota also said that the Zuma camp had introduced tribalism into the party 's internal politics with a campaign projecting Zuma as a "" 100 % Zulu boy "" and promoted violence with the singing of a song , Bring Me My Machine Gun , that is now a trademark of the ANC leader .
"" T - shirts are printed with tribalist slogans decorated with the face of some very senior member of the ANC .
At its foundation the ANC 's leaders declared that tribalism is the most serious danger to our country and our people .
No condemnation , no action to stop it , "" he said .
"" Songs which advocate violence at a time when the ANC has negotiated peace for this country , and our people are supposed to be free and live in peace , leaders of the ANC stand on public platforms singing songs that advocate violence and the collection of weapons .
To what end ?
To promote what policy of the ANC ? ""
But Lekota 's accusation that the new ANC leadership is "" eliminating internal democracy "" with a purge of Mbeki 's supporters and attacks on Zuma 's critics will ring hollow among many of Mbeki 's critics who were hounded with a vicious vilification campaign by the former president 's backers .
Lekota declined to say directly that he will be launching a new party but , when pressed on the issue by reporters , he said that today 's announcement amounted to the serving of "" divorce papers "" ."
2008-10-15,"Another political heavyweight has quit South Africa 's ruling African National Congress as dissidents prepare to launch a rival party after the former president , Thabo Mbeki , was toppled from power by supporters of Jacob Zuma .
Mbhazima Shilowa , a former trade union leader and ex - premier of the country 's industrial and financial heartland around Johannesburg and Pretoria , resigned from the ANC over what he called the "" putsch "" against Mbeki , who was ordered by the party leadership under Zuma to resign as South Africa 's president last month .
Shilowa said he was backing Mbeki 's former defence minister , Mosiuoa Lekota , who announced he was "" serving divorce papers "" on the ANC last week .
The party suspended Lekota this week .
The rebels plan to call a national convention "" in defence of democracy "" on November 2 which is expected to be the launch pad for a rival to the ANC as the party fractures over political and , to a lesser extent , ethnic differences .
Shilowa said he would establish a preparatory committee of "" prominent individuals "" ahead of the convention to tour the country and generate support .
The ANC 's national executive held a special session yesterday to discuss the split .
The leadership said it would act "" very decisively "" to rid the party of factionalism .
Zuma claimed the new party would get nowhere . ""
It 's cold out there if you are out of the ANC , very cold , "" he said .
There is little likelihood of the ANC losing next year 's general election , but if Lekota and his allies can get a serious breakaway movement off the ground , it could eat into the ruling party 's two - thirds majority in parliament .
Two of the ANC 's provincial ministers are expected to quit in the mostly Xhosa eastern Cape , where there is discontent not only because it is Mbeki 's home province , but because of unhappiness at the Zuma camp 's emphasis on their leader 's Zulu roots .
Lekota condemned the T - shirts worn by Zuma 's supporters at the ANC convention in December that declared him to be "" 100 % Zulu "" , a jibe at accusations that Mbeki headed a "" Xhosa nostra "" at the top of the ANC ."
2008-11-04,"When the ANC president , Jacob Zuma , addressed a packed 20,000 crowd in Soweto on Saturday one of the preachers present evoked murmurs of assent when he said that "" Zuma has not been selected by the people only .
Anyone who fights him is fighting Nkulunkulu ( the Supreme Being ) personally . ""
In fact , Zuma 's rally was one of a whole series of ANC gambits aimed at drawing attention away from the national convention organised in Johannesburg at the weekend by the ANC dissidents , led by Terror Lekota and Sam Shilowa , who are intent on launching a new party to compete with the ANC in next April 's general election .
But the gambits failed : some 5,000 delegates packed the convention which was shrouded in one - nation euphoria as speakers from all races and parties were given a rapturous reception and the media gave it blanket coverage , all claiming that it had "" changed South African politics forever "" .
In the weeks before the convention , the various front organisations of the Communist party ( the SACP ) and in particular the various constituent unions of the Congress of South African Trade Unions ( Cosatu ) has rained down denunciations of Lekota , Shilowa and anyone likely to support them , but this was merely an index of how thoroughly the SACP has colonised the Cosatu unions and the ANC itself – the SACP chairman , Gwede Mantashe , is now the ANC Secretary - General and the party 's most forceful and frequent spokesman .
But although the ANC is the party in possession – it has power , patronage , the symbols and history , the long - faithful voters –
it has clearly been taken aback by the speed and degree to which the breakaway faction is developing .
Lekota and his supporters now challenge the party head on in a way it is simply not used to : what is wrong with being middle class , Lekota asks ?
Do we all have to do what an SACP of only 20,000 members tells us ?
Moreover , to Cosatu 's considerable alarm , Willie Madisha , the former Cosatu chairman expelled for his refusal to back Zuma , is deep in talks to set up a new non - political labour federation which will doubtless entice many members away from Cosatu .
South African politics has always been ethnic and regional .
The convention 's organisers showed their hand when they allocated 500 delegates each to the East , West and Northern Cape , the NorthWest and the Free State , for it is in these five provinces that they feel most confident of their support – indeed
Lekota predicted to me that the ANC could no longer win any of them .
Only 300 delegates each were allocated to Mpumalanga , Limpopo and Gauteng ( which includes Johannesburg ) and only 200 to Zuma 's home province of KwaZulu - Natal .
Already , there are strong mutterings that Zuma 's Zulu followers will make the latter a no - go area for the dissidents .
What no one is saying is that the breakaway can only gain serious traction if it exploits tribal lines of cleavage .
These are already evident : the three Cape provinces are predominantly Xhosa and it is clear that the dissidents will draw their principal support from this group , which feels dispossessed by the sight of a Xhosa President , Thabo Mbeki , being thrown out by a Zulu .
Lekota himself is a South Sotho from the Free State and the Tswanas who populate the NorthWest are essentially just Western Sotho .
At the convention Lekota spoke in English , Afrikaans – and Xhosa , for they were the dominant group : over a thousand delegates arrived from the Eastern Cape alone ( despite the quota ) .
This is the province where most Xhosas live and where the most confident predictions of dissident success are being made .
Similarly , the key fact about Zuma 's Soweto rally was that he spoke almost exclusively in Zulu : doubtless the language of most of the audience .
Zulus are passionate about the notion that after three successive Xhosas – Tambo , Mandela and Mbeki – the Zulus , the biggest tribe , must provide the next ANC leader .
It is this passionate enthusiasm which explains the invocations of the Almighty on Zuma 's side .
But this means massive violence , especially in ethnically mixed areas like Gauteng , for there is little doubt that the parties will seek to control "" their "" communities .
No one is saying this yet .
But we could well be in for a return to civil strife on a scale not witnessed since the early 1990s ."
2009-01-12,"A South African appeals court has reversed a decision to dismiss corruption charges against the ANC leader , Jacob Zuma , months before an election he was widely expected to win .
The ruling is a blow to the ruling party , which claimed vindication in September after the high court dismissed the case against Zuma on a technicality and implied that there had been political interference .
That judgment helped force the resignation of then president Thabo Mbeki and led to a split in the African National Congress .
But in a scathing verdict in Bloemfontein today , Judge Louis Harms , deputy president of the supreme court of appeal , said the earlier ruling by high court judge Chris Nicholson had failed "" to distinguish between allegation , fact and suspicion "" .
"" Political meddling was not an issue that had to be determined , "" said Harms , whose decision was televised nationally .
"" Nevertheless , a substantial part of his judgment dealt with this question and in the course of this discussion , it changed the rules of the game .
It took his eyes off the ball . ""
The National Prosecuting Authority welcomed the ruling and said that the 16 original charges still stood against Zuma , including racketeering , corruption and money laundering , involving about 4 m rand ( £ 267,000 ) .
The case was part of a bribery investigation into South Africa 's largest weapons buying deal , which saw Zuma 's financial adviser jailed for 15 years .
Analysts say Zuma 's lawyers may try to reach agreement with the prosecutors , while he can also appeal against yesterday 's ruling before the constitutional court .
Even if he chooses not to , any corruption trial is unlikely to begin before the election , which could take place as early as March .
Following the decision yesterday , the ANC said in a statement that it accepted the court 's decision "" without reservation "" but said the verdict had nothing to do with the guilt or innocence of Zuma . ""
The judgment will not affect the decision of the ANC that Zuma be the ANC 's presidential candidate for the 2009 elections , "" the statement said .
The powerful trade union Cosatu and the South African Communist party also expressed support for Zuma .
But analysts say the court ruling presents a serious dilemma for the ANC , coming so close to the election .
Professor Sheila Meintjes , head of the political studies department at the University of the Witwatersrand , said that it would reinforce strong – if largely muted – concerns within the party hierarchy about Zuma 's leadership .
"" The best solution for South Africa would be for him to step down and let [ current president Kgalema ]
Motlanthe lead the party into the election , "" she said .
"" But the likelihood remains that Zuma will go into the poll with this fraud cloud hanging over him . ""
Currently , there is nothing to prevent a sitting president from appearing in court , although parliament could change that .
Ebrahim Fakir , senior researcher at the Johannesburg - based Centre for Policy Studies , said the ANC 's position on Zuma had until now had been one of "" manufactured consensus "" , but that dissenting voices may now begin to be heard .
He said the appeal court ruling would also help the ANC splinter faction led by former defence minister Mosiuoa Lekota , whose new Congress of the People party will contest the election for the first time .
"" If they keep insisting that it must be Zuma – a candidate charged with fraud – the ANC is implying that no other person can lead the party , which is not true , "" Fakir said .
"" This is an ethical question , and one that is completely separate from Zuma 's basic rights and a presumption of innocence . """

2009-01-15,"Allies of Jacob Zuma , South Africa 's president - in - waiting , seem prepared to stop at nothing to save their man after the country 's supreme court of appeal ruled this week that the ANC leader should , after all , stand trial on criminal charges of corruption , fraud , money - laundering and tax evasion .
With national elections in the spring approaching fast and confidence in South Africa 's investment - starved economy teetering , the political stakes could hardly be higher .
A swift decision by Zuma 's lawyers to appeal to the constitutional court , the country 's highest tribunal , reflected the sense of crisis in ANC ruling circles .
In a move reminiscent of Robert Mugabe 's tactics in neighbouring Zimbabwe , Zuma 's backers are also seem to be trying to shift the legal goalposts .
Speaking after the appeal court ruling , ANC chief whip Nyamezeli Booi revealed he was launching a probe into the national prosecuting authority ( NPA ) – the body that brought the charges against Zuma .
The probe could result in "" extensive revisions "" to the act of parliament governing the NPA , local media reports said .
Booi denied any political motivation .
"" This is not about JZ ( Jacob Zuma ) , "" he said .
The review was needed "" so we are able to run the NPA in a proper way on behalf of the public of South Africa "" .
The NPA has been embroiled in controversy before , most recently over the sacking of its director , Vusi Pikoli , by South Africa 's stand - in president , Kgalema Motlanthe , another Zuma loyalist . ""
Motlanthe 's decision to fire Pikoli without justifiable explanation has all the hallmarks of a cover - up , "" the opposition Democratic Alliance party said .
It accused the president of putting "" the narrow interests of the Zuma faction of the ANC "" before those of the country .
"" It must be remembered that Mr Pikoli was the one who reinstituted charges against Mr Zuma , "" Bantu Holomisa , another opposition leader , told the South African Press Association .
"" It 's clear that people are sent to head institutions to promote and protect the ANC but the moment such people show any backbone , integrity or independence they are hounded out of office . ""
Supporters are exploring additional ways to help Zuma beat the corruption charges that arose from alleged kickbacks in a £ 2bn government arms deal signed in 1999 .
One possibility is that Pikoli 's acting replacement at the NPA , Mokotedi Mpshe , may be persuaded to drop the case .
According to media reports , unidentified ANC members have claimed that any criminal proceedings against Zuma would in any case be "" quashed "" once he was elected president .
Legal experts are also predicting government moves to amend the constitution to forbid the prosecution of a sitting president .
This week 's ruling has other ramifications .
By flatly rejecting last September 's lower court finding that the case against Zuma was politically motivated , the appeal court has to some extent exonerated Zuma 's old rival , Thabo Mbeki .
He was forced to hand over the presidency to Motlanthe after the September finding .
Mbeki supporters in the ANC subsequently formed a breakaway party , the Congress of the People ( Cope ) .
In a statement this week , Cope said the Zuma faction had acted recklessly and opportunistically in ousting Mbeki before his term expired .
"" It has set a very dangerous precedent in which a sitting head of state could be removed at any time depending on the whim and mood of the party 's executive committee . ""
Other Mugabe - ish tendencies in South African governance are causing increasing concern .
Despite uproar over the corruption case , plus concerns about a national unemployment rate of 23 % , falling foreign investment , a rising current account deficit , high crime levels and poor educational and social provision , the ANC seems assured of re - election – as has been the case continuously since the first post - apartheid polls in 1994 .
And undeterred by past policy failures , the party 's election manifesto , unveiled last week , marks a further shift to the left .
Its centrepiece proposal is "" a comprehensive state - led industrial policy that will direct public and private investment "" .
Speaking last month , Mosiuoa Lekota , the Cope leader , said the ANC had forfeited is moral authority and was using apartheid - era tactics to retain power . ""
Intimidation and paralysing fear is now gripping sections of our society .
Public servants now talk in whispers ...
they report they risk their jobs if they are seen to befriend us , "" Lekota said .
The Zuma case was typical of a ruling culture riddled with corruption , he suggested .
For his part , Zuma is trying to stand above the fray .
Visiting a school in Soweto this week , he offered no comment on the court 's decision , urged pupils to study hard and said he regretted his lack of a formal education .

2009-02-15,"Nelson Mandela made a rare appearance at a political rally in support of his African National Congress party today amid splits and internal divisions over its leader and likely presidential candidate , Jacob Zuma .
Mandela joined Zuma on the platform as the ANC leader campaigned in the Eastern Cape , a traditional party stronghold where it now faces a significant challenge from a breakaway faction in the race for the 22 April ballot .
An ANC spokeswoman , Lindiwe Zulu , said thousands attended the rally but Mandela did not speak .
His grandson , Mandla , addressed the crowd instead , saying that he and his grandfather were "" there to confirm their ANC membership and support for the party "" .
Zulu said : "" He said they were here to dispel any notion by anybody , anywhere who thinks that anybody within the Mandela family , particularly Nelson , were not supporting the ANC . ""
Mandela 's endorsement was important as the ANC grapples with a growing perception that the party 's primary preoccupation these days is to prevent Zuma going on trial for corruption .
He is likely to be formally nominated as his party 's election candidate even though charges are hanging over him , reinforcing a widening view that the ANC is soft on corruption and that some of its leaders have enriched themselves while in power .
Mandela 's presence was also significant because his successor as South Africa 's president , Thabo Mbeki has so far refused to publicly endorse the ANC in the election after he was forced from office last year by Zuma 's supporters at the top of the party .
Some ANC allies of Mbeki , who is from the Eastern Cape while Zuma is from KwaZul , went on to form a breakaway party , the Congress of the People ( Cope ) .
It poses little threat to Zuma 's challenge for the presidency but could significantly eat in to the size of the ruling party 's majority in parliament .
Cope is led by one of Mbeki 's former cabinet minister , Mosiuoa Lekota , and has attracted the support of a handful of prominent former ANC officials .
The perception that some ANC politicians are living extravagant lifestyles has been reinforced in recent days by revelations about the party 's senior spokesman , Carl Niehaus .
He was forced to resign after admitting forging the signatures of other ANC officials in an attempt to borrow large amounts of money and lying to people who loaned him substantial amounts , which he used on his mansion , luxury cars and skiing holidays .
It was revealed in the South African press that Niehaus was forced to resign from a job in Mbeki 's presidency after charging holidays to government expense accounts , but the ANC apparently did not initiate a criminal investigation .
He was previously forced to resign as chief executive from an evangelical church because he failed to repay it a loan of about £ 50,000 , and he was asked to quit a top job with the audit firm Deloitte and Touche over implausible expense claims and his financial woes ."
2009-02-23,"A breakaway faction of the ruling African National Congress has selected a Methodist bishop as its candidate for April 's presidential election as the campaign focuses on morality and the corruption allegations engulfing South Africa 's governing party and its leader , Jacob Zuma .
The Congress of the People ( Cope ) chose Bishop Mvume Dandala as its presidential contender in place of the man who was previously favoured for the nomination , Mosiuoa Lekota , a former defence minister in the cabinet of the ousted president , Thabo Mbeki .
Lekota , who launched Cope late last year , is said to be angered at being bypassed but other party figures believe that its best chance of winning votes from the ANC is to avoid a candidate tainted by recent infighting within the ruling party .
Cope is unlikely to defeat Zuma 's challenge for the presidency but it could eat into the ANC 's large majority in parliament and possibly even wipe it out .
Dandala , 57 , the general secretary of the All Africa Conference of Churches who has solid anti - apartheid credentials , can be expected to bring support from some of the large number of deeply religious voters as well as people disillusioned by the ANC 's choice of Zuma as the party 's presidential candidate even though he is facing trial for allegedly accepting bribes as part of a controversial multibillion pound weapons deal .
If , as expected , Zuma is elected , he will go on trial as a sitting president unless he or his party uses its power to quash the charges .
Dandala will be well positioned to highlight not only the corruption allegations swirling around the ANC but what is perceived as Zuma 's lack of morality in failing to step aside until his trial is over .
Cope is accusing him of "" running away from the fraud and racketeering trial "" .
The ANC at times appears to be more preoccupied with keeping Zuma out of jail than crucial issues of governance 15 years after the country 's first democratic elections put an end to apartheid .
Cope said that Dandala would provide a contrast to the country 's present leadership .
"" South Africa needs an honest , trustworthy and highly skilled leader , someone who can restore hope and belief in our country , "" it said ."
2009-03-29,"South African prosecutors are poised to drop corruption charges against the African National Congress leader , Jacob Zuma , who is expected to be elected president next month , according to local media .
The Sunday Independent newspaper in Johannesburg said that the national prosecuting authority ( NPA ) would withdraw the case this week after fresh evidence of alleged political interference by the administration of former president Thabo Mbeki .
The decision would be a significant election boost to the ANC , which chose Zuma as its candidate for the 22 April election , despite him being due to go on trial in August . ""

"" Those close to the NPA are ' very positive ' [ that ] Mpshe will make a decision after consulting his lieutenants on Monday . ""
The case against Zuma , who maintains his innocence , contributed to the ousting of Mbeki and led to a split in the ANC , which has governed the country unchallenged since the end of apartheid .
The opposition Democratic Alliance has warned that dropping the case would strongly damage the rule of law .
Prosecutors originally charged Zuma with 16 counts of corruption , bribery , money laundering and racketeering involving about 4 m rand ( £ 291,000 ) .
The eight - year legal battle formed part of a wider investigation into a multibillion - pound government arms deal that resulted in Zuma 's former financial adviser Schabir Shaik being sentenced to 15 years in jail for bribery before being controversially granted "" medical parole "" on 3 March , after serving 28 months .
Following Shaik 's conviction in 2005 , Mbeki sacked Zuma as deputy president but saw his rival gain revenge by toppling him as party leader in ANC elections in 2007 .
In September last year the high court dismissed the case against Zuma on a technicality , suggesting that there had been political interference by Mbeki as part of a power struggle within the ANC .

2009-04-06,"South African prosecutors have dropped corruption charges against Jacob Zuma , the leader of the ruling African National Congress party , clearing the way for his expected election as president later in the month .
Mokotedi Mpshe , acting director of public prosecutions , upheld long - standing complaints by Zuma that he was the victim of a political conspiracy , and that key prosecutors had abused their powers in pursuing the case against the 66-year - old former guerrilla leader .
"" It is neither possible nor desirable for the national prosecuting authority to continue with the prosecution of Mr Zuma , "" Mpshe told a packed news conference that was broadcast nationwide .
Zuma supporters celebrated in the streets of downtown Johannesburg , amid a cacophony of blaring car horns and shrieking whistles .
Hundreds waved ANC flags in a square , dancing and singing to Zuma 's theme song , Bring Me My Machine Gun .
"" I 'm very happy for the decision , hoping that this gives our president what he needs for us to go forward , "" said Victress Iwabi , an ANC town councillor .
"" I think under Zuma people will have decent work , free and quality education , quality health care for all .
And we are going to defeat crime .
"" The ANC is widely expected to win an election on 22 April and choose Zuma as South Africa 's next head of state .

2009-04-06,"Jacob Zuma , the leader of the African National Congress party , yesterday won a six - year battle to clear his name , after prosecutors in South Africa dropped corruption charges against him .
The decision paves the way for the 66-year - old to be sworn in as the country 's next president if , as expected , the ANC wins the elections on 22 April .
However , the ruling has polarised views in a nation already divided by the case .
As Zuma supporters poured on to the streets of Johannesburg and Durban to celebrate , the ANC 's treasurer , Mathews Phosa , praised the National Prosecution Agency ( NPA ) for having "" seen the light "" after being party to a "" vindictive politically - motivated prosecution "" .
Zuma had faced 16 charges linked to a multimillion - pound arms deal when he was deputy to former president Thabo Mbeki .
The charges included racketeering , money - laundering , corruption , fraud and tax evasion involving about 4 m rand ( £ 291,000 ) .
In an announcement broadcast live on national television , the NPA 's acting head , Mokotedi Mpshe , said the decision had not been based on the merits of the case .
"" It does not amount to an acquittal [ of Zuma ] , "" he said , adding that the charges had been dropped because of an "" abuse of process "" by Leonard McCarthy , the former head of the elite Scorpions anti - corruption unit who is now vice - president in the integrity unit of the World Bank .
Mpshe released transcripts of taped conversations between McCarthy and the NPA 's former head Bulelani Ngcuka in which the two men discussed the timing of an announcement in Zuma 's prosecution .
Mpshe said there was no evidence to suggest Mbeki had been instrumental in pressing the NPA to prosecute .
However , Zuma 's legal woes have coincided with a bitter battle between the two men for control of the ANC .
It was Ngcuka who in 2003 announced that Zuma 's former financial adviser , Schabir Shaik , would be charged with corruption and fraud , adding that there was a "" prima facie "" case against Zuma but that the case was "" not winnable "" .
Shaik went on trial in 2004 and was jailed .
He was recently released on medical grounds .
The move against Shaik prompted Mbeki to sack Zuma as deputy president , naming Ngcuka 's wife , Phumzile Mlambo - Ngcuka , in his place .
A week later , prosecutors announced they were launching a case against Zuma .
Opposition parties and some churches reacted with dismay at the NPA 's decision .
The largest opposition party , the Democratic Alliance , said it was considering a private prosecution against Zuma .
Its leader , Helen Zille , said : "" The National Director of Public Prosecutions has not taken a decision based in law , but has buckled to political pressure .
Two weeks before the election , it now portrays Jacob Zuma as a wronged victim in a show trial . ""
She added that "" selective "" quotations from transcripts of bugged telephone conversations did not change the substantive merits of the case against Zuma .
The Freedom Front Plus leader , Pieter Mulder , denounced the cost of the legal process , estimated at 60 m rands . ""
The public has been taken for fools while the NPA was abused to sort out internal ANC fights , "" he said .
"" It is ironic that the prosecution is being stopped to restore the credibility of the NPA . """
2009-04-06,"No matter what the ANC 's leaders say , the decision to drop corruption charges against the president of South Africa 's ruling African National Congress , Jacob Zuma , is no cause for celebration .
It should rather be mourned as a setback to efforts to entrench the rule of law in South Africa 's infant democracy .
Zuma was facing 16 charges , including racketeering , money - laundering , corruption and fraud , linked to a controversial multi - billion rand government arms deal .
South Africa 's National Prosecuting Authority simply wilted under pressure from Zuma supporters in charge of the ANC to drop the case before national elections – scheduled for April 22 – in which Zuma will stand as an ANC presidential candidate .
The NPA said it reached its verdict based on possible political interference in the trial .
It said it came to the decision after reviewing transcripts of illegally intercepted telephone calls – presented to the NPA by Zuma 's legal representatives – in which the former NPA head Bulelani Ngcuka and former head of the Directorate of Special Operations ( DSO ) , Leonard McCarthy , allegedly discussed the timing of re - charging Zuma .
The NPA said the intercepted telephone records , including those of former president Thabo Mbeki , showed the discussions took place before the ANC national conference in December 2007 , where Zuma was elected the new leader of the ANC , ousting former leader Thabo Mbeki .
It would have been better if the Zuma case had not been dropped , but that those accused of conspiracy to have been investigated and charged alongside Zuma .
The same goes for those who illegally tapped telephones .
Zuma supporters have depicted his prosecution as a conspiracy from within and outside the ANC to prevent him from becoming the president of South Africa .
Yet they have been silent on the very real allegations of wrongdoing against him .
Zuma 's legal representatives have not tried to show their man is innocent of the corruption charges .
Incredibly , they have argued other ANC leaders have been more corrupt than their man , yet have not been prosecuted , and therefore to charge Zuma would be wrong .
He also threatened to implicate other ANC leaders if he is convicted of corruption – a threat that itself should have been probed by the NPA .
Zuma , who could hire the best legal brains available ( paid for by the state ) has used every loophole to stay out of court , rather than facing up to the very real allegations of wrongdoing against him and trying to clear his name .
Taking on the man who is now the most powerful figure in the ANC was never going to be easy .
That is why Bulelani Ngcuka , the former head of the NPA , said in 2002 , that although it had prima facie evidence of wrongdoing against Zuma , the authority would n't directly take him on , because the political forces ranged in support of the ANC leader were just too powerful .
A better strategy , Ngcuka argued , was to go for Zuma 's lesser lieutenants : chiefly Schabir Shaik , his former financial advisor – who was eventually successfully prosecuted for corruption .
Yet the NPA has shot itself in the foot by getting the basics wrong and letting Zuma off the hook on procedural grounds twice .
Just as instructive is the fact that the ANC leadership can not see something wrong in having the compromised Zuma – a sexist , populist and social conservative - as presidential candidate .
This is in itself in indictment of the ANC 's moral backsliding .
The Zuma case involved not only a manipulation of public opinion by political leaders , it is also a terrible case of idol worship .
Perfectly rational people across the ideological spectrum appear to be unable to ask difficult questions about Zuma 's policy agenda .
Acting National Director of Public Prosecutions
Mokotedi Mpshe said the "" legal process "" in the Zuma case was "" tainted "" , but the corruption charges remain solid .
Yet senior ANC leaders , like the party treasurer , Mathews Phosa , said : "" We have always said Zuma was innocent and today it was the NPA who said it . ""
Many grassroots ANC members have genuinely fallen for such spin .
Many more in rural areas , townships and informal settlements , which do not have access to viewpoints showing Zuma as a compromised man , have fallen for the line that the dropping of the corruption charges against Zuma means that he is "" innocent "" .
Other ANC supporters who may have a problem with Zuma will nevertheless vote for the ANC based on its liberation record .
Many public intellectuals have argued that a Zuma presidency is unlikely to be any worse than Thabo Mbeki 's autocratic leadership .
They claim that Zuma will rule as part of an ANC leadership collective , and thus can not do much harm .
Yet Mbeki was supposedly also ruling as part of a leadership collective – and his spectacular failures were in part responsible for plunging South Africa into this mess ."
2009-04-08,"The reverberations of the decision by South African prosecutors to drop charges against the embattled ruling party leader – and presumptive South African president – Jacob Zuma , is still so fresh that it is hard to see a bright side to this mess .
For one , the credibility of South Africa 's legal system – painstakingly rebuilt after the damage done to it by apartheid – has been dealt a serious blow .
So has the reputation of the new opposition party , the Congress of the People , in whose ranks many of former president Thabo Mbeki 's allies have reinvented themselves as defenders of the rule of law .
They have now emerged as the ones politicising the charges against Zuma and manipulating the legal system and the police .
COPE was projected to do badly already ; this will only add to its woes .
Both inside and outside South Africa there is a lot of unease and nervousness about a Zuma presidency .
Those who hoped that Zuma would be legally prevented from the top prize in South African politics will have now to come to terms with him as president .
It is now highly unlikely that Zuma will stand back for Kgalema Motlanthe , who has stood in as president of South Africa for the last few months after Mbeki 's abrupt sacking .
But there is a bright side to all this .
As the New York Times reported this week , apart from Zuma 's usual middle class , civil society and opposition critics ( both black and white ) , the dividing line between Zuma 's guilt and innocence is as not distinct as most people may believe .
"" Some Zuma supporters are willing to accept his culpability but protest his being singled out among a larger group of presumed profiteers in government . ""
More importantly , the paper cited a recent survey of likely ANC voters , which showed that only 41 % of them thought he was innocent .
Because the ANC still commands roughly two - thirds of the potential vote , this translates to a significant constituency and it suggests that this is where the potential for political realignment and a new politics will come from .
The ANC is not facing any real challenge from opposition parties .
Some speculate that this is not the last time we will hear about COPE .
This was its first time out and it will have five years to built a profile and challenge the ANC at the next election .
But that was said about the Independent Democrats in 2004 .
It is for all intents and purposes a small regional party now trying to leverage its role as a "" kingmaker "" for coalition governments at provincial and city level in Cape Town .
The other option , the Democratic Alliance , is also doomed to a dwindling , ethnic base .
So any break will come from its own ranks .
Furthermore , the prosecutor 's decision , as the influential South African newspaper Business Day opined on Tuesday , "" removes the main weapon with which Zuma and the ANC have been able to fight off opponents –
Zuma 's victimhood .
Free of the charges , it will be easier from now to judge him for what he does rather than for what is being done to him . ""
Zuma will have the popular base and the alliances – he is strongly supported by the ANC 's leftwing critics in the trade unions and the Communist party , and has a rapport with the party 's traditional poor , black , constituency , which Mbeki lacked .
The majority of these citizens saw their lives go from poor and coping to desperate in the last 15 years , and will harshly judge Zuma and the ANC .
Zuma has already lost the black middle class .
During a recent visit to South Africa in January it was clear that for many of these people the ANC had lost its moral authority to govern South Africa and was transforming into a run - of - the - mill post - independence political party whose primary aim is obscuring the hoarding of economic resources for its party elite with populist rhetoric .
Some compared the ANC to the PRI that governed Mexico for much of the 20th century and that is now only remembered as a corrupt , bloated and violent regime .
This year at least 2 million new voters registered for the 22 April elections .
Five years from now there 'll be more .
They 'll also be younger .
They have little or no memory of the ANC 's role as a liberator .
For them , the ANC is associated with government .
Their memory of the ANC is increasingly associated with greater class and race ( and intra - race , especially among black people ) inequality , lack of delivery , corruption ( or perceptions of corruption ) and cronyism .
The ANC may succeed in quelling dissent with food packets during this election cycle , but that will be harder five years from now , which will be 25 years since Mandela walked out of prison and two decades since the first democratic elections ."
2009-04-11,"Interviewing Jacob Zuma is unlike meeting any other politician at the peak of his career .
Gaffe - prone and spin - free , the African National Congress president , who turns 67 today , finds himself easily carried away in bonhomie that gets the better of his dislike of journalists .
It was a year ago , in Luthuli House , the ANC head office , in Johannesburg .
Zuma was still devoting all his energies to his legal battle to avoid going to trial on a slew of corruption charges which he claims were politically motivated .
That fight ended last Monday and Zuma is now set to become South Africa 's next president after the country 's fourth all - race elections on 22 April .
At the time of the interview , it was a vain hope to ask any policy questions .
Crime , health and education were important but the direction of his future presidency would be about the wishes of the ANC , not his .
Yet when the questions got personal , Msholozi ( his clan name ) lashed out at journalists , complaining of successive trials by media .
In defending himself , he clumsily repeated his justification for having had sex with a 31-year - old woman whom he was later cleared of raping .
He said the woman had "" always worn trousers but that day she wore a kanga and no panties "" .
Patronage , in the African context , is not corruption : "" If I buy my brother a pair of trousers , I buy them for him because he is my brother not because I want something from him .
Europeans do n't understand that . ""
ANC press officer Steyn Speed , who sat in on the interview , stared down at the shiny boardroom tabletop , presumably contemplating a nightmarishly damaging Observer headline .
Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma comes across as everything the shy , uncharismatic and intellectual Thabo Mbeki was not .
Where Mbeki was groomed for power by ANC president Oliver Tambo and handpicked to be head of state by Nelson Mandela , Zuma is the self - taught Zulu herdboy whose policeman father died before he was four and whose domestic worker mother lived in a faraway town .
Where Mbeki was the brains of the ANC , polygamist guerrilla leader "" JZ ' "" was the brawn .
But what is less well known is that the two men were practically joined at the hip for 30 years .
After an aimless childhood with virtually no schooling or role models , Zuma joined the ANC at the age of 17 and the South African Communist party at 21 .
The same year , 1963 , he was arrested while attempting to cross to Bechuanaland ( Botswana ) for training with Umkhonto we Sizwe ( MK ) , the armed wing of the banned ANC .
He spent the next 10 years imprisoned on Robben Island .
On his release , he married a childhood sweetheart , Sizakele Khumalo , the first of his six wives .
In 1974 , he went into exile , in Swaziland , where Thabo Mbeki taught him to shoot .
Bonding over a firearm , the two established a partnership that was to last until Zuma was sacked as deputy president in 2005 .
Mbeki read the books ; Zuma read the people .
The two men were deported to Mozambique in 1976 and eventually found themselves together at "" head office "" in Lusaka , Zambia .
During Zuma 's exile he was involved not only in training MK guerrillas but in intelligence work .
He was also a member of the shady and violent ANC disciplinary arm , Mbokodo ( "" the stone that crushes "" ) , which ran Quadro , a disciplinary camp in Angola .
According to research by the Observer 's David Beresford , cadres sent to be disciplined endured beatings with barbed wire and torture .
Zuma has never spoken about his role in Mbokodo and failed to turn up for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearing that might have offered some light .
With the end of apartheid came the ANC 's choice of post - Mandela leader and the gradual sidelining of the brash and uneducated Zuma .
Xhosa nobleman Mandela chose Xhosa intellectual Mbeki .
Zuma , who in 1990 had played a crucial role in the transition to democracy by convincing Zulus that the future would be political , not tribal , was given second prize : a deputy presidency .
He survived the poisoned chalice of heading the National Aids Council under Aids - denying Mbeki .
He tried unsuccessfully to broker peace in Burundi , and on the tight ship that Mbeki was running , ultimately fell foul of party tittle - tattle .
The final falling - out was in 2001 after Mbeki discovered that Zuma had received - and kept secret - a letter from Winnie Madikizela Mandela , then president of the ANC women 's league , in which she referred to gossip about the president 's alleged womanising .
In 2003 National Prosecution Authority head Bulelani Ngcuka announced that Zuma 's former financial adviser , Schabir Shaik , would be charged with corruption and fraud in connection with a 1999 South African arms procurement deal .
Ngcuka added that there was a "" prima facie "" case against Zuma but that it was "" not winnable "" .
Shaik went to jail and in June 2005 Mbeki sacked Zuma , replacing him with Ngcuka 's wife , Phumzile Mlambo - Ngcuka .
A week later , prosecutors launched a case against Zuma on 16 charges linked to the arms deal , involving about 4 m rand ( £ 291,000 ) .
Claiming to be the victim of a political conspiracy , Zuma plotted his comeback and danced his way to revenge .
He turned to the ANC Youth League , his communist and trade union friends - those who felt betrayed by Mbeki 's neo - capitalism - and won the presidency of the ANC in December 2007 .
The scenes at the conference - contrasting the lonely figure of Mbeki with the chanting of a crowd wearing T - shirts bearing slogans such as "" 100 % Zuma "" and "" Zulu Boy "" - made it clear that the old - fashioned ANC had been subjected to a total takeover .
Mbeki spent the remainder of his time in power negotiating the Zimbabwe crisis and was ousted in September in favour of caretaker president Kgalema Motlanthe .
The South African parliament was left merely to rubber - stamp decisions taken at Luthuli House .
Last Monday , Zuma 's victory became complete and his supporters danced in the streets , bursting into choruses of "" Lethu Mshini Wami "" ( "" Bring me my machine gun "" ) .
After weeks of speculation , the NPA had dropped the case , citing taped evidence produced by the defence , implying that the prosecutor timed his moves so as to undermine Zuma 's ANC presidency campaign .
The party is keen to maintain its two - thirds majority .
Until last Monday , that looked optimistic , given the birth of the Congress of the People ( Cope ) - a black - led grouping created by Mbeki acolytes .
But despite the failings of 15 years of ANC rule - especially in terms of uplifting the poor - Cope failed to come up with convincing policies or to break out of its middle - class Xhosa mould .
Its strongest card had been Zuma 's legal problems and it failed to attract big - name defections from the ANC , apart from clear Mbekists .
Zuma will be inaugurated as president at the helm of a bruised but very powerful ruling party and after an election dominated by his legal battle and devoid of debate over the urgent issues still facing the country after 15 years of democracy - vast wealth inequalities , appalling education for blacks , Aids policies that may only be beginning to come right , and now - endemic corruption , which has worsened inadequate service provision .
But Zuma may be what his country needs .
The meteorological feature of what was known as the New South Africa is no longer a rainbow but the dark cloud that is said to hang over
the "" did he or did n't he ? "" question .
( The fact is , if he did accept bribes , so did many others . )
That dark cloud does n't just hang over the incumbent president but over an entire nation , where no one obeys the rules - there are 9,000 murders per year .
But what will he be like ?
Given the role of the communists and trade unions in Zuma 's elevation , what are his promises of macroeconomic stability worth ?
How will he take the country into his confidence , given that even among his supporters , many remain unconvinced that he is innocent of corruption ?
Has his main ambition been to get to power , rather than do anything with it ?
The questions are the same as they were at Luthuli House a year ago , and the answers have not been provided by the election campaign .
At the heart of the leadership of South Africa now is not so much Zuma 's personality - or his guilt or innocence - but what the ANC has become in the process of transforming itself from liberation movement to ruling party .
What has happened is a conflation of the leader , the party , the government and the state that has nothing to do with democracy .
Power was centralised under Mbeki and the party seems caught up in a culture in which debate and dissent are suppressed in ways hardly less glorious than at the Quadro disciplinary camp .
At best the Zuma presidency will be the end of what is cynically called the "" Xhosa nostra "" and the beginning of an era in which a tough - talking president rolls up his sleeves and pulls thousands of illiterate herdboys and girls out of poverty .
At worst , it will be jobs for the boys - at least those wearing "" 100 % Zuma "" T - shirts .

2009-04-18,"Fifteen years after Nelson Mandela was sworn in as president before an admiring world , South Africa is about to elect a leader who , despite his adamant denials , is widely regarded in his own country as a crook .
Until a few days ago , there was a real prospect that Jacob Zuma would go on trial later this year as a sitting president on a myriad of bribery and racketeering charges .
But the national prosecutor 's office dropped the indictment just ahead of this week 's general election , stating that there had been political interference in the process , saving the ruling ANC the embarrassment of its leader being prosecuted for corruption .
Yet the man to blame for creating these circumstances is not Zuma .
Responsibility lies with Thabo Mbeki , the former president who succeeded Mandela a decade ago and who projected himself as an urbane intellectual promising a revival of his country and his continent .
Less than 10 years later , all that was largely forgotten as Mbeki was forced from office by his own party .
Few regretted his passing even if they were disturbed by the manner of his removal .
Mbeki made too many enemies with a governing style that demanded absolute loyalty while critics were ruthlessly vilified .
The institutions put in place to defend post - apartheid democracy were subverted to serve his interests and South Africa 's moral influence was expended on perverse support for regimes in Zimbabwe and Burma .
But most disastrous were Mbeki 's Aids policies , which led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of poor black people .
Mandela 's magic may have saved South Africa from full - blown civil conflict once the apartheid regime collapsed , but the country 's future path was decided by Mbeki , first as Mandela 's deputy and then as president .
His dominance of the post - apartheid era is reflected in four new books about South Africa , all of which relegate Mandela to a secondary role .
The best , Mark Gevisser 's A Legacy of Liberation : Thabo Mbeki and the Future of the South African Dream ( Palgrave Macmillan £ 18.99 , pp400 ) , seeks to understand how a man who came to power with so much goodwill behind him is today regarded with hostility .
Gevisser , a respected journalist who conducted several lengthy interviews with the then president , follows Mbeki 's path from the cold insecurity of his rural Transkei home , where he lived with a distant father perpetually threatened with arrest for his anti - apartheid activities , through his exile at Sussex University and in Moscow and finally to the forefront of ANC politics .
Gevisser carefully listens to his subject and those around him before artfully dissecting his thinking .
Nowhere is this clearer than on Aids .
As president , Mbeki cost countless lives as he questioned the science of the disease and delayed the distribution of anti - Aids medicines .
Gevisser describes how Mbeki 's views were shaped by an obsession with race , the legacy of colonialism and "" sexual shame "" .
He recalls the president phoning him to ask whether he had seen a 100-page paper he 'd secretly authored and distributed anonymously among the ANC leadership .
In it , Mbeki compared Aids scientists to latterday Nazi concentration camp doctors and portrayed black people who accepted orthodox Aids science as "" self - repressed "" victims of a slave mentality .
Similar sentiments revealed themselves in other political battles .
Critics were accused of being enemies of the people , corruption investigations were quashed as plots against the government and questioning of Mbeki 's support for Mugabe were dismissed as the product of a colonial mindset .
But Mbeki 's damage runs deeper than that and South Africa will live with its legacy for years .
Mbeki was determined to create a black elite to match the old white one , which had swiftly bought its way into ANC favour by giving huge sums of money to the new leadership , including the Mandela family .
The old elite played ball on what was called Black Economic Empowerment , which saw a small minority of black people become super - rich .
Not coincidently , most were attached to the ANC .
That pursuit of money inevitably sent corruption running through the body politic .
Charges of corruption brought out Mbeki 's instinctive defensiveness , because it played to what he saw as stereotypes about African leaders .
And so he sought to cover up anything that might embarrass the ANC unless it was useful in going after opponents such as Zuma .
In After the Party : Corruption , the ANC and South Africa 's Uncertain Future ( Verso £ 14.99 , pp320 ) , Andrew Feinstein offers an insider 's view of the depths to which Mbeki sank to protect his friends and pursue his critics .
Feinstein , a former ANC member of parliament , was hounded from the party because he pressed too far for the leadership 's liking with a parliamentary investigation into anallegedly corrupt arms deal .
He recalls his efforts prompting a furious diatribe from Essop Pahad , a cabinet minister who was also Mbeki 's closest aide : "" Who the fuck do you think you are questioning the integrity of the government , the ministers and the president ? ""
RW Johnson probes many of the same issues in South Africa 's Brave New World :
The Beloved Country
Since the End of Apartheid ( Allen Lane £ 25 , pp608 ) , which offers glorious detail on the political infighting and Mbeki 's vindictive style of government .
But , unlike Gevisser , Johnson offers few insights into what motivates Mbeki .
His book is devoted to cataloguing what he clearly regards as the ruling party 's failure on almost every level since the ANC fought its first election in 1994 under the slogan "" A Better Life for All "" .
Johnson calls affirmative action "" the single greatest disaster to overtake South Africa "" , as there were n't the necessary numbers of skilled black people to fill demand .
But he sometimes seems to forget that the ANC did not create the problems of poverty , unemployment and a lack of basic health care .
It inherited them from a system that disregarded 90 % of South Africans .
There 's a better understanding of the strides the party , and the country , has taken , in Alec Russell 's After Mandela : the Battle for the Soul of South Africa ( Hutchinson £ 18.99 , pp336 ) .
Russell does not pull punches in describing the widespread disillusionment among blacks and the disasters of the Mbeki years .
But he does seek to put the ruling party 's shortcomings in context and recognises that life is better for many South Africans than it was .
Millions now have access to power and clean water and affordable housing is more widely accessible .
While whites whinge about a deteriorating infrastructure , many black people see hope .
It 's easy to run a country for the benefit of one in 10 of the population ; it 's much harder to do it for everyone .
But the party has been distracted by the power struggle between Mbeki and Zuma that has torn the ANC apart .
Russell maps it out and asks what path South Africa will now follow .
Zuma is very different from his predecessor - an extrovert politician , comfortable in his own ( black ) skin .
Although once a member of South Africa 's Communist party , he comes across today as almost shorn of ideology .
Zuma seems up for grabs , willing to be guided by whichever of the factions that threw its weight behind him is able to assert its dominance , whether the communists and unions or the pro - business elite .
The charges against Zuma were dropped not because of a lack of evidence but because a tape recording of Mbeki speaking to the head of the investigation team suggests that the charges were being pursued for political reasons .
It was classic Mbeki .
No one was surprised .
Zuma will have to govern with the legacy of that and much else besides .

Chris McGreal recently stood down as the Guardian and Observer 's Africa correspondent to become Washington correspondent ."
2009-04-19,"As young Zulu boys , Maphamule Ndlovu and Jacob Zuma had much in common .
They would herd cattle , kill snakes and learn the warrior code by stick fighting .
They would listen to stories of their ancestors around the village fire in the pretty but impoverished hills of 1950s KwaZulu - Natal .
But the lives of the two men , now both 67 , could not have turned out more differently .
Ndlovu lives alone in a ramshackle building with a leaking roof and no water or electricity , on a diet of bread , tea and porridge .
Zuma is poised to become South Africa 's first Zulu president after elections on Wednesday . ""
He was the person who was good - looking and spoke well , "" recalls his former friend .
""
He was very determined to be educated . ""
In a story that rivals anything the American dream has to offer , the Zulu herd boy from one of the country 's poorest provinces is about to become the most powerful man in Africa .
He has done it after serving his time in the liberation struggle and on Robben island .
He has proved a resilient political fighter who , floored by fraud and corruption claims and a charge of rape , kept picking himself up off the canvas to finally outmanoeuvre his rivals .
Unlike the scholarly and aloof Thabo Mbeki , who habitually quoted Shakespeare or phrases in Latin , Zuma can dance .
He is charming and charismatic and comfortable in his own skin .
He can walk with royalty - Prince Charles is said to have described him as "" one of his best friends "" - without losing the common touch .
His ability to connect with poor people , black and white , and articulate their concerns about crime and jobs has been compared to that of politicians in the southern states of America . ""
In a certain kind of way Zuma will be our first African president , "" said his biographer , Jeremy Gordin .
""
Nelson Mandela transcended everything and was a world figure .
Thabo Mbeki spent a lot of time in England wearing pinstripe suits and smoking a pipe .
Zuma is a real African . ""
However , Zuma has earned plenty of critics - including Archbishop Desmond Tutu - and enemies during his ascent .
Many believe that the recent collapse of legal action against him was a disaster for South Africa 's courts .
They accuse Zuma of being a political chameleon who tells audiences what they want to hear , reassuring business , courting trade unions and communists , appealing to populist sentiments for the death penalty and against gay marriage .
They worry about who will ultimately control him once he is in power .
Zuma 's Zulu origins can be found amid the undulating hills , valleys and forests , deep ridges and steep gorges of KwaZulu - Natal .
It was here that Zuma , the son of a domestic worker and rural policeman , gained the thin scars visible on his face today in a clan initiation .
A razor is used to make incisions in the cheeks of a child between their first and second birthday , then a herbal mixture is applied to heal it .
But the clan believes that if the sky is overcast , the scars will continue to weep .
Education was scarce for Zulu boys growing up in the early apartheid years .
But Zuma 's brothers challenge the myth that he received no education , and only learned to read and write while a prisoner on Robben island . ""
For most of us , school was about being able to write letters to girlfriends , but Jacob was different , "" Michael Zuma told the Guardian through a Zulu translator . ""
He insisted we should get further knowledge so , after we brought in the cows each day , we attended a kind of night school .
He instigated it for everyone . ""
Joseph added : "" People say he did n't learn because they ca n't find evidence of which school he went to , but that 's because we had classes on the homestead .
Jacob was a very intelligent boy with a very incisive mind .
"" When we were sitting around doing nothing , Jacob was always the one who would pose us questions . ""
At times of poverty , for example , he would ask if there was a room full of food and a room full of money , which would you rather have ?
He was always asking deep questions . ""
The brothers believe that Zuma 's childhood experiences shaped the man he is today .
Michael added : "" Jacob still very much believes in Zulu culture .
We do n't want him to forget it because those are his roots .
It 's unfortunate if white people disagree , as he is only pursuing his own culture .
Taking many wives is acceptable to Zulus as long as you have means to support them .
White people have their own culture .
"" There is general uncertainty about the number of Zuma 's wives , though he reportedly has 22 children by six women .
While he was acquitted of rape , his remark that he took a shower after having sex with an HIV - positive woman to minimise the risk of infection caused fury .
So too his statement that "" in Zulu culture you can not leave a woman if she is ready .
To deny her sex , that would have been tantamount to rape .
"" None of this plays well with the middle class in urban centres such as Cape Town , especially among educated women .
Some are appalled that , when the eyes of the world turn on South Africa for next year 's World Cup , they will find a country led by an "" African big man "" with several first ladies .
The Zulu factor is also painful to those who admired the ANC for keeping tribalism out of politics for so long , even if the outgoing leadership was dubbed the "" Xhosa Nostra "" .
Mandela and Mbeki were both Xhosas . ""
Xhosas have a reputation as great talkers , "" said a political analyst , Patrick Laurence .
"" Zulus have a reputation as great fighters . ""
"" White folk not familiar with rural Africa do n't like it , and women shirk from his polygamy , "" said Allister Sparks , a veteran journalist and political analyst .
"" But it goes down well with Zulus and poor people around the country .
Unlike Mbeki , he can do the tribal dance and connect with them . ""
Today many of South Africa 's 7 million Zulus , the biggest ethnic group at around 15 % of the population , are assimilated and westernised .
In the historic Zulu capital , Ulundi , they visit KFC and Nando and the large shopping centre .
But in neighbouring poor townships , many speak only Zulu and believe in a spiritual link with their ancestors .
It was their ancestors ' empire that was unceremoniously smashed by the British army in 1879 , just six months after the battle of Rorke 's Drift , depicted in the film Zulu with Michael Caine .
This was a humiliating final defeat that , in the words of local battlefield guides , turned once proud warriors into herdboys , labourers and servants .
But 130 years later , a Zulu has power in his grasp .
And Zuma , who used to regale his Robben island cellmates with tales of the Anglo - Zulu war , has made sure everyone gets the message .
He wears leopard skin and loincloth to dance with his close ally , the current Zulu king Goodwill Zwelithini , and his signature song is Umshini Wam ( Bring Me My Machine Gun ) .
His supporters sport T - shirts proclaiming "" 100 % Zulu Boy "" .
The leader of the ANC youth league announced its readiness "" to take up arms and kill for Zuma "" .
Under Zuma , the ANC is likely to overwshelm its bitter rival in KwaZulu - Natal , the Inkatha Freedom party , led by the veteran Zulu prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi .
More than 23,000 police and soldiers have been deployed in the province in case of more violence this time .
Posters for both parties are dotted on lampposts and telegraph poles around Nkandla .
The beauty of the landscape here belies the brutal statistics which show unemployment at 90 % and estimate Aids as infecting at least one in four people .
The poverty is palpable in Ndlovu 's home and life story .
Zuma 's childhood friend tried to make a living despite never becoming literate .
He went to work in Johannesburg , but was the victim of a shooting .
He rolls up his shirt to reveal the scars of stitches on his stomach .
He returned to Nkandla and married , fathering two sons , but his wife left him and later died .
Asked how he earns money to feed himself , he said : "" I throw my hands in the air .
I just live from day to day .
I try to hold on to that . ""
Would he swap places with his childhood friend ?
"" You ca n't be president when you are not educated , "" he muses .
"" I do regret not being educated .
When Zuma comes back here as president , he is welcome to bring me some money . """
2009-04-19,"Nelson Mandela today proved he is still the giant of African politics when he made a surprise appearance at the African National Congress 's final campaign rally before Wednesday 's elections .
Tens of thousands of supporters shouted and sang as Mandela , wearing a shirt in the ANC 's green , gold and black colours ‑ and emblazoned with the campaign slogan "" Together we can do more "" ‑ was driven into Johannesburg 's Ellis Park stadium in a golf cart .
South Africa 's 90-year - old first black president was helped on to the stage by Jacob Zuma , the man set to become the fourth .
Wearing a baseball cap , Mandela then took his seat and , smiling serenely , effortlessly upstaged the man whose coronation this was meant to be .
Too frail to stand during the national anthem or to make a speech , Mandela spoke in a short , recorded message played on stadium TV screens .
He said the "" primary task "" for the ANC is to "" eradicate poverty and ensure a better life for all "" .
He did not mention Zuma by name .
In an emotional moment charged with a little wistfulness , the crowd then rose as one to sing "" Nelson Mandela , Nelson Mandela "" , paying tribute to the retired statesman , now in his twilight years .
A record 400,000 people were estimated to be watching the "" Siyanqoba "" ( "" Victory "" ) rally in Ellis Park or on screens at the adjacent Johannesburg stadium , and in stadiums in South Africa 's eight other provinces .
The ANC looks certain to win but , in the most competitive election since the dawn of democracy 15 years ago , the party is fighting to retain its two - thirds majority .
The centrepiece of the event was the address by ANC president Zuma , who paid tribute to Mandela as "" the icon of this country "" , thanking him for being a "" president , father and statesman whose loyalty to the ANC we 'll never doubt "" .
Zuma , 67 , wearing a black T - shirt , whipped up the crowd with a funky dance before his speech , and followed it with his signature song , Bring Me My Machine Gun .
He told the crowds : "" The 2009 election is indeed a defining moment for the ANC and the country .
Only a few months ago pessimistic predictions were made for the ANC by those who claim to know best . ""
But we 've seen excitement about the ANC we 've not witnessed since the release of our icon , Madiba [ Mandela ] , and the 1994 elections . ""
He insisted the "" ANC brand "" had never been so strong with young and old alike .
In a reference to persistent racial divisions in the country , he said : "" We are firm that South Africa belongs to all of us , black and white , and working together we will ensure no South African feels less valued than any other because of their race or religion . ""
Outside the stadium thousands of people had formed a river of gold as they waved Zuma flags and banners and sang party anthems , as if on the way to a football match .
Bikers revved their engines in support , and city Metro trains slowed to honk their horns .
The rally was a show of strength by the ANC , which dwarfed those of rival parties such as the Congress of the People , a breakaway from within the ANC 's own ranks ."
2009-04-19,"Remember one thing as South Africa prepares to go to the polls this week and the world grapples with the ascendancy of the African National Congress leader Jacob Zuma : South Africa is not Zimbabwe .
In South Africa , no one doubts that Wednesday 's elections will be free and fair .
While there is an unacceptable degree of government corruption , there is no evidence of the wholesale kleptocracy of Robert Mugabe 's elite .
While there has been the abuse of the organs of state by the ruling ANC , there is not the state terror of Mugabe 's Zanu - PF .
And while there is a clear left bias to Zuma 's ANC , there is no suggestion of the kind of voluntarist experimentation that has brought Zimbabwe to its knees .
Unlike its neighbour , South Africa is deeply implicated in the global economy .
It has a robust civil society with a fiercely critical media , and it has an independent judiciary that has not balked at ruling against political leaders , who seem to respect its decisions .
Even if Zuma was to develop the authoritarian impulses of a Mugabe , he would be checked - not least by his own party , which set a continental precedent by ousting Thabo Mbeki in 2007 , after it felt he had outstayed his welcome by seeking a third term as party president .
The ANC appears to have set itself against that deathtrap of African democracy : the ruler for life .
But do these commendable democratic instincts flourish only because of the certitude of the ruling party 's majority , and its conviction that it has a divine mandate to lead its people ?
Zuma himself is fond of saying that the ANC will rule until the Second Coming .
Even Nelson Mandela reiterated , in his message to the ANC 's epic final campaign rally yesterday , that the ANC had an "" historical responsibility to lead our nation "" .
This self - perception is abetted by the polls : the ANC won nearly 70 % of the vote in the 2004 general elections , and is expected to take more than 60 % this year .
The ANC remains the liberator , overseen by a pantheon of deities including Mandela .
It is also home for most black South Africans ; and one that it is difficult to leave .
But if the adolescent South Africa is going to mature into a healthy liberal democracy , it is essential that the ANC learns to live with the possibility of defeat - and thus with the oversight of a strong opposition rooted in the country 's black majority .
The current official opposition , the Democratic Alliance , will win the Western Cape province away from the ANC , but is still perceived - not without cause - to be the shrill redoubt of racist white and coloured minority interests .
A new party , the Congress of the People ( Cope ) , was formed by Mbeki loyalists last year when their leader was ousted from the country 's presidency ; it seemed to present the first viable option for black voters wishing to move on from the ANC .
But although it will make a significant dent in the ANC 's majority , it will struggle to win more than 10 % of the vote .
While Cope has been beset by teething troubles and the dubious baggage of the Mbeki legacy , its existence has energised the ANC , which mounted its most exuberant ( and costly ) campaign to date in response .
A key ANC strategy has been to talk openly about the party as a "" family "" ; Zuma himself urges voters on the campaign trail not to leave the ANC hearth as they will find it "" cold outside "" .
He is , of course , suggesting that the ANC looks after its own .
In a society with devastating unemployment , where the state is often the only employer in impoverished rural areas and where nearly 25 % of all citizens rely on state social welfare grants , such an idea can not but carry an implicit threat .
In South Africa today , the argument could be made that the majority of Wednesday 's voters will still vote in their best interests when they put their cross next to the pro - poor Zuma .
But even if South Africa is not Zimbabwe , there is a lesson to be learned from north of the border , where more than 40 % of all voters chose to keep Mugabe in power last year , entirely against their own best interests .
The lesson is this : an identification with the ruling party for the atavistic reasons of "" family "" or race , or because it is perceived that benefits will accrue to you by virtue of being in the victory camp , is no insurance for a healthy democracy .
The fact that a demographically small but symbolically significant number of black voters will be leaving the ANC for the first time this year - many of them young people without any historical connection to the liberation struggle - is vitally important for South Africa 's wellbeing .
It is the beginning of a necessary realignment that must , eventually , see the end of the ANC 's de facto one - party state if the country is to grow and thrive .

2009-04-20,"We apologise to Jacob Zuma , the president of the African National Congress , for suggesting ( in a piece headlined Get used to a corrupt and chaotic South Africa .
But do n't write it off , 6 March , page 31 ) that he was guilty of rape .
This was included due to an editing error .
In fact , Mr Zuma was acquitted of a rape charge in 2006 .
We also alleged that he was guilty of corruption and bribery .
We would like to clarify that since the article was published all criminal charges against Mr Zuma have been dropped by the South African National Prosecuting Authority on the basis that the timing of the decision to prosecute him in the first place was politically motivated .
We apologise for any distress or embarrassment caused .

2009-04-20,"Jacob Zuma , expected to be elected president in tomorrow 's South African elections , has yielded to the demands of a powerful union in a dispute that threatens to cripple next year 's football World Cup .
The leader of the African National Congress ( ANC ) told taxi owners yesterday that he would agree to suspend a controversial plan to replace their vehicles with buses .
The taxis , in effect small minibuses , carry 50 million passengers per day .
The owners object to a plan that would replace taxis with buses on designated routes in the centres of Johannesburg , Cape Town and Port Elizabeth .
The buses are seen as a crucial part of South Africa 's attempts to upgrade almost non - existent public transport in time to shuttle thousands of football fans around major cities in 2010 .
The row over transport is one of several issues that could swing votes needed by the ANC to retain its two - thirds majority in parliament .
In a final push before polling day , Zuma appeared at a meeting of taxi drivers in Johannesburg and , after praising their role in the struggle against apartheid , pleaded for delegates to support the ANC .
Facing a voluble and potentially hostile reception , Zuma soon charmed his audience with flattery , amusing anecdotes spoken in Zulu and a rendition of his signature song , Umshini Wami ( "" Bring Me My Machine Gun "" ) , accompanied by a pianist and trumpeter .
Despite the taxi owners ' anger at the government , they gave Zuma a standing ovation and held their fists aloft .
Jan Nkosi , 46 , from Mafeking , said : "" Jacob Zuma 's speech was excellent but the people working with him are destroying us .
We are worried about buses taking us out of business .
There is a chance we will strike for the World Cup . ""
Commentators have suggested it was no coincidence that the taxi owners organised their summit or the eve of the elections .
Jeremy Gordin , author of a biography of the presidential candidate , said : "" The taxi industry is incredibly powerful and could bring this country to its knees .
The owners are like mafia dons - most drivers carry guns . ""
Zuma 's response is to charm them and say let 's talk some more .
It was a classic example of the good and bad Zuma two days before the elections .
"" The stand - off is just one of several economic headaches facing the man who looks certain to be South Africa 's next president .
Millions of blacks still live in impoverished shantytowns , unemployment is around 30 per cent and the country has one of the highest rates of violent crime in the world .
The government has an affirmative - action programme to bring black people into a mainstream economy still dominated by white people .
But critics argue that , while it made a few black businessmen wealthy , it has failed to help the poor .
Although once notorious areas such as Soweto now boast gleaming shopping malls , many people still live in townships lacking basic services .
Gordin added : "" For many people the main issue is , ' Where do I get money to buy food today ? '
Basic service provision is a disaster in this country .
The test for Zuma is whether he can fix it . ""
The poor and overcrowded township of Alexandra on the outskirts of Johannesburg was the scene of xenophobic violence last year , after rioters targeted and killed Zimbabwean immigrants .
Some three million Zimbabweans have fled economic collapse to South Africa in the past decade , along with many other Africans desperately seeking work .
Ntabeni Nkutha Zwane , a resident of Alexandra , told the Reuters news agency yesterday : "" My three points , first one is service delivery , second one , I expect job creation , and the third one , I expect our government to eliminate or reduce crime , our justice system should be stronger than before . ""
Zuma will be under pressure from union and communist backers to increase spending on the poor , while trying to placate foreign investors nervous about a shift to the left .
The economy shrank by 1.8 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
South Africa 's close regulation of banks has saved its financial sector from the worst of the global credit crisis .
But manufacturing output fell 15 per cent in February , a record year - on - year drop , having slumped by 12.9 per cent in the year to January , making the first recession in 17 years likely .
Falling global demand has placed thousands of jobs at risk in the labour - intensive manufacturing and car sectors .
About 24,000 jobs are at risk in mining as the prices of most metals fall , adding to high unemployment and triggering strike warnings by unions ."
2009-04-20,"Jacob Zuma , South Africa 's president - in - waiting , faces plenty of tough domestic challenges without worrying over - much about international relations .
But how he handles the ongoing crisis in neighbouring Zimbabwe will show how much importance he attaches to key issues of human rights , democracy , and the rule of law that resonate at home and abroad .
South Africa 's recent performance could certainly be improved .
Addressing foreign diplomats in Pretoria last month , Zuma said the African National Congress 's main foreign policy aim was to strengthen South Africa 's role in peacemaking , reconstruction , development and integration , especially in southern Africa and the African continent .
"" We must emphasise what our icon , Nelson Mandela , said in 1992 : that the primary task of ANC international policy was to be a friend to every nation in the world , "" he said .
The party had a "" clear plan "" to fight poverty and other global ills .
But Zuma 's lack of emphasis on human rights and good governance contrasted sharply with something else his more famous predecessor said .
Writing in 1993 , Mandela acknowledged the importance of human rights ideals in the international anti - apartheid movement and pledged "" human rights will be the light that guides our foreign affairs "" .
A free South Africa , he said , would be "" at the forefront of global efforts to promote and foster democratic systems of government "" .
In a recent article Terence Corrigan of the South African Institute of International Affairs , said a central question for Zuma as he prepares to assume power is whether the ANC "" has squandered [ South Africa 's ] enormous moral capital and its commitment to human rights to side with some very questionable regimes ? ""
The phrases human rights and democratisation no longer even appeared in the foreign affairs ministry 's mission statement , he noted .
Mandela 's clear vision for his country has grown especially cloudy of late , following South Africa 's two - year stint on the UN security council .
During that time it sided with Burma and Sudan against western countries enraged at egregious human rights abuses .
A similarly blind eye was turned to China 's treatment of Tibetans ; South Africa recently withheld a visa from the Dalai Lama for fear of upsetting Beijing .
Dismay also greeted its refusal to support a UN declaration decriminalising homosexuality and its reluctance to back moves to classify rape as a war crime .
The most notorious case of backsliding concerns South Africa 's continuing support for Robert Mugabe 's illegitimate , bloodstained presidency in Zimbabwe .
Only Pretoria has the power – economic , financial , physical – to force genuine change in Harare .
But despite a destabilising influx of 3 million Zimbabwean refugees , it consistently refused to apply its leverage during the reign of Thabo Mbeki , Zuma 's predecessor .
When Mugabe stole last year 's presidential election , Zuma was critical at first .
"" We can not agree with Zanu - PF ( Mugabe 's party ) , we can not agree with them on values , "" Zuma said .
"" We fought for the right of people to vote .
We fought for democracy . ""
But the hope that Zuma was breaking with Mbeki 's quietly - do - nothing diplomacy has since faded .
He now firmly backs Zimbabwe 's new power - sharing accord despite strong suspicions that the opposition has been suckered into perpetuating Mugabe 's hold on power .
Last month he attacked western countries such as Britain for withholding development aid .
Persistent allegations that Zuma has corruptly enriched himself , and has subverted the legal system to avoid just retribution , also raise a symbolic question mark over the next government 's commitment to the rule of law , at home and abroad .
ANC plans to "" speed up "" the country 's land reform programme , for example , have raised fears of forcible , illegal farm seizures as in Zimbabwe .
The party vows this will never happen .
South Africa 's apparent post - apartheid drift away from what are loosely called "" western values "" can be explained in several ways .
For James Kirchick , an American writer , Zuma and the ANC 's erstwhile freedom fighters are willing heirs to an "" anti - imperialist intellectual tradition heroically opposed to the western democracies "" .
This may help explain unconfirmed press reports that the ANC has received electoral funding from China , India and elsewhere – and its political dallying with the likes of Hamas and Hezbollah .
Then there 's the "" realist "" view .
Given that the country 's short - term imperatives are rapid economic growth , social development , and the alleviation of poverty , given its acute need of global partners , and given its aspirations as a continental power , South Africa simply can not afford an unworkable , west European - style liberal democratic agenda .
According to Terence Corrigan , "" an emergent multipolarity of power in the world will spawn a multipolarity of values "" .
In other words , universal rights remain an aspiration , not a fact .
One day South Africa may have to meet a more exacting standard .
But that is unlikely to happen while Jacob Zuma is in charge ."
2009-04-22,"The former archbishop Desmond Tutu said today that casting his vote in the fourth South African democratic elections required "" more heart - searching "" than in previous years .
The retired Tutu did not reveal how he had voted , but indicated that he was disappointed the president - elect , Jacob Zuma , would come to power with "" a question mark over his head "" .
Arriving with his wife , Leah , at Milnerton library polling station , the 77-year - old Nobel prize winner apologised to other voters for jumping the queue .
"" They are making me go ahead of you because I am so decrepit , "" joked the white - haired cleric , wearing his trademark fisherman 's cap .
At least 300 people , most of them white , were waiting at the polling station , which opened at 7 am but was unable to process voters until 9 am because election materials had not arrived .
In a television interview last week Tutu launched a scathing attack on the ANC government for failing to deliver housing and better healthcare to the majority of South Africans since coming to power in 1994 .
Today his views appeared to have mellowed . ""
The vote is still a wonderful thing , but for most people there 's more heart - searching this time .
It is n't like the previous elections .
It is no longer a foregone thing to vote for the ANC and you have to make decisions that go against your inclinations .
"" The way you feel in your head is not the same as the way you feel in your heart . ""
He said the National Prosecution Agency 's withdrawal two weeks ago of corruption charges against Zuma in connection with a multimillion pound arms deal in the 1990s had been damaging for the country .
"" We would have felt a lot better had we had a judicial commission to investigate the arms deal .
It would have been a great deal better for us , for Mr Zuma and for our country had he gone through a judicial process . ""
He should have faced the charges in a court of law .
They should not have been dropped in the way they have .
Even if he is innocent , there is a question mark and that is not good for our country . """
2009-04-22,"If campaign music would decide the South African election , the ruling African National Congress would win hands down .
From Mina Ngo Hlala Nginje or "" I will remain ANC for life "" driven by an infectious kwaito beat , their Barack Obama song , to the controversial lyrics of its presidential candidate Jacob Zuma 's signature tune Bring Me My Machine Gun , the organisation sure knows how to party .
In contrast the largest opposition party , the Democratic Alliance ( DA ) , can only counter with a frivolous and sexist Afrikaans ditty , Koekie Loekie , which contains a line "" Hey Koekie , with your little tight pants "" .
The much smaller Independent Democrats ( ID ) remixed the theme of the long - canned American TV series The Golden Girls while the new political party , the Congress of the People ( Cope ) , is using a semi - religious song by syrupy crooner Josh Groban .
The same can be said for the parties ' television commercials ( allowed for the first time in elections ) .
The ANC 's commercials , which invent a spotless record for the party of its last 15 years , still beat out the opposition 's tepid efforts .
While the ID and Cope with smaller budgets , at least try , the DA 's election advert consists of outdated , "" Rainbow Nation "" stock footage with no commentary and the song
Somewhere over the Rainbow , criticised even by the party 's own supporters .
But the ANC does not need commercials or catchy tunes to win the election .
And they 'll win , not because as one foreign correspondent suggested , of "" reflexive loyalty "" on the part of black South Africans , but largely because the opposition is so bad .
Large numbers of black South Africans – across class lines – are unhappy with the ANC , but like Aids activist Zackie Achmat , who publicly clashed with former president Thabo Mbeki and the country 's health minister , Manto Tshabalala - Msimang , over their wrongheaded Aids policies , they 'll probably vote for the ANC today , giving the party a two - thirds majority .
Many others question the wisdom of giving one party so much power .
Many of them want to vote for the opposition .
So what is available ?
The pickings are slim .
More than 40 opposition parties are running in nine provinces and at the national level .
Most of them do n't inspire confidence .
Cope was launched with much promise in November last year , but a number of elementary blunders have damaged the party 's chances .
It has no clear policy alternatives to the ANC and at Cope 's launch , party leaders compared the ANC government to apartheid , nominated an unknown white businesswoman as its deputy president and spent much of its time , despite claiming to leave the ANC over power politics , bickering over who would be party leader .
The new party also picked a political novice as its presidential candidate .
Cope ca n't shake its connection to Mbeki , whose legacy now is only misuse of the organs of state , coddling Robert Mugabe 's regime in neighbouring Zimbabwe and Aids denialism .
Some are looking to small parties like the ID and the United Democratic Movement ( UDM ) .
The ID is led by Patricia de Lille , and has proved more adapt than the larger DA ( which has a phalanx of American consultants , young able researchers and is beloved by the media ) at playing the role of opposition .
The UDM , led by a former ANC government minister , Bantu Holomisa , was the first opposition political party formed after 1994 .
Nelson Mandela expelled Holomisa from his cabinet .
In a recent report , Justin Sylvester , a political researcher from thinktank Idasa , suggests the ID and UDM 's "" softer issue - based "" approach to opposition politics may be more attractive to voters in the long run .
More disappointing has been the track record of the Democratic Alliance .
Despite copying Barack Obama 's "" Change "" logo for its election campaign , setting up a Twitter account for its party leader , Helen Zille , giving her a botox make - over , and the ease with which it adapted to social media , the DA still had to do ground - level campaigning .
Predictably it fell back on old habits .
Zille , like her predecessor Tony Leon , has proved more skilful at shoring up the party 's traditional base of minority whites and conservative coloureds , than attracting black votes .
Zille 's "" Stop Zuma "" campaign is turning off not only black voters , but also , even more significantly , some in her traditional constituency .
Like the other opposition parties , the DA has not exploited black working class dissatisfaction with the ANC 's economic policies under Mbeki .
The choices for South African voters are rather pedestrian today .
But on the bright side , this election campaign signalled perhaps the first class fissures among the country 's black majority ( the real effect of the Cope breakaway will perhaps be felt by the next presidential election in 2014 ) and for the opposition , that the need for a different kind of politics is long overdue ."
2009-04-23,"The voters appear to have made their choice abundantly clear in South Africa 's election .
Now the president - in - waiting , Jacob Zuma , must make a delicate diplomatic choice of his own : which of his wives will be the country 's first lady ?
When Zuma attends events such as the G20 , at which the Wags attracted much attention recently , there is likely to be only one seat allocated to his spouse alongside the likes of Michelle Obama , Sarah Brown and Carla Bruni - Sarkozy .
Zuma once told a television interviewer : "" There are plenty of politicians who have mistresses and children that they hide so as to pretend they 're monogamous .
I prefer to be open .
I love my wives and I 'm proud of my children . ""
When the president of the African National Congress ( ANC ) voted in his rural Zulu homeland yesterday , one of his wives stood to the side watching patiently as he was mobbed by cheering crowds and reporters .
Nompumelelo Ntuli , 34 , Zuma 's youngest wife , was soon attracting her own crowd of admirers .
Women whispered : "" Is n't she beautiful ! "" as Ntuli , decked out in an apricot and blue tie - dye outfit , cast a smile . ""
Jesus is Lord ! ""
was all she said in response to questions .
Reports conflict on how many times Zuma , 67 , a Zulu traditionalist and unabashed polygamist , has married over the years .
His first wife is Sizakele Khumalo , whom he has known for 50 years and married in 1973 .
He we d Ntuli last year , and reportedly was married again in January to Thobeka Mabhija , a Durban socialite with whom he is said to have two children .
Two more wives are no longer with him .
Kate Mantsho Zuma killed herself in 2000 .
He divorced the other , Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma , in 1998 , although she remains a trusted aide and , as the country 's foreign affairs minister , is expected to join his cabinet .
He is said to have more than 10 children ; possibly as many as 18 .
South African law recognises such marriages , although fewer young South Africans are entering into them because they are seen as expensive and old - fashioned .
It remains common among several tribes , however , including the Zulus and Swazis .
In the contest to be first lady , Khumalo has the seniority and experience but Ntuli has the glamour and ease in social situations .
Khumalo , who presides over the family homestead near the school where Zuma voted in Kwanxamalala , rarely appears in public .
Ntuli , who uses her maiden name , as is customary in polygamous marriages to differentiate among the wives , has been more active outside the home .
She organised a prayer meeting in south - eastern South Africa earlier this year , calling for political tolerance , and established a community development foundation .
ANC officials decline to comment , insisting that it is a private matter for Zuma ."
2009-04-23,"Jacob Zuma swept into power as South Africa 's fourth post - apartheid president last night , but was facing a formidable challenge of uniting his country behind him .
With around 12.2 m votes counted , the African National Congress ( ANC ) was narrowly ahead of the two - thirds majority it needs for the parliamentary freedom to rule unrestrained , and a celebratory rally thronged the streets of Johannesburg last night .
"" The people have spoken with their vote , "" Zuma told the crowds , switching from English to Zulu to Sotho .
"" We are not reading newspapers .
We are talking to the people .
We are not yet celebrating victory .
The counting is still going on .
The real celebration is on its way . ""
But then a bottle of champagne , and a giant replica bottle , were produced on stage and a blizzard of confetti unleashed , as the man treated the crowd to another rendition of his signature tune , "" Umshini Wam "" , meaning "" Bring me my machine gun "" .
Yet the impression of Zuma as a polarising figure has been reinforced by an unexpectedly strong showing by the Democratic Alliance ( DA ) , whose voters are largely white or of mixed race .
Zuma , 67 , who will be South Africa 's first Zulu president , scored heavily in the tribe 's traditional heartland of KwaZulu - Natal .
But the ANC looked likely to lose control of the Western Cape to the DA .
"" I think a lot of people have voted for the ANC reluctantly , "" Steven Friedman , a political academic , said .
"" Zuma will take office having to deal with a sceptical electorate and will be judged on how far he goes to allay scepticism and show that politicians care more about the people than looking after themselves . ""
The ANC had accumulated 8.2 m votes by last night compared with 1.9 m for the DA ( 16 % ) , and 939,000 ( 7.7 % ) for the ANC splinter group the Congress of the People ( Cope ) .
It was a bad day for one of the veterans of South African politics , 80-year - old Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi , whose Inkatha Freedom party was marooned on 4 % .
The ANC , which has governed South Africa since the first post - apartheid election in 1994 , was down from its 69.69 % share five years ago to 66.4 % .
Zuma will be sworn in as president in Pretoria on 9 May and can expect close scrutiny of his inauguration speech .
Andrew Feinstein , a former ANC MP turned critic of the party , said : "" What he will do is make overtures to minority groups who did n't vote for the ANC . ""
Experts predict that Zuma will tread carefully in his first 100 days , seeking to reassure the financial markets and show continuity in policy .
Among his first tasks will be to select a cabinet .
There is speculation that he will reward those who helped him win the presidency , including communists and trade unionists .
Feinstein said : "" He 'll use his cabinet announcement to send a message .
I think it 's going to be a mixed cabinet , rewarding some close confidants with jobs and including some competent people as well . ""
Feinstein said in his opinion it was a "" worrying sign "" that those in contention include Zuma allies Blade Nzimande , the general secretary of the Communist party , and General Siphiwe Nyanda , former chief of the national defence force .
Other contenders for cabinet posts include Zweli Mkhize , the ANC chairman in Zuma 's home province , Lindiwe Sisulu , touted as a possible foreign minister , and Jeremy Cronin , a member of the Communist party .
There is speculation about whether Trevor Manuel will remain in his post as finance minister , providing stability in the face of global recession and a conservative voice in the cabinet .
Zuma has attempted to soothe investor concerns by promising that he will not veer to the left .
But fears persist that , with a two - thirds majority , he might be tempted to amend the constitution , despite his assurances to the contrary ."
2009-04-23,"Jacob Zuma had the South African presidency in his grasp last night after tens of millions of people voted in the country 's most exciting election since the end of apartheid .
Early results showed the African National Congress ( ANC ) pulling ahead as expected after a day which saw long queues at voting stations and a celebratory mood reminiscent of the first multiracial elections in 1994 .
With just 23,000 of a potential 23 million votes counted , the ANC had 53.6 % support while the main opposition Democratic Alliance held 26 % .
The Congress of the People ( Cope ) , a new party formed by ANC dissidents late last year and touted as a potential challenge to 15 years of ANC dominance , tabled 8.7 % .
But with turnout possibly as high as 90 % , there was frustration as some polling stations ran out of ballot papers and boxes .
Election officials insisted that no one was turned away without being allowed to vote .
Zuma , given a clear run at the presidency this month when corruption charges against him were dropped , cast his vote at Ntolweni primary school in Nkandla as supporters sang his signature anthem , Umshini Wam , which means "" Bring Me My Machine Gun "" . ""
Never did I think as I was growing up here that one day I would cast my vote here as I am doing , "" said Zuma , the 67-year - old veteran of the struggle against apartheid .
"" It must be great , feeling the difference from the olden days to where we are today , when we can decide our own fate . ""
There were tears among supporters young and old as Nelson Mandela , South Africa 's first black president , stepped out of his car to vote in Johannesburg .
Mandela , 90 , braving the morning chill in a winter overcoat , walked with a silver cane as hundreds strained to photograph him .
Many voters were wrapped in blankets , hats and scarves as queuing began before sunrise .
The impressive turnout suggested renewed enthusiasm for the democratic process as the governing ANC faced a new challenge .
The Congress of the People ( Cope ) , a breakaway group of ANC rebels loyal to former president Thabo Mbeki , has been described as the first credible alternative for black voters .
Casting his vote , former archbishop Desmond Tutu said : "" The vote is still a wonderful thing , but for most people there 's more heart - searching this time .
It is no longer a foregone thing to vote for the ANC and you have to make decisions that go against your inclinations .
"" The ANC remained confident of an "" overwhelming "" victory to ensure Zuma becomes president , although opinion polls have suggested it could lose its two - thirds majority in parliament .
Election officials claimed the system had run smoothly but suffered some setbacks .
There were concerns that voters had been turned away after polling stations suffered a shortage of ballot papers and boxes .
The ANC expressed anxiety at the delays and Helen Zille , leader of the Democratic Alliance , branded the situation "" a farce "" , saying the electoral commission "" could n't run a bath "" .
The commission blamed a last - minute rule change which allowed people to vote at stations other than the ones where they were registered .
It said that 58 m ballot papers had been printed for 23 million registered voters and had been redistributed where necessary.""Most of the hiccups are little problems , "" said its chairman , Brigalia Bam .
"" We must not exaggerate this issue and make it bigger than it is . ""
Some voters complained that they had queued for as long as eight hours .
In Ulundi , near Zuma 's home in KwaZulu - Natal , a presiding officer was arrested and charged with fraud after she was found with marked ballot papers .
But the prevailing mood remained one of excitement , novelty and empowerment in a country where until 15 years ago black people were denied the right to vote .
In Johannesburg 's Soweto township , once the heart of the anti - apartheid struggle , Zwelibanzi Zuneu , 23 , was voting for the first time .
"" I voted for the ANC because of what it 's done for us in the past , "" he said .
"" If it was n't for the organisation , I do n't think we 'd be voting at all . ""
Soweto , scene of the 1976 student uprising , now boasts bars and restaurants , business parks and a giant shopping mall .
There was a steady flow of voters – including Mandela 's ex - wife , the ANC candidate Winnie Madikizela - Mandela – at the polling station at Orlando West high school . off Vilakazi Street where Nelson Mandela and Tutu once lived .
Lindi Hleza , 37 , a cleaner , came with her three - year - old son , Vezokuhle , to vote for the ANC .
"" My life has improved a lot under them , but there are some things left to be done , "" she said .
"" Instead of paying people for not working , they should create more jobs .
But I 'm optimistic for my son .
I think he will grow up in a better country . ""
In a reminder of the severe hardships that remain , however , about 200 protesters in the impoverished Alexandra township refused to vote .
One said : "" Until they give us a house , I wo n't vote for them . ""
Mbeki , who dismissed Zuma as deputy president in 2005 only to be ousted as president last year , remained tight - lipped , amid speculation that he had turned against his party at the polls .
"" People should vote for who they want , not out of fear , but for the party they believe will deliver , "" he said .
South Africa 's last white president , FW de Klerk , cast his vote in Cape Town and told reporters he believed the country 's democracy would be healthier because of the split in the ANC .
"" I think our situation becomes more competitive , "" he said ."
2009-04-24,"Jacob Zuma has claimed victory in the South African election – a result that has been welcomed by ministers in neighbouring Zimbabwe as intensifying pressure on President Robert Mugabe .
With around 95 % of votes counted , Zuma 's African National Congress ( ANC ) had taken 66.1 % of the vote .
British prime minister Gordon Brown called Zuma to congratulate him on his the victory .
Zuma has been outspoken in his criticism of Mugabe 's autocratic rule .
He supports of the power - sharing agreement between Mugabe 's Zanu - PF and the Movement for Democratic Change , led by Morgan Tsvangirai but he has criticised his predecessor Thabo Mbeki 's "" quiet diplomacy "" towards Zimbabwe .
Tendai Biti , finance minister in the unity government and secretary - general of the MDC , is looking forward to a Zuma presidency .
"" I do n't think it will be quiet diplomacy , "" he said .
"" That was buried on 22 September 2008 , the day Mbeki was removed .
I expect a more forthright , honest and hands - on diplomacy . ""
Jacob Zuma is not Thabo Mbeki and that means a lot .
I know the man and meet him regularly and know the way he thinks .
"" Unlike Britain and the US , South Africa has thrown its weight behind the power - sharing agreement , despite concerns that Mugabe and his allies remain dominant .
Biti added : "" South Africa is leading the way in supporting us directly , including financial assistance .
They recognise the problem requires international support They 've been calling for that consistently . ""
Zuma , who has a track record on brokering peace deals in conflict areas , is thought to be keen to keep the ear of Mugabe .
But he has family ties with the MDC : last year one of his daughters married the son of Welshman Ncube , a leading party figure .
David Coltart , Zimbabwe 's minister of education and an MDC senator , said : "" The key for us is that Jacob Zuma wins .
Of the last three – Thabo Mbeki , Kgalema Motlanthe and Zuma – he has been the most outspoken .
I think Mugabe will be fairly nervous about his relationship with him.""Zuma and Mugabe are very different characters .
You would never see Mugabe singing a song in front of the faithful and dressed in casual attire . ""
South Africa has long been regarded as the democratic anchor of the continent .
After the violent crackdown that followed last year 's disputed elections in Zimbabwe , Zuma said : "" We can not agree with Zanu - PF , we can not agree with them on values .
We fought for the right of people to vote .
We fought for democracy . ""
The provisional result appears to show the ANC falling short of the two thirds of the vote needed to change the South African constitution .
The ANC 's closest rival was the Democratic Alliance with almost 16.4 % of the vote .
The Congress of the People , formed by politicians who broke from the ruling party , stood below 7.5 % ."
2009-04-24,"Defying predictions that a scandal - ridden past and a split party would dent Jacob Zuma 's rise to power , the African National Congress roared into action in South Africa yesterday .
With most of the votes counted , the party led with 67 % , enough to ensure a two - thirds majority to change the constitution .
If it was no longer the lion of Mr Zuma 's imaginings , in most provinces the ANC proved itself to be an extremely agile cat .
Except , that is , in the Western Cape , where Cape Town 's charismatic mayor , Helen Zille , was on course to oust the ANC and possibly win control of the province outright .
Nationally , her Democratic Alliance ( DA ) came in a respectable second on 16 % .
Way behind both was the party which , when it broke from the ANC , championed itself as its only real alternative .
The Congress of the People - Cope - was struggling to do just that , unable to break into double figures .
These people had solid liberation - struggle credentials and , when they first broke away , thought they could take as much as 30 % of the vote .
But the splitters suffered from splits within their own ranks and they picked a poor candidate .
The smaller parties were the other losers of this election .
Mangosuthu Buthelezi 's Inkatha Freedom Party ( IFP ) was unable to compete with a Zulu in charge of the ANC and the IFP 's support in KwaZulu - Natal melted away .
So the party is not over for the ANC as the natural ruler of the country .
This was not the ANC 's toughest election , as had been widely predicted ; nor is its dominance of parliament likely to be shaken .
Mr Zuma has a mandate to rule almost as large as Thabo Mbeki 's .
However , this is not the end of the story .
With cabinets being formed , and lucrative posts to be filled at all levels of government , it is payback time for Mr Zuma 's band of brothers .
They have pulled their candidate through some thin times - a trial for rape , for which he was acquitted , and a corruption case that lasted for eight years before it was dropped three weeks ago .
The mood in the Congress of South African Trade Unions will be particularly worth watching a year into a government which fails to make inroads into soaring unemployment , income inequality , or the world 's highest murder rate .
These became national problems with the economy growing by 4.5 % a year .
But that growth rate is unlikely continue as the global recession bites .
Mr Zuma starts with the advantage of not being Mr Mbeki : he has the popular touch ; he can listen ; he can pull people together .
But he is going to need more than these to navigate the course ahead .
For this much has changed .
It is not enough for the ANC to remain in power .
It has to deliver too ."
2009-04-24,"The anxiety over Jacob Zuma 's election as president of South Africa obscures a significant milestone : for the first time in decades , a sub - Saharan nation has at its helm a champion of ordinary people .
African politics has long been the exclusive domain of aristocrats , soldiers and technocrats .
Even with the spread of democratic elections , the region 's leaders tend to come from the ranks of soldiers ( Uganda , Rwanda , Zimbabwe ) , family dynasties ( Togo , Kenya , etc ) , or university professors , lawyers , and economists ( Ghana , Malawi , Liberia ) .
Now South Africa , the region 's economic engine and home to its most sophisticated universities , media , and corporations , has a former goat herder at its helm , a rare African leader with the common touch .
Zuma is legendary for his ability to connect with ordinary people .
He 's secure enough to dance and sing in public .
He speaks the language of populism , raising hopes for the vast majority of South Africans who daily endure the misery of poor housing , schools , and health care .
In contrast to his two predecessors – the saintly Nelson Mandela , who emphasized racial healing , and the aristocratic Thabo Mbeki , who reassured financiers with his strong grasp of macroeconomics –
Zuma recognises the pent - up demand for material improvement in the lives of his country 's tens of millions of have - nots .
"" We have learned from the mistakes of the past 15 years , especially the manner of which we may have , to some degree , neglected the people 's movement , "" he said in April , before his African National Congress swept to victory .
Until now , populism has been the missing note in African political culture .
Zuma , who spent his youth herding cattle and only gained formal education while in the notorious Robben Island prison with Mandela , is refreshingly aware that Africa 's biggest problem is its inequalities , not its global marginalisation .
In Africa 's wealthiest nation – but also the nation where wealth is most unequally shared – a bold populist now holds ultimate power over government policy .
Yet , while Zuma 's populist appeal reflects South Africa 's especially large differences in economic class , the threat of imposing higher taxes and other obligations on employers and the wealthy has raised fears at home and internationally .
Moreover , Zuma has been called a chameleon , accused of telling his audiences what they want to hear .
Zuma 's turbulent personal life – many wives and his embarrassing contention during a rape trial that he avoided HIV infection by taking a shower – has invited ridicule .
Most seriously , doubts persist about his commitment to democracy , with critics arguing he 's an old - style African "" big man "" ready to bully opponents and ravage the public coffers with his cronies .
Dismissing complaints , Zuma insists , "" There 's no cloud around me . ""
His defenders , meanwhile , point to two benefits that he has already delivered : an end to Mbeki 's ambivalent approach to fighting HIV / AIDS , the country 's major public health threat , and a refreshing willingness to move against Zimbabwe 's aged dictator , Robert Mugabe , whom Mbeki coddled out of a misguided sense of loyalty for his support during the struggle against apartheid .
In an Africa bereft of successful populist politicians , Zuma 's role models may come from Latin America , where income inequality is also extreme and the trade union movement , as in South Africa , is strong and militant .
With enormous pressure from ordinary people to deliver tangible gains , Zuma the populist will quickly face a major test : will he emulate Lula of Brazil , who has struck an admirable balance between good economic governance and redistribution of wealth to the poor ?
Or will he follow the path of Hugo Chávez , a popular autocrat who seems to prefer building a cult of personality over raising living standards for the poor ?
The stakes for Africa are enormous .
South Africa has the continent 's largest economy and , until the global financial crisis , posted 10 years of steady economic growth .
In an economic slowdown , the country 's severe crime problem might only worsen ; so might unemployment , which already tops 20 % in the formal economy .
Zuma senses the urgency of the situation .
He is , after all , 67 years old and likely to serve only a single term in office .
"" We ca n't waste time , "" he says .
Yet , according to the political economist Moeletsi Mbeki , at his core , "" Zuma is a conservative . ""
In this sense , Zuma represents yesterday 's South Africa .
He is part of the proud generation that defeated apartheid – and then peacefully engineered a transition to durable black - majority rule .
Their achievement remains one of the greatest in recent history .
At the same time , Zuma 's revolutionary generation still seems uneasy leading South Africa in a post - apartheid era that is now 15 years old .
In a region that reveres the elderly , Zuma 's attachment to his rural traditions must be matched by an equal openness to the appetites of the country 's youth .
Three in 10 South Africans are younger than 15 , meaning that they did not live a day under apartheid .
Somehow Zuma must find a way to honour his own generation 's commitment to racial justice and national liberation , while empowering the masses who daily suffer the sting of class differences and yearn for material gain .

2009-04-25,"The African National Congress stormed to a fourth successive landslide victory in election results announced yesterday , but stopped short of maintaining its coveted two - thirds majority in the South African parliament .
Spokeswoman Jessie Duarte said the ANC 's 66 % share of the vote - its lowest since 1994 - represented an "" emphatic mandate "" for party leader Jacob Zuma , ahead of his inauguration as president on 9 May.
The main opposition hailed a victory for democracy as the ruling party lost its parliamentary power to change the constitution without challenge .
In a victory speech at the counting centre in Pretoria last night , ANC leader Jacob Zuma called for a "" new era of hope and progress "" and pledged his government would not be out of touch with the people .
In a clear reference to his past rivalry with former president Thabo Mbeki , he said : "" We have gone through a difficult period over a few years .
South Africa must reclaim its position and image as a thriving nation , which can overcome all its difficulties , and which is able to put the country first above sectional and party political interests . ""
Final results were released by the Independent Electoral Commission in Pretoria at the end of a process delayed by the fact that the 17 million South Africans who voted last Wednesday - a 77 % turnout - were allowed to cast their ballots in any polling station .
The ANC 's loss of its two - thirds majority was a triumph for the Congress of the People ( Cope ) party , created only four months ago .
Cope , whose supporters are close to Mbeki , scored only 7 % in the national poll , but the party 's presence on the ballot paper achieved its aim of undermining the dominance of the ANC among black voters .
The biggest setback for the ANC was the loss of the Western Cape , where it won only 32 % of the vote against 46 % in 2004 , marking the first time the ruling party has been ousted from provincial government at the polls .
The Democratic Alliance ( DA ) won an absolute majority in the Western Cape with 51 % of the vote , nearly double its score in 2004 .
Fighting her way through 300 well - wishers after flying back from the counting centre in Pretoria , Helen Zille , the mayor of Cape Town and DA leader , claimed to be at the vanguard of multi - partyism in South Africa . ""
The Western Cape is leading South Africa towards democracy , "" she told the Observer . ""
The voters here have shown the nation that democracy is not just about the right for everybody to vote , but about the regular change of government through the ballot box . ""
Zille , who will become premier of the Western Cape province , said the first victory for the opposition would be to block Amendment 17 , a constitutional change to limit local authorities ' revenue - raising powers , which was put before the cabinet shortly before the election .
The DA , which won 17 % of the vote nationally , also hopes for support from other opposition parties to prevent the ANC from managing the judiciary to its advantage .
The party claims that the national prosecutor bowed to ANC pressure when it withdrew a corruption case against Zuma three weeks ago .
On the arrivals forecourt at the airport , Zille 's car was blocked by the dancing crowd .
Tourists with trolleys seemed confused by the sea of blue T - shirts .
Western Cape , the country 's richest province , has always been different because of its racial make - up : 4.2 million people are classed as "" coloured "" - mixed - race - against about 1.2 million black and 1 million white people .
But Zille , a 58-year - old former anti - apartheid activist , claims that the DA 's breakthrough is much more than a demographic assertion .
"" The DA is the most non - racial party in South Africa , "" she insisted , "" and the magnificent thing is that the voters of the Western Cape have led the way in the crusade against identity politics . ""
Zille , a former journalist who had to leave the profession in 1977 after co - authoring a scoop that exposed the apartheid regime 's role in the death of activist Steve Biko , is the biggest thorn in the ANC leadership 's side .
She is not humble , and yesterday claimed a Barack Obama - like victory in her crusade against identity politics , an apartheid invention that lives on through the ANC 's incessant references to race .
She told the Observer : "" In the DA we have crossed all the racial boundaries and done , in 15 years , what it took the United States 221 years to do . ""
While she accepts that she will never be president of the country because she is white , she has credentials that humble those of many black ANC supporters .
In the 1980s she was a leader of the Black Sash women 's resistance movement .
She entered mainstream politics in the 1990s when her party was called the Democratic party and polled 5 % in the province .
As provincial education minister , she gained the nickname "" Godzille "" for her dawn blitzes on schools with high teacher absenteeism .
Her mantra since becoming mayor of Cape Town in 2006 has been to show up the "" failed state "" created by the ANC .
Reformed municipal policing and efforts to combat drug crime appear to be among her achievements .
The welcoming crowd 's banners read : "" Wake up SA and support Helen "" and "" Service delivery happens in the Cape "" .
Their song elevated her even further : "" Dit is Zille wat die wind laat waai "" ( It 's Zille who makes the wind blow ) ."

2009-04-26,"The mandate , just short of a two - thirds majority of the vote in last week 's elections , given to South Africa 's ruling African National Congress , is a poisoned chalice .
It is clear that the election of Jacob Zuma as ANC leader in 2007 has energised South Africa 's electorate .
Voter turnout was more than 70 % in this election .
Some white South Africans , who seemingly gave up on politics after the loss of political power in 1994 , have returned .
Many appear to have voted to prevent Zuma 's ascendancy , by casting their ballot for the traditionally white Democratic Alliance ( DA ) or the Congress of the People ( Cope ) , the party formed by ANC dissidents last year .
Many middle - class black people , also opposed to Zuma , have broken their allegiance to the ANC and voted for Cope .
But poor blacks , who had drifted away because of the party 's poor delivery record , have returned to vote for the ANC persuaded by Zuma 's promises .
Party leaders have successfully presented themselves as almost a new ANC that will be more pro - poor , accountable and less corrupt – blaming government failures on the leadership of outgoing president , Thabo Mbeki .
Sadly , the election campaign brought few details of how to deliver the promises .
Zuma 's challenges are formidable : improving public services , assembling competent staff – which means not purging senior civil servants critical of him – tackling corruption , and restoring the credibility of democratic institutions .
Having turned out in their millions , the challenge now is for South Africans to stay politically active .
They must hold the new government accountable , to prevent the abuse of power we have seen in recent years .
It is also clear that South Africa has too many opposition parties , with few policy differences .
Some of them will do well to merge , or even to become NGOs .
Desperate black voters , who gave the ANC this victory , did so in a last - ditch hope that its leaders will turn their liberation struggle promises and good intentions into action .
That calls for Zuma to roll up his sleeves from day one .
He is unlikely to have the honeymoon period that previous ANC governments had .
If the ANC does not deliver this time , people are likely to plunge back into apathy or protest strongly , even violently .
To capture the presidency , Zuma assembled a disparate coalition and made often diametrically opposed promises to each group .
We now face the possibility that disappointed expectations and infighting in the coalition may trigger another fracture of the ANC .
In the successful campaign to get the corruption charges against Zuma dropped , democratic institutions were damaged , and their credibility is now in tatters .
Zuma must steer clear of appointing uncritical acolytes , and make the ANC internally democratic .
The DA has won in the Western Cape , giving it the opportunity to show it can govern competently and inclusively .
Zuma must refrain from withholding resources to this region .
Cope , given that it lacked the resources and was only launched last December , did well to capture more than a million votes .
These parties now have enough support to hold the ANC more accountable .
South Africa desperately needs a serious party on the left of the political spectrum , with roots in the "" struggle "" .
The Congress of South African Trade Unions ( Cosatu ) and the South African Communist party had planned to form such a party , but were persuaded to back Zuma .
The ANC under Zuma is too broad a ­coalition to turn into a leftwing party , as some of the trade unionists and ­socialists backing him hope .
Yet dashed expectations and failing to deliver on promises may still trigger a leftwing break within the ANC , and herald a major reconfiguration of party politics"
2009-04-27,"After Jacob Zuma is inaugurated as South Africa 's president on 9 May , he will have to move swiftly and decisively to satisfy the needs and hopes of the have - nots – the millions of black people who thus far have gained few or no material benefits from the end of apartheid 15 years ago .
Zuma acknowledges what faces him : over the weekend , when the victory of his African National Congress was officially confirmed , he proclaimed "" a new era of hope "" and reiterated campaign promises for better public services and an expanded social safety net , improved healthcare and schools , and a stepped - up fight against crime .
That Zuma has achieved these heights testifies to his adroitness and cleverness .
He succeeded in projecting himself as a man of the people and in persuading voters to overlook the flaws in his character .
The election victory is also testimony to the enduring strength of the African National Congress .
Its share of the vote has dropped only by 4 % , from just under 70 % five years ago to just below 66 % .
During its 97 years as a liberation movement , it was supplanted by other movements during the 1920s and 1930s and was challenged by breakaway groups during the 1950s and again this year .
But "" Congress "" has always overcome and survived and was the engine that brought democracy .
Last week proved it retains mass loyalty .
Whether it can continue to do so will depend on what Zuma and his new cabinet can do .
Fifteen years is a short time in which to repair a people and society deeply damaged by 300 years of discrimination and deprivation .
But the ANC 's achievements include ensuring that 80 % of people have electricity ( compared with 58 % in 1994 ) , and 74.4 % have access to clean water ( up from 68 % ) .
The national government has built more than 2.6 m houses in 15 years , so as to get millions of people out of rudimentary shacks .
However , a wealthy black middle class has emerged , while 40 % of black people live below the poverty line .
With unemployment at upwards of 40 % , people can not always pay their rent , or electricity and water bills .
Affirmative action in employment has been unavoidable and essential in getting over past discrimination and inequities .
But it has spawned inefficiencies with serious consequences , such as in the sudden and damaging shortage of electricity supply early last year .
Corruption is spoken of as pervasive .
The ANC recognises education as the key to the future and allocates 20 % of the budget to it .
Yet a staggering 70 % of schools are said to be dysfunctional ; 17 % lack electricity and 61 % have only rudimentary sanitation .
Teachers are badly paid and there are not enough of them .
Some primary school classes have more than 100 pupils .
This crisis has a wider societal context .
A shortage of jobs and poor schooling have exacerbated the crime rate , even if its origins could still be blamed on the dislocations caused by apartheid .
Murder and robbery were said last year to have decreased .
But every day South Africans continue to live in fear , with those who can afford it turning their houses into fortresses with razor wire , alarms and guards .
In 2006 , 23,453 children were raped and 1,075 murdered .
A research report says that nearly 20 % of men have raped a woman at least once in their lives .
It often seems that ANC leaders , ensconced in their luxury houses and cars and surrounded by armed guards , have been switched off from the reality of terrifying levels of crime .
South Africa continues to hold the world 's No 1 spot for HIV - positive people : more than 5.5 million , 20 % of adults .
The infection rate has stabilised – with 1,000 a day infections and 1,000 a day deaths – but tuberculosis , associated with Aids , is spiralling .
Shortage of funding is blamed on lack of money and on reckless and corrupt spending of what is available .
Land reform – restoring land to black people that was stolen by white people – is crucial for righting the wrongs of the past .
The aim is to have 30 % of agricultural land in black hands by 2014 , but this is described as a "" pipe dream "" because only a tiny proportion has been transferred thus far .
In addition , land already transferred is often poorly farmed and new farmers lack guidance , seeds and machinery .
One result is that South Africa 's food production is declining , forcing it to turn to imports .
And the hovering fear is that if land transfers are not swiftly and efficiently executed , there could be a repeat of the violent land grabs by blacks in neighbouring Zimbabwe , with the disasters that have followed there .
Zimbabwe , moreover , is one of the immediate problems for Zuma .
Apart from the devastating effects for Zimbabweans – with an estimated three million of them coming across the border for sanctuary – South Africa 's failure to curb Robert Mugabe has helped to diminish its status as a moral beacon for the world .
During his campaign , Zuma promised everything to everyone and his problem now will be to satisfy everyone .
The business community , both in South Africa and abroad , depends on his pledges to maintain the capitalist economy , which has brought South Africa strong growth and financial stability .
The trade unions , the youth and the South African Communist party – all pillars of his popular support – expect him to deliver on his commitments to reform the economy .
Zuma and his cabinet - to - be will take office with the odds stacked against them to deliver on expectations of more jobs , houses and safer streets .
Up to 300,000 job losses are predicted this year , and the ANC government will be poorly placed to splurge on major new spending , with the International Monetary Fund predicting the economy will contract by 0.3 % in 2009 .
South Africa 's have - nots have shown remarkable patience thus far in waiting for what is their due .
They will not wait forever ."
2009-05-06,"Parliament elects ANC leader Zuma as president South Africa 's parliament elected the ANC leader , Jacob Zuma , as the country 's fourth post - apartheid president yesterday .
Zuma , 67 , was challenged in the vote by Mvume Dandala of the Congress of the People party - a breakaway party of African National Congress dissidents .
Zuma received 277 votes to 47 for Dandala .

The country 's new cabinet will be announced in Pretoria on Sunday , a day after Zuma 's inauguration , which is expected to be attended by dignitaries from around the world .
Reuters , Cape Town Rights activists get bail after Tsvangirai steps in Zimbabwe 's prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , intervened yesterday to get bail reinstated for 15 human rights and political activists who on Tuesday were sent back to a jail where they claim they were tortured .
The group , including members of Tsvangirai 's MDC party and prominent peace activist Jestina Mukoko , had been freed , pending trial on what observers claim are trumped - up charges of terrorism and a plot to overthrow Robert Mugabe .
Harare magistrate Catherine Chimanda , who revoked the bail , yesterday reversed that decision , freeing all but three of the group of 18 activists .

2009-05-07,"It will be an inauguration unlike any other .
When Jacob Zuma formally becomes president of South Africa on Saturday , he will sing and dance in front of visiting heads of state ‑ and possibly have three first ladies at his side .
Zuma , a controversial figure whose African National Congress retained power in last month 's elections , will hope the R75 m ( £ 6 m ) showpiece event at the Union Buildings in Pretoria can help unite the country behind him .
A Zulu and practising polygamist , he has invited his wives Sizakele Khumalo , Nompumelelo Ntuli and Thobeka Mabhija to join him , according to South Africa 's The Star newspaper yesterday .
A spokesman for the ANC described the reports as "" speculation "" .
Guests will include Zimbabwe 's president Robert Mugabe , whose inclusion has sparked protests , former Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda , Indian National Congress president Sonia Gandhi and America 's Rev Jesse Jackson .
Britain will be represented by the Foreign Office minister for Africa , Lord Malloch - Brown , while the Obama administration will send trade representative Ron Kirk .
There will be a 21-gun salute after Zuma takes his oath of office .
The new president will break from protocol following his inaugural address by moving down and singing to the crowds , possibly with a rendition of his signature tune , Umshini Wami , meaning "" bring me my machine gun "" .
"" It comes very naturally for him , "" said Brian Sokutu , a spokesman for the ANC .
"" The masses want to see him sing .
He will make the formal inauguration speech , then there will be a moment when he comes down to the lawn to speak to the masses .
"" It will be an informal speech for the people , different from the official one .
He will greet them , he will sing , he will thank them for their contribution to constitutional democracy . ""
Sokutu denied that the show will cause embarrassment on the world stage .
"" This is South Africa , it 's different here .
When Nelson Mandela became president in 1994 , he had his traditional long shirt , which became known as the Madiba shirt , and now everyone knows the Madiba dance . ""
Jeremy Gordin , Zuma 's biographer , welcomed the piece of showmanship .
"" I 'm a bit surprised because I thought he was going to avoid it , "" he said .
"" Going down to meet the people will be a good compromise .
It wo n't be embarrassing , it will be a nice thing .
"" It 's not typical of South African politicians .
Even Mandela would n't do that .
But it 's typical of Zuma .
"" The presence of Mugabe has drawn protests from AfriForum , a civil rights initiative , which put posters that read "" Mugabe go home "" around the Union Buildings .
AfriForum 's chief executive , Kallie Kriel , said it was protesting against human rights violations in Zimbabwe , which should have seen Mugabe struck off the guest list .
The inauguration will be attended by 5,000 dignitaries .
Twenty - nine countries will be represented by heads of state , seven by their deputy presidents and 56 by their foreign ministers .
Another 30,000 people ‑
some bussed in from townships ‑ are expected to witness the event from the south lawns .
The opposition Democratic Alliance has condemned the cost of the event , arguing that R75 m could buy about 2,000 low - cost houses , 25,000 bullet - proof vests for the police or build a 75-bed hospital .
There has been speculation about which of Zuma 's wives will eventually assume the mantle of first lady .
His first wife is Khumalo , whom he has known for 50 years and married in 1973 .
He we d Ntuli , his youngest wife , last year , and was married again in January to Thobeka Mabhija , a Durban socialite with whom he is said to have two children ."
2009-05-09,"Jacob Zuma was sworn in as president of South Africa today , becoming leader of the continent 's economic powerhouse after overcoming corruption , sex scandals and a power struggle within his own party .
Zuma , the fourth president since apartheid ended 15 years ago , took the oath of office in front of a crowd of more than 30,000 at the Union Buildings in Pretoria .
After he signed the oath , a Zulu praise singer in traditional animal skins and pink feathers took to the stage to extoll the new president 's virtues .
Tens of thousands had broken into spontaneous song when Zuma arrived , beaming , accompanied by his senior wife , Sizakele Khumalo .
Zuma 's unabashed polygamy has raised questions about which of his three current wives may act as first lady .
On Saturday , all three were reported present but only Khumalo accompanied him to the stage , where Zuma dropped down onto his knees before Nelson Mandela in a traditional sign of respect .
Zuma ejoys a popularity often compared toMandela 's .
Many impoverished black South Africans believe Zuma 's triumph over his personal battles give him special insight into their own struggles and aspirations .
He survived corruption and sex scandals and an internal power struggle so vicious it led to a split in his African National Congress party .
The ANC won last month 's parliamentary elections and Zuma was elected president by parliament on Wednesday .
He is due to unveil his new parliament tomorrow .
Sydney Mokoena , a 48-year - old Pretoria high school teacher , roused his 10-year - old daughter , Thula , at 4.30am to get to the lawns early .
He said he admired Zuma for the calm he showed during his legal battles over corruption allegations that have now been dropped and a 2006 rape trial that ended with acquittal .
Mokoena said that while Zuma may not have had much formal education , his leadership of the ANC 's intelligence wing during the anti - apartheid struggle was proof he was smart enough to be president .
Zuma will be "" a dynamic and vibrant president , "" Mokoena said .
"" That 's what South Africa needs .
He 's down to earth and he 'll listen . ""
Mokoena laughed when Thula said she hoped for a glimpse of Mandela .
Frail at 90 years old , Mandela makes few appearances , but he arrived for Saturday 's inauguration in a golf cart to applause , wolf whistles and the announcer 's cheer of "" Viva Mandela , viva . ""
"" We can have three or four or five presidents , people will still be talking about Mandela , "" Mokoena said .
Mandela and Zuma share rural roots and an easy warmth in crowds , though Zuma 's origins are much humbler .
Mandela , 90 , has ties to Xhosa tribal royalty and was groomed for leadership from an early age , attending some of the best schools and universities then open to blacks and earning a law degree .
Zuma , 67 , herded cows instead of attending school as a boy to help his impoverished family before rosing through the trade union movement and the African National Congress guerrilla force ."
2009-05-09,"Jacob Zuma yesterday vowed to work to fulfil the dreams of all South Africans after he overcame corruption and sex scandals to become president .
Tens of thousands of spectators screamed approval , dignitaries applauded and a Zulu praise singer in traditional animal skins extolled the virtues of Zuma , whose popularity rivals that of Nelson Mandela . ""
The dreams and hopes of all the people of our country must be fulfilled , "" he promised at his swearing - in in Pretoria .
"" There is no place for complacency , no place for cynicism , no place for excuses . ""
South Africa 's fourth president since the end of apartheid is no stranger to struggle .
The former guerrilla fighter and intelligence chief of the African National Congress was acquitted in a rape case and has survived a power struggle in the ANC , which easily won last month 's parliamentary elections .
He urged South Africans to ensure "" that the struggles and sacrifices of our people shall not be in vain .
They shall inspire us to complete the task for which so much blood was shed . """
2009-05-10,"Jacob Zuma , the new South African president , today sacked the health minister praised by campaigners for turning around the country 's disastrous policy on Aids .
Announcing his first cabinet , Zuma moved Barbara Hogan from the health ministry to the less influential public enterprises portfolio .
Hogan is replaced by Aaron Motsoaledi , a provincial education minister who is a medical doctor .
Some analysts had predicted Hogan would be ousted after she publicly criticised the leadership of the African National Congress ( ANC ) earlier this year for barring the Dalai Lama from a conference on peace and reconciliation .
The Aids epidemic , which kills 1,000 South Africans every day , remains a high sensitive topic for Zuma .
During a 2006 trial in which he was acquitted of rape , he said he took a shower after sex with an HIV - positive woman , believing this would reduce his risk of infection .
Hogan had replaced the unpopular Manto Tshabalala - Msimang after Thabo Mbeki lost an ANC power struggle against Zuma late last year and was forced to step down as president early .
Mbeki and Tshabalala - Msimang were fiercely criticised for playing down the extent of the Aids crisis , questioning the link between HIV and Aids and whether Aids drugs worked .
Whereas Tshabalala - Msimang promoted lemons , garlic and beets as treatments , Hogan had been praised by Aids activists .
Rebecca Hodes , the head of policy communication and research at the Treatment Action Campaign in South Africa , said : "" We were impressed by Barbara Hogan because she put an end to state - sponsored Aids denialism . ""
One of the first things she said was that HIV causes Aids . ""
The campaign group declined to condemn the change of personnel .
but Hodes said : "" We are pleased that Barbara Hogan is still in the cabinet . ""
When she spoke out about the Dalai Lama and had to apologise , we thought that was outrageous .
The new minister is a medical doctor and he 's got a lot of work to do .
Much will depend on who he has working with him . ""
Jacob Zuma has to try to prove he is serious about tackling HIV .
He is going to have to make up for past errors and grossly mistaken statements .
When he made that remark about taking a shower , it was held up as proof of his idiocy around the world . ""
In other changes , Zuma moved the respected finance minister , Trevor Manuel , to a new and powerful central planning post .
He replaced him with Pravin Gordhan who had a successful tenure in the tax department .
Blade Nzimande , a firebrand Zuma ally and the head of the South African Communist party , was named the minister of higher education and training .
The presence of communists and trade unionists in senior positions has raised the prospect of a shift to the left , worrying some investors .
Winnie Madikizela - Mandela , the popular former wife of Nelson Mandela , did not get a cabinet position ."
2009-05-12,"At his inauguration over the weekend , South Africa 's charismatic and controversial new president Jacob Zuma claimed for himself the Mandela mantle , thanking the country 's founding father for having "" healed our wounds "" and promising not to "" deviate "" from Mandela 's "" nation - building task "" of "" reconciliation "" .
The first days of the Zuma presidency have been an interesting test to this promise .
First , he embraced his predecessor and old friend turned bitter rival , Thabo Mbeki ; the man who fired him , and whom he then defeated and allowed to be fired in turn .
Then , in a more challenging manoeuvre , he set the terms for his own presidency by trying to reconcile the Mandela doctrine with the Mbeki one .
Mbeki , during his decade - long presidency , had made a point of deviating from the Mandela ethos by claiming that there could be "" no reconciliation without [ social ] transformation "" ; he had also insisted that South African society would only heal if the divisions of the past were addressed rather than papered over .
This rendered the Mbeki presidency confrontational , divisive and often brittle – albeit without the promised upside : ironically , Zuma came to power on a wave of dissatisfaction with the speed of socio - economic transformation under Mbeki .
The ANC 's 65 % mandate – 11.6 million voters – was garnered from a populist electoral campaign that promised jobs and rural development , along with vastly improved health , education and crime prevention services .
Zuma now has to reconcile this commitment to his electorate – and to the ANC 's labour movement and communist allies who were the powerhouse of his campaign – with the expectations of sceptical markets and investors .
Such scepticism is only underscored by Zuma 's troublesome history ( charges of fraud and racketeering were dropped just before his election ) , and by the perhaps unfair perception that he is uneducated traditionalist ill - equipped to run a modern state .
The first practical application of this attempt at reconciliation took place the day after Zuma was inaugurated , when he announced his new cabinet .
While the former finance minister Trevor Manuel was removed from the treasury – a key demand of Zuma 's left backers , who revile Manuel – he was given the key new post of head of the State Planning Commission .
Meanwhile , Manuel was replaced with his most able lieutenant , the former tax collector Pravin Gordhan , and a new ministry of economic planning was established , and given to the confrontational leftwing unionist Ebrahim Patel .
A key complaint of the left was that the treasury under Manuel had too much power ; that Manuel 's obsession with balancing the budget trumped socio - economic needs .
But Manuel has now been moved to a position where he would be responsible for the government 's "" entire programme of action "" , including the economy , Zuma has said .
Meanwhile , his arch - opponent Patel would be responsible for nothing less than the generation of economic policy .
Between this rock of the right and this hard place of the left it is difficult to imagine what role the actual minister of finance , Gordhan , might play , and how able Zuma – by no means well - versed in economic matters – will be to mediate .
What in Mandela was seen as an almost saintly ability to conciliate could , in a lesser man , be read as weak - kneed populism .
Is Zuma brilliantly bringing all sides into his big tent so as to forge a common purpose that has been lacking in South Africa in the past decade , and thereby resolve the ideological tensions that have perpetually threatened to tear the ANC in two ?
Or is he , once more , trying too hard to be all things to all people , creating an impossible mess of contention and confusion where clarity , more than ever , is required ?
In a cash - strapped government that is already carrying far too much dead wood , Zuma has increased the cabinet from 28 to 34 , and created several new deputy ministries as well .
Once more the question needs to be asked : is this in the name of increased efficiency and service - delivery , or is it a form of cronyism calculated to reward the many backers who have supported the Zuma candidacy ?
Zuma , for example , was expected to do badly in the populous northern province of Limpopo , and yet he performed spectacularly there .
Three virtually unknown regional politicians from the province were given key ministries : in international relations , in health and in monitoring and evaluation .
Time will tell whether Zuma the populist will become the kind of hard - driving statesman needed to hold South Africa together as the global recession begins to bite .
Certainly , the new president wishes to make his mark : for the first time in 15 years , Mbeki is not making the decisions , and there are significant new faces in the South African government .
Still , the worry of loyalism and cronyism remains – particularly given the way , over the past eight years , both the organs of state and the rule of law have been abused and compromised by the factional battles between Mbeki 's supporters and Zuma 's .
There is one key area in which Zuma has made no attempt at reconciliation whatsoever : criminal justice and security .
The ministers of justice , defence , intelligence ( now called "" state security "" in a throwback to both apartheid and the ANC 's old Stalinist past ) , police and communications are all die - hard Zuma loyalists .
Whatever their line functions , they will also play the role they have played so ably to date : keeping Zuma out of court – and making sure the state serves Zuma as it once did Mbeki ."
2009-05-13,"A vicious war of words has broken out in South Africa in a row that has brought the country 's volatile politics of gender and race to the surface .
Jacob Zuma , who was sworn in as president last weekend , stands accused by Helen Zille , the leader of the opposition , of putting his three wives at risk of contracting HIV .
Her description of Zuma as a sexist was countered by a charge of racism from the ANC Youth League , expressed in even more florid language that derided her for talking "" hogwash "" .
Zille , who heads the Democratic Alliance , questioned Zuma 's moral fitness to lead the country by referring to an incident in which he had sex with an HIV - positive woman .
He was accused of rape but cleared .
Zille was quoted by the Sowetan newspaper as saying : "" Zuma is a self - confessed womaniser with deeply sexist views , who put all his wives at risk by having unprotected sex with an HIV - positive woman . ""
The African National Congress 's Youth League today returned fire , criticising Zille , who is white , for picking an all - male executive team in the Western Cape , the only province to vote against the ANC in the election .
The Youth League said that it was "" disgusted by remarks attributed to the racist girl Helen Zille , who when failing to defend her stupid and sexist decision to appoint predominantly white males into her cabinet , attacks the president of the republic of South Africa "" .
It threatened "" militant action "" against the Western Cape premier , adding : "" The fake racist girl who was dropped on a head as child should understand that South Africa will never be a Mickey Mouse republic like she wants to portray it . ""
The ANC joined the criticism , albeit in more measured terms , saying it was "" astounded "" by Zille 's remarks .
Jessie Duarte , a spokeswoman for the governing party , said : "" Even by Zille 's standards of personal invective , this latest attack is an unprecedented example of Zuma - hate .
Zille 's outburst is deeply offensive and should be roundly condemned .
"" Zille 's comments reportedly came in response to criticism from a Congress of South African Trade Unions , which has said it will challenge the Western Cape premier 's all - male cabinet in the national equality court .
The row points to the potent and often paradoxical intersection of gender and racial conflicts in South Africa .
Female representation in parliament rose to 45 % at the last election , putting the country behind only Rwanda and Sweden in parliamentary gender balance .
Five of South Africa 's nine provincial governors are women .
Yet sexism remains a burning issue in a country where traditional attitudes run deep and rates of crimes such as rape are staggering .
The gap between post - apartheid ambitions and the reality of racial divisions is similarly apparent .
It also emerged today that Julius Malema , the firebrand president of the ANC Youth League , has been reported to the country 's equality court in Johannesburg .
During the election campaign , Malema reportedly told students at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology that the woman who accused Zuma of rape would not have stayed for breakfast if she had not enjoyed the sex . ""
Those who had a nice time will wait until the sun comes out , request breakfast and ask for taxi money , "" he was quoted as saying in January . ""
In the morning , that lady requested breakfast and taxi money . ""
He added : "" You ca n't ask for money from somebody who raped you . ""
A gender advocacy group has now laid a hate speech complaint against Malema .
Mbuyiselo Botha , the head of Sonke Gender Justice , is demanding an apology from him and an undertaking to refrain from making statements that "" undermine women 's dignity "" .
Botha said : "" The majority of the population are women … but we ca n't say that there is true freedom in this country if women are still considered fair game . ""
Malema said he was unaware of the charges .
"" I do n't know about this , "" he told the Cape Times . ""
Let those people who want publicity go to court , because they wo n't find me there .
I do n't have time for this . ""
His alleged gaffe came after Zuma himself was criticised at the time of his trial for saying that he took a shower after intercourse with the woman to reduce his chances of contracting HIV .
The polygamist also caused outrage by saying the woman was sending him a sexual invitation by wearing flimsy clothing .
Meanwhile one of South Africa 's leading satirists , Jonathan Shapiro , known as Zapiro , had decided to detach the notorious shower head he draws in cartoons above Zuma 's head .
He said he wanted to "" give the presidency a chance "" ."

2009-07-22,"Jacob Zuma faced the first critical test of his presidency today as violent protests at a lack of basic services spread in South Africa 's townships .
Residents hurled bottles and stones at police , who responded by firing rubber bullets and teargas .
Smoke from burning tyres filled the air as thousands marched in a show of anger at poor services in townships in Johannesburg , Western Cape and the north - eastern region of Mpumalanga .
Immigrants said they feared for their lives and sought police protection as there were reports of foreign - owned businesses being looted in Mpumalanga .
Last year 62 people died in xenophobic attacks .
The unrest comes as frustrations boil over at the government 's record , 15 years after apartheid , at providing townships with basic services such as electricity , running water , housing and sanitation .
Koos Bezuidenhout , chief executive of the workers ' interest group the United Association of SA , warned that "" dissatisfaction with poor service delivery or the complete lack thereof at municipal level is now spreading like a veld fire through South Africa "" .
More than 100 people have been arrested during the last week .
Protesters pelted cars with stones and blocked a highway near Johannesburg yesterday .
At Siyathemba township , 55 miles south - east of the city , protesters demanding jobs and better schools clashed with police and threatened the local mayor .
Residents in Meyerton , south of Johannesburg , occupied farmland in invasions similar to those in neighbouring Zimbabwe .
They were protesting at being evicted from their temporary settlement .
Demonstrations also turned violent for a second day in Thokoza township , where residents want better housing and services .
Thirty - five residents are due in court .
Eljah Ngobese from Thokoza told the Citizen newspaper : "" We are tired of empty promises .
All this government want from us is a vote , nothing else .
They are treating us as monkeys .
How can they shoot us while we are protesting for our rights ? ""
Bongani Mazibuko , who has been unemployed for years , added : "" This government is rotten to the core .
"" Cars and houses were burnt in the Diepsloot township last week , in protest at plans to tear down makeshift shacks to make way for a sewage pipe .
Zuma put service delivery at the heart of his election campaign this year , pledging to root out corruption and incompetence .
But along with South Africa 's worst recession in 17 years , his first months have been hit by strikes involving doctors , miners , teachers and construction workers building facilities for the 2010 World Cup .
The township protests reflect growing impatience among the poor , said William Gumede , author of Thabo Mbeki and the Battle for the Soul of the ANC .
"" Zuma has less of a honeymoon than his predecessors , Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbkei , "" he said .
"" People are at the end of their patience and are giving the African National Congress one more chance to deliver . ""
During the election campaign people 's expectations of what Zuma could deliver were really worked up .
People were given the sense that if they voted for the ANC one more time , there would be delivery immediately . ""
He added : "" This is now going to snowball and get bigger and bigger . ""
Fifteen years after the ANC won its first election , more than 1 million South Africans still live in shacks , many without access to electricity or running water .
The gap between rich and poor is also growing .
Nearly 3 m houses have been built , but the allocation has been prone to nepotism and corruption .
Nic Borain , an independent analyst , said : "" This was always going to be a problem for Jacob Zuma , a pro - poor government coming to power at the height of the global recession .
I do n't think it is a crisis for the Jacob Zuma government , but I think it is a challenge . """
2009-07-25,"After two weeks of vandalism and running battles between township residents and police , President Jacob Zuma asked South Africans yesterday to desist from violence and give him more time to improve their living conditions .
Speaking at a township stadium rally on his home turf in the province of KwaZulu - Natal , Zuma acknowledged that the government had fallen short in the past 15 years .
He told the audience : "" The troubles we are seeing in our townships prove to us that there is much work to do and much to repair .
But there must not be violence between us .
Let us work together ! ""
The response to his speech was muted , and the African National Congress organisers seemed disappointed at the turn - out of about 3,000 people .
They admitted that the 67-year - old president , after an early - morning visit to workers at a World Cup building site in Durban , had delayed his arrival to allow more time for the stadium to fill up .
Nozipho Mbambo , 24 , was attending the siyabonga ( "" thank you "" ) rally in the hopes of seeing Zuma - affectionately known as Msholozi , meaning dance .
It is nearly 100 days since Zuma swept to power on a platform of hip - wriggling and promises that he , at last , would be a people 's president .
"" I do n't have much to thank Msholozi for , "" she said , adding that things would be different if someone had plumbed in the breeze - block toilet that was built for her street five years ago .
In the past week , scenes reminiscent of the apartheid era have returned to the townships - clouds of acrid black smoke rising from burning tyres , police turning on residents with rubber bullets , sirens wailing and - most symbolic - official buildings and vehicles being set on fire .
Commentators say South Africa is sitting on a social time bomb .
Government damage - limitation efforts so far seem focused on preventing an explosion before next year 's World Cup rather than on improving delivery of services .
Sitting on the grass , Mbambo , who in common with nearly two thirds of the population voted ANC on 22 April , said the government was out of touch .
"" We vote ANC because you must .
They are like the royal family .
Zuma is a Zulu , so there was no question for me .
But that does not mean I am happy , "" explained the single mother who lives with her parents . ""
First , I would like a job . ""
Semi - rural Hammarsdale has few shacks and widespread electricity coverage .
But Mbambo says residents have to burn their own litter because it is never collected .
Transport is scarce and crime is bad .
"" You have to walk everywhere .
It is dangerous , so you ca n't go out at night .
There are rats that bite the children .
Last month armed robbers held up worshippers during a church service .
""
She said she understood restive compatriots in squatter camps .
Her uncle lives in Diepsloot , near Johannesburg . ""
He moved there from Alexandra because President Thabo Mbeki was promising him a house .
That was eight years ago .
He is a man in his 60s and he has to do his business in a bucket .
Now the local councillors have told them to move again , to a wasteland near Pretoria , to make way for a new sewerage pipe .
I support all those who are rioting now . ""
Across South Africa 's 283 municipalities , similar incidents have caused a crescendo of rage in the past month .
Protesters have brandished placards saying life was better under white rule .
Ethiopians and Pakistanis in Balfour , within the province of Mpumalanga , have taken refuge outside a police station , fearing a repeat of last year 's xenophobic attacks which left 100,000 people homeless and saw 63 killings .
Fifteen years after the first all - race elections , the situation is dire , whichever set of statistics you look at .
Hammarsdale has a 33 % HIV infection rate and antiretroviral drugs recently ran out .
Nationally , figures issued last week by the Institute of Race Relations showed 70 % of children live in poverty .
The number of black orphans has increased by more than a quarter in five years , pushing the number of households where a child is in charge to nearly 148,000 .
This week 150,000 municipal workers will go on strike and petrol pumps may run dry if chemical industry workers also go ahead with planned industrial action .
The disputes do not have astronomical demands .
The recent construction industry strike - which halted World Cup projects for a week - centred on a modest pay increase for 50,000 workers , from 14 rands ( £ 1 ) per hour to 15.68 rands .
It was finally awarded by an industry in full boom .
The chairmen of the five construction companies building stadiums have claimed share options this year worth millions of rands and their chief executives ' salaries average 7 m rands ( £ 530,000 ) .
The South African wealth gap is deepening .
Even as squatter camp residents were rioting , the new communications and education ministers were out buying cars .
Insensitively , their spokesmen said they were "" obeying the rules "" by purchasing three BMWs and a Range Rover for a total of 4.1 m rands ( £ 310,000 ) .
The government 's clumsy handling of the present crisis adds to the bitterness .
After , in effect , ignoring last year 's xenophobic violence , this time the ANC has deployed the hitherto unknown minister of cooperative governance and traditional affairs , Sicelo Shiceka , to deal with the issue .
But he is firing in all the wrong directions , suggesting it is normal for people to take to the streets because "" we are legitimate government and their protests mean they understand this "" .
He told a radio station that people with complaints should ring Zuma 's new "" presidential hotline "" , but inquiries by the Observer revealed the people will have to wait until September , when it comes into service .
Shiceka has said demonstrators who have gone on looting sprees are "" opportunists using their bad living conditions to take advantage of a situation "" .
Defending the country 's image , he said : "" The international community must not have any fears .
Before the World Cup in France in 1998 there was a big strike and everything came to standstill .
But no one saw that as a problem for the World Cup .
"" The government acknowledges that the 2.6 million homes it has built since 1994 are still 2.1 million short of its target .
Shiceka admits that local authorities are chaotically run , but blames the councillors ' lack of experience .
Ordinary South Africans - and the estimated one million shack - dwellers in the country - are very clear : service delivery failures are the result of ANC nepotism , comrades being assigned to positions for which they are not qualified .
In some regions , the escalator to the middle class runs solely through local government jobs and tenders .
Analyst Aubrey Matshiqi says this explains why service delivery protests take place outside election time : "" There was a lull during the election campaign period because some of the protest leaders hoped to be on ANC election lists or had already succeeded in their quest to be on them . """
2009-07-27,"If Winston Churchill was to be believed , he did not in fact say of Clement Attlee : "" An empty taxi drew up outside No 10 Downing Street , and when the door opened , Attlee got out . ""
But the whiff of the man who was n't there has clung to certain political leaders throughout time .
We just did n't expect it to emanate from the South African president , Jacob Zuma .
During this year 's election campaign , Zuma 's shiny pate was everywhere on placards tied to lampposts in city streets and the remotest rural village .
You could n't switch on a television without seeing the swivelling hips and hearing his oft - repeated ditty , "" Umshini wami ""
( Bring me my machinegun ) .
Whereas the former president Thabo Mbeki was an aloof , out - of - touch philosopher king , we were told , Zuma was a massive presence in every sense , a Zulu warrior king so in touch with the people he had already married four of them .
But the political honeymoon has rapidly slipped into a winter of discontent .
Doctors , miners , train drivers and workers in the chemical , construction , energy , paper , printing , retail and state broadcasting sectors have downed tools .
More than half a million working days were lost due to strikes in the first half of this year , more than twice that in the same period in 2008 .
Residents have been warned to expect power cuts at home , no buses or trains to get to work and streets piled high with rubbish .
The flexing of trade union muscles is coinciding with unrest in South Africa 's impoverished townships that has turned violent .
The air has filled with clouds of teargas , the whizz of rubber bullets and the acrid smoke of burning tyres , while buildings and vehicles have been set ablaze .
Their patience exhausted after 15 years of promises following the end of apartheid , some who still lack electricity , water or a functioning toilet are even calling for the return of white minority rule .
Where , then , is the president at this moment of national crisis ?
It is perhaps unfortunate that on the front page of the latest issue of the City Press newspaper , he is pictured grinning broadly and dancing while a banner headline reads : "" The week South Africa burned . ""
On Wednesday , as youths fought running battles with police in Siyathemba township ( near Johannesburg ) , jobless people marched and looted shops in Durban , and residents of Pilisi Farm informal settlement barricaded a highway with burning tyres and stoned passing cars , Zuma was at the Union Buildings with Sir Richard Branson .
It was not , in fairness , a publicity stunt for the tireless entrepreneur 's Virgin Atlantic , but rather the joint announcement of a disease control centre for South Africa .
At the press conference , however , Zuma refused to answer questions about the service delivery protests .
It was an own goal that allowed the opposition Democratic Alliance to accuse him of being "" detached "" and showing an "" uncaring attitude and unwillingness to tackle the issue head on "" .
A day later , as TV crews descended on the townships , Zuma missed the politician 's trick of a walkabout to show he was feeling the pain .
Instead he was in Sandton , the richest square mile in Africa , addressing a conference of well - heeled black businessmen .
At last , he spoke about the demonstrations , but in the view of many , it was too little too late .
The Citizen newspaper noted : "" Reading a prepared speech to a well - fed audience at a gathering of the Confederation of Black Business Organisations in Sandton 's plush convention centre is not the ideal way to calm the storm .
Impoverished , disaffected people enduring this bitter winter cold without adequate shelter , food or clothing will not have been impressed . ""
The Citizen added : "" If Zuma must read a prepared speech he should do so on national TV , to all South Africans .
Better still , he should throw away the speeches and go to the hotspots .
Visit the aggrieved and tell them how government will help . ""
Like George Bush , Zuma was a regular guy who appealed to the heartland but , like Bush during Hurricane Katrina , the populist touch appears to have deserted him .
On Saturday he began , at a poorly attended rally , a two - month tour of South Africa to thank voters for putting the African National Congress in power once again .
His opponents argue he would be far better advised to use this time visiting townships where shack dwellers huddle around paraffin stoves , water drips from communal taps while sewers overflow , and violent crime and vigilantism are rife .
But there are some seasoned watchers who believe Zuma is merely a figurehead and not really in charge at all .
They say that the true centre of power has shifted to the ANC headquarters and its secretary - general , Gwede Mantashe .
By summoning cabinet ministers to account for their implementation of ANC policy , he has been accused of blurring the line between party and state .
Mantashe is also national chairperson of the South African Communist party .
Is it possible that the power behind the throne of a G20 nation is a commie ?
It must be said that the ANC comrades tend to practise communism - lite .
But when Mantashe gave a lecture recently at Johannesburg 's Wits University , I asked him if he would describe himself as a Marxist .
"" I would not describe myself as a Marxist , "" he replied .
"" I am a Marxist . ""
He added that he has no better conceptual tools with which to understand the world .
It is conceivable then that , if Zuma continues to fiddle while the townships burn , South Africa 's fate may yet depend on the prescription of Das Kapital ."
2009-08-08,"Zimbabwe topped the agenda when US secretary of state Hillary Clinton yesterday ended an upbeat visit to South Africa aimed at mending a relationship that became fractious during the reign of former president Thabo Mbeki .
Clinton described as "" extremely helpful '' a meeting in Durban with Jacob Zuma .
The South African president said : "" The two countries have always had good relations and we are taking that relationship higher . ""
The warm tone of Clinton 's visit – after harsher exchanges with the Kenyan government on the first leg of her seven - nation tour – is seen as a diplomatic preamble to Barack Obama attending next year 's football World Cup in South Africa .
Yesterday afternoon Clinton used a visit to a housing project on the outskirts of Cape Town to praise South African attempts to alleviate poverty , comparing them favourably with the decline in living conditions in Zimbabwe .
"" There are 3 million Zimbabwean refugees living in South Africa .
The difference is that you are free , you are dynamic and you are working together .
It is tragic that your neighbours do not have the same freedoms , "" she said after visiting the Victoria Mxenge housing project for the third time since 1997 .
"" It is the responsibility of a leadership to do what it should to take care of its own people .
I know that president Zuma is working very hard , as did president Mbeki before him , to try to change the attitude of the Zimbabwean leadership . ''
Relations between the US and South Africa turned frosty during Mbeki 's presidency , amid his resistance to pressure Robert Mugabe to accept democratic developments in Zimbabwe .
Mbeki 's denial of the link between HIV and Aids also put a damper on relations .
It lasted throughout the administration of George W Bush , whose Aids - reduction programmes for Africa were highly praised in other countries .
During Mbeki 's presidency , South Africa also maintained a staunchly pro - Palestinian line and denounced the Iraq war .
While holding the presidency of the UN Security Council , South Africa refused to condemn the Myanmar regime 's clampdown against protests led by monks in 2007 .
South Africa recently supported a motion by the African Union refusing to co - operate with the international criminal court over its arrest warrant for Sudanese president Omar al - Bashir .
But it is understood that South Africa has since taken legal advice and recanted .
Clinton said she had listened to Zuma 's views on Zimbabwe , Sudan and Somalia . ""
His advice on these regional issues was extremely helpful , '' she said .
Officials in the South African government – disappointed that Obama 's first state visit to Africa , last month , had taken him to Ghana – feared Clinton was coming to lecture them .
Since Zuma was sworn in on 9 May , his foreign policy advisers have been at pains to tell diplomats that the new president will take a tougher line on Zimbabwe than Mbeki did .
But amid continuing blows to the unity government there – including arrests of MPs from the former opposition and no progress in the appointment of a new attorney general or central bank chief – there has been no evidence of this ."
2009-08-28,"South Africa 's president , Jacob Zuma , has given an upbeat assessment of Zimbabwe 's unity government , saying he believes the worst of the country 's troubles are over .
Zuma held talks in Harare with President Robert Mugabe , who looked well despite speculation over his health , and the prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , in a bid to end feuding between the coalition partners .
But even as Zuma struck an optimistic note , new figures showed a surge in violent attacks and human rights abuses by soldiers loyal to Mugabe .
Zuma , on his first visit to Zimbabwe as South African president , told a state banquet today : "" It is indeed very encouraging to note the significant progress that has been made under the auspices of the inclusive government . ""
He added : "" The remaining issues are not insurmountable and can be overcome .
The most difficult path has already been travelled . ""
Speaking at the same event , Mugabe said : "" I am happy to inform you that the inclusive government is alive and well and that the three principals [ including the deputy prime minister , Arthur Mutambara ] are committed to its success .
Indeed , a political accommodation of this nature is bound to experience teething problems . ""
Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change is hoping that Zuma , who is the current chairman of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , will put pressure on Mugabe to rein in hardline supporters and fulfil his commitment to the country 's global political agreement .
Tsvangirai said after a meeting with Zuma early this morning , that he had briefed the South African leader on the "" outstanding issues "" of the political deal .
But in an interview with the Guardian earlier this month , Tsvangirai admitted he could not expect preferential treatment from Zuma . ""
He does n't take sides , "" the prime minister said .
"" He is committed to ensuring all the issues of the global political agreement are implemented , because he 's chairman of SADC . ""
He can not pick and choose between Zanu - PF and MDC .
What he wants to see is the strengthening of the inclusive government .
He wants to see progress , he wants to see more positive outcomes .
"" The politicians ' performance was criticised by non - governmental organizations .
The Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum said cases of political violence and rights abuses surged to 125 in June compared with 99 incidents recorded in May. "" The month of June saw the levels of organised violence being sustained with little indication that the Government of National Unity was committed to ending human rights violations in the country , "" the forum said .
"" Of note in the month of June is the increase in incidents of violence reportedly perpetrated by members of the army against civilians …
It is alarming that some members of the ZNA [ the army ] appear to be a law unto themselves and continue to harass defenceless civilians . """
2009-10-08,"It seemed the perfect gesture to burnish Jacob Zuma 's credentials as a man of the people .
A "" presidential hotline "" , inviting ordinary South Africans to let off steam , showed him as a listening leader .
Zuma himself was on hand to field calls at 9 am on the first day .
But since it was piloted on 14 September , Zuma 's phone has been ringing off the hook .
Thousands of people have tried to get through to vent years of pent - up frustrations about jobs , housing and public services .
Consequently the system has gone into meltdown .
When the Guardian tried phoning 17737 today , it was greeted with a recorded message : "" Due to extremely high call volumes we are unable to attend to your call .
Please call again , goodbye . ""
Many others say they have had the same experience .
The R4 m ( £ 340,000 ) scheme that was intended to allow people to air their grievances is now itself the subject of complaints .
Opposition politicians have seized their chance to turn Zuma 's coup de theatre against him .
The Democratic Alliance says it tested the hotline 46 times during the past three weeks but has been able to register only four complaints , and has not been given a reference number for any of them .
The party leader , Helen Zille , said that 42 calls failed to get through and its callers spent 572 minutes on hold ‑ a total of nine hours and 32 minutes .
"" When President Zuma launched the hotline , he said he wanted to create an ' ethos of accountability ' , "" Zille said .
"" During his state of the nation address he undertook to treat every complaint as if it were the only one .
As every day passes , that commitment rings increasingly hollow . ""
She added : "" At the end of the first week , it was clear the presidency had designed a system that could not meet the requirements of the undertaking .
By the second week , things had not improved .
And , by the third week the situation is completely inadequate and , at least in practical terms , dysfunctional . ""
On its first day of operation , manned by 43 liaison staff at the presidential headquarters , the free hotline took 27,000 calls .
More than 2,500 were received in the first hour , increasing to 7,000 in the third hour .
Zuma has been forced to respond to the criticism , promising the problems getting through will be dealt with .
"" We are working to address this challenge to ensure that we give every call the attention it deserves , "" he said .
Zuma disclosed that common queries related to housing , water and electricity , as well as corruption , unfair dismissals and general unemployment issues .
There were also numerous calls by young people about school and university fees .
In a bid to escape embarrassment , the president had one last card to play ‑
he claimed the phone logjam simply showed how many people want to voice their concerns and should therefore be seen as a success , not a failure ."
2009-12-01,"South Africa 's president , Jacob Zuma , today pledged to undergo an HIV test in an attempt to draw a line under an era of political inertia blamed for hundreds of thousands of deaths .
In a speech on World Aids Day , Zuma told crowds in Pretoria that all HIV - positive babies under the age of one will receive anti - retroviral drugs as part of a huge expansion of treatment .
The declaration marked a final break with the stance of his predecessor and rival , Thabo Mbeki , whose unwillingness to act has been cited for the world 's highest HIV caseload and the premature deaths of 300,000 people .
There are growing calls for Mbeki to apologise or even face charges of genocide .
Yet Zuma himself was once seen as an unlikely anti - Aids crusader .
In 2006 , while being tried on charges of raping an HIV - positive family friend , he was ridiculed for testifying that he took a shower after sex to lower the risk of Aids .
He was acquitted of rape .
In his address to the nation today , however , Zuma signalled a determination to help the estimated 5.7 million South Africans infected with HIV and the 59,000 babies born infected each year . ""
Let there be no more shame , no more blame , no more discrimination and no more stigma , "" he said .
"" Let the politicisation and endless debates about HIV and AIDS stop . ""
He said the government will distribute life - prolonging anti - retroviral drugs to significantly more people infected with the virus .
From April all HIV - positive children under one year will get anti - retroviral drugs ( ARVs ) .
Pregnant women and patients with both tuberculosis and Aids will receive treatment if their CD4 or T - cell counts are 350 or less .
Currently public hospitals dispense ARVs when HIV deteriorates to Aids and patients '
CD4 counts are below 200 .
It was unclear exactly how many more people would now be covered , or how the government would meet the cost , although the US announced a $ 120 m aid package over two years today .
Zuma compared the scale of the struggle to that against the apartheid regime . ""
Together we fought and defeated a system so corrupt and reviled that it was described as a crime against humanity , "" he said .
"" Together we can overcome this challenge .
"" I am making arrangements for my own test .
I have taken HIV tests before , and I know my status .
I will do another test soon as part of this new campaign .
I urge you to start planning for your own tests . ""
Former president Mbeki , also of the African National Congress , was roundly criticised for questioning the link between HIV and Aids and failing to make ARVs widely available .
His health minister was lampooned for recommending garlic and beetroot as treatments .
A Harvard study concluded that more than 300,000 deaths in South Africa could have been prevented if officials had acted sooner to provide drug treatments to Aids patients and to prevent pregnant women with HIV from passing the virus to their children .
Aids claims around 1,000 lives per day .
Health activists praised the radical shift in policy .
Catherine Tomlinson , a researcher at the Treatment Action Campaign , said : "" It 's a very positive change and signals an end to the era of denialism .
It 's significant that our president is using scientific evidence and research to guide his decisions .
Jacob Zuma has shown great leadership . ""
Mark Heywood , director of the Aids Law Project , said : "" We welcome the president 's call for an end to the politicisation of this issue .
Without saying it in so many words , he drew a line under the Mbeki approach and crossed it out .
It 's a new era .
The challenge now is implementation and for the government to put its money where its mouth is . ""
The Congress of South Africa Trade Unions has called on Mbeki to issue a public apology following weeks of debate in the media over whether he should be charged with genocide .
Heywood added : "" I think Mbeki should apologise but I would n't go as far as genocide .
I spent nine years in fierce conflict with him .
It 's now strange to find myself on the same side as the president .
This government is aware of the toll HIV is taking on our society and that if they do n't deal with it , their legacy will be as weak as Mbeki 's . """
2010-01-03,"Jacob Zuma , the polygamous president of South Africa , is to gain his third first lady in a traditional Zulu wedding on Monday .
Zuma , 67 , will marry Tobeka Madiba in a private family ceremony at his homestead in rural KwaZulu - Natal province , the president 's office confirmed .
Madiba , 36 , will be Zuma 's third current wife and his fifth marriage overall .
He is also reported to be engaged to another woman .
The Zulu tribe , the biggest ethnic group in South Africa , practises polygamy by tradition .
Zuma once told an interviewer : "" There are plenty of politicians who have mistresses and children that they hide so as to pretend they 're monogamous .
I prefer to be open .
I love my wives and I 'm proud of my children . ""
The wedding is scheduled for 6 am local time and goats and sheep have been slaughtered for the feast , South Africa 's Sunday Times newspaper reported .
Zuma is expected to vow to love and protect Madiba , with whom he has three children , in a Zulu ceremony known as udwendwe .
She will become South Africa 's third first lady , joining Sizakele Khumalo - Zuma , whom Zuma has known for 50 years and married in 1973 , and Nompumelelo Ntuli - Zuma , whom he married two years ago .
There were two further wives who are no longer with him .
He divorced Nkosazana Dlamini - Zuma , now home affairs minister , in 1998 .
Kate Mantsho Zuma killed herself in 2000 , after describing her marriage to him as "" 24 years of hell "" .
Zuma is said to have more than 10 children , and possibly as many as 19 .
Zuma has paid lobolo to the family of Madiba , described as a socialite from Durban , as custom demands .
She has attended official events with the president but it appears the wedding has been postponed until now because of Zuma 's work commitments .
He was elected president in April .
No known date has been set for what could be Zuma 's sixth wedding .
Gloria Bongi Ngema is understood to have presented umbondo ( gifts ) to the Zuma family last week , customarily a precursor to marriage .
Originally from Durban , Ngema works for IBM in Johannesburg and has a son with Zuma named Sinqumo .
South African law recognises multiple marriages , although fewer young South Africans are entering into them because they are seen as expensive and old - fashioned .
The cultural practices of Zulus and other groups are protected by the constitution .
Zuma played up his Zulu heritage during the election campaign and spent Christmas at his homestead in Nkandla , in KwaZulu - Natal .
He relaxed by shooting birds with a slingshot , drinking umqombothi ( traditional beer ) and taking part in a chess tournament .
It emerged this month that a reported R65 m ( £ 5.3 m ) expansion of the Nkandla residence is under way with new houses being built to accommodate Zuma 's three wives .
Jeremy Gordin , Zuma 's biographer , said he was surprised how little attention Zuma 's latest wedding had received .

2010-01-04,"Jacob Zuma , the president of South Africa , married his third wife today in a traditional Zulu ceremony – but not without a hitch .
Zuma , 67 , reportedly slipped and fell during a traditional solo dance at the wedding at his homestead in Nkandla , KwaZulu - Natal province .
Zuma and Tobeka Madiba , the republic 's third first lady , were presented to society as husband and wife for the first time during their ceremony , South Africa 's Eyewitness News reported .
Accompanied by an entourage of men dressed in leopard skins , Zuma sang and danced , the network said .
Madiba was then presented with her own entourage of young Zulu men and women .
The president did a solo traditional dance but slipped and fell backwards in the process , according to Eyewitness News .
The reporter who saw the slip said later that this did not appear to be part of a traditional Zulu ceremony where dancers execute a fall .
There was no indication that he had been hurt .
The Madiba family presented Zuma with a chest of drawers as a wedding gift .
Overcast skies in Nkandla failed to dull the spirits of villagers – dressed in animal skins and African prints – who walked along muddy trails to the Zulu ceremony , known as udwendwe .
The media were kept away from the proceedings , but buses transporting the guests were seen outside Zuma 's house , where three big tents were erected .
Several sheep , goats and cows were slaughtered for the wedding feast .

This article was updated on 5 January 2010 to make clear that the Eyewitness News reporter who saw Jacob Zuma 's fall later said that this did not appear to be part of a traditional Zulu ceremony where dancers intentionally execute a fall ."
2010-01-31,"Jacob Zuma , the polygamous president of South Africa , has been accused of undermining the fight against Aids by reportedly fathering his 20th child – with a woman who is not one of his three wives .
Zuma , 67 , allegedly had unprotected sex with the daughter of a friend who is one of the principal organisers of this year 's football World Cup , according to South Africa 's Sunday Times .
The newspaper reported that 39-year - old divorcee Sonono Khoza , the daughter of a football official , Irvin Khoza , gave birth to Zuma 's daughter in October .
The president , who recently married for the fifth time , already has 19 children .
The claim , which was not denied by Zuma 's office , prompted fierce criticism from the opposition Democratic Alliance .
Its leader , Helen Zille , said : "" President Jacob Zuma 's behaviour directly contradicts the government 's campaign against multiple sexual partners , and the inherent Aids risk in having unprotected sex . ""
Zille said a current government advertising campaign promotes safe sex , the use of condoms and attitudes that diminish the chance of having unprotected sex with multiple partners .
"" It sits in stark contrast to the behaviour , and it would appear attitude , of the president . ""
She added : "" There are some people who may argue that Jacob Zuma 's sex life is a matter of private morality or ' culture ' , but this is not so .
His personal behaviour has profound public consequences , and he acknowledged as much by apologising to the nation for having unprotected sex , following his rape trial [ in 2006 ] , and by undertaking to change his ways .
"" Zuma was acquitted of rape .
The president 's 20th child has been registered with the name of Thandekile Matina Zuma , the Sunday Times said .
According to a family friend quoted by the paper , a delegation visited the Khoza family in Soweto , near Johannesburg , last December on Zuma 's behalf to discuss the customary Zulu payment ( inhlawulo ) due when a child is born out of wedlock .
Zuma later discussed the issue with Sonono and her mother , Matina , in Soweto in January .
Irvin Khoza , who is chairman of the World Cup local organising committee and owner of the Orlando Pirates club , is said to have told family friends that he felt betrayed by Zuma 's relationship with Sonono , as he considered him a friend .
During a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , last week , Zuma was asked if he loved all his wives equally . ""
Absolutely , "" he said .
He said polygamy was part of his culture and did not negate any of his beliefs , including his belief in "" the equality of women "" .
He dismissed the idea that polygamy was inherently unfair to women , saying : "" It depends what culture you come from .
People interpret cultures in different ways .
Some think that their culture is superior to others .
That 's a problem we have in the world . ""
That 's my culture .
It does not take anything from me , from my political beliefs and everything , including the belief in the equality of women . """
2010-02-06,"Jacob Zuma , the polygamous president of South Africa , has apologised for fathering his 20th child with a woman who is not one of his three wives .
Sexual health activists have criticised Zuma for having sex with the daughter of a friend who is one of the principal organisers of this year 's World Cup , contending his behaviour sets a bad example in a country with one of the world 's highest rates of HIV and Aids , the Reuters news agency reported .
Senior ANC officials are also furious with the president for embarrassing the party and breaking a pledge he made after being elected party leader in 2007 "" not to embarrass the ANC with other sexual revelations "" , according to South Africa 's Star newspaper .
"" I have over the past week taken time to consider and reflect on the issues relating to a relationship I had outside of wedlock , "" Zuma said in a statement today .
"" It has put a lot of pressure on my family and my organisation , the African National Congress .
I deeply regret the pain that I have caused to my family , the ANC , the Alliance and South Africans in general . ""
On Tuesday Zuma , who married for the fifth time last month , confirmed reports he had fathered a child with Sonono Khoza , the 39-year - old daughter of Irvin Khoza , who is chairman of the World Cup local organising committee and owner of the Orlando Pirates football club .
Khoza is said to have told family friends that he felt betrayed by Zuma 's relationship with Sonono , as he considered him a friend .
Zuma has now made a traditional payment of inhlawulo ( damages ) to Khoza 's family .
The leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance , Helen Zille , has accused Zuma of undermining the South African government 's campaign against multiple sexual partners , "" and the inherent Aids risk in having unprotected sex "" .
Multiple marriages are allowed in South Africa and form part of Zulu culture , but have drawn criticism from HIV and Aids activists .

2010-02-07,"South Africa 's president , Jacob Zuma , apologised yesterday for fathering his 20th child with a woman who is not one of his three wives .
Zuma , 67 , had been accused of undermining the fight against Aids by having unprotected sex with the daughter of one of the football World Cup organisers .
Senior officials in the ruling African National Congress ( ANC ) have also been furious with him for embarrassing the party and breaking a pledge he made after being elected as its leader in 2007 "" not to embarrass the ANC with other sexual revelations "" .
Zuma said in a statement : "" I have over the past week taken time to consider and reflect on the issues relating to a relationship I had outside of wedlock .
"" It has put a lot of pressure on my family and my organisation , the African National Congress .
I deeply regret the pain that I have caused to my family , the ANC … and South Africans in general , "" he added , reaffirming his commitment to "" the importance of the family as an institution "" .
South Africa 's Sunday Times revealed last weekend that 39-year - old divorcee Sonono Khoza , the daughter of a football official , Irvin Khoza , gave birth to Zuma 's daughter in October .
Zuma , who married for the fifth time last month and also has a fiancee , confirmed the report on Tuesday but said the matter was "" intensely personal "" and dismissed as "" mischievous "" criticism from activists who said he had undermined official sexual health campaigns in a country with one of the world 's highest rates of HIV and Aids .
The president acknowledged paternity of the child and said that he had made a traditional payment of inhlawulo ( damages ) to the Khoza family .
Sonono Khoza 's father heads the local organising committee for the 2010 World Cup and reportedly told friends that he felt betrayed by Zuma 's relationship with his daughter .
Zuma 's sex life has come under the spotlight in the past .
After being acquitted of rape in 2006 , he admitted he had made a mistake by having unprotected sex with a woman he knew to be HIV - positive .
But he was ridiculed for saying during the trial that he had left his bedroom after having sex with the woman and taken a shower because this "" would minimise the risk of contracting the disease [ HIV ] "" .
Another South African newspaper , the Star , yesterday quoted unnamed senior party officials as saying that Zuma had plunged the ANC into crisis by breaking his 2007 pledge .
"" Some of us are paralysed [ by embarrassment ]
…
This is something that you can not even raise in meetings , "" the paper quoted a senior member of the ANC 's national executive committee as saying .
"" We do n't know what to do .
We are embarrassed when asked about this by decision - makers internationally . ""
The latest affair has been seized upon by political opponents of the ANC such as Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille , who accused Zuma of undermining the government 's campaign against multiple sexual partners .
"" South Africa now has a president who , both through his words and actions , is doing similar damage to the struggle [ against HIV / Aids ] , "" she said .
The current campaign promoting safe sex , the use of condoms and a change of attitudes towards having unprotected sex with multiple partners "" sits in stark contrast to the behaviour , and it would appear attitude , of the president "" .
Last year , campaigners hailed Zuma as a breath of fresh air following the reign of Thabo Mbeki , who was criticised for claiming the HIV virus was not the sole cause of Aids .
Multiple marriages are allowed in South Africa and form part of Zulu culture , but have drawn criticism from HIV / Aids activists .
At least 5.7 million South Africans are infected and an estimated 1,000 people die from the disease each day ."
2010-02-11,"President Jacob Zuma has carefully chosen his state of the nation address to coincide with the day that Nelson Mandela was released by the white - minority government after 27 years in prison .
His strategy appears to show the continuity of the present ANC with that of Mandela 's generation .
It will do the opposite .
The contrast between the moral authority of Mandela , and the murkiness of Zuma , the current ANC and South African leader , could not have been more striking .
It is also a powerful indictment of the backslide of the ANC .
Zuma 's speech will be overshadowed by the "" babygate "" revelations of the out - of - wedlock birth of his four - month old baby with Sonono Khoza , the daughter of football tycoon Irvin Khoza .
The excesses of the president 's private life is now becoming to dominate his public life to such an extent that it may paralyse government for most of his presidential term .
Winnie Madikizela - Mandela , the former wife of Nelson Mandela , last month said the Mandela family was "" sort of keeping him ( Nelson Mandela ) away from "" the daily news of bickering , scandals and moral indiscretions of the ANC .
Madikizela - Mandela said if her frail ex - husband would have known what was happening to the ANC he spent 27 years in jail for , it would "" quicken our journey to eternity "" .
Of course , Madikizela - Mandela is far from blameless .
During the struggle for liberation , members , activists and supporters of the ANC did not see the movement as simply another ordinary political party .
It was supposed to have a soul .
The soul of the ANC was of course not easy to define .
Yet it was roughly understood that what made the ANC stand apart was its genuine commitment to internal democracy , accountability , honesty , and its compelling vision of a caring non - racial society and governing in the broadest public interest .
When Mandela was released on 11 February 1990 , to assume the de facto leadership of the ANC , we naively thought that the ANC would be different .
The ANC in government was going to break from the familiar path of African liberation movements , having their souls corrupted in power .
And to many extents it has been : it managed to cobble together a constitution , which set out a post - liberation ideological blueprint of a caring and inclusive society , which no other post - liberation African country has done .
Yet what can not be doubted anymore is that our worse fears have come true : the ANC has lost its soul .
The question now is can the party recapture its soul – and turn it to the democratic path many dreamed of was possible when Mandela walked out of Victor Verster prison 20 years ago .
Many have already given up trying .
The only way to do so is to overhaul the ANC root , branch and leadership , and turn it into a wholly democratic organisation .
If the ANC 's democratic soul can not be recaptured , it may be better for South African society for it to break up , and for new parties to be formed from its ashes ."
2010-02-21,"South Africa 's president , Jacob Zuma , once had a smart riposte to anyone who questioned his polygamous lifestyle : "" There are plenty of politicians who have mistresses and children that they hide so as to pretend they 're monogamous .
I prefer to be open . ""
That was until a Sunday newspaper revealed that Zuma had fathered a child with a woman who is not one of his three wives .
After an initial attempt to paint the media as intrusive , he gave in to pressure from his own party and apologised .
Zuma , who now has 20 children , is the first South African president from the Zulu tribe and a proud defender of its cultural traditions , such as polygamy .
Some are reluctant to criticise , wary of echoing colonialist tropes by characterising him as an "" African big man "" of untamed sexuality .
The latest episode , however , has earned the president widespread ridicule and thrown open a debate about how respect for some cultural practices can be squared with values of equality and non - discrimination .
"" It may well be that many , including Zuma , still practise polygamy , "" wrote columnist Justice Malala in the Times , South Africa .
"" It may also be that polygamy is something that is allowed in our constitution .
That , however , does not make it right and it is not defensible under the guise of culture .
Polygamy is inherently undemocratic and oppressive of women .
"" On one side are those who assert the right of groups to express their culture and resent patronising interventions by the west .
Ranged against them are those who believe that "" culture "" is protean and should not be allowed to trump universal human rights .
Boys in the Xhosa tribe undergo circumcision in a secretive ritual , but about 80 died last year from botched operations .
Last December , Zuma attended the annual feast of Ukweshwama , in which young men slaughter a bull with their bare hands .
There will be ample opportunity to seek Zuma 's views on these topics next week when he embarks on a state visit to Britain and stays at Buckingham Palace with his newest wife .
Prince Philip is never one to miss a chance for cultural commentary ."

2010-03-02,"The South African president , Jacob Zuma , began his three - day state visit to the UK today with a call for international sanctions on Zimbabwe to be lifted .
Zuma told reporters in London that the travel bans and asset freezes imposed by the EU and the US on Robert Mugabe and his allies served only to divide the already fragile power - sharing government in Zimbabwe .
Repeating calls by the Southern African Development Community for a suspension of the sanctions , Zuma said : "" Our view is that the unity government should be supported so that it can get out of the difficulties that face Zimbabwe ...
We plead with the countries that have applied sanctions to lift [ them ] .
That would give Zimbabwe the opportunity to move forward . ""
Zuma said Zimbabwe could not be expected to sort out its problems while its power - sharing government , made up of Mugabe 's Zanu - PF and Morgan Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change , was subject to two different sets of rules .
"" It 's going to be difficult [ for the government ] to get on with other matters if there are sanctions , because sanctions are one - sided , "" he said .
"" We have a government that 's not treated equally by sanctions .
Those who can not travel freely feel that they are constrained . ""
Zuma said in a Financial Times interview last week that South Africa had been "" one of the major players that actually pulled Zimbabwe back from getting into a disaster "" , while Europe and the US had ignored the new reality in maintaining sanctions .
The president , who will meet the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh tomorrow , also found time to address the South African football team 's lacklustre performance in the run - up to this summer 's World Cup .
"" We are going to surprise you , "" he said .
"" Our standards came down a little bit , but we have worked hard .
The only weakness was not scoring goals , and we have fixed that .
The World Cup may remain in South Africa . ""
Zuma 's aides , however , were less forthcoming on how the polygamous president had decided which of his three current wives would accompany him to the UK .
In the end , his newest bride , Thobeka Madiba Zuma , has accompanied him .
Protocol on which wife attends which state event is unclear in South Africa , since Zuma operates an unofficial "" rotation "" between spouses .
"" We are an open democracy , "" said a spokesman .
"" We do not have a first lady – what if we had a gay president ?
We have a spousal office .
Who accompanies the president is for him to decide .
It 's a private matter . ""
Speculation in the South African press has suggested that the president considered the trip to London , his new wife 's first foreign engagement as consort , as her turn .
Zuma is a strong defender of Zulu cultural traditions including polygamy and is rumoured to be planning a sixth wedding ."
2010-03-02,"Even before his plane lands on British soil for his state visit on Wednesday South Africa 's president , Jacob Zuma , has made an impact on British politics .
Though famously hostile to diplomatic niceties and white - tie dinners , Gordon Brown has seen fit to absent himself from PMQs and join the Queen in greeting him .
There are precedents , though they will not stop Brown 's critics from claiming he had ducked a routine duffing from David Cameron .
But if that is the least controversial feature of the exuberant Zuma 's visit , Foreign Office veterans may breathe a sigh of relief .
The banana - skin factor , real or imagined , is never absent from such high - profile occasions .
The bread and butter components of the new president 's talks at No 10 and elsewhere are obvious .
Zuma wants to talk about the rolling crisis in Zimbabwe ( western "" smart "" sanctions are no longer helpful , he believes ) which destabilises the region , UK visa policy , this summer 's World Cup and business investment .
A shrewd , if controversial , populist who has fought off rape and corruption charges , Zuma is expected to stress that – despite his leftwing power base – he rejects calls for sweeping nationalisation from the ANC 's impatient youth wing .
But the media has preferred to focus on five - times married Zuma 's choice of wife to accompany him .
Unsurprisingly , the polygamous 67-year - old has chosen Thobeka Stacey Mabhija , his latest bride whom he married in January in a traditional Zulu ceremony .
It will be her first official trip as Mrs Zuma .
Will such a colourful CV discomfort her hosts , not least the 83-year - old and distinctly monogamous monarch with whom the Zumas will stay at Buckingham Palace ?
Given the range of distinctly ropey state visitors she has greeted during her 58 years on the throne it seems unlikely .
The Queen is long past being shocked by the expedient dictates of foreign policy and commercial interests .
King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia who paid a state visit in 2007
– there are usually two such visits a year – is a much - married monarch with at least 22 children .
Zimbabwe 's Robert Mugabe ( 1994 ) was always a controversial guest , whom the Queen Mother boycotted .
For some so was the wartime emperor of Japan , Hirohito ( 1971 ) , for others , George Bush .
His state visit , the first by a US president since Woodrow Wilson in 1918 , came six months after the 2003 invasion of Iraq – and prompted demos .
So did that of President Jiang Zemin in 1999 – when police were accused of heavy - handedness – and Vladimir Putin ( 2003 ) , the first official visit by a Russian head of state since Tsar Nicholas
I 's highly - political trip in 1843 .
It failed to prevent war 10 years later .
As a pro - western dictator , Zaire 's president , Joseph Mobutu , paid a state visit to Britain in 1973 before his long career had established him as one of the world 's great kleptomaniacs .
He modelled his rule on King Leopold of the Belgians , a first cousin of Queen Victoria , who looted what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo as his private fiefdom , killing millions in the process between 1878 and 1908 .
Mobutu died in his bed as some state visitors , including King Feisal of Iraq ( 1956 ) and King Birenda of Nepal ( murdered by his son in 1980 ) , did not .
Most notoriously , President Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania and his wife , Elena , were state visitors at the fag - end of Jim Callaghan 's Labour government in 1978 .
Many were appalled that such a Stalinist dictator should get the red carpet treatment .
But Britain was keen to encourage Ceausescu 's independence from the Russians and to sell him planes he could not afford .
Private Eye produced a memorable cover in which Prince Philip says : "" And does he have any hobbies ? ""
Elena replies : "" He 's a mass murderer . ""
The Queen observes : "" How very interesting . ""
She gave him a knighthood , later taken back .
Mrs Thatcher gave him a rifle , BAe sold him some aircraft .
None of it saved him from a hail of bullets as the Soviet bloc crumbled in 1989 .
The Queen soldiered on ."
2010-03-03,"12.03pm :
Alongside the pomp and ceremony , there is a serious side to Jacob Zuma 's visit .
He will be pressing Gordon Brown tolift the travel bans and asset freezes imposed by the EU and the US on Robert Mugabe and his allies .
Zuma 's argument is that it serves only to divide the already fragile power - sharing government in Zimbabwe .
Gordon Brown has taken the unusual step of skipping prime minister 's question time to be at Buckingham Palace when the Queen receives Zuma .
Here is a wry take from my colleague Michael White on Zuma 's visit to the palace .
Will such a colourful CV discomfort her hosts , not least the 83-year - old and distinctly monogamous monarch with whom the Zumas will stay at Buckingham Palace ?
Given the range of distinctly ropey state visitors she has greeted during her 58 years on the throne it seems unlikely .
The Queen is long past being shocked by the expedient dictates of foreign policy and commercial interests .
12.06pm :
My colleague Sam Jones who is at Horse Guards Parade says there was a last - minute tidying up as someone brushed the gravel with a broom .
Sky News is juxtaposing rowdy scenes from PMQs with pictures from Horse Guards .
The carpet looks pink rather than red .
It 's cold so the Coldstream Guards are wearing long grey coats .
The Mall is splendidly bedecked from Admiralty Arch and Buckingham palace with the Union Jack and the South African flag .
The Queen in purple coat and hat just arrived and is shaking hands with people .
It 's surreal watching the Queen while listening to Harriet Harman sparring with William Hague simultaneously .
12.18pm :
Vince Cable , the Lib Dem Treasury spokesman , gets a big laugh at PMQs by suggesting to Harman that she discuss polygamy with Zuma and the role of family tax allowance can play .
Zuma 's visit could be overshadowed by news of the death of Michael Foot , the former Labour leader .
The last pictures Sky carried of the Queen showed her waiting - impatiently ? - for Zuma .
It is cold after all .
12.24pm : That crack from Cable will not go down well with Zuma 's entourage .
His supporters have already condemned the "" colonialist "" tone in some of the media coverage in the UK .
The African National Congress Youth League has expressed its disgust .
"" It is quite apparent that the British media is one that is characterised and defined by the worst form of barbarism , backwardness and racism , "" its spokesman said .
12.29pm : While Sky News is concentrating on Foot 's death , Zuma 's visit is getting live coverage in South Africa on eNews , emails my colleague David Smith in Johannesburg .
The presenter says that Zuma 's rather harsh comments today might not be the best start to the visit .
"" One ca n't help drawing a parallel to Nelson Mandela 's state visit to the UK in 1995 .
There was a huge greeting for Nelson Mandela . ""
12.43pm :
My colleague , Sam Jones , has just called in with details from the scene , which is just as well as it 's wall - to - wall Michael Foot on the BBC and Sky .
The Queen 's matching hat and coat are officially described as violet and the Guards were Grenadier
not Coldstream as I previously said .
The Queen turned up at 12.15 on the nose .
Zuma turned up at 12.22 in a Bentley with the Prince of Wales .
The third Mrs Zuma , Thobeka Madiba , 38 , followed in a Rolls - Royce with Camilla .
Mrs Zuma was wearing a gold dress and gold hat .
Zuma wore a dark grey suit .
He and Prince Philip , in top hat , inspected the ceremonial guard at a brisk pace .
Zuma led , with the duke two paces behind .
Then everyone went off the palace with a footman handing the Queen a black blanket for the ride -
it 's bitterly cold , Sam says .
12.55pm :
David Smith , my colleague in Johannesburg , was interviewed on South African radio about Zuma 's visit .
He said it was not the top item .
That was handover of the Soccer City stadium to Johannesburg for the World Cup .
He says : The antics of the British media are making waves in South Africa today .
The front page of The Star newspaper took a screen grab from the Daily Mail 's website : "" Jacob Zuma is a sex - obsessed bigot with four wives and 35 children .
So why is Britain fawning over this vile buffoon ? ""
The paper quoted several other papers and reported Zuma 's response to the "" UK onslaught "" .
The British coverage was also the talk of radio shows , but on television the Zuma visit to "" Queen Elizabeth the Second "" is taking a back seat to the countdown to the football World Cup in South Africa .
The eNews channel said : "" There are concerns that the British media will focus on his private life . ""
1.03pm :
Before coming here , Zuma told the Financial Times that the EU should lift its targeted sanctions against Zimbabwe .
Zuma argues that the unity government "" is being suffocated .
It is not being allowed to do its job by the big countries . ""
The Foreign Office , however , says "" evidence of change and commitment to reform on the ground will be the most important factor influencing our position on sanctions . ""
Before becoming president , Zuma had taken a tougher line on Zimbabwe than Thabo Mbeki , his predecessor , so his new position is a slight u - turn .
Despite reports in the pro - Robert Mugabe press that Morgan Tsvangirai favours a lifting of the sanctions , this is not the case .
Tsvangirai still believes that the power - sharing agreement must be fully implemented before sanctions can be lifted .
1.31pm :
The ANC has put out a statement decrying British media coverage of Zuma 's visit , specifically Stephen Robinson 's piece in the Mail .
We find it appalling that the media , in particular , Stephen Robinson , would have such a myopic view and disrespect for an official visit of a head of state to their country .
2.26pm :
A snippet from the Press Association 's account of the occasion .
The procession along the Mall by the monarch and the presidential couple was a glittering affair as they were accompanied by a mounted Sovereign 's Escort provided by the Household Cavalry 's Life Guards and Blues and Royals .
The Queen rode in the lavishly decorated Australian state coach with the president while Mrs Zuma , who had been smiling throughout the ceremony , was joined by the Duke in the Scottish state coach .
2.30pm :
While Zuma and the ANC have been bashing the British press , the South African media are also poking at him .
The Cape Times has this spoof on what the Queen and Zuma wo n't be talking about .
QE : I 'm so glad .
It 's just a formality here in court .
Have you been to court before , President ... er , Jake ?
JZ :
Yes , but as you know , I was acquitted of all charges .
QE :
Of course .
I meant the court of St James .
Cultural differences cause so much misunderstanding , though I 've always been interested in diversity within the Commonwealth . .
2.48pm :
Watch ITN 's report on Zuma 's visit , which includes vox pop with disgruntled young South Africans who complain that Zuma has not delivered .
2.53pm :
So what else is Zuma up to while he is here .
A lot .
Here are some of the highlights .
After today 's private lunch with the Queen , he is off to Muswell Hill to visit Oliver Tambo 's house ( Tambo was one of Mandela 's ANC companions ) and this evening there will be a state banquet at the palace .
Tomorrow , he holds talks at No 10 with Gordon Brown and will visit Lewisham town hall for a discussion on Lewisham council 's approach to issues affecting young people .
On Friday he will hold talks with captains of industry at the palace .
3.01pm :
All is not well at home , where some commentators have described Zuma as a lame duck after less than a year in office .
Richard Calland of the Mail&amp;Guardian gave this downbeat assessment recently .
There is little appetite for another ruthless recall à la Mbeki or a bloody succession battle , neither , increasingly , is there a great deal of enthusiasm within the ANC for much more of Zuma , let alone a second term .
Faced with a lame duck president , some are already reaching the conclusion : Zuma should go - and go now .
3.12pm :
The respected thinktank , International Crisis Group , also thinks that targeted sanctions on Zimbabwe should be maintained .
The broader international community , especially the UK , US , EU and China , should support and complement SADC 's ( the regional group ) efforts through careful calibration of trade , aid , and investment to encourage progress ; maintenance of targeted sanctions on those thwarting the transition ; and lifting of sanctions on entities key to economic recovery .
3.20pm :
The South African Broadcasting Corporation 's Kgomotso Sebetso anticipates a "" no - holds barred affair "" at tomorrow 's press conference at No 10 .
3.38pm :
That 's it for today 's coverage of Jacob Zuma 's state visit .
Thanks for all your comments ."
2010-03-03,"South Africa 's president , Jacob Zuma , has lashed out at British attitudes to "" barbaric "" Africans as he begins a state visit in London .
The remarks came after scathing British media coverage of the polygamous president and his chequered past , including the recent scandal of his 20th child , born out of wedlock .
A Daily Mail article described him as a "" sex - obsessed bigot "" and "" vile buffoon "" .
Zuma , due to meet the Queen and Gordon Brown today , countered with an attack on what he described as culturally superior views reminiscent of the British empire in South Africa . ""
When the British came to our country , they said everything we are doing was barbaric , was wrong , inferior in whatever way , "" he told South Africa 's Star newspaper .
"" Bear in mind that I 'm a freedom fighter and I fought to free myself , also for my culture to be respected .
And I do n't know why they are continuing thinking that their culture is more superior than others , those who might have said so .
"" I am very clear on these issues , I 've not looked down upon any culture of anyone , and no one has been given an authority to judge others . ""
The British have done that before , as they colonised us , and they continue to do this , and it 's an unfortunate thing .
If people want an engagement , I 'm sure we will engage on that issue .
"" Zuma 's statement was condemned by South Africa 's main opposition party , the Democratic Alliance , as insulting to his hosts .
Kenneth Mubu , the party 's shadow international relations minister , said : "" The treatment of President Jacob Zuma at the hands of a certain portion of the British press – most notably the Daily Mail and Daily Mirror – does not excuse his quite extraordinary attack on Britain and the British people . ""
He added : "" Instead of rising above predictable criticism from a particular quarter of the British press , he has allowed himself to be dragged down to the level of the tabloids . ""
By accusing the British people of believing that Africans are barbaric and inferior , he has insulted his hosts , and no doubt undermined the entire purpose of the state visit – which is to strengthen relations between South Africa and the United Kingdom . ""
Zuma was backed , however , by the youth wing of his party , the African National Congress .
It issued a statement saying it was disgusted by the British reports . ""
British media seem to have developed a habit of rubbishing our president and constantly portray him as barbaric and of inferior belonging , "" the youth league said .
"" It is quite apparent that the British media is the one that is characterised and defined by the worst form of barbarism , backwardness and racism . ""
These British racists continue to live in a dreamland and sadly believe that Africans are still their colonial subjects , with no values and principles .
They believe that the only acceptable values and principles in the world are British values of whiteness and subjugation of Africans . ""
Zuma , on a three - day visit , will press the British government for international sanctions on Zimbabwe to be lifted .
He is accompanied by the newest of his three wives , Thobeka Madiba Zuma , on her first trip abroad .
Protocol on which wife attends which state event is unclear and Zuma operates an unofficial "" rotation "" between spouses ."
2010-03-03,"Jacob Zuma , who emerged from a Bentley at 12.20pm today to shake the Queen 's hand and receive a formal welcome , was a study in sartorial sobriety .
Those hoping that the charismatic and often controversial South African president would bring a touch of KwaZulu - Natal exoticism to central London were destined for disappointment .
Instead , the 67-year - old president rolled up in a dark grey suit , dark overcoat , black shoes and black scarf .
His sensible attire was echoed by the heavy coats and patriotic scarves of his fellow South African delegates , who looked on proudly from the sidelines , and complained from time to time about the unpredictable cruelty of Britain 's springtime and the predictable cruelty of its press .
It was left to Zuma 's third concurrent wife , 38-year - old Thobeka Madiba Zuma , and the Queen to inject a little colour into proceeding with their respective outfits of gold and purple .
Zuma 's muted clothes reflected his desire to reiterate that , despite his five marriages , 20 children and turbulent political and personal past , he is a potent figure on the international stage .
Not only is the ANC veteran head of one of the most important developing countries in the world , he is also the pre - eminent regional powerbroker and a man who could help cure the UK of one persistent headache : Zimbabwe .
Sadly for Zuma and his entourage , much of the media coverage so far has focused on the man rather than the office .
His aides are furious about the "" disrespectful "" reports that have greeted this week 's three - day state visit , not least one newspaper 's description of Zuma as a "" sex - obsessed bigot "" and "" vile buffoon "" .
Zuma himself was sufficiently incensed by the comments to risk offending his hosts .
Hours before meeting the Queen , inspecting the guard of honour and listening to the band play both Nkosi Sikilele Africa , and God Save the Queen , the president told South Africa 's Star newspaper that he was fed up with being judged and sneered at by a country with a hypocritical attitude towards its former colonies .
There were , however , no discernible signs of that anger as he smiled and chatted with the Queen before climbing into the Australian state coach for a trip down the Mall to Buckingham Palace .
As the coach drew away , the Queen pulled a blanket up to guard against the chill and the president of South Africa , who joined the ANC at the age of 16 , wiped his nose with a handkerchief .
At the palace , Zuma was treated to a private view of memorabilia relating to UK 's links with South Africa .
There were personal photographs recording the Queen 's first visit to Zuma 's country as Princess Elizabeth 63 years ago .
That was a trip that yielded two famous moments .
The first was the future Queen 's promise to devote her life to the service of the Commonwealth .
The second was the Queen Mother 's misidentification of a loyal subject ; when a man jumped on to the running board of the royal car , she feared the worst and beat him off with an umbrella .
It later transpired that he had been trying to give Princess Elizabeth a 10-shilling note as a present on her 21st birthday .
Today , the presidential Bentley rematerialised on the streets of a north London suburb as Zuma indulged in some political nostalgia .
The three - storey Edwardian house at 51 Alexandra Park Road , in Muswell Hill , made an unlikely shrine , but , as the green plaque on its front attested , the building had played a crucial role in the fight to end apartheid .
For 30 years it was home to Oliver Tambo , the once exiled president of the ANC , and a beacon for freedom fighters , politicos and intellectuals .
The house has been bought by the South African government and could become a museum .
The posters on the staircase – "" ANC demands one person , one vote in South Africa "" – and the huge framed photo of a smiling Zuma , already offered a succinct chronology of recent South African history .
Returning to the house , said Zuma , brought a bittersweet time back to life . ""
The reflections [ we shared ] were about the struggle , "" he said , after unveiling a plaque in the company of Tambo 's son , Dali , and guests including David Steel and Glenys Kinnock . ""
Some of us used to come here to give reports and bring messages .
It does bring back those days when we could not speculate about when would be the day of freedom .
"" The house holds more memories and more ghosts for Dali Tambo , who can remember the great gatherings , the break - ins and the knowledge that his family was under constant surveillance .
"" It was very much a home to all South African exiles from any faction within the struggle , "" he said .
"" We always felt that if we were going to land anywhere in the world apart from your own home , the best place was London .
My mother called it a soft landing as you were landing in a liberal democracy . ""
As he waited in the cold for the presidential motorcade to arrive , Tambo , who was educated in London but lives in Johannesburg , pondered Zuma 's progress from visitor to Muswell Hill to visitor to Buckingham Palace .
The Zuma he remembered , he said , bore little resemblance to the cartoonish and libidinous man the press were presenting .
"" You 'll always have the media caricaturing politicians and I guess that 's part of their job , "" he mused .
"" But it 's unfortunate that it ignores a very noble personal history .
He has spent his entire life fighting for the liberation of his people .
We view him as an honourable man . """
2010-03-03,"South African president Jacob Zuma began a three - day state visit to the UK on Wednesday ( you can follow his whereabouts on Mark Tran 's liveblog ) .
Only the president 's newest bride , Thobeka Madiba Zuma , has accompanied him .
Zuma 's polygamy has been criticised after he admitted that he had fathered a child with an unmarried woman 28 years his junior .
But Duduzani Zuma , one of Zuma 's sons , swiftly came to his defence : "" We as a family are content with the polygamous nature of our household . ""
Debates on polygamy are often framed by the clashing perspectives of religious doctrine and feminist - inspired critiques of exploitation of women , with accusations of cultural imperialism and counter - accusations of patriarchal oppression .
Meanwhile , very few communities actively exercise polygamy 's opposite , polyandry .
But perhaps , in the context of polygamy , we should be able to discuss different models of relationships .
Should love and commitment between two people – the couple – really be the only approved sort of relationship in society ?
What about alternative living arrangements , such as open relationships and communes , let alone the extended families of polygamous unions ?"
2010-03-03,"Lifting sanctions against President Robert Mugabe and his Zanu - PF party "" would give Zimbabwe an opportunity to move forward "" , Jacob Zuma told reporters this week during his visit to Britain .
South Africa 's president is right .
The continued EU sanctions are seriously weakening the hand of Morgan Tsvangirai , the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , in his efforts to implement a power - sharing deal in Zimbabwe .
This is because Zanu - PF 's response to the EU sanctions has consisted of an unrelenting propaganda effort to cast Tsvangirai and the MDC as "" sell outs "" who campaigned for the imposition of unjustified sanctions that are "" racist "" and a violation of Zimbabwe 's sovereignty .
Zanu - PF has circulated this message since sanctions were imposed in 2002 .
It depicts Tsvangirai 's MDC as being in cahoots with imperialist western states .
Tsvangirai 's party denies it campaigned for the imposition of sanctions .
But it has nonetheless failed to counter Zanu - PF 's propaganda because its message has never been as coherent and consistent .
The fact that Zimbabwe 's public media is controlled and dominated by Zanu - PF scarcely helps .
Since the MDC began sharing power it has come under pressure to advocate the removal of sanctions because it supposedly "" instigated "" them .
Zanu - PF refuses to implement democratic reforms it consented to in the power - sharing agreement for as long as the sanctions remain in place .
The sanctions standoff is one of the main reasons why the government has made little headway in democratising Zimbabwean institutions in time for the next election in 2012 .
This stalemate is what prompted Zuma 's call – although it is consistent with the position taken by several southern African leaders since 2002 .
The then Tanzanian president , Benjamin Mkapa , was scathing about the EU move : "" As you have heard about Zimbabwe and the EU 's decision to impose sanctions , it seems they want to divide Africa at Brussels in 2002 just as they did in Berlin in 1884 .
Africa must be prepared to say no , "" he said .
When Zimbabwe 's power - sharing deal was signed in 2008 , the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) called on the EU and the United States to remove all forms of sanctions .
They declined , arguing that sanctions should only be removed when Zanu - PF had fully implemented the power - sharing agreement .
Today , the EU contends that if it brings Zimbabwe 's isolation to an end , it will have less leverage to persuade Zanu - PF to fully implement the agreement .
The EU 's condemnation of Mugabe and the Zanu - PF elite would command more authority if the same standards were applied elsewhere .
After Afghanistan 's inconclusive presidential election in August last year , Afghans were expected to vote in a runoff between incumbent Hamid Karzai and challenger Abdullah Abdullah .
Abdullah withdrew , citing vote rigging designed to ensure Karzai 's victory .
In Zimbabwe this drew comparisons with how Tsvangirai pulled out of the 2008 runoff against Mugabe because of its unfair nature .
In spite of the evident electoral abnormalities in Afghanistan , the US and EU recognised Karzai as the duly elected president .
Zuma and other SADC leaders who brokered power sharing in Zimbabwe deeply resent the EU 's refusal to lift sanctions when they applied no equivalent to Karzai .
Few , if any , African countries still look up to the EU , and the west generally , as champions of human rights and democracy .
It is time to start listening and taking our cue from leaders like Zuma , who are far more engaged with the region and better placed to bring about free and fair elections in Zimbabwe ."
2010-03-03,"11.14am :
It 's Harriet Harman versus William Hague today .
Gordon Brown is tied up with Jacob Zuma 's state visit .
Preparing for PMQs is normally an ordeal , but this morning all Harman needs to do is read a copy of the Guardian .
Hague has failed to explain why Lord Ashcroft , the man Hague nominated for a peerage on the basis that he would start paying "" tens of millions a year in tax "" , has been a non - dom for the last 10 years and Harman could put him on the back foot just by using the "" questions for William Hague "" in today 's Guardian .
For light entertainment , she may also refer to Nicholas Watt 's story , and raise the fact that Kenneth Clarke yesterday described David Cameron and George Osborne as young and inexperienced .
With Ashcroft almost certain to come up , Hague will probably want to play it defensively .
At PMQs , that means asking about a sombre topic where a partisan reply would seem inappropriate .
I would not be at all surprised if he has something to say about the Chilean earthquake .
12.01pm :
Andrew Neil has just said on the BBC that this is the 10th time Brown has missed a PMQs .
Tessa Jowell says the BBC would be "" castigating "" Brown if he snubbed Zuma .
Neil says Tony Blair missed 5 % of PMQs .
Brown has missed 12 % of them , Neil says .
12.02pm :
In the chamber , Harman starts with an explanation for Brown 's absence .
Perhaps she 's been watching The Daily Politics too ?
12.03pm :
Harman pays tribute to five soldiers killed in Afghanistan .
They demonstrated "" outstanding courage and skill "" , she says .
12.04pm :
She also sends condolences to the people of Chile .
12.05pm : Manufacturing Eleanor Laing ( Con ) asks why manufacturing has declined faster under this Labour government than under any other administration .
Harman says this is typical of the Conservatives "" talking the country down "" .
The Tories describe Britain has heading towards an age of austerity .
She says : "" We do not share that pessimism . ""
12.06pm : William Hague
There 's lots of cheering when Hague stands up .
He also names the dead servicemen . ""
Let us hope they are not forgotten , "" he says .
12.07pm :
He starts with a question related to the armed forces .
The Iraq inquiry showed the MoD was running on a "" crisis budget "" .
Was n't it a mistake for Gordon Brown to cut the helicopter budget ?
12.08pm
: Harman says the government is fully committed to the armed forces .
There has been an increase in helicopters .
12.08pm
: Hague says the government made an "" enormous mistake "" in 2004 .
Quoting Geoff Hoon from the Iraq inquiry
, he says more helicopters would be coming into service now if Brown had released more money .
Will Brown admit his mistake when he gives evidence to the inquiry on Friday ?
12.10pm
: Harman says the question is "" fatuous "" .
Hague will have to wait until Brown appears on Friday .
Hague says Harman has twice called him "" foreign secretary "" .
"" She must think we 've had the election already . ""
Turning to the economy , he asks why UK bonds are valued by the markets as twice as risky as debt held by Pepsi or McDonald 's .
12.11pm
: Harman says the Tories are acting as if they have won the election already .
Hague is making the assumption that he will be remaining in his position .
"" I wonder about that , "" she says .
( A clever shift to Ashcroft . )
The Commons places the highest value on the nature of integrity , she says .
12.13pm :
Hague says he was not assuming the election result .
"" People in glass houses should not start throwing stones . ""
The real party funding issue is the power of the Unite union .
Unite is "" wrecking British Airways "" .
And Jack Dromey , the union 's deputy general secretary and Harman 's husband , has just gone through an "" all - woman shortlist "" to be selected , he said .
Harman may not recognise marriage in the tax system .
But she does recognise it in the political system .
Turning to the economy , why has investment fallen ?
12.14pm :
Harman returns to Ashcroft .
The question is about one man in the Lords .
On debt , the most important thing is that the economy should grow .
Tax has a part to play in reducing the deficit .
She says : People who have promised to pay their tax and given assurances should pay their taxes .
What has happened to the Ashcroft money , she asks .
12.15pm : Hague says , on the subject of the Lords , that Harman may want to explain why Lord Paul became a privy counsellor after he bought 6,000 copies of Brown 's book Courage .
Does Harman agree that a weak currency arises from a weak economy that arises from a weak government ?
12.16pm :
Harman says the government is determined to strengthen the economy .
She returns to Ashcroft .
The Tories try to shout her down .
John Bercow , the Speaker , intervenes .
He gets them to be quiet , and he urges Harman to address government business .
Harman says Hague has been left without "" a shred of credibility "" .
Apparently some Labour MPs have been waving £ 5 notes at Hague .
12.18pm :
Hague returns to the economy .
While Brown is at the palace today , will he ask the Queen to dissolve parliament and call the election ?
12.19pm :
Harman says the government will continue to pursue policies that have supported the economy and it will not take the advice of the "" inexperienced "" shadow chancellor .
( So , Nick 's story gets a mention . )
Returning to Ashcroft , she says Hague and Ashcroft ca n't both be right .
One of them should go .
Alan Turing Phyllis Starkey ( Lab ) asks Harman to condemn the homophobic policies that pushed Alan Turing , the Bletchley Park codebreaker , to suicide .
She does .
12.21pm :
Vincent Cable Cable suggests that Harman , in her capacity as equality minister , might want to discuss polygamy with Zuma , and the impact of marriage tax breaks might have on that .
He also asks about Ashcroft .
12.21pm :
Harman says it is "" paradoxical "" that the Tory married tax cut would be available to a man getting married for the third time , but not to his first two wives .
12.22pm :
On Ashcroft , she says the country was "" misled "" by the assurances given at the time .
The questions are for the Tories to answer .
There are lots of Tory MPs heckling Cable about Michael Brown , the fraudster who donated to the Lib Dems .
12.22pm :
Cable asks the government to release all the Cabinet Office papers relating to Ashcroft .
12.26pm :
Harman says the release of papers is a matter for the cabinet secretary .
She says Ashcroft 's memoirs were appropriately called "" Dirty Politics , Dirty Times "" .
She says in the book Ashcroft says he got his peerage because of Hague .
12.27pm :
NEWSFLASH -
Michael Foot , the former Labour leader , has died .
12.29pm
: It 's getting a bit farcical now .
Phil Wilson ( Lab ) asks a question .
Harman does n't hear it .
Wilson asks it again .
It 's about the bribery bill .
Will it cover Ashcroft ?
Harman says that it is not retrospective .
But he says that does not exempt Ashcroft from the obligation to pay his taxes .
12.33pm :
In response to another question , Harman says : It is evident that the Tory party is for sale - but Britain is not .
12.37pm :
Here are two of the quotes from Hague and Harman on the Ashcroft affair .
Hague :
The real party funding issue in this country is the power of the Unite union that is bankrolling the Labour party and is wrecking British airways and who 's deputy general secretary , her husband , has just gone through an all - woman shortlist to be selected to parliament .
Harman : People who have promised to pay their tax and given us assurances should pay their taxes .
What has happened to the tens of millions of pounds of taxes that the shadow foreign secretary promised would be paid by Lord Ashcroft ?
Instant summary
Who won ?
Harman .
Admittedly , she had an easy target .
But she whacked it with gusto , and she performed a couple of nifty segues to shift from one subject to Ashcroft .
Telling Hague that national debt would be lower if Ashcroft paid his taxes worked particularly well ."
2010-03-04,"With his country just 97 days away from hosting the first World Cup on African soil , Jacob Zuma was well placed today , during a visit to Wembley Stadium , to advise the Football Association chairman , Lord Triesman , on England 's own bid to host the 2018 tournament . ""
At the beginning , many people said it would be very difficult for South Africa to host this .
We can say now without any fear of contradiction that we are ready , if not more than ready , "" said Zuma , who later just avoided missing an open goal on the hallowed Wembley turf when invited by Fabio Capello to take a penalty .
Earlier , Zuma had met Gordon Brown , during which he committed to a global summit on education during the World Cup .
"" We agreed that if the soccer world was behind education you could change the world as the game is loved by so many .
We want to develop very specific resources to poor children in particular , "" he said .
Even before Zuma 's recent outburst to the South African media over the reporting of his visit , World Cup organisers had criticised the British press for focusing on security risks .
"" We have worked very hard , and that includes the issue of safety .
Besides the time of the games themselves , the fact of the matter is that we have brought down crime , "" he said .
"" Rest assured , the event will come and go without any bad event . ""
Earlier , in a speech at Westminster to MPs , he admitted there was still much to do to close the gap between black and white and rich and poor in South Africa .
In return for his advice to the FA , Zuma might have asked Capello for some tips for his national team , known as Bafana Bafana , who go into the tournament as the least fancied hosts in history .
Danny Jordaan , the 2010 chief executive who accompanied Zuma on his Wembley tour , admitted the team 's form was a "" big concern "" .
Zuma was more optimistic : "" Bafana Bafana will take the cup and it will stay in South Africa . """
2010-03-04,"The combustible combination of Harriet Harman and Jacob Zuma were briefly under the same Westminster roof yesterday .
While the leader of the house was finishing her weekly report on next week 's Commons business , the leader of South Africa was gearing up to address assorted VIPs at the unelected end of the building .
As a prominent British feminist , Harman has already been teased – by saintly Vince Cable , no less – about the possibility of "" entering into a debate "" on gender equality and marriage tax breaks with the polygamous South African masculinist , here on a state visit .
Alas , it was not to be .
Besuited Zuma 's speech was such a model of graceful moderation which ticked all the right boxes that the Queen herself could have delivered it .
Even more disappointingly , Zuma ticked boxes close to the Harman heart : poverty , inequality and a fairer deal for women .
Not a machine gun joke in sight .
In any case , Hotwheels Hattie was busy elsewhere , stirring up an inequality debate between Tory zillionaire donor Lord Ashcroft and the rest of us .
She was joined in this noble crusade by Labour and Lib Dem MPs , all fearful that "" central American money "" saved through his non - dom tax status is being channelled into capturing their marginal seats .
Harman seemed happy to amplify any passing attack on the man Denis MacShane called "" Lord Sleaze of Belize "" .
Indeed she kept repeating the two core charges : that Ashcroft had broken tax assurances given as a condition of his peerage and that he was spending the ill - gottens "" trying to buy seats with the Belize dollar "" .
"" What I have said is a fact , "" she bellowed more than once , before ploughing on .
From a more ambitious politician it would have sounded like a leadership bid .
But when she used the word sleaze Tory MPs erupted and Sir Peter Tapsell , who allows God to address him as an equal , demanded a retraction .
None came .
This was all very embarrassing for the Speaker .
Periodically , John Bercow instructed MPs not to mention Ashcroft again because he is not on next week 's agenda .
At every turn they ignored him .
Mr Speaker sounded desperate , as well he might , because rightwing Tories with trademark red faces were using the session to harry Harman with a not - so - coded question .
During votes on Commons reform due that afternoon ( which reformers later won handsomely ) , why were they not being allowed to have another secret ballot to pick the Speaker in the next parliament , instead of an open vote ?
In plain English that translates as : we want to vote out Bercow when we 're in charge , but not be caught doing it .
Hotwheels flannelled unconvincingly .
It took a good 20 plodding minutes for a Tory MP to throw the obvious grenade . ""
Why is she so in favour of all - women shortlists apart from when her husband is seeking selection ? "" asked Shipley 's hooligan member , Phil Davies .
Hattie 's hubby Jack Harman has recently been picked for the Ashcroft - proof Labour seat of Erdington , using his maiden name , Jack Dromey . ""
Even I am not in favour of 100 % all - women shortlists , although when I see you it tempts me to think I might be mistaken , "" Hattie replied .
This was the wrong answer as she has recently conceded class as well as race and gender can create inequality .
Jack is a working class lad who married up ; the least they can do is find him a seat .
After all , in some countries where a bloke has served the maximum allowed time as president , Argentina or the US for example , he pushes the missus for a top job .
After 10 years of New Labour , it is now OK for feminists to promote their fellas – and non - doms to promote whoever they fancy ."
2010-03-04,"Jacob Zuma is an affable man justly lauded for attempting to recreate Nelson Mandela 's reconciliatory style in the aftermath of Thabo Mbeki 's deeply divisive tenure .
In this context , the new South African president 's prickly attack on neocolonial British attitudes towards "" barbaric "" Africans was remarkable .
It was reminiscent of Mbeki himself , and even Zimbabwe 's Robert Mugabe .
The column that provoked the attack , by the Mail 's Stephen Robinson , was indeed an instance of the kind of sarky condescension with which Zuma takes issue .
But by rising to the bait at the outset of his most important foreign tour yet , Zuma manifested a dawning truth about his fledgling presidency : he is weak and embattled , not least by the latest revelations about his messy personal life .
A month ago , the South African media revealed that Zuma had a secret child born out of wedlock ; after brazening it out for a few days with the "" this is my Zulu culture "" defence , he was forced to offer an apology .
This was not because of an uproar from white racists , but rather , because of the disquiet and outrage of black South Africans , who understood that he was abusing traditional customs to justify his own goatishness .
There is no question that he had broken the very strict rules of traditional African polygamy by impregnating the daughter of Irvin Khoza , a close personal friend and South Africa 's football supremo .
The episode compromised Zuma 's authority , already weak by virtue of the fact that he is in power thanks to the sponsorship of a disparate group of ANC leaders with little in common .
These include leftwing trade unionists , ambitious businessmen , Zulu ethnicists , and spooks and provincial strongmen sidelined by Mbeki – all of whom saw in Zuma a route into power , and now would like to call in their bets .
Most of them lined up behind Zuma for the simple reason that he was not Mbeki , and was willing to take the man on ; many , now , are reckoning with their bad call .
Observing Zuma deliver his state of the nation address in parliament a week after his apology , the South African commentator Richard Calland wrote that he could "" smell the sense of distance and disdain "" towards Zuma from ANC parliamentarians : "" You hear it in the conversations of longstanding ANC members and activists , who remember the days when the ANC 's grand mission was not only to conquer apartheid , but also to do so with a compelling sense of modernity , of non - ethnicity and non - sexism , to set a new standard as a paragon of decency and dignity that would surprise the world and win Africa new - found respect and intellectual status . ""
Much remains good about Jacob Zuma presidency : rational leadership at last on Aids ; a talented and heterodox cabinet held to account by performance appraisals ; a lack of the defensiveness that characterised the Mbeki era .
Zuma 's populism has rendered the South African government more responsive and accessible than it was during the aloof Mbeki 's tenure .
But it has also meant that Zuma presents himself as all things to all people – and he seems unable to be the kind of decisive leader South Africa needs , if it is going to combat its huge problems .
The country lost nearly 900,000 jobs in last year 's recession ; a haemorrhage it can ill - afford given its endemic unemployment rates and consequent crime levels .
As one senior business leader told me recently : "" At least under Mbeki you knew whom to talk to , and there was a line everyone followed .
Now , every time I visit the Union Buildings [ the South African presidency ] , I feel as if I am walking into a children 's playroom where everyone is squabbling over the toys .
"" There is an edge to the metaphor .
The toys represent not just policy positions , but the lucrative access to state patronage , via tenders for state contracts .
And this is where Zuma 's messy personal life becomes a serious issue : his many wives ; his 20-odd children ; the bad judgment that rendered him vulnerable to both corruption charges in 2005 and rape charges in 2006 – even if this bad judgment was exploited by his political enemies in the Mbeki camp .
This week , Zuma was quoted as saying , "" When the British came to our country , they said everything we are doing was barbaric , was wrong , inferior in whatever way . ""
But the serious critique of Zuma is not about who is a barbarian and who is civilised .
It is about good governance , and this is a universal value , as relevant to an African village as it is to Westminster .
If you are unable to keep your appetites in check , you are inevitably going to live beyond your means .
And this means you are going to become vulnerable to patronage and even corruption .
That is why Jacob Zuma 's "" polygamy "" is his achilles heel ."
2010-03-05,""" How do Zulus explain polygamy ? "" the BBC website asked yesterday in a piece at the thoughtful end of this week 's coverage of the South African president 's state visit to Britain .
On Tuesday the Daily Mail called him "" a sex - obsessed bigot "" and yesterday its sketch teased him as "" the Leslie Phillips of African statesmen , "" before turning its fire on British politicians as well .
This paper , too , has had a go : Pass notes No 2,736 called him "" Mr Defective Zipper "" .
There are many more serious concerns about President Zuma 's rule beside his domestic arrangements , and many more important issues for the British and South African governments to discuss .
He has said deeply unpleasant and ignorant things about women and Aids in his time , and last year demoted the country 's respected health minister Barbara Hogan .
It is right to criticise him for this .
But that does not wholly explain this week 's media fascination with polygamy .
There is an undertone of imperial snobbishness about it as well , the mockery of a visiting president exposing a British national weakness for thinking of foreign leaders in the most simplistic , comic - book terms .
African leaders seem particularly prone to this stereotyping .
Nelson Mandela , hero to the world and saviour of his nation , can do no wrong in British eyes , just as President Zuma can now do no good – South Africa 's saint giving way to its sinner .
Idi Amin , who got his own state visit in the 1970s , was thought a buffoon by the press before he was declared a butcher .
Robert Mugabe experienced a similar slide .
Britain 's closer neighbours suffer too .
President Sarkozy 's state visit in 2008 was dominated by excitement over the tight outfits worn by his wife Carla Bruni .
Silvio Berlusconi is routinely laughed at in the press as an ageing Italian lothario , which takes away from the much more serious harm his rule does to his country 's economy and democracy .
Russia 's prime minister Vladimir Putin is seen ( with encouragement on his part ) as a ruthless tough guy .
Most other world leaders , even Germany 's Angela Merkel , lacking any easy definition , are largely ignored .
What Jacob Zuma makes of the reporting of his several marriages is unknown .
A tough politician , he has doled out as many insults in his time as he has taken .
Before leaving for Britain he told a South African paper that "" when the British came to our country they said everything we did was barbaric , was wrong , inferior in whatever way "" .
That is a reasonable point about an empire whose relics linger on in the imperial coaches and plumed hats dusted off before state visits .
The absurdity runs both ways in this affair ."

2010-03-07,"Why do they hate us ?
That was the question dominating South African headlines and radio phone - ins last week after British press coverage of both President Jacob Zuma 's state visit and the imminent football World Cup .
Leading the charge , like Michael Caine in red tunic and white pith helmet in the film Zulu , was journalist Stephen Robinson , whose critique of South Africa 's Zulu leader in the Daily Mail bore the headline : ""
Jacob Zuma is a sex - obsessed bigot with four wives and 35 children .
So why is Britain fawning over this vile buffoon ?
"" Robinson was not alone in interrogating Zuma 's polygamous lifestyle and recent love child , past brushes with corruption charges and the rest of what the Guardian delicately described as a "" colourful CV "" .
The stinging reports came with South Africans already sensitive about the way their country is being portrayed in Britain as it prepares to host the World Cup in June .
When the Sun and several other British papers recently reported on the state of England 's training camp in Rustenburg , the Times of South Africa ran a headline : "" English hacks raining on World Cup parade again .
"" It said : "" The English media have again been accused of sabotaging the World Cup with negative reporting – this time by slagging off their national team 's training base . ""
Radio talk shows in South Africa have speculated on the reasons for what they see as relentlessly negative coverage bordering on "" Afro - pessimism "" .
Butana Komphela , chairman of the national assembly 's sport committee , said : "" There are racist writings by journalists who are very malicious . ""
Could such reporting really be an overhang of colonialism propagated by modern - day Henry Morton Stanleys ?
Zuma suggested so when , in a departure from diplomatic protocol , he said : "" When the British came to our country , they said everything we are doing was barbaric , was wrong , inferior in whatever way . ""
The youth wing of Zuma 's governing party , the African National Congress , put it more baldly : "" British media seem to have developed a habit of rubbishing our president and constantly portray him as barbaric and of inferior belonging .
It is quite apparent that the British media is the one that is characterised and defined by the worst form of barbarism , backwardness and racism . ""
These British racists continue to live in a dreamland and sadly believe that Africans are still their colonial subjects , with no values and principles .
They believe that the only acceptable values and principles in the world are British values of whiteness and subjugation of Africans . ""
Such a critique might carry more weight if the British press did not also regularly eviscerate its own political leaders and organisers of its own forthcoming Olympic Games .
Nor is Zuma the target of British journalists alone .
He has plenty of acidic domestic critics , including the satirical cartoonist Zapiro , who has depicted him unbuckling his belt and poised to rape the blindfolded figure of lady justice .
The Daily Mail seems timid by comparison ."
2010-03-12,"People often say they are proud of their country , proud of their ancestors and all they achieved .
Presumably it also follows that you can be ashamed of your country and the sins of its fathers .
The longer I spend as a Briton living abroad , the more I 'm aware that Britain is nothing special , just another peculiar character in the global ensemble .
The longer I spend as a Briton living in Africa , the stronger grows my disquiet at the red , white and blue cloak that trails behind me .
The "" special relationship "" between Britain and South Africa , as Jacob Zuma somewhat lazily described it last week , was in the spotlight during the president 's state visit to chilly London .
It was a cultural collision that saw the Zulu polygamist shed his leopard skins for a white bow tie , as the Queen made him an honorary knight grand cross of the Order of the Bath .
Paying his diplomatic courtesies , Zuma told an audience : "" Though we may be a long way from South Africa , we feel very much at home here . ""
He noted Britain 's role in the struggle against white minority rule , providing refuge to Oliver Tambo , giving birth to the anti - apartheid movement and supporting the transition to democracy .
Zuma said Britain is South Africa 's biggest foreign investor and source of tourists .
He pointed out that statues of two former South African leaders stand in Parliament Square : General Jan Smuts and Nelson Mandela , the latter 's first name bestowed by a teacher who may have been a student of British naval history .
Zuma added : "" There are many South Africans of British descent .
The culture , language , institutions , practices and values of this nation have left a distinctive imprint on South African life .
"" It was a delicate way of putting it after the salty exchanges between Zuma and the British press .
Stephen Robinson 's assault in the Daily Mail bore the deathless headline : "" Jacob Zuma is a sex - obsessed bigot with four wives and 35 children .
So why is Britain fawning over this vile buffoon ? ""
Zuma hit back at Britain 's military imperialism of the past and continued cultural imperialism today , with its presumption of superiority over "" barbaric "" Africans .
This provoked Graham Boynton in the Daily Telegraph to suggest that Africans should be grateful for that legacy .
He wrote : "" The European colonials gave Africa efficient and comparatively honest civil services , a vision and a work ethic that saw the construction of road and rail networks , modern harbours and airports , and education systems based on European standards . ""
Enough is enough , said the South African press , rallying around the president .
A leader column in Business Day chided : "" Let us help you guys in Fleet Street with a little news .
Life in SA , even under Zuma , is , trust us , a lot better than in the UK .
Sure Zuma 's imperfect .
He may even be a lousy leader .
But he 's our lousy leader .
We 'll deal with him . ""
Jeremy Gordin , Zuma 's biographer , fumed in the Daily Dispatch that Robinson 's polemic "" bespeaks a racism and contempt that the English specialise in .
Basically , such a piece is saying that the man with the black skin , who hails from Africa , and who subscribes to a polygamous marital system , is a lesser breed ; he 's a sex - crazed buffoon .
"" Gordin went on : "" There 's not much funny about what Robinson has written and of course , its success lies in its appeal to the basic racism of the English about the laughable black men in Africa who sit under a tree , have many wives to till the fields for them , and never require Viagra .
"" My mind went back to my first days living in Africa when I toured Rorke 's Drift in KwaZulu - Natal .
There was the story of the disastrous British defeat by Zulu warriors at Isandlwana where , facing death so far from home , Colonel Anthony William Durnford exulted his surrounded men : "" Fix bayonets and die like British soldiers do . ""
Then came the heroic British defence of Rorke 's Drift .
What 's less well remembered is the Battle of Ulundi six months later , in which the British , reinforced with superior arms , crushed the Zulus and burned King Cetshwayo 's royal homestead to the ground .
I remember being told of the sadness in the eyes of old Zulu warriors as they witnessed the end of their once proud nation . ""

The Anglo - Boer war is unforgotten too in monuments I 've seen and people I 've met .
In a pub decorated with hunting trophies near the Vaal river , an Afrikaner called Reichardt Piek asked me : "" Who invented concentration camps ?
"" I replied "" Lord Kitchener "" , although this is disputed . ""
That 's right , "" he said .
"" How many people died there ?
"" It was around 28,000 , mainly women and children whose houses had been burned in the British army 's scorched earth policy , in response to the Boers ' guerrilla warfare .
About 20,000 black people also died in the poorly - run , disease - ridden camps .
Citing companies such as Anglo American mining group and SABMiller brewer , both founded in South Africa but now headquartered in London , Piek told me : "" South Africa is still a British colony .
The black regime here is corrupt because they know capitalism .
Bribery and corruption have always been here –
it 's an invention from Britain . ""
In Harare , Zimbabwe , I 've stood at state events where President Robert Mugabe berated "" the British , the British , the British "" , for the killings , theft of land and colonial degradations visited on the former Rhodesia .
In Livingstone , Zambia , I 've looked at museum displays of the joy on independence day , when the yoke of British imperialism was overthrown .
The voices of Afrikaner nationalists and Mugabe come loaded with crippling baggage of their own .
Yet to live outside Britain is to experience the dawning realisation that much of the world does n't owe you a thing .
In fact , that world is often more gracious and welcoming than the children of Victoria deserve .
Yes , my country helped save the world from fascism , but it also helped send millions of Africans into slavery .

2010-03-15,"A prominent South African politician has been convicted of hate speech after claiming that the woman who accused President Jacob Zuma of rape had a "" nice time "" because she stayed for breakfast and asked for taxi money .
Julius Malema , the leader of the African National Congress youth league , was ordered to make an unconditional public apology and pay 50,000 rand ( £ 4,500 ) to a shelter for abused women .
Malema , 29 , is a hugely divisive figure in South Africa .
Though he does not hold public office , he attracts far more media attention than most cabinet ministers , and has been touted as a possible future president .
Zuma was acquitted of rape in 2006 after he insisted the sex with his accuser was consensual .
He went on to become president last year .
Malema , an influential Zuma ally , made reference to the case at a gathering of students last year .
According to court papers , he said : "" When a woman did n't enjoy it , she leaves early in the morning .
Those who had a nice time will wait until the sun comes out , request breakfast and ask for taxi money . ""
A gender justice group said this statement was insensitive to those who had been victims of rape and would perpetrate rape myths .
Sonke Gender Justice took Malema to the Johannesburg equality court , which ruled today that he was guilty of hate speech and harassment .
Magistrate Colleen Collis said : "" This court is satisfied that the utterances by the respondent … amounted to hate speech .
It clearly demeans and humiliates women …
The uttered words constitute harassment as contemplated in the equality act . ""
Collis concluded her judgment : "" Mr Malema , being a man of vast political influence , be wary of turning into a man that often speaks but never talks . ""
Mbuyiselo Botha of Sonke Gender Justice welcomed the decision . ""
This case makes it clear that our country 's leaders need to be more responsible in their public statements and that civil society can and will hold them accountable , "" he said .
"" We hope that this ruling will alert public figures to the potential repercussions of their words , both in terms of the impact that public statements can have in perpetuating gender - based violence and other forms of discrimination , and in terms of the legal implications . ""
A handful of Sonke supporters celebrated outside the court , carrying placards that stated "" Only one in 20 rapes are reported "" and singing "" Malema is a Mickey Mouse "" .
Malema , who was not present in court , said he would appeal .
The verdict was welcomed by the opposition Democratic Alliance .
Its national youth spokesman , Khume Ramulifho , said of the remarks : "" It showed Malema 's disgraceful , sexist attitude , and he still continues to promote sexism and hate towards women .
"" It is time the ANC took action and brought Malema to book .
Malema , for his part , should unconditionally apologise for the damage he is causing . ""
Phillip Dexter , a spokesman for the Congress of the People , added : "" His comments were an insult to women everywhere .
Such irresponsible utterances show the inherent chauvinism , misogyny and muddled thinking that inform Julius Malema 's rationale .
"" We live in a country where violence against women is still a massive problem .
As an individual that President Zuma saw fit to pronounce as ' worthy of inheriting the ANC ' , this ruling reflects poorly on the judgment of the president of the republic as well . ""
Malema is notorious for his incendiary personal statements .
He recently said of rival politician Patricia de Lille : "" Patricia does n't look like a married woman .
There 's no normal man who can marry Patricia .
If Patricia has got a husband , that husband must divorce Patricia and come and look for well - mannered and beautiful women in the ANC . ""
He has described the Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille as a "" racist little girl "" and said recently that she was "" suffering from satanism "" .
Malema was again accused of hate speech last week after he led college students in singing the protest song "" Shoot the boere , they are rapists . ""
Boere translates as farmers in Afrikaans , the language of white South African descendants of the early Dutch settlers .
Afrikaners and others accused Malema of inciting violence against whites , but the ANC said the song is symbolic of the anti - apartheid struggle .
In recent days Malema has also faced embarrassing media revelations over his financial affairs and lavish lifestyle .
He retaliated by accusing journalists of a smear campaign : "" We know [ that ] some of you here [ and ] the people you are sleeping with , unethical journalists sleeping with politicians for you to get information . ""
The City Press newspaper reported that the ANC youth league had issued a four - page document to media houses that appeared to be an intelligence report on one of its journalists , including personal banking details and the names of his children .
The youth league was instrumental in bringing Zuma to power last year and remains an influential powerbroker in the ANC ."
2010-03-17,"A bitter row has erupted in South Africa after it emerged that taxpayers are spending more than 15.5 m rand ( £ 1.3 m ) a year to support President Jacob Zuma 's three wives and some of his 20 children .
The figure , almost double the presidential spousal budget a year ago , was condemned as "" exorbitant "" by the opposition leader , Helen Zille , who claimed the size of Zuma 's family "" makes corruption almost inevitable "" .
This prompted a sharp riposte from the governing African National Congress , which accused Zille , who is white , of "" cultural intolerance "" .
Zuma , 68 , is a member of the Zulu tribe , in which polygamy is a traditional practice .
In a written answer to a parliamentary question on Tuesday , Collins Chabane , a minister charged with monitoring government performance , said the state had a 15.5 m rand budget for Zuma 's family this year .
This compares with the spousal support office budget of 4.5 m rand in 2005/06 and 8 m rand in 2008/09 .
The spousal office paid for personal support staff , such as secretaries and researchers , as well as domestic and international air travel and accommodation , Chabane said .
Mobile phones for spouses and their secretaries , laptops and printers and a special daily allowance for "" incidental "" expenses were also covered .
"" The state provides all reasonable administrative , logistical and other support to the spouses to enable them to meet these responsibilities in a manner that permits them actively to pursue their own careers and interests if they so desire , "" he said .
Mrs Thobeka Zuma was engaged in community work related to health , Mrs Sizakele Zuma was dealing with agriculture and food security , while Mrs Nompumelelo Zuma was working with orphans and vulnerable children , he added .
Chabane said that , collectively , Zuma 's children are entitled to 60 domestic economy - class flights a year to visit their parents .
Tickets beyond this are paid for by Zuma .
The revelations prompted swift criticism from Zille , leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance .
"" It is impossible for anyone , even on a president 's salary , to look after a family of the size of Zuma 's without relying extensively on private benefactors and the taxpayers ' money , "" she said .
"" This makes corruption almost inevitable . ""
The office of the ANC 's chief whip issued a response saying that Zille 's attack is distasteful and demonstrates cultural intolerance of the worst type .
It continued : "" A large family , according to Zille , ' makes corruption almost inevitable ' .
This kind of condescending attitude has no place in a democratic South Africa .
"" Those who have been making a lot of noise about the cost to the state of the president 's family are guilty of cultural chauvinism .
They find themselves at odds with the South African constitution , which guarantees the right of all South Africans to express their beliefs , practice their culture and speak their language .
The state has no business discriminating against anyone , including the president , for doing so . ""
Zuma 's lifestyle has been under scrutiny after it emerged that he had fathered his 20th child out of wedlock and was several months late in declaring his financial interests ."
2010-04-04,"A white supremacist group in South Africa today vowed to exact revenge for the death of their leader as the country 's president , Jacob Zuma , sought to calm growing racial tensions .
Eugene Terre'Blanche , leader of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging ( AWB ) movement , was found bludgeoned and hacked to death on Saturday at his farm in Ventersdorp .
Two black farm workers involved in an apparent wage dispute were arrested at the scene .
The AWB has since ramped up the language of a race war .
Its spokesman , Andre Visagie , said : "" The death of Mr Terre'Blanche is a declaration of war by the black community of South Africa to the white community that has been killed for 10 years on end . ""
Visagie warned other countries to avoid sending their football teams to the World Cup in June as they would be travelling "" to a land of murder "" .
He added : "" We will decide upon the action we are going to take to avenge Mr Terre'Blanche 's death . ""
The AWB accused Julius Malema , leader of the youth wing of the ANC , of having blood on his hands .
It blamed the killing on the recent apartheid - era protest song proclaiming the words "" shoot the boer "" .
Malema expressed fear that his life was at risk , citing a rightwing conspiracy .
Last week the ANC said it was concerned about a text message in circulation which appeared to offer a bounty for his death .
The ANC has defended the song as no more than a way to remember a history of oppression , but a party spokesman told the Guardian it would now re - examine the issue in the light of recent criticism .
Today at Ventersdorp , in South Africa 's North West Province , AWB followers clad in paramilitary khaki laid flowers at the gate of Terre'Blanche 's farm .
South Africa 's Sunday Times reported that the 69-year - old was killed by two farm workers who claimed that he refused to pay them their monthly salaries of 350 rand ( £ 32 ) each .
The workers , aged 21 and 15 , reportedly smashed a window to enter Terre'Blanche 's home and killed him with a knobkerrie ( wooden club ) and a panga ( broad - bladed knife ) .
A police source told the Sunday Times the pair alleged Terre'Blanche had threatened to kill them when they went to his farm for their money . ""
They claim they killed him in self defence , "" the officer said .
The men , who were said to have waited for police to arrive and arrest them , are due to appear in court on Tuesday .
The killing sparked fierce debate on race relations in a country where white farmers have become increasingly vocal , claiming thousands of them have been murdered since the end of white minority rule in 1994 .
Last month former president F W De Klerk wrote to Zuma warning that Malema was creating an increasingly febrile mood .
He said : "" All this is beginning to create a volatile atmosphere in which any additional intemperate statement or action might spark an unfortunate incident . ""
Frans Cronje , deputy director of the South African Institute of Race Relations , said : "" It could be an explosive case , especially if the ANC do n't back down . ""
Zuma appealed for calm following the "" terrible deed "" .
In a statement he asked South Africans not to allow "" agent provocateurs "" to take advantage of the situation by "" inciting or fuelling racial hatred "" .
Jackson Mthembu , an ANC spokesman , also denied any causal link between the "" shoot the boer "" song and the murder of Terre'Blanche .
But he also appeared to shift the party 's position : "" The ANC is prepared to look at whether it is appropriate to continue singing it in this manner .
We will … look at what we can do . ""
The opposition Democratic Alliance warned of a risk of polarisation with a dangerous outcome .
Its leader , Helen Zille , said : "" The murder of Eugene Terre'Blanche will inevitably polarise and inflame passions in South Africa at a time when tensions are already running high …
This could have tragic consequences and it is essential that all leaders stand together now and call for calm . ""
Terre'Blanche had threatened war on South Africa 's white minority government in the 1980s when it began to make what he considered dangerous concessions that endangered South Africa 's white race .
Described yesterday as a bully and buffoon , his predictions of doom under a multiracial democracy proved hollow and his support dwindled to a tiny rump . ""
He was a has - been personality , "" said Allister Sparks , a veteran political analyst .
"" His influence is absolutely minimal .
I regarded him as one of the most remarkably powerful orators I 've ever heard .
He spoke with a great passion and could really move people , but that was before 1994 when he was trying to mount his rather crazy resistance campaign . ""
Songs of protest Many songs in South Africa refer to the armed struggle against apartheid .
During last year 's election campaign Jacob Zuma sang Umshini Wami ( Bring Me My Machine Gun ) .
The song Ayasab ' Amagwala ( The Cowards are Scared ) rose from the conflict between exiled African National Congress guerrillas and white farmers defending the land .
Allister Sparks , a veteran political analyst and journalist , said : "" Initially the armed struggle was supposed to be aimed only at installations .
Then it extended somewhat .
One of the expansions was when farmers formed civilian militia units that were used to patrol the borders , so in the ANC 's eyes they became active soldiers , not civilians .
"" There were some landmine attacks on farm roads and some farmers were killed along the borders of Botswana and Zimbabwe .
I remember going to the funeral of one whose entire family was wiped out by a landmine . ""
That 's where this song arose and some farmers were killed . ""
The song raised controversy in 2002 when a crowd chanted "" kill the boer , kill the farmer "" , at the funeral of Peter Mokaba , an ANC Youth League leader .
It became contentious again when Julius Malema led a rendition .
Its lyrics include : aw dubul'ibhunu ( shoot the boer ) dubula dubula ( shoot shoot ) .

2010-04-16,"It was shortly after Aaron Mokoena had met the Queen at Buckingham Palace last month that Jacob Zuma , South Africa 's president , felt the need to reinforce the introduction . ""
The president pulled me to the Queen , "" Mokoena recalls , with a smile , "" and he said to her : ' You 've got to know this man because he is the one who will make sure that South Africa wins the World Cup .
He is the captain of the country . '
It was really fun . ""
The moment , during Zuma 's state visit to the UK last month , was one of those when you wished you were there .
Wayne Rooney , Fabio Capello , Elizabeth II - your boys are going to take one hell of a beating .
What did Her Majesty make of it all ? ""
Well , the thing is she is well informed , "" Mokoena says .
"" She obviously knew that the finals were in South Africa and she also knew who I was .
But not to such an extent so the president had to make a point .
"" Zuma was not joking . ""
When Zuma was here for his visit , I had the opportunity to sit down with him a couple of times and have a discussion , "" Mokoena says .
"" He just got straight to the point
and he said to me that you have to make sure we win .
He loves football so much .
I did n't know
but he 's a Liverpool fan
and he used to play football himself .
He used to be a captain of a team in the prison with Nelson Mandela on Robben Island .
But that 's exactly what he said to me : ' You 've got to make sure that the country wins . '
"" South Africa have qualified for only two previous World Cups and they have won no more than a solitary group tie .
If history is against them , then so too is recent form .
They failed to reach January 's Africa Cup of Nations , for the first time since 1994 , and , of their 10 matches this season , they have won only two – against Madagascar ( ranked 154th in the world ) and Zimbabwe ( 113rd ) .
South Africa , who have been drawn with France , Mexico and Uruguay in the group stage , are ranked 88th .
Only North Korea ( 105th ) take a lower ranking to the finals .
But Mokoena refuses to consider anything impossible and why should he , after the manner in which his Portsmouth team have diced with winding - up threats this season only to reach the FA Cup final ?
It was Mokoena 's 120th - minute winner in the third - round replay at Coventry that got the fairytale started and his outstanding performance in the semi - final upset of Tottenham that helped to carry them into next month 's showpiece with Chelsea .
"" It 's been a fantastic run for us and especially lately , because we know that it 's the only thing we had after our points deduction and relegation from the Premier League , "" he says .
"" We need the FA Cup more than anything and there 's absolutely a parallel between Portsmouth and South Africa .
It 's exactly the same .
We need the FA Cup more than anything and South Africa need this World Cup more than anything .
Hopefully , we can do as well in the World Cup as we have done at Portsmouth in the FA Cup . ""
The longer you listen to Mokoena , the more convincing his arguments sound .
It is not a surprise to discover that he wanted to be a lawyer when he was younger , only for football to come calling , or that he intends to apply to law school once he has hung up his boots .
Mokoena , South Africa 's most capped player , says that his squad boasts a wealth of talented youngsters , who are hungry to make their names and possibly secure transfers to Europe .
They have recently returned from a four - week training camp in Brazil , in which they enjoyed encouraging friendly results against opposition that included Santos .
Then , there is the coach , Carlos Parreira , the Brazilian who led his nation to glory at the 1994 finals .
His experience is vast .
He has also taken Kuwait , the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia to World Cups .
Above all , however , is Bafana Bafana 's 12th man .
With their blaring vuvuzelas and mounting excitement , the home South African crowd is champing at the bit to play its part .
"" We saw what happened at the 2002 finals with South Korea , "" says Mokoena , of the co - hosts who reached the semi - finals , "" and it can definitely be the same story with us .
"" We experienced it last summer when we had the Confederations Cup in South Africa
and I am sure that the atmosphere will be even hotter at the World Cup .
People are so over the moon to have the World Cup and we are going to show how much it means to us .
The Confederations Cup , when we reached the semi - finals , was a good rehearsal and it 's absolutely possible that we can do well at the World Cup .
"" I think it 's good to be underdogs .
I said before the Confederations Cup not to write South Africa off
and we surprised people then .
I 'm going to say exactly the same thing again .
Do n't write off Bafana
Bafana before we 've even kicked a ball . ""
The responsibility on Mokoena 's shoulders at the African continent 's first World Cup will be huge but , in a sense , events at club level have prepared him well .
The 29-year - old only joined Portsmouth from Blackburn Rovers last summer
but , such has been the emotional intensity of the week - to - week ride , it feels to him as though he has been there a lifetime .
"" I must say it 's been tough , "" Mokoena says , reflecting on Portsmouth 's ownership changes and slump into administration . ""
But in the semi - final against Tottenham , we showed what character we have .
I 'm sure a lot of people elsewhere would n't have coped with the situation that we 've had .
The important thing is that there is nothing impossible in life .
Do you want to take the easy way out or do you really want to fight it through ? ""
Mokoena has always had a steely side , from his formative days in the township of Boipatong near Vanderbijlpark , the site of a massacre in June 1992 when Inkatha party members , aided by the police , swept in by night to kill more than 40 people , including pregnant women and children .
"" I remember I was on my way to school and people were coming back crying and that 's when we heard , "" he says .
"" People were murdered at night .
It was awful .
After the massacre , there were a lot of rumours saying that these people wanted to kill the young boys .
So my mum had to protect me in any way
and she decided to dress me as a girl .
She also took me to this community hall where there was enough protection for people from the township , especially the boys .
"" It was n't an easy upbringing .
It was a township and in townships anything is possible .
My brothers and sisters really experienced apartheid while crime - wise it was absolutely bad
but I always had the support and protection of my family . ""
Mokoena also had his studies .
"" I was an academic boy , "" he says .
"" I was into mathematics and I loved science .
I wanted to study further but , because of football , I could n't do what I wanted to do . ""
His passion for education has seen him lend his support to the 1GOAL initiative , which aims to get all children into school . ""
The thing that encouraged me was that there are so many kids who do n't get the chance to go to school , "" he says .
"" We are talking about 72 million kids worldwide who do n't get the chance .
"" I chatted at length to President Zuma about 1GOAL .
He is absolutely into education and in South Africa a quarter of the budget goes to education .
That shows the president is trying to give younger people the chance to have a better life .
Apartheid jeopardised the opportunity for kids in South Africa to be educated and he is trying to change that .
It is one thing he wants to leave as his legacy . ""
Zuma has a different demand of Mokoena .
The FA Cup final is merely the warm - up .

2010-05-15,"In 1994 , the world watched South Africa going to the polls .
Queues snaked the breadth of the land as young and old , black and white , masters and domestics cast their votes in their country 's first democratic election .
A nation that , as Nelson Mandela said in his inauguration speech , had once been the skunk of the world was suddenly smelling very sweet .
A horrible war had been averted .
Negotiations had led to peace .
In 2004 , I was with my sisters in Mozambique to commemorate those fighters of the ANC 's army , Umkhonto we Sizwe ( MK for short ) , who had been killed in the Matola raid .
Matola , a suburb of Maputo , was the base for a group of young , black South Africans , many under the command of our father , Joe Slovo , then MK 's chief of staff .
He ran a special unit and the Matola men were his elite .
His hopes for the future .
Sixteen were killed after a blacked - up unit of South African military illegally crossed into Mozambique and massacred them .
Our shared pasts had ensured the Matola dead a special place in our hearts .
But there was another reason why we were there .
A year after Matola , in 1982 , our mother , Ruth First , then living in Maputo , was killed by a letter bomb sent to her by the South African police .
She was buried beside the Matola victims .
I stood with my sisters , relatives of the Matola dead and former members of MK during the graveside ceremony .
A laying of wreaths , a tune by a Mozambican military band and then our cavalcade was away to church .
It had been a strange few days .
The high commissioner , a Christian , had placed religion at the centre of the commemoration .
Meanwhile , traditional healers from South Africa had joined their Mozambican counterparts to cleanse the graves spiritually .
An undercurrent of difficulty , reflective of contradictory impulses in the new South Africa , seemed to flow between these two camps and their different ways of claiming history .
Who knows what Ruth , an atheist and sceptic to her very core , would have made of either .
Maputo 's cathedral was the venue for the event and there were bishops , archbishops , choirs , biblical readings , hymns and speeches :
what there was n't much of was who the Matola dead had been and what they stood for .
Until Jacob Zuma stepped up .
The rainbow days of Mandela 's presidency were done .
In his place had stepped Thabo Mbeki , whose talk of an African renaissance sat uneasily with his opinions and inaction on Aids .
Zuma was Mbeki 's deputy but , with allegations of corruption swirling round , his position was insecure .
Yet it was his speech that galvanised the congregation and gave meaning to the event .
Zuma had worked in the Maputo underground .
The dead had been his comrades , colleagues , friends .
He spoke of them not as innocent victims , but as fighters .
He spoke of the way he had run to Matola to witness the devastation .
And then he began to sing the freedom songs that had sustained the anti - apartheid struggle .
Here , at last , was the past as we remembered it , and Zuma put sound to it on our behalf .
Fast forward to the present .
Zuma , having survived allegations of rape and corruption , used his same melodic voice to defeat Mbeki in the contest for the ANC presidency before becoming president of the country .
With his many wives and children , Zuma seems to eschew the modernity that made Mbeki a favourite in the west .
To outsiders he can appear too "" other "" – the strange , dark pulse of Africa .
But though many in the west may be uncomfortable with his machine - gun toting rhetoric , it is he who is to preside over the World Cup and who led the recent state visit to Britain .
When Zuma came to London , his delegation was so large , and his fans so numerous , that the reception was held not in the High Ccommission but in the Dorchester hotel .
Mandela 's first trip to London had as its high point a speech in Trafalgar Square .
We live now in different times .
The throngs that graced the Dorchester were mainly businessmen , the new wealthy that the new South Africa had helped create .
A fat cat delegation whose conspicuous consumption sits awkwardly among the poverty of South Africa .
And Zuma 's speech was not nostalgia for a heroic past but praise for the glories of the football to come .
Mandela 's visit had been a testimony to courage ; Zuma , the man who in Maputo had claimed this past , was here to inaugurate a brand .
Thus does history move on .
In a world where politicians are increasingly distrusted , South Africa is no longer the exception .
The ANC also can be seduced into thinking that marketing and PR can replace solutions to intractable problems .
And why not ?
Its past was written with pain ; the country also has the right to be ordinary .
Yet I ca n't help feeling that , in making the transition , something profound has been lost .

2010-05-21,"A fortnight after the volcano cloud put paid to their planned appearance as guests of honour at this year 's London Book Fair , the cream of South Africa 's writers regrouped at the small town of Franschhoek in the Western Cape for a weekend of heated exchanges on everything from their country 's World Cup chances to the rhetoric of their president , Jacob Zuma .
Among their number was the ANC veteran Kader Asmal , who was due in London to promote his long - awaited memoirs , which will be published in South Africa in October .
At Franschhoek , the former cabinet minister shared a platform with a newspaper cartoonist who once famously portrayed him as Jiminy Cricket – "" the conscience of the ANC "" .
Now 75 , Asmal proved that , though ever the optimist , he is no pushover .
Asked to explain why he did n't challenge the ANC , while still a minister , on its refusal to acknowledge the extent of the Aids crisis or to condemn Robert Mugabe , he said : "" When I was a minister , I had to weigh up decisions in relation to how effective I could be in my own portfolio .
After I stopped being a minister , I took an AIDS test and railed against the government 's stand on Zimbabwe within a month . ""
His former adversaries within the ANC may have most to fear from his memoirs but , as Asmal points out , his story is international .
"" Everyone wants to know what happened in South Africa since 1990 , but for 27 years of my life I was in Ireland , and that 's where a great deal of my life in the ANC took place .
We formed the boycott movement and led the cultural boycott .
The great Irish trilogy of writers – O'Casey , Heaney and Beckett – enthusiastically joined the movement . ""
After 27 years we thought we 'd die happy in Dublin , but then in 1987 we came to a special conference of the National Executive of the ANC , at which the ANC said there were no secret negotiations ( with the apartheid government ) .
As the writer Claud Cockburn once wrote : ' Never believe anything until it 's officially denied . '
I said to my wife , ' Since it 's been denied it 's clearly happening .
We 're going home . '
It took three years and I got home in 1990 .
"" The rest is history – but as Asmal is fond of saying , quoting his old friend Seamus Heaney , "" sometimes , hope and history can rhyme "" ."
2010-06-23,"Aaron Mokoena has said that the legacy of World Cup 2010 must go beyond racial unity and show that South Africa is a serious player on the global stage .
In sporting terms , the national captain said , the country must now get behind its football clubs with the same fervour and in the same numbers as it has done with Bafana
Bafana over the past two and a half weeks .
South Africa 's president , Jacob Zuma , has promised that his government will invest in football 's grassroots in an attempt to build on the success of the World Cup .
But Mokoena , mindful perhaps that some of Japan 's and South Korea 's World Cup 2002 stadiums are lying empty and losing money , feel that his countrymen have to rally behind their own league .
"" We have one of the wealthy leagues here in South Africa but it 's important that the nation gives the same support to it as they have done to Bafana Bafana , "" Mokoena said .
"" This World Cup has to leave a positive legacy and that 's part of it .
Hopefully that will happen .
"" Development is absolutely important , and that 's what the president has emphasised as well , that we have to really make sure that we pump in the money for development .
It 's good that the president is aware of this .
It 's important . ""
Bafana Bafana bowed out of the tournament on Tuesday despite a famous 2 - 1 victory over France at the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein .
Mexico edged through from Group A ahead of them on goal difference , but the feelgood factor from the performance and result rippled across the nation .
"" It 's incredible , we have absolutely pulled people together , [ from ] different races and that means a lot , "" said Mokoena .
"" That 's what this World Cup had to do .
It 's not only football .
I always said that this World Cup was going to give the opportunity to South Africa as a whole to showcase what we have in the country and pull people together .
Now the world knows what South Africa is all about .
South Africa had to be on the map and South Africa is on the map .
"" It was a mixed feeling for us after the France game because we really wanted to go through .
We had an incredible chance to make it happen , we created enough chances
but , unfortunately , we could n't convert .
But I 'm not sad ; disappointed , yes , but there are so many positives that we can take from this . """
2010-06-29,"King Albert II of Belgium will today join African leaders including Jacob Zuma and Robert Mugabe at a ceremony in Kinshasa to mark the 50th anniversary of Congo 's independence .
The capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has received a facelift for today 's military parade , but the anniversary has triggered a rancorous debate about the colonial record of Belgium , where a campaign is under way to prosecute ageing civil servants over the 1961 murder of a Congolese independence hero .
Thousands of Congolese lined the streets to cheer the arrival of "" their "" king on Monday night , according to Le Soir , Belgium 's bestselling Francophone daily , which refigured its masthead from blue to leopard print and renamed itself Le Soir de Kinshasa for a day .
The Belgian monarch will not be making speeches while in Congo , however .
He is keen to avoid any echo of his brother 's notorious farewell speech in 1960 , in which he saluted the "" genius "" of Belgium 's colonialism .
The Belgian government is also anxious that the visit should not be seen as endorsing Congo 's poor human rights record under President Joseph Kabila .
Meanwhile , a team of Belgian , American and German lawyers is preparing to file criminal complaints relating to the assassination in January 1961 of Patrice Lumumba , Congo 's first post - independence prime minister .
The legal team is targeting 12 former civil servants who worked in the Belgian colonial administration .
Led by Christophe Marchand , the lawyers represent Lumumba 's three sons and are basing their case on a Belgian parliamentary investigation in 2001 into the country 's involvement in the assassination . ""
The parliamentary commission found that Belgium was morally responsible but not legally responsible , "" Marchand said .
"" We analysed the documents , the facts established by the commission , and found there were international legal consequences . ""
The events of 1960 - 61 occurred at a time of international armed conflict .
This means there is no statute of limitations , as these constitute war crimes .
"" The complaint will be filed in October against individuals Marchand declines to name and who are now in their 80s and 90s . ""
It 's going to be a hard case , for sure .
The defence will be very tough , "" Marchand said .
"" The descendants of Belgians in Congo want to avoid trials at all cost .
They will argue that this is not the right jurisdiction , that the statute of limitations does apply , and that this does not count as an international conflict .
And there is still a strong taboo in Belgium about discussing this subject . ""
Researchers believe that around half the population was killed in the Belgian colony of the Congo Free State – in effect , the personal property of Leopold .
Louis Michel , Belgium 's liberal ex - foreign minister and until last year the EU 's development commissioner , caused controversy last week by declaring Leopold II "" a true visionary for his time , a hero "" , and a man who "" brought civilisation "" .
Michel , now an MEP , said : "" The Belgians built railways , schools and hospitals and boosted economic growth .
Yes , "" he said , "" maybe colonisation was domineering , but at a certain moment , it brought civilisation . ""
Adam Hochschild , author of King Leopold 's Ghosts , about the Belgian Congo , said that sections of Belgian society were still unwilling to address the past : "" Leopold 's aim was quite open : to extract as much wealth from the territory as he could .
In today 's money , this amounted to $ 1bn in profit over 23 years .
He did so by putting much of the male population under forced labour .
Between 8 and 10 million Congolese died . ""
Leopold pioneered particularly brutal forms of forced labour for rubber extraction .
To make sure the Congolese men did not run off , the Belgians held their women hostage until they came back . ""
The men were worked to death and the women raped and starved .
Quite how this can be hailed as the delivery of progress and civilisation is a mystery to me , "" said Hochschild .
Belgium still boasts a Royal Belgian Overseas Union which aims "" to restore the image of the Belgian colonial period , and to combat all libel and disinformation against the Belgian colonial era.""In the Matonge quarter of Brussels , home to Belgium 's many Congolese immigrants , posters denounce the royal visit and Belgian "" neocolonialism "" .
At the Bana Congo barber 's , Masudi Serge said the royal visit was unwanted .
"" We are not happy , not happy at all .
Leopold was a Hitler .
There have never been any real inquiries here , any trials .
How can we be happy when they are still profiting from Congo ? """
2010-07-30,"Nearly half of South Africa 's traditional monarchies are to be abolished in a government move to bury another legacy of the apartheid era .
Some of the kings were originally appointed by the white minority government with few legitimate claims to their thrones , a report found .
They were part of a divide and rule strategy to undermine opposition to the apartheid regime , said Jacob Zuma , the South African president .
Zuma announced that six out of 13 monarchies would be derecognised to correct "" the wrongs of the past "" and defuse tensions among rival leaders .
He stressed that no one would be accused of being an apartheid collaborator .
South Africa is a constitutional democracy and its traditional monarchs are symbolic figureheads with little political power , although they still preside over hearings to resolve tribal disputes .
The National House of Traditional Leaders advises parliament on issues of customary law .
Seven of South Africa 's 13 kingships were approved after a six - year study by the Commission on Traditional Leadership Disputes and Claims .
The other six will end when the incumbent ruler dies , with their successors becoming lower - ranking leaders .
"" The apartheid regime created its own traditional leadership at the expense of authentic leadership in some communities , "" Zuma said .
"" It was how those in charge divided and disunited people . ""
We urge all communities to accept the findings in the spirit of correcting the wrongs of the past , and as part of the country 's nation - building efforts .
"" The move will also mean savings for the South African taxpayer because each monarchy is subsidised by the government .
Zuma added : "" The finding must help all affected communities to begin the path of acceptance , healing and reconciliation .
"" We have always been able to find ways of resolving issues , and of accepting even the most difficult of solutions for the good of the country .
We must face the truth , even if it is uncomfortable , and move forward . ""
But leaders of the six kingships affected by the move have said they will challenge their demotion in court .
One political analyst , who did not wish to be named , said : "" Whatever the circumstances of their appointment , some of the leaders have come to think of themselves as royalty and wo n't go quietly .
In some contexts , there is a risk of violence between rival groups . ""
But Steven Friedman , director of the Centre for the Study of Democracy , described the threat of violence as "" implausible "" .
He added : "" There will be quibbles over which monarchies were legitimate and which were n't , but there was a great deal of manipulation under apartheid of traditional institutions .
The decisions look pretty expected and sensible . ""
The leaders of South Africa 's two biggest tribal groups , the Zulus and Xhosas , will not be affected .
Zulu king Goodwill Zwelithini , who has six wives , demonstrated his influence recently by launching a campaign to the revive the custom of male circumcision as a means of combating HIV/ Aids .
Another king to survive the cull is Buyelekhaya Zwelibanzi Dalindyebo of the AbaThembu clan , who has urged about half the nation , including Johannesburg , to secede from South Africa .
This was after he was sentenced to 15 years in prison last year for charges including culpable homicide , arson and assault .
Khosi Fhumulani Kutama , chairman of the National House of Traditional Leaders , said he would attempt to persuade the affected monarchs of the merits of the decision .
"" We have been waiting for this decision for a long time , "" he told South Africa 's Mercury newspaper .
"" It will help us build our democracy .
It is important that people accept it not only for the institution of traditional leadership but for the whole country . """
2010-08-12,"A killing spree by security guards has left at least four people dead at a South African gold mine owned by relatives of Nelson Mandela and President Jacob Zuma .
Mining firm
Aurora confirmed that four illegal miners were killed and a number of others shot and wounded .
A newspaper reported that as many as 20 miners might have been murdered in the underground shaft .
Police have recovered four bodies .
The governing African National Congress condemned "" in the strongest terms the senseless killing of illegal miners "" .
The Aurora mine east of Johannesburg is owned by Zuma 's nephew , Khulubuse Zuma , and Mandela 's grandson , Zondwa Mandela .
The two are embroiled in a pay dispute with workers they inherited from several mines they bought from an insolvent company .
Police warrant officer Jannie van Aswegen said : "" There 's now four bodies that have been retrieved from the shaft . ""
He added that police had found out about the shooting from the Sowetan newspaper .
The Sowetan quoted one man , 25-year - old Sam Sithole , as saying he went down a shaft on Monday with a group of miners that included two of his brothers and encountered three guards .
He said he heard one of the three giving an order to "" shoot everyone "" .
"" People started running all over when the first men fell , "" Sithole told the Sowetan .
"" I jumped over the body of one of my brothers as I fled . ""
He said he later pretended to be dead . ""
The killers left me only because they thought I was dead , "" he added .
Thulane Ngubane of Aurora said the incident happened a day after a security guard was killed and another kidnapped by the illegal miners .
Jackson Mthembu , a spokesman for the ANC , said : "" The mine management and the responsible security company should have sought the assistance of the South African police on suspicion of crime being committed in their mine , rather than shooting at first instance .
"" We appeal to our law enforcement agencies to investigate this matter with the urgency it deserves . ""
South Africa 's National Union of Mineworkers called for an investigation and said "" anyone guilty of unprovoked shooting should be charged , tried and punished "" .
Patrick Craven , a spokesman for the Congress of South African Trade Unions , backed the union 's call .
He added : "" We do not condone illegal mining , but even if the people killed were involved in illegal mining that in no way justifies the brutal response allegedly meted out by the security guards .
[ People involved in illegal mining ] have the same constitutional right as every other citizen to a fair trial and appropriate sentence . ""
South Africa is one of the world 's largest gold producers and has some of the world 's deepest mines .
Illegal mining is common , as are deaths due to fires and other accidents in abandoned , unsafe shafts .
Over the past seven months workers at the Aurora mine have complained of poor living conditions , having pay withheld , and a lack of water and electricity .
Many migrants from African states are ready to risk their lives to prospect for gold deposits in abandoned , and sometimes unsafe , mines .
Last year more than 80 prospectors were found dead in one of the country 's abandoned gold mines .
Police say illegal miners , or zama zamas , are hired by organised crime rackets ."
2010-08-26,"South Africa 's president , Jacob Zuma , is today facing one of the biggest tests of his presidency as tens of thousands of striking workers took to the streets and relations with his union backers neared breaking point .
There were demands for Zuma , who was thousands of miles away at the World Expo in Shanghai during a state visit to China , to return home as cities were paralysed by marching public sector workers .
The Congress of South African Trade Unions ( Cosatu ) warned that its historic alliance with Zuma 's governing African National Congress ( ANC ) had reached a critical low .
Zwelinzima Vavi , secretary general of Cosatu , said government corruption had derailed the alliance 's agenda . ""
The emergence of a ' new tendency ' focused on taking over the ANC and using access to the state for a selfish accumulation agenda disrupted the emerging unity of purpose , which has led to a paralysis in both the alliance and government , "" he said .
"" The alliance is unable to convene an alliance summit for fear of an implosion as a result of fundamental differences on the question of where the power lies . ""
Vavi condemned a lack of decisive leadership .
"" The alliance is again dysfunctional ; the centre can not hold , "" he said .
Cosatu 's role as potential kingmaker was evident in 2007 when , having lost patience with the then president , Thabo Mbeki , it threw its weight behind Zuma .
Some critics say that Zuma 's promises to the labour movement and others are now coming home to roost .
Vavi recently told an angry crowd demonstrating over low pay that Zuma earns more than R2.2 m ( £ 193,000 ) a year . ""
He has blood like we have blood , "" he said .
"" He has a big family like we do .
He has children to feed like we do .
Our needs are the same . ""
Analysts said Cosatu , which forged ties with the ANC in the struggle to end apartheid , would have too much to lose from a split .
But William Gumede , author of Thabo Mbeki and the Battle for the Soul of the ANC , warned that the political fallout could be damaging .
"" It 's a big moment for the alliance , "" he said .
"" These are some of the people who brought Zuma to power .
As this strike goes on , the same people are potentially talking about getting Zuma out .
"" Zuma has wanted to please everybody but in this kind of situation you ca n't please everybody .
If he chooses one side then he loses the other .
The strike could be a tipping point . ""
Cosatu , which says it has 2 m members , has warned of a "" total shutdown "" of the South African economy next week if the government does not meet its demand for an 8.6 % wage rise and 1,000 rand ( £ 88 ) monthly housing allowance .
Cosatu said it had filed seven - day strike notices for members to join the state workers in a stoppage that would then hit mining and manufacturing .
Police and army medics could also join in , bringing the country to a standstill .
In a major show of strength today , thousands of workers marched through cities waving placards , wearing union T - shirts and singing apartheid - era protest songs .
The strike by about 1.3 million state employees is now in its eighth day and has shut schools and crippled hospitals .
Frustration with government was palpable in a country where half of young black men are unemployed .
In Johannesburg workers danced , blew vuvuzelas , sang anti - Zuma songs and chanted : "" We are going , we are going to Luthuli House [ the ANC headquarters ] . ""
In Bloemfontein , thousands marched peacefully through the streets , carrying banners such as : "" We behaved during the World Cup .
Now reward us with 8.6 % . ""
The strike has divided South Africans because of its human costs .
Nomvula Mokonyane , the premier of Gauteng province , said at least 53 premature babies were left unattended at various hospitals when nursing staff left their posts .
Dr Aaron Motsoaledi , the health minister , who worked an all - night hospital shift , said he saw nurses receiving threatening phone calls for continuing to work .
The National Aids Council expressed fears about the effects on HIV - positive people , saying it had received reports of patients struggling to get access to medicine .
The Health Professions Council of South Africa condemned "" shocking effects "" on patient welfare .
Marella O'Reilly , its acting registrar and chief executive , said : "" The dismal picture portrayed in our public hospitals as a result of the strike is one of disgrace , embarrassment and failure . ""
The South African army has sent doctors and other personnel to help at 47 hospitals across the country .
But the SA National Defence Union is now considering a stoppage in solidarity with public servants .
The police union has also said its members will down tools on Saturday .
But police management obtained a court order barring police from striking and said officers who joined the protests could be fired .
There have been reports of teachers being abused for crossing school picket lines , and even some children suffering intimidation .
Exams have been postponed in some provinces .
Steven Friedman , director of the Centre for the Study of Democracy , said the unions were disappointed with Zuma . ""
The strike illustrates that , from the perspective of the trade unions , the government they are dealing with now is exactly the same as before Zuma was elected .
The Zuma presidency was held up to Cosatu as more pro - labour .
But it has n't been and it will be interesting to see how union leaders react . ""
Will the unions campaign against Zuma in two years ' time ?
There are two questions .
Do they have the votes to do it ?
Probably not .
And who would they put in his place ?
There is no obvious candidate . ""
Friedman also ruled out a split between the ANC and Cosatu .
"" There 's not much incentive on either side to pull the alliance apart .
I guess that the ANC and Cosatu have had their honeymoon and now this is the death knell .
There will be a more adversarial relationship , but that 's nothing new . """
2010-08-28,"Deaf , perhaps , and mum , definitely , in response to the cries of his striking populace , President Jacob Zuma led his court and comrades in a solemn reunion at Saint George 's cathedral in Cape Town yesterday for the funeral of anti - apartheid hero Joe Matthews .
Two days earlier , a striking teacher marching in a huge public servants ' demonstration to parliament held aloft a placard suggesting : "" Zuma : Give 700 rands 2 your wives .
"" Two decades after trade unions played a key role in bringing the African National Congress to power , the £ 61 monthly housing allowance being offered by the government of the polygamous president to 1.3 million strikers is about as welcome as cake from Marie Antoinette .
And what is really at stake on the 12th day in the most bitter round of industrial action since the end of apartheid is not the 7 % pay rise offer or the 8.6 % demand – plus 1,000 rands ( £ 88 ) housing allowance – from the streets .
It is the future of the ideologically confused ANC alliance , consisting of the massive Confederation of South African Trade Unions ( Cosatu ) , a Communist party that does not run in elections and an ANC nourished by memories of struggle and comradeship that are increasingly irrelevant to the population . ""
The alliance is dysfunctional , '' said Cosatu secretary - general Zwelinzima Vavi on Wednesday .
"" It is unable even to convene an alliance summit for fear of an implosion as a result of fundamental differences on the question of where power lies . ""
Last time the alliance reached implosion point , in 2008 , the ANC managed to circumscribe the damage , Soviet - style , by ousting the right - leaning Thabo Mbeki and replacing him with the power - hungry Zuma .
This time , in the absence of a policy - neutral frontman like Zuma who tells everyone what they want to hear , the entire alliance is threatened , and with it the government of the country .
In the run - up to next year 's local government elections , Vavi says the unions will not , as in the past , "" give the ANC a blank cheque "" by guaranteeing their support .
This week Vavi plans to play his trump card by drawing in the private sector and creating "" total shutdown '' of the economy .
Some 320,000 mineworkers are on standby to down tools on Thursday .
The only other meaningful sector in a country with 40 % unemployment is the car industry , which is already partially on strike .
Some of its 70,000 members marched through the posh Johannesburg suburb of Sandton yesterday .
Vavi 's move is intended to give the heebie - jeebies to the man who really runs South Africa .
The de facto prime minister Trevor Manuel , who carries the innocuous title of minister in the presidency in charge of the national planning commission , has maintained the market - friendly course he put in place as finance minister under Mbeki .
It brought a World Cup to the country , but it did not change lives .
In the past week , when Zuma was in China , Manuel remained in the country but was as quiet as the president .
So worried is Zuma that he has , somewhat clumsily , announced that he will not attend the UN General Assembly at the end of September because it clashes with the ANC national general council policy review conference .
After coming to power against no meaningful national opposition in the April 2009 elections , the ANC under Zuma relied on the firebrand youth league leader , Julius Malema .
His role was to pacify the people with rhetoric , including calls for the nationalisation of mines .
More interested in immediate delivery , the people did not buy it .
Crucially , neither did Cosatu .
Amid scandals and calls for new legislation to muzzle the media , Malema increasing looks merely like one of the many "" tenderpreneurs "" , denounced by Vavi as the ANC 's "" predator society "" .
The strike is unpopular because public sector workers have a bad image .
The police do n't solve crimes .
People spend hours queueing up for anti - retroviral drugs outside clinics manned by a skeleton staff of 3,000 military medics .
Children sit for their matric ( A - levels ) in schools where the whims of gangs determine attendance .
Social housing is illegally sold to residents by corrupt officials .
But the suffering of the masses is irrelevant to the strike .
Amid a lack of political leadership from the president , the ANC alliance 's life expectancy no longer depends on Zuma .
It is in the hands of Vavi and will be determined , possibly this week , by his ability to draw the private sector into the strike and make it felt on the world 's stock markets and the share portfolios of South Africa 's middle classes ."
2010-09-06,"Nurses , teachers and other public servants in South Africa will return to work tomorrow after union leaders agreed to suspend a crippling four - week national strike .
But the unions warned that they will resume mass action if a suitable pay deal is not struck in the next 21 days .
The halt will come as a relief to beleaguered hospitals and schools , and to President Jacob Zuma , who has seen his former union allies turn against him .
In a joint statement today , more than 20 unions portrayed the move as a victory , saying the government had raised its 5.2 % wage increase to 7.5 % .
The unions have been holding out for 8.6 % .
They said : "" Labour has decided to suspend the strike and this does not mean we have accepted the state offer . ""
But there were hopes that public services would return to normal from tomorrow .
Chris Klopper of the Independent Labour Caucus said today : "" We expect workers to go back to work immediately , and that means tomorrow . ""
Thobile Ntola , president of the South African Democratic Teachers Union , told a gathering of his members : "" There comes a time in any strike in which we must weigh our options . ""
He said it was the government , not the workers , that had caused the strike .
He criticised Zuma for travelling overseas instead of showing leadership : "" What has the president done ?
He has left the country and gone to China . ""
He also said Cabinet ministers and top officials should forgo their own pay raises .
"" Our demands are genuine , "" he said .
"" The inequalities in this country are very vast , and they need to be closed . ""
The strike involving 1.3 million public sector workers has dragged on for three weeks , testing public sympathy .
Volunteers and army medics have been called in to help at hospitals , and some patients have been moved to private medical facilities .
School pupils in their final year are worried they will not be able to sit final exams on time .
Judges have told jailed suspects their pleas for bail can not be heard for want of interpreters and other court staff .
Police have used rubber bullets and water cannon to disperse protesters who sought to block hospitals and hundreds of people have been arrested .
South African media have reported numerous acts of violence against health and education staff who insist on going to work .
A nurse suffered burns when her house in Soweto was petrol bombed , according to the Sowetan newspaper today .
Another had serious head and neck injuries after reportedly being been beaten by striking workers at Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital in Soweto on Friday .
A day earlier another nurse was stabbed at a hospital in Pietermaritzburg .
There were also reports of a nurse being abducted and held for several hours before being released unharmed .
Government officials have said the state can not afford the offer they have already put on the table and there is no more room in the budget to increase its offer , which would swell state spending by about 1 % .
Economists estimate that the labour action is costing the economy about 1bn rand ( £ 90 m ) a day .
The SA Chamber of Commerce and Industry has warned that the strike was wiping out the economic gains of hosting a successful football World Cup .
It has also put a strain on the historic alliance between the African National Congress and the labour movement , which helped propel Zuma into office .
Some have expressed disappointment at Zuma 's failure to reward them and speculated that he could be vulnerable to a leadership challenge .
Africa 's most powerful economy has been hit by two other labour stoppages .
About 70,000 workers at petrol stations , garages and auto dealerships walked off the job last Wednesday , seeking 20 % wage increases .
The National Union of Mineworkers said more than 8,000 workers seeking 15 % increases at Northam Platinum began a work stoppage today ."
2010-09-14,"Any event featuring Jacob Zuma , virginity tests and more than 25,000 bare - breasted maidens dancing for a polygamous king is unlikely to pass entirely without incident .
And so it proved with this year 's Zulu reed dance in South Africa .
King Goodwill Zwelithini , who has five wives , spoke out angrily against the photographing of girls undergoing virginity tests at the event , arguing that the images would be used to undermine Zulu culture .
Girls participating in the annual uMkhosi WoMhlanga are required to have their genitalia inspected to certify they are virgins .
The centuries - old practice has been condemned by gender rights groups but defended by Zulus as means of combating teenage pregnancy and HIV .
Zuma was among guests at the ceremony in Nongoma , KwaZulu - Natal province , last weekend .
Zwelithini , 62 , condemned "" rogue "" virginity testers and expressed dismay at seeing pictures of the tests turn up on the internet , South Africa 's Mercury newspaper reported .
"" I was shocked when I received these pictures on my website , "" the Zulu monarch was quoted as saying .
"" I have no doubt these pictures are going to be used to attack this solemn culture of ours .
This is a very important tradition and culture and needs to be conducted with dignity and respect without abusing and violating the dignity and privacy of the maidens . ""
The Mercury said there were fears that the event , in which thousands of mostly adolescent girls parade bare - breasted wearing traditional beaded skirts and necklaces , had become a target for pornography syndicates .
Before the dance , the arts and culture department in KwaZulu - Natal had insisted that only accredited photographers would be allowed to attend and anyone taking "" indecent "" pictures would be arrested .
It declared that women wearing trousers would be banned from the king 's palace .
It said the participating maidens would be taught life skills , moral regeneration and HIV / Aids prevention methods .
The ceremony sees Zulu maidens sing and ululate as they descend on the eNyokeni palace to present the king with a reed symbolising their purity .
Last year one maiden died and several were injured in a stampede .
Mangosuthu Buthelezi , traditional Zulu prime minister and president of the Inkatha Freedom party , said the reintroduction of the reed dance 26 years ago was ahead of its time .
"" It encouraged young people towards chastity even before we were swept up in the devastating wave of the HIV / Aids pandemic , "" he told the gathering .
Virginity testing has been criticised because of a widespread superstition in rural areas that sex with a virgin can cure HIV / Aids – blamed for fuelling high levels of rape ."
2010-10-20,"The launch of a pro - government newspaper in South Africa today was postponed when the editor and four senior staff quit hours before the first issue was due to go to press .
The New Age has promised "" more positive "" news and to highlight the achievements of the governing African National Congress ( ANC ) .
Its owner , the Gupta Group , has close links with President Jacob Zuma and his family .
The paper was due to hit the streets this morning , but at 3 pm yesterday there was a staff mutiny involving the editor , Vuyo Mvoko , the deputy editor Karima Brown and three other senior staff .
Gary Naidoo , managing editor of the New Age , told South Africa 's Talk Radio 702 : "" We were ready to go to print .
We withheld that publication with respect for those editorial staff that have stayed on .
"" We have been prepared and we have been working throughout the weekend .
We have been working right up to Monday .
We did not anticipate this . ""
Naidoo estimated that the newspaper , already delayed from an original launch date of mid - September , would be published in "" maybe a week , two weeks "" .
The five journalists who walked out issued a joint statement that said : "" We have taken the decision that it would be neither proper nor professionally acceptable for us to speak publicly about the reasons for our decision .
"" There were reports in the South African media that the incident followed a disagreement with the owners over the paper 's editorial stance .
Mvoko was understood to have resigned because he felt his authority was being undermined .
The New Age 's owners are Indian businessmen who arrived in South Africa in 1993 and built their fortune from computers .
Concerns have been raised about the Guptas ' nine - year relationship with Zuma and his family .
Atul Gupta is said to be a close friend of Zuma ; Gupta 's brother , Rajesh , and Zuma 's son , Duduzane , are business partners who own shares in the steel company ArcelorMittal .
ANC threats to press freedom
The walkout by staff came on national press freedom day in South Africa , an event marked by protests and debates because of two new measures being considered by the ANC .
The party is pushing for the creation of a statutory media appeals tribunal and new laws that would broaden the definition of official secrets , with whistleblowers and journalists who infringe them facing up to 25 years in prison .
The ANC says legislation is needed to make journalists legally accountable for inaccurate reporting .
But there has been an outcry from journalists and figures such as Desmond Tutu and the writers André Brink and Nadine Gordimer .
Many say the laws are reminiscent of the apartheid era and would be abused to cover up government corruption .
Hundreds of demonstrators marched to Constitution Hill in Johannesburg in a silent protest yesterday .
Kader Asmal , a former cabinet minister , told a meeting at Wits University : "" Who can fight the persistent calls to respect freedom of the press from Nelson Mandela ?
"" We have managed through our sacrifice of blood , sweat and tears to secure a precious new dispensation that rightly placed freedom of speech and access to information as lodestars of a new order .
We can not and must not allow any denigration of these core beliefs that were so dearly won . """
2010-11-11,"A free trade area for Africa , to help the impoverished continent match the spectacular growth of Far East economies , emerged as a distinctive British initiative at the G20 summit today .
The anti - poverty strategy , which is partly the brainchild of former Labour minister turned G20 adviser Baroness Vadera , has been developed with Jacob Zuma , the president of South Africa .
David Cameron , speaking at a business summit in Seoul today , said : "" We should explain that free trade is good for the poorest parts of our world as well , and one thing the British have been very active in trying to insert into this G20 is a free - trade area for Africa . ""
Africa should be a growing part of the world economy : we should be lifting more people out of poverty in Africa .
But we will not do it with all the trade barriers that exist between African countries .
"" There are currently three distinct free trade areas within Africa , but a meeting in January of the continent 's major powers is designed to create a single free trade entity spanning 26 countries .
However , anti - poverty campaigners warned that a new approach focused on growth must not be used as an excuse to wriggle out of aid promises .
"" That 's got to be the worry – that there 's the appeal of the new , and that promises that are quite painful to deliver in the current climate are gone , "" said Adrian Lovett , global campaign director for Save the Children .
Save the Children said that of $ 25bn in aid promised by the G8 countries in 2005 , only $ 12bn has been delivered , and warned that development progress could be derailed by the economic crisis .
Zuma , who is attending the G20 meeting , said the summit is also expected to launch major investments in infrastructure and skills development in developing countries , to help rebalance the world economy by creating new centres of demand outside the flagging economies of North America and Europe .
A battle earlier in the year – in part waged by Vadera , who was helped into her current role by her former boss , Gordon Brown – has ensured that the issue of international development is now appearing on the G20 's agenda , having previously been seen exclusively as the preserve of the G8 .
Leaders are expected to agree on a "" nine - pillar "" plan tomorrow that is intended to become a guide to strengthening cooperation between developed and emerging economies .
The nine pillars are infrastructure building , trade promotion , human resources development , private investment , job creation , domestic resources mobilisation , growth with resilience efforts , financial inclusion and knowledge sharing .
Vadera , a former investment banker who was ennobled by Brown , points out that South Korea is one of only two countries that has transformed itself from a low income country to a high - income country in just one generation .
She argues that it achieved this not by following the traditional prescriptions of the World Bank or the IMF , but by using international trade as an essential component of its development policy .
She argues that it is not enough to rely on aid over the long term ; instead , greater reliance on domestic resources is critical to build a more resilient economy and implement a home - grown development agenda ."
2010-11-12,"John Kani , the veteran actor , is among several South Africans to recently suggest that anyone seeking to understand the country 's malaise should look to a fairy story written by an Indian - born , Old Etonian veteran of the Spanish civil war and published in Britain in 1945 .
George Orwell intended Animal Farm as an allegory of Stalin 's Soviet Union , but great metaphors have the regenerative power to go forth and multiply .
Literary - minded pessimists may cast the farm as South Africa , the tyrannical Mr Jones as the apartheid government , the noble revolutionary Major as Nelson Mandela , the deposed and erased Snowball as Thabo Mbeki , the scheming ruler Napoleon as Jacob Zuma and the garrulous zealot Squealer as Julius Malema .
Then of course there is the cart - horse , Boxer , representing the exploited workers . ""
Somehow it seemed as though the farm had grown richer without making themselves any richer – except , of course , for the pigs and the dogs … "" Orwell writes . ""
…
As for the others , their life , so far as they knew , was as it had always been .
They were generally hungry , they slept on straw , they drank from the pool , they laboured in the fields ; in winter they were troubled by cold , and in summer by flies . ""
By the end of the story , Napoleon has donned the garb of the one - time enemy – black coat , ratcatcher breeches and leather leggings – and is at the head of a table where his well - fed comrades play cards and drink beer .
Clover the cart - horse and other animals , peering in at the dining - room window , observe how their leaders have become indistinguishable from their previous oppressors .
All this came to mind in the days that followed the rapid rise to infamy of Kenny Kunene , a hitherto little - known businessman and member of the so - called "" new black elite "" .
To celebrate his 40th birthday , Kunene threw a party costing more than 700,000 rand , or £ 63,000 , at an exclusive nightclub in Sandton , the wealthiest suburb of Johannesburg .
According to the City Press newspaper , "" the party was the definition of bling and debauchery "" and served 66 bottles of Dom Perignon , 36 bottles of Cristal and 32 bottles of 18-year - old Chivas Regal .
The 300 invited guests , instructed to wear all - white ensembles , included Zizi Kodwa , spokesman for President Zuma , and Malema , president of the African National Congress ( ANC ) youth league .
Kunene , arriving late by limousine , could be seen posing in shades , bow tie and flamboyant white suit , his arms draped around four models smothered in grey paint .
But what everyone will remember is the sushi , or rather the manner of its serving .
For Kunene 's delectation , the rice and raw fish was spread out on the thighs and stomach of a young model wearing only shoes and black lingerie .
This has become one of those striking images or quotations that seem to trap someone , transfix the media 's imagination and inexorably harden into a symbol of the times .
So it was in Kenya in 2004 when Edward Clay , the British high commissioner , criticised government corruption with the deathless words , "" their gluttony causes them to vomit all over their shoes "" .
Kunene has quickly been dubbed a "" sushi king "" , and this once innocent Japanese delicacy has suddenly become a byword for Gatsby - esque excess .
"" It is this spitting in the face of the poor and insulting their integrity that makes me sick , "" said Zwelinzima Vavi , general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions , who is rapidly establishing himself as the voice of the ANC 's disappointed friends .
"" I am told at one party sushi was served from the bodies of half - naked ladies .
It is the sight of these parties , where the elite display their wealth , often secured by questionable methods , that turns my stomach . ""
But Kunene evidently is n't a man to take such criticism lying down .
He wrote Vavi an open letter that retorted : "" I should not have to defend what I spend my money on – a huge milestone in my life – when it 's honest money spent on honest fun .
You remind me of what it felt like to live under apartheid : you are telling me , a black man , what I can and can not do with my life . ""
White people threw big parties every day when I was a poor young black man .
They are still throwing parties .
There is nothing wrong with that .
Many of them are my friends .
I look up to many of them .
We celebrate success , not doing what many now do , hiding their money in fear of what people like you will say .
I want my life to inspire people to go into business , so they can create jobs for others . ""
He added : "" You are narrow - minded and still think that it 's a sin for black people to drive sports cars or be millionaires at a young age . ""
You make my stomach turn .
"" There has been widespread condemnation of Kunene for flaunting ostentatious wealth in the world 's most unequal society .
Figures published this week show that about 1.6 % of the South African population earns a quarter of all personal income .
Only 41 % have a job and just 58 % have attended secondary school ; 9 % do n't have access to water , 23 % do n't have toilets and 24 % do n't have electricity .
Average life expectancy is 52 , the lowest since 1970 .
Small wonder that last week , at an event organised by the news and comment website the Daily Maverick , I heard Vavi warn : "" We are already sitting on a ticking bomb .
The poor are already getting restless .
They are tired of watching and reading about the elite blacks or whites parading wealth a few kilometres away from where they live in squalor .
"" The more we delay intervening , strongly guided by a new growth path that will end poverty , worsening unemployment and inequalities , the more we risk that one day this poor majority will simply walk to the suburbs to demand the same living standards .
No walls will be high enough and no electronic fences will be strong enough to stop the overwhelming majority . ""
Just as Nero is doomed to be remembered for fiddling while Rome burned , which he did n't , and
Marie Antoinette for saying "" Let them eat cake "" , which she did n't , so Kunene looks set to go down in shame for consuming sushi , which he did .
But what of the model who acted as his sushi board ?
"" I felt safe the entire time , "" Naledi told the press .
"" Nobody came on to me or touched me .
And Kenny literally only had one bite to eat . """

-------
Summary ------- 1 .
( SBU )
This is the third of three messages that aim to reveal a comprehensive background picture of Jacob Zuma , the President of the ruling African National Congress party ( ANC ) , who was inaugurated as the fourth post - apartheid president of South Africa .
The first message was released before Zuma was inaugurated , and the last two will be released following his ascendancy .
End Summary .
---------------------------
Zuma Destined for Greatness --------------------------- 2 .
( SBU )
The global emergence of the anti - apartheid and disinvestment movements gained momentum in the 1970s and the 1980 's , such that even the USG adopted a sanctions policy against the apartheid regime .
Under international diplomatic , political , military , and economic pressure , the SAG decided that apartheid was no longer sustainable .
Negotiations with Nelson Mandela , who was serving a life sentence in Robben Island , opened the door for his release from prison and the un - banning of the African National Congress ( ANC ) and other opposition and anti - apartheid political parties .
When SAG President F.W. de Klerk un - banned the ANC in 1990 , Jacob Zuma , the ANC 's Intelligence and Security chief in exile , was one of the first high level ANC operatives to return to South Africa .
Zuma immediately became involved in negotiations concerned with dismantling apartheid laws and governance , facilitating the repatriation of those in exile , as well as the release of all political prisoners .
It was between 1990 and 1994 that Zuma achieved his most important success : negotiating an end to the spiral of violence between the ANC and the Zulu - based Inkatha Freedom Party ( IFP ) -- that believed in Zulu tradition and primacy -- and resulted in thousands of politically - related deaths .
Zuma is likely the most prominent ANC Zulu politician -- even eclipsing Mangosuthu Buthelezi .
Moreover , his own Zulu ethnicity and identity was a major asset , convincing the Zulus of KwaZulu Natal to support the ANC 's leadership , the new ANC constitution , and reconciliation as he urged a non - violent way for the opposing political movements to communicate .
Though sporadic outbreaks of Zulu - ANC violence occurred up until 2009 , the intensity , frequency , and number of deaths have reduced to a very small fraction compared to the early 1990s .
This achievement remains one of the most important bases for Zuma 's stature , popularity and support among the ANC rank and file .

For the decades of his imprisonment , Mandela was the most recognized icon of the ANC as well as a global symbol of freedom , perseverance , and resistance to apartheid .
Upon his release , he led the ANC 's efforts to create a majority - based , multi - racial democratic system founded on a progressive constitution based on democratic best practices around the world .
In the period before the end of apartheid following the 1994 election which made Mandela the first democratically - elected president of South Africa , Zuma was appointed to key roles in the ANC and participated in their political decisions and negotiations .
In 1994 , his supporters say , he stepped aside so that Thabo Mbeki could stand unopposed as Mandela 's Deputy President .
He had one unsuccessful campaign to become the premier of KwaZulu Natal Qunsuccessful campaign to become the premier of KwaZulu Natal and in 1994 was appointed the Deputy Premier of that province by his old comrade and sometimes adversary Thabo Mbeki .
Between 1994 and 1996 , Zuma was KwaZulu Natal 's provincial chairman of the ANC as well as MEC for Economic Development and Tourism .
In 1996 , he was re - elected as Chair of the ANC in KwaZulu Natal and the same year became the ANC 's National Chairperson -- one of the top six jobs in the party .
4 .

His highest office -- prior to his current status as President - elect of South Africa following a vote in Parliament on May 6 , 2009 -- was ANC Deputy President and Member of Parliament , as he served as Deputy State President in the Mbeki Administration from 1999 to 2005 .
Upon attaining the party Deputy Presidency , by tradition of succession in the ANC , Zuma was believed to be Mbeki 's heir apparent , destined to succeed to the presidency in his time .
But there were bumps in the road .
He served as an unofficial PRETORIA 00000954 002.2 OF 004 peace mediator and diplomatic troubleshooter in the region ( Zimbabwe , Burundi , and the Democratic Republic of the Congo ) and helped the ANC build a rapport with trade unions , traditional leaders , and other political parties .
Zuma developed the reputation of being humble , charismatic , loyal , hard - working , and committed to improving the lives of South Africans .
In 1999 , based on this profile , he was appointed Deputy President of the ANC and became the Deputy President of South Africa in the first Mbeki administration .
He was dismissed by Mbeki as SAG Deputy President in 2005 as a result of being implicated in the corruption trial of his friend and financial advisor Schabir Shaik .
In 2006 , he was charged with rape of a family friend , but was acquitted .
Following Shaik 's conviction of bribing Zuma for personal gain , Zuma was indicted and charged with multiple counts of corruption , accepting bribes , tax evasion , and money laundering .
5 .
( SBU ) Zuma 's rise to the pinnacle of South African politics at the same time that serious questions about his character were
headline news is an astonishing political achievement in itself .
Zuma is known as a populist whose rise occurred in partnership with leftist constituencies in the ANC .
Despite criminal allegations against him , he remained popular in the party , unlike Mbeki who came to be hated .
Zuma is particularly popular among Zulu ethnic and Youth Leagues ; their defense of him claims he has served the people well , there are others worse than him , and he is much better than Mbeki .
Some of his most ardent supporters promised to kill and die for him while others threatened that if Zuma were to be convicted , "" blood would flow "" and they would make the country "" ungovernable . ""
To them , Zuma had a "" right "" to be president .
Mbeki believed that a Zuma presidency would be a disaster for South Africa and would split the ANC .
Zuma 's supporters counter - claimed that Mbeki was a disaster for the poor
and he was the one splitting the party , creating a strong presidency that acted without reference to party instruction .
In 2007 , well after the conviction of his friend Shaik for bribery and corruption , Zuma was also indicted for having a corrupt relationship with Shaik .
The charges were set aside in September 2008 due to lack of preparedness by the prosecutors to proceed with the case .

( SBU )
Despite Mbeki 's intellect and experience as well as his apparent success as a leader , politician , and diplomat , Zuma out - maneuvered him by manipulating the party base through the district offices and portraying himself as the victim via the image - making machinery of the ANC .
Pundits thought Mbeki was the smartest and most effective political leader of his generation , but on December 17 , 2007 in Polokwane , Limpopo , the ANC declared Zuma the clear favorite , beginning Mbeki 's surprising slide into political obscurity .
Days following his election , corruption charges were re - filed against Zuma , causing a leadership crisis in the ANC that was only resolved in September 2008 when the Zuma - led NEC forced Mbeki to resign as President of South Africa -- a deliberate act of triumphant revenge just eight months short of the end of his second five year term .
Kgalema Motlanthe ( septel ) , Qof his second five year term .
Kgalema Motlanthe ( septel ) , the ANC Deputy President , was sworn in as South Africa 's third post - apartheid president , but his seven month tenure was purposefully that of a care - taker , marking time until the president in waiting took office .
7 .
( SBU ) Following a year - and - a - half of controversial high profile court challenges , appeals , and counter - suits , all charges against Zuma were dropped only weeks before the election in April 2009 .
His supporters ' adoration only grew as his detractors characterized him as an unlettered and corrupt buffoon surrounded by crass and intimidating socialist sycophants .
Zuma loyalists ignored critiques that he is a charismatic populist and political chameleon who tells each audience exactly what they want to hear , that he is a man without his own vision or policy center .
His supporters understand that Zuma has one over - riding policy -- loyalty to the ANC and improving the lives of the rural poor above all else .
--------------------------
Keys To Zuma 's Personality -------------------------- PRETORIA 00000954 003.2 OF 004 8 .
( SBU ) Zuma has clearly weathered numerous storms during recent years and he used several tactics of political survival that give clues to his personality and leadership style .
First , he used the power of persuasion to build strong alliances .
Faced with enormous challenges to his political career , Zuma built a strong support team and pulled his family close to him .
He also relied heavily on his contacts in KwaZulu Natal Second , he leveraged on the infrastructure and networks of his friends .
The perceived political conspiracy against Zuma became a reality in the minds of many South Africans -- including Pietermaritzburg High Court Judge Chris Nicholson -- and this triggered a groundswell of sympathy for him .
The ANC Youth League , the Congress of South African Trade Unions ( COSATU ) , and the South African Communist Party ( SACP ) gave him a political platform to express his views .
He also worked closely with business people who had local and international networks .
They extended their influence so he could counter the negative images that his adversaries had built of him .
Third , he remained focused on key tasks .
Throughout the political crisis he faced after Mbeki fired him , Zuma focused on his oft - repeated assertion that he was innocent and that he was the victim of a systematic abuse of power .
Fourth , Zuma understood that the main thrust of the political conspiracy would have been to remove him from the ANC , and the ANC from him .
His best response would be to live the values of the ANC throughout the crisis period , and become the epitome of an ANC cadre -- which he did .
He built extensive relationships in Parliament and with ANC branches across the country .
As he began to live the values of the ANC , the ruling party found it more difficult to distance itself from him .
9 .
( SBU ) Fifth , Zuma delegated effectively while never abandoning his responsibilities .
Zuma is outstanding at delegating jobs to those around him .
According to those closest to Zuma , "" his demeanor in the face of adversity helped to create a positive atmosphere inside his war - rooms . ""
Sixth , he always maintained the moral high ground and remained authentic throughout .
No matter how hard detractors tried to break his spirit by name - calling and leaking information , Zuma never lost his composure .
In the midst of his toughest times , Zuma visited his working - class supporters and the unemployed .
Seventh , he improvised his communication methods -- and found success doing so .
When he realized that much of the media in South Africa was against him becoming the next leader , he resorted to positive imagery .
He became the dignified underdog , and he painted those against him as shameless bullies and cowards .
Last , Zuma used smart aggression as a tool to wear down his opponents .
Throughout the most difficult times of the past few years , Zuma came across as reluctant to draw first blood , only displaying subtle determination to take the fight to his aggressors .
This is consistent with a leader that is aware of his own strengths -- smart power .

Comment ------- 10 .
( SBU )
As Zuma 's presidency begins , many outstanding questions remain about his government and his policies .
His close association with the ideological left of the ANC Qclose association with the ideological left of the ANC alliance has raised some worries about the impact on economic policy by close Zuma allies in the SACP and COSATU .
He has reassured investors their assets will be secure under his administration , but has also called for the redistribution of wealth in the interests of the poor .
The ANC has led the world to expect a more intimate intertwining of the ruling party and the state as well as a deployment of public officials whose standard of conduct and effectiveness will be their loyalty to Zuma and the ANC and their willingness to carry out ANC policies .
With a relatively weak opposition but respected courts and activist civil society , there is optimism that a Zuma administration will , at worst , muddle through .
There are many top performers in the ANC , and the ANC tradition of collective decision - making will define the policy context of the Zuma administration .
One can only guess how South Africa will evolve under a Zuma presidency -- which he promises will only be for one term .
South Africans have suffered many more and greater tragedies than an elected government with a near two - thirds majority .
It is trite to PRETORIA 00000954 004.2 OF 004 say , but "" time will tell . ""
In this case , such a statement rings true for South Africa in 2009 .

Summary ------- 1 .
( SBU ) Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma , President of the ruling African National Congress ( ANC ) party , is a controversial but not well understood personage who emerged from obscurity to where he now occupies the apex of South Africa 's political pyramid .
He is deeply loved and revered by his closest constituencies ; he is mistrusted by opposition parties ; and is hated by those here who believe he is "" wrong for South Africa . ""
Zuma 's nearly five decades of involvement with the ANC , has brought him to this moment .
Zuma is now poised to become the fourth post - apartheid President of South Africa , following Nelson Mandela , Thabo Mbeki , and Kgalema Motlanthe .

( SBU )
The National and Provincial elections held on April 22 , 2009 resulted in the ANC winning its fourth consecutive governing majority ( 65.9 % ) .
Under the South African constitution , the Parliament elects the state president ; thus the ANC majority in Parliament elected Jacob Zuma to be inaugurated in Pretoria on May 9 , 2009 .
This message weaves together various sources to provide a comprehensive look at the life and times of Jacob Zuma .
Our goal is to dispel the caricatures that dominate the media and present a more realistic picture of the man who will soon lead the most dynamic emerging democracy in Africa .
This is the first in a series of three related cables .
End Summary .
-----------------
The Boyhood Years
----------------- 3 .
( SBU ) Zuma was born on April 12 , 1942 in the rural village of Inkandla in the heart of Zululand ( now , Kwa - Zulu Natal ) .
One hundred or so years before Zuma 's birth , the Zulu War leader Shaka led a bloody expansion of the Zulu kingdom against other African tribes , and fifty or so years before , the last Zulu War was won by the British Empire .
Two centuries of colonial incursions into the heart of South Africa and the advent of the Afrikaner Boers into central and eastern territories reduced the Zulus to dependency status in a racist system that placed all blacks at the bottom of a segregated system of governance .
Jacob Zuma was born the first - born son of the second wife of a provincial policeman and had two full brothers and two full sisters .
The first wife of his father had three boys and four girls .
His father , whom he says he never saw , died while Zuma was very young .
4 .
( SBU )
The death of his father left his mother destitute and displaced her from her home in Inkandla .
She returned to her own village of Maphumulo where she worked for low pay as a domestic .
As the war ended , she relocated to a Durban township and worked as a domestic to feed her children .
Zuma 's childhood was spent between Durban and the rural interior of Zululand .
In 1947 , the National Party won the election and instituted apartheid and racial categories as the policy of the state .
The Group Areas Act , pass laws , Bantustans , separate facilities and amenities were in place .
The racial segregation of the colonial period became the law , and the authoritarian police state was prepared to enforce wit with violence .
In reaction , the violent , chaotic relations between the state and the oppressed Africans led to an atmosphere of periodic bloody riots , political suppression , torture , murder , strikes , townships in flames , Qsuppression , torture , murder , strikes , townships in flames , and widespread suffering .
5 .
( SBU ) Zuma was forced to work odd jobs from a young age to supplement his mother 's meager income -- as a herd boy , a gardener , a domestic , in tea houses , and small shops .
He faced the same problems of life of all Africans in the apartheid state .
In the rural , pastoralist cattle culture of the Zulu , Zuma 's first job as a herd boy linked him to an ancient traditional occupation of African boys throughout the continent .
He once wrote , "" I used to look after them ( the cows ) very well .
That was the first time I was praised for a job well done . ""
6 .
( SBU ) Not unusual for the times , as an unregistered African , Zuma only achieved schooling to Form III , or Fifth PRETORIA 00000939 002.2 OF
003 Grade equivalent .
However , friends and relatives recognized his hunger for learning and helped him with what they had learned .
He claims to be self - taught and that he taught himself to read and write .
In his teens , in 1955 , a cousin encouraged him to attend night school in Durban .
In this era , African churches , trade unions , and civic organizations offered educational opportunities to their members that were otherwise lacking from the state .
Throughout South Africa and beyond , Zuma 's life exemplified the distinction between education and intelligence -- the former he lacked , the latter he had in abundance .
In 1985 , in a biography penned for the Communist Party , he said he was self - educated up to the Junior Certificate level .
Later in his life he said , "" Education is education whether it is formal or not . ""
He continued , "" I have done everything that the educated have done . ""
--------------------------
To Political Consciousness -------------------------- 7 .
( SBU )
The ANC was established in 1912 as one of several civil agencies seeking to end racism and segregation and to protecting the human and civil rights of the African majority .
By mid - century , it had attracted the support of African intellectuals and traditional leaders as well as the average neglected African who was denied the rights of citizenship in the land of their birth .
Zuma 's elder half brother from his father 's first wife was a secret member of the ANC .
A maternal uncle was a trade union activist .
They talked to him about the struggle for equality and freedom , setting the spark for his developing political consciousness .
8 .
( SBU ) Zuma actively took to politics , resistance , and activism as a young man of 17 years .
He attended public and underground meetings where the goals of groups like the ANC and the South African Communist Party ( SACP ) were discussed .
In 1958 , he hovered around the ANC Youth League ( ANCYL ) -- an organ made famous a decade earlier by the young revolutionary Nelson Mandela -- and in 1958 , Zuma joined the ANC and its Youth League .
He said he was not an active participant , but he attended meetings and rallies .
In 1959 , he joined the South African Council of Trade Unions ( SACTU ) with his brother and soon was involved in an anti - pass campaign in the Noxamana district as well as in demonstrations opposing the Bantustan policy .
In these activities , he found a fraternity among like - minded groups that defined his life 's work .
9 .
( SBU )
In 1961 , the year Nelson Mandela was arrested and jailed , Zuma was 19 years old and committed to fighting apartheid .
That year , in Durban , he began courses with SACTU on Marxism - Leninism , the labor theory of value , and political discussions about colonialism , imperialism , the anti - colonial movement , and the nature of the struggle inside South Africa .
While a member of a political study group in 1962 , the year Mandela was sentenced to life in prison , Zuma was recruited into the militant armed wing of the ANC -- Umkonto wa Sizwe ( the Spear of the Nation , aka "" MK "" ) .
The following year , he was recruited into the SACP , though in his words , he did "" little party work .
"" It was Zuma 's associations with these organizations at this critical tipping point in South Africa 's history that became the guiding commitment of his QAfrica 's history that became the guiding commitment of his life up until today .
--------------------
Life in the Struggle
-------------------- 10 .
( SBU )
As an underground member of the banned ANC and the SACP , young Jacob Zuma was urged to go into exile , gain military training , and join the fight against apartheid .
In June 1963 , the 21 year old Zuma was arrested with 45 other young comrades in Zeerust , in the Transvaal ( now North West Province ) , as they were walking to Botswana into self - imposed exile .
He was detained for ninety days , then tried and sentenced to ten years in prison for "" conspiracy to overthrow the government . ""
Zuma spent the next ten years incarcerated with many other political prisoners , including the senior ANC leadership in prison such as Nelson Mandela , Walter Sisulu , Govan Mbeki , among other political prisoners at the infamous Robben Island .
While in Robben Island , in what had become PRETORIA 00000939 003.2 OF 003 the ANC 's graduate school , they discussed the U.S. civil rights movement , the anti - Vietnam War movement , the African independence movement , and the global ideological contest of the Cold War .
11 .
( SBU ) Zuma rarely discusses this period of his life in public , nor did his biography speak frankly about that experience , his relationships , and what he learned .
He does say that many important people there engaged in serious political debates and disagreements , but he failed to say who they were or what they argued about .
The only insight he provided says he held many responsible positions within ANC structures at Robben Island , he was a mentor for students , and at the end was Chairman of the Political Committee .
In the culture of the revolutionary anti - apartheid movements , his presence at Robben Island during Mandela 's first decade there is the best possible "" struggle credential "" he could possibly have acquired to rise in the movement .
Released from prison at the age of 32 in 1974 , Zuma immediately re - engaged the struggle with the ANC Natal underground .

2010-12-14,"Fifa president Sepp Blatter today provoked calls for his resignation after joking that gay football fans should "" refrain "" from sex during the 2022 World Cup in Qatar , where homosexuality is illegal .
Asked about concerns over the treatment of gay fans at the 2022 tournament , Blatter appeared to laugh the question off , saying : "" I would say they should refrain from any sexual activities . ""
Blatter and South Africa 's president , Jacob Zuma , sitting alongside him at a press conference to discuss the legacy of the 2010 World Cup , both laughed awkwardly , as did several journalists present .
But the Fifa president 's response and that of the assembled audience provoked anger from John Amaechi , the former NBA basketball star who revealed he was gay in 2007 .
He accused Blatter of "" epic ignorance "" .
Meanwhile , campaign groups said he risked undermining work to combat homophobia in football and called on him to apologise immediately or stand down .
Amaechi , born in the US but brought up in Stockport , has built up a career as a psychologist , campaigner and broadcaster since retiring in 2003 .
He said Blatter 's reaction was indicative of the wider attitude in football .
"" It 's not just his reaction but the fact that an entire room of sports reporters thought this something worth laughing about , "" Amaechi said .
"" He is football .
This is football 's attitude .
This man , who giggles like a six - year - old when asked a perfectly reasonable question .
This is yet another case where the epic , archaic , neanderthal ignorance of someone who wields the power to summon kings , princes , presidents and prime ministers uses that power not to foster positive change but to further entrench bigotry . ""
Blatter went on to say there would be "" no discrimination against any human beings on this side or that side or left or right or whatever .
So you can be assured that if people want to watch a match somewhere in Qatar in 2022 I am sure they will be admitted to such matches . ""
Qatar 's stance on homosexuality and women 's rights has been widely questioned since it won the right to host the 2022 tournament by promising to bridge east and west .
According to Amnesty International , last year in Qatar at least 18 people , mostly foreigners , were sentenced to floggings of between 40 and 100 lashes for offences related to "" illicit sexual relations "" or alcohol consumption .
Lord Ouseley , chairman of the Kick It Out campaign , who today hosted a House of Lords reception to highlight its work in tackling racism and homophobia within football , said Blatter 's comments were outrageous . ""
The whole thing is potentially calamitous , "" he said .
"" We 've got some real dinosaurs right at the top end of these world bodies .
Blatter talks a lot but does n't deliver on these issues . ""
Chris Basiurski , chairman of the Gay Football Supporters ' Network , said : "" Many LGBT [ lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender ] people live in countries where they would face execution or imprisonment if discovered .
These people deserve our help , our respect and our support .
They , like the rest of us , do not deserve to be laughed at .
Mr Blatter should retract his remarks and apologise immediately .
Otherwise , he should reconsider his position and resign . ""
That seems unlikely given Blatter 's track record .
It is far from the first time that the 74-year - old Fifa president , who intends to stand for another four - year term in 2011 despite the recent flurry of corruption allegations levelled at his organisation , has caused outrage with his views .
In 2004 he suggested that , to raise the profile of their sport , female footballers should wear tighter shorts .
When asked about the reaction to his latest comments , Fifa simply pointed to his subsequent remarks .
"" You see in the Middle East the opening of this culture , it 's another culture because it 's another religion , but in football we have no boundaries .
We open everything to everybody
and I think there shall not be any discrimination against any human beings be it on this side or that side ,
be it left , right or whatever , "" he said .
Blatter , who called England "" bad losers "" after Fifa awarded the 2018 tournament to Russia , added : "" I think there is too much concern for a competition that will be done only in 12 years .
But it gives me the opportunity to say that in Fifa , and this is in the statutes of Fifa , we do n't want racism , we do n't want any discrimination .
What we want to do is open this game to everybody , and to open it to all cultures , and this is what we are doing in 2022 . ""
No high - profile gay footballers have come out publicly since former Norwich City forward Justin Fashanu , who killed himself in 1998 .
The Justin Campaign – a pressure group named after Fashanu that was founded to highlight homophobia in football – said Fifa and Blatter should be "" utterly ashamed "" .
He said that in awarding the World Cup to Qatar and Russia , Fifa sent the message that the LBGT community simply did n't exist in its eyes .
Blattering on : what Sepp said "" There are gay footballers , but they do n't declare it because it will not be accepted in these macho organisations .
Look at women 's football – homosexuality is more popular there . ""
"" Let the women play in more feminine clothes like they do in volleyball … for example , tighter shorts .
Female players are pretty , if you excuse me for saying so , and they already have some different rules to men - such as playing with a lighter ball .
That decision was taken to create a more female aesthetic , so why not do it in fashion ? ""
"" In football , there 's too much modern slavery , in transferring players or buying players here and there and putting them somewhere . ""
"" Every game should have a winner .
When you play cards or any other game , there 's always a winner and a loser .
We should have the courage to introduce a final decision in every game of football . """
2010-12-31,"It 's that time of the year when , in many parts of the world , political analysts are writing about those moments that have somehow captured the soul of a particular government or ruling party – perhaps even the zeitgeist of the country itself .
We in South Africa have of course had our share of those events in 2010 .
We learned , for example , that President Jacob Zuma 's 28-year - old son , Duduzane , who seems to have no business experience in the metals industry , has benefited from a black empowerment deal related to ArceloMittal ( a large steel company ) and that Khulubuse Zuma , the president 's plump and jovial nephew , has made a literal fortune ( many millions ) since Uncle Jacob came to power .
Or perhaps one would prefer to point to the story about Blade Nzimande , the minister of higher education as well as the general - secretary of the SA Communist party , having chosen the Mount Nelson Hotel , the country 's top luxury hotel , as his temporary base in Cape Town – bearing in mind that many who belong to the SACP ca n't even afford the taxi fare from their shanty homes to the gates of the place .
But for me there is one thing that has captured how the ANC government and its courts operate ; its cavalier attitude towards its own people ; and its ineptitude .
In 1993 , Fusi Mofokeng and Tsokolo Joseph Mokoena , then aged 25 and 32 respectively , were jailed for life for their "" involvement "" with an ANC self - defence unit ( SDU ) that killed a policeman and caused permanent brain damage to another , on the outskirts of Bethlehem in the Free State .
Mofokeng was related by marriage to one of the members of the unit .
Even though the trial court acknowledged that Mofokeng and Mokoena had not been present at the shootings , they were found guilty in terms of "" common purpose "" . ""
Common purpose "" was a bit of law introduced by the apartheid regime enabling courts to find people , especially in unrest situations , guilty of murder by association .
In other words , if you were part of a crowd that "" necklaced "" someone , you could be found guilty of murder even if you did not strike the match yourself .
In 1995 , the remaining SDU members ( those not shot by the police and army in their swift reprisal ) and Mofokeng and Mokoena appeared before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission ( TRC ) .
All the SDU members were given amnesty .
But Mofokeng and Mokoena – unable "" to tell the truth "" and to apologise , because they had not done anything – were refused amnesty and sent back to jail .
In August 2009 , the University of the Witwatersrand Justice Project and Bethlehem ANC members joined forces with Jomo Nyambi , the ANC head of the petitions committee in the National Council of Provinces , the second tier of government ( formerly the senate ) .
Nyambi was appalled by what had happened to the men .
He was especially angry that for 14 years Mokoena and Mofokeng had been fobbed off by the ANC in particular .
The two were continually told by the ANC 's legal desk that their plight "" was being looked into "" .
So during the end of 2009 and into 2010 , Nyambi worked long and hard , walking the ministerial corridors of ( his own ) government .
At last , Nyambi was able to promise the two men that they would be present at the first game of the football world cup – in June .
Well , Sepp Blatter was there , but not Mofokeng and Mokoena .
Needless to say , the two men were distraught .
Despite the obvious fact that they had been in jail for 17 years for a crime they had n't committed , the situation seemed too legally difficult for anyone to unravel .
Arranging a "" retrial "" or appeal would take years .
The ministers of Justice and Correctional Services were unable to find a way to have the prison doors opened .
Since I was Zuma 's biographer , I contacted his office .
There was no official response , though I did hear that his office had in turn made some enquiries at the minister of correctional service 's office .
In South Africa , the job as minister of correctional services is regarded as a bit of a political backwater .
The present incumbent , Nosiviwe Mapisa - Nqakula , was a patently unsuccessful minister of home affairs in Mbeki 's government and the wife of Mbeki 's right - hand man , Charles Nqakula .
Zuma has apparently retained her because he wanted to appease the ANC Women 's League and the folks from Eastern Cape .
Still , at the end of September , a lifeline was thrown to all .
Parole became an option due to a judgment from the highest court in the land , the constitutional court .
The court ordered that anyone sentenced to life imprisonment before 1994 had to be considered for parole "" with immediate effect "" .
Here was a temporary solution .
Parole would get Mofokeng and Mokoena out of jail as quickly as possible .
Other details could be sorted out later .
I accompanied Nyambi to Kroonstad jail at the end of October and remember that as he told Mofokeng and Mokoena the news – that they would be home for Christmas – smiles slowly but surely transformed the sombre , cautious expressions on their faces .
Nyambi explained that Mokoena and Mofokeng 's names would be put before the National Council for Correctional Services ( NCCS ) .
The NCCS , headed by a judge , sits four times a year and recommends parole for specific inmates to the minister of correctional services .
In their case , however , he hinted , this would be merely a rubber stamp .
Big problem : it was discovered in December , a full two months after the judgment was made , that the court order does not mention the NCCS at all .
Consequently , the NCCS interpreted the court 's order as having removed the NCCS 's jurisdiction to deal with any "" lifers "" sentenced pre-1994 .
The members of the NCCS packed their briefcases and went home .
No one knows why the judgment did n't mention the NCCS ; maybe the judge who wrote it , Justice Bess Nkabinde , simply did n't know how the parole system operates ; but eight of her fellow judges , the best in the land , found with her .
The Mofokeng and Mokoena families , who are from "" the poorest of the poor "" , as the ANC likes to say , are distraught .
But the rest – the law men , the politicians and the government ministers – well , quite frankly , they do n't seem to give a fig .
Zuma has gone on holiday , to host his famous annual Christmas party for children .
Mapisa - Nqakula has also gone on holiday .
Mofokeng and Mokoena remain where they were put 17 years ago , despite not having committed any crime ."
2011-02-01,"A special panel was set up last week at the African Union summit in Addis Ababa to seek a solution to the Ivory Coast crisis within a month .
The AU 's peace and security council – Jacob Zuma , Jonathan Goodluck , Robert Mugabe and Hifikepunye Pohamba , presidents , respectively , of South Africa , Nigeria , Zimbabwe and Namibia – decided to set up the "" high - level panel "" consisting of African heads of state .
Its make - up is expected to include leaders from Africa 's five main regions , some of whom support president - elect Alassane Ouattara and others the defeated incumbent Laurent Gbagbo .
Until now the AU has demanded Gbagbo 's departure , but Jean Ping , head of the AU , said he was "" no longer sure things should be presented in these terms "" .
He added : "" The winner of the election is clearly Ouattara , but we need to find a peaceful , negotiated political solution . ""
Whereas some leaders called for the use of force , Ping , from Gabon , now advocates "" a result without resorting to violence "" .
Although he said this would not necessarily involve power - sharing , it would probably boil down to that , in view of a Kenyan precedent cited by Ping .
In 2008 the president , Mwai Kibaki , refused to recognise the victory of opposition leader Raila Odinga , who was ultimately appointed prime minister after a spate of violence .
"" Non - Africans only think of democracy , "" Ping said .
"" Africans are concerned about democracy and peace , their continent being afflicted by conflict and civil war . ""
Ping also has in mind various elections to be held this year .
It would set a dangerous precedent if Gbagbo persisted in his denial of the poll result .

2011-02-23,"At least 10 soldiers loyal to the disputed president Laurent Gbagbo have been killed by unidentified "" commandos "" amid renewed political violence in Ivory Coast , according to reports .
The ambush followed clashes in a stronghold of Gbagbo 's rival , Alassane Ouattara , and an Amnesty International investigation that uncovered a wave of murders , beatings and gang rapes .
An African Union delegation led by South Africa 's president , Jacob Zuma , has failed to end the crippling power struggle between Gbagbo and Ouattara , who is widely acknowledged as the winner of eelctions in November .
An adviser to Ouattara , who did not wish to be named , told the Associated Press that "" invisible commandos "" seized at least four military and police vehicles in a pro - Ouattara neighbourhood in Abidjan , Ivory Coast 's largest city , killing forces loyal to Gbagbo .

Abobo has been the scene of brutal attacks by security forces loyal to Gbagbo , who refuses to cede power despite intense pressure from the UN and west African neighbours .
On Monday , witnesses said soldiers shot at supporters of Ouattara during demonstrations , killing at least six .
At least 300 people have died since the disputed poll , with Gbagbo 's forces accused of human rights violations .
Gaëtan Mootoo , an Amnesty researcher who has just spent a month in Ivory Coast , said : "" In the west of the country , women told us that they have been gang - raped in January 2011 in their homes in view of their children , and others told us they were raped on their way to the market .
Eyewitnesses have also seen men beaten and deliberately killed in the street . ""
International media interest in the crisis has waned in recent weeks as attention turned to uprisings across north Africa and the Middle East .
Mootoo said : "" The eyes of the world may have shifted from the political stalemate in Ivory Coast but the abuses are clearly continuing . ""
Both the security forces and the Forces Nouvelles [ former rebels loyal to Ouattara ] are committing these horrific acts and their victims have no recourse to justice .
This reign of terror must end . ""
An estimated 70,000 people have fled their homes in the west of the country and settled in displacement sites or refugee camps across the border in Liberia and Guinea .
In the town of Duékoué , Amnesty researchers found that scores of people had been killed , with several women raped and hundreds of homes burned and looted .
One woman told the human rights group of an attack on 3 January : "" They came early in the morning ...
they had knives and machetes .
They broke the door and grabbed me .
Their faces were blackened with charcoal .
"" They said nothing , threw themselves on me and did horrible things to me .
They raped me , three or four of them .
They burned my house – the house of my family – and they killed my brother .
"" They stole everything from my shop and then burned it down .
We fled the same day . ""
Mootoo added : "" The current crisis in Ivory Coast has created a human rights black hole in the country .
The very serious human rights abuses that we have documented both in Abidjan and the west of the country must be immediately and impartially investigated .
"" The turmoil has driven cocoa futures to their highest level in more than three decades .
Ivory Coast is the world 's biggest cocoa producer , and a spokesman for Ouattara said he would extend the export ban he had ordered to 15 March .
The AU officially recognises Ouattara 's election victory , but while Nigeria has taken a tough line on Gbagbo , South Africa has tentatively backed his call for a recount of the votes Before a meeting with Ouattara in Golf hotel , where he is besieged by Ivorian troops , Zuma was mobbed by angry pro - Ouattara youths shouting : "" Zuma , Zuma , tell the truth ! ""
More than two dozen surrounded Zuma 's car as he pulled into the hotel and South African security forces
had to stop them pushing towards him .
A spokesman for Zuma denied that he had been in any danger .
West Africa 's regional body Ecowas [ http://www.ecowas.int ] had said it would not attend the talks because of threats by Gbagbo supporters , though the its commission chief , James Victor Gbeho , later arrived .
In a further sign that Gbagbo is digging in , and with February salaries due soon , his government said it would open two former French banks later this week .
Gbagbo 's camp has earmarked the Ivorian branches of Société Générale and BNP Paribas , two of many foreign banks to have suspended operations , for nationalisation .
"" The government will take all measures necessary to put these banks back to work , "" Gbagbo 's inspector general of finance , Bernadin Yapi , told journalists . ""
This will show the whole world that the state can take its responsibilities . """
2011-03-17,"Jean - Bertrand Aristide , the former president of Haiti , is expected to end seven years of exile by touching down in Port - au - Prince on Friday , defying Barack Obama 's concerns that his return could jeopardise the country 's election .
Aristide left his base in South Africa , accompanied by the Hollywood actor and campaigner Danny Glover , who is chairman of the TransAfrica social justice forum .
Such are Obama 's misgivings that he called Jacob Zuma , the South African president , to discuss the matter , according to US National Security Council spokesman , Tommy Vietor . ""
The United States , along with others in the international community , has deep concerns that President Aristide 's return to Haiti in the closing days of the election could be destabilising , "" he said .
"" President Obama reiterated that view in a call with President Zuma the other day ... along with his belief that the Haitian people deserve the chance to choose their government through peaceful , free and fair elections [ on 20 March ] .
"" US state department spokesman Mark Toner has acknowledged Aristide 's right to go back to Haiti , but said returning this week "" can only be seen as a conscious choice to impact Haiti 's elections "" .
Aides say Aristide fears the election winner may reverse the long - awaited decision to allow his return – both candidates are rightwingers long opposed to him .
Aristide 's lawyer , Ira Kurzban , said : "" He is genuinely concerned that a change in the Haitian government may result in his remaining in South Africa . ""
Kurzban claimed that even at the 11th hour the US was exerting pressure on South Africa to delay Aristide 's flight , which took off on Thursday night from Johannesburg 's Lanseria airport .
The former priest and liberation theologist 's diplomatic passport was delivered last month , and the South African cabinet minister Collins Chabane said the government could not be held responsible for whether he stays or goes .
"" What I should stress is that we are not sending former president Aristide to Haiti , "" Chabane said .
"" He was given the passport by the government of Haiti and we ca n't hold him hostage if he wants to go . ""
Glover arrived in South Africa on Thursday to escort the ousted leader home .
He asked why the former dictator Jean - Claude "" Baby Doc "" Duvalier could return to Haiti unhindered – as he did in January following 25 years in exile – and yet not the twice democratically elected Aristide . ""
People of good conscience can not be idle while a former dictator is able to return unhindered [ and ] a democratic leader who peacefully handed over power to another elected president is restricted from returning to his country by external forces , "" Glover wrote on the TransAfrica Forum website .
Glover and nine others recently wrote to Zuma urging him to "" assist the Aristides in making their transition as soon as possible "" as "" all the last remaining obstacles to the Aristides ' return have been removed "" .
Aristide , who emerged as a leading voice for Haiti 's poor in a popular revolt that forced an end to the Duvalier family 's 29-year dictatorship , remains hugely popular in the country .
Some predict his return will brings tens of thousands of supporters to the airport .
He has said he will not be involved in politics in Haiti and wants to lead his foundation 's efforts to improve education in the impoverished Caribbean nation devastated by an earthquake last year .
His political party has been excluded from running in the election , which many Haitians consider illegitimate .
The two remaining candidates received just 10 % of the first - round votes between them .
This would be Aristide 's second return from exile .
He was ousted by a military coup in 1991 but Bill Clinton , when he was president , returned him to power in 1994 following a US intervention that forced out the military regime .
Aristide fled Haiti again in February 2004 , leaving before dawn on a US plane as rebels approached the capital .
He accused American diplomats of having kidnapped him , charges that Washington denied .
He continues to have powerful enemies in Haiti .
The same forces that made him leave in 2004 will consider his return to be a threat , and foreign powers that bankrolled the elections will also see him as a destabilising influence .
The first round was marred by massive fraud , with voters unable to find their names on electoral rolls and polling stations closing early – or not opening at all .
Voter turnout was at a 60-year low – only 22.9 % of those registered actually cast ballots .
In areas most affected by the earthquake the figure was half that , and it is not yet clear the situation will be vastly improved this time ."
2011-04-10,"Jacob Zuma is due to meet Muammar Gaddafi as part of an African Union peace effort , as Libyan government forces and rebels battle for control of the strategic eastern town of Ajdabiya .
The South African president and leaders from Mauritania , Congo , Mali and Uganda will also meet Libyan rebels in Benghazi as part of the AU diplomatic initiative .
South Africa voted in favour of UN resolution 1973 , which authorised military action in Libya to protect civilians , but Zuma subsequently criticised western air strikes against Gaddafi .
After criticism from his African National Congress party 's youth wing and political allies in the Communist party for voting for the resolution , Zuma accused the US and its allies of going against its "" letter and spirit "" .
The AU delegation arrives in Libya as Libyan government forces continue to push back the disorganised rebel forces .
The rebels said forces loyal to Gaddafi killed four of their fighters on Saturday in Ajdabiya , about 100 miles from their stronghold in Benghazi .
A Reuters witness near Ajdabiya 's eastern gate heard shooting and artillery fire and saw plumes of black smoke , suggesting Gaddafi 's forces had pushed towards the centre of the town .
"" There is resistance inside the city .
Gaddafi forces are fighting with rebels .
They have a presence inside , "" said a rebel at a checkpoint on Ajdabiya 's eastern fringes .
One rebel fighter , Hassan Bosayna , said eight Gaddafi loyalists and four rebels were killed on Saturday .
One of the rebels was shot in the forehead by a sniper .
Muftah , another rebel , said : "" There are Gaddafi forces inside Ajdabiya in sand - coloured Land Cruisers and we know there are Gaddafi snipers in civilian clothing in the city as well . ""
Rebels were firing rockets from pickup trucks into the desert on the outskirts of the town , possibly in an attempt to stop any flanking manoeuvre by Gaddafi loyalists .
The mostly untrained rebels have tried to reorganise and re - equip but were unable to hold their ground last week against Gaddafi 's better - armed forces in the oil terminal of Brega , west of Ajdabiya , the last major town on the Mediterranean coastal road before Benghazi to the north and the oil terminal of Tobruk further east .
Libya 's deputy foreign minister said government forces shot down two US - built helicopters being used by rebel forces .
Khaled Kaim accused the international community of double standards for allowing rebel forces to operate aircraft despite the existence of a no - fly zone over the country .
"" A clear violation was committed by the rebels to resolution 1973 relating to the no - fly zone .
The rebels used two Chinook helicopters and they were shot down "" near the eastern oil facilities of Brega , he said .
"" We have a question for the allied forces : Is this resolution made for the Libyan government only or everyone in Libya ? ""
Kaim 's claims could not be confirmed with the rebels , but journalists in the area described seeing at least one helicopter apparently engaged in fighting in the area on Saturday , although it appeared to be a Russian - built model .
The government forces still have most of the military aircraft in the country , but a few were taken by the rebels when some air force units defected .
Nato , which enforces the no - fly zone , said it has been applying it to both sides and on Saturday intercepted a rebel MiG-23 fighter jet and forced it back to the airport .
Nato forces continue to carry out air strikes against Gaddafi 's forces , destroying 17 tanks and damaging nine others , the alliance said on Saturday .
Rebels have bitterly criticised the alliance for giving insufficient support as government forces continue to push eastwards and for Nato attacks mistakenly against them ."
2011-04-11,"The Libyan leader , Muammar Gaddafi , has accepted a roadmap to a political solution to the deadlocked two - month - old conflict , South Africa 's president , Jacob Zuma , has said in Tripoli .
Zuma , who led a five - strong African Union ( AU ) delegation to the Libyan capital , said he was optimistic that a settlement would be reached .
The delegation , minus Zuma , who was leaving Libya on Sunday night , will travel to Benghazi today to present the plan to the rebel opposition leadership .
Referring to officials of the regime , Zuma told reporters inside Gaddafi 's compound at Bab al - Azizia that "" the brother leader delegation has accepted the roadmap as presented by us "" .
He also called on Nato to stop air strikes on Libyan military targets "" to give a ceasefire a chance "" .
Asked about the prospects of a deal , Zuma - who has had a close relationship with Gaddafi , said : "" I am optimistic . ""
An AU official later said the plan included an immediate ceasefire , the delivery of humanitarian aid , the protection of foreign nationals in Libya , and dialogue between Libyan parties on the establishment of a transition period towards political reform .
He would not comment on whether the discussions with the Libyan leader had included the possibility of him relinquishing power .
But , he added , "" the AU considers it 's up the to the Libyan people to choose democratically their leaders "" .
However , opposition forces insist they will not consider any deal that involves Gaddafi or his family retaining power .
Proposals put forward by the regime so far have included Gaddafi or one of his sons overseeing political change in Libya .
It is far from clear how this gap could be bridged . ""
The delegation ... will be proceeding to meet the other party , to talk to everybody and present a political solution to the problem in Libya , "" Zuma said .
"" We also ... are making a call on Nato to cease the bombings to give a ceasefire a chance . ""
The AU said it was speaking to "" all partners "" in the Libyan crisis , hinting at consultations with the US , Nato and European countries .
The AU delegation , consisting of the presidents of South Africa , Congo - Brazzaville , Mali and Mauritania , plus Uganda 's foreign minister , landed at Tripoli 's Mitiga airport after Nato gave permission for their aircraft to enter Libyan airspace .
The planes were the first to land in Tripoli since the international coalition imposed a no - fly zone over the country more than two weeks ago .
Gaddafi later drove among the thousands of chanting supporters who gather daily at his compound to pledge their loyalty and act as a human shield against Nato airstrikes .
Gaddafi 's public appearances have become less frequent as the crisis has progressed .
The AU initiative came as Nato air strikes once again pulled the rebels back from significant defeat by stalling a government assault on the strategic town of Ajdabiya , the gateway to the revolutionaries ' de facto capital , Benghazi .
Nato said its forces destroyed 11 tanks around Ajdabiya and 14 tanks on the outskirts of Misrata , the sole rebel - dominated town in the west of the country , which has seen fighting for about six weeks . ""
The situation in Ajdabiya and Misrata in particular is desperate for those Libyans who are being brutally shelled by the [ Gaddafi ] regime , "" said Lieutenant General Charles Bouchard , the Canadian commander of Nato 's Libya operations .
A Red Cross ship docked in Misrata at the weekend , bringing medical supplies to civilians in the besieged port city , which is about 100 miles from Tripoli .
The Libyan government has refused to take journalists into Misrata , citing safety , but civilians and doctors contacted by phone have described coming under attack from shells and sniper fire .
Many of the victims are reported to be children .
Last week Nato said Misrata was its "" number one priority "" .
The air strikes in Ajdabiya , 90 miles from Benghazi , helped reverse days of setbacks for the rebels , during which Gaddafi 's forces fought their way into the heart of the town on Saturday .
Shelling around the southern entrance to Ajdabiya could be heard yesterday morning , but it died away in the afternoon following the air strikes .
Six vehicles carrying government soldiers were hit .
Their charred bodies were scattered around the still burning wreckage a few hours later . ""
Nato has to do this to help us every single day .
That is the only way we are going to win this war , "" one of the rebels , Tarek Obeidy , 25 , told Reuters .
The rebels said government forces shot down a Russian - made helicopter sent into the fight by the rebels two days earlier .
Nato forced a MiG jet fighting for the rebels to land .
Many areas were deserted after civilians fled the prospect of Gaddafi 's troops taking Ajdabiya for a second time in as many weeks .
Thousands of rounds of discarded bullet casings marked the site of some of the most intense fighting over the weekend .
The sudden change in the rebels ' fortunes again demonstrated how reliant they are on Nato air strikes to hold off government assaults .
Nato faces humiliation if Gaddafi 's army forces its way through Ajdabiya to threaten Benghazi , in defence of which Nato launched the air strikes .
There is little sign of rebel defences there other than a line of artillery 15 miles from the city .
Libyan officials said the regime was preparing a new constitution , although they failed to give details or say whether Gaddafi would retain power .
One official , Ibrahim Moukhzam , said : "" Constitutions are not designed to fit around individuals .
They are designed to serve the nation and any citizen can find a place for them in this constitution .
Muammar Gaddafi as a Libyan individual can find his place in the constitution .
The vast majority of people want him to stay .
He is a symbol .
He has many jobs and tasks .
"" Asked if it would be a presidential republic or another political system , Moukhzam said it would be a "" Libyan version "" .
Meanwhile , four western journalists are believed to be in the custody after being detained near Brega , in the east of the country , last week , and a photographer for the Associated Press , who became separated from colleagues near Ajdabiya , has been found ."
2011-04-19,"Jacob Zuma had to wait four months before really enjoying his Christmas gift .
Last Thursday , on China 's Hainan island , the South African president joined his counterparts from Brazil , Russia , India and China for the third summit meeting of the informal group named after the initials of its members .
Formerly Bric , it is now the Brics club .
The invitation to join the group was issued on 24 December .
Zuma had worked hard , visiting each of the Bric members in 2010 , and he was rewarded with a diplomatic victory .
He lost no time endorsing his new partners ' concerns about the massive influx of foreign assets currently plaguing emerging countries , where yields are higher than in developed nations .
Initially the decision to bring South Africa into the club prompted surprise , even incomprehension .
How could this economic dwarf be a member , with Mexico , South Korea and Turkey still left out in the cold ?
South Africa 's gross domestic product only amounts to one - sixteenth of China 's output , it only has 50 million inhabitants and annual growth barely exceeds 3.5 % , far behind China ( 10.3 % last year ) .
Thanks to their booming economies , the four other Brics members will contribute 60 % of global growth in 2014 , according to the IMF . ""
For South Africa to be treated as part of Bric does n't make any sense to me , "" commented Jim O'Neill last December .
The chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management International , who originally coined the acronym , added , "" But South Africa as a representative of the African continent is a different story . ""
In choosing to broaden their constituency the Brics countries have made a significant move .
This is no longer an artificial body founded on comparable economic performance , but increasingly a political club representing the developing world , determined to counterbalance western influence in major international forums .
At their meeting in Sanya the five leaders discussed reform of the world 's financial bodies .
Zuma echoed demands by India and Brazil for a permanent seat on the UN security council .
Of course South African membership of this select club is connected to the race to grab the mineral resources emerging nations so badly need .
Not only is it the world 's fourth largest source of gold and diamonds , it is also sitting on more than three - quarters of global platinum reserves .
China became its top trading partner in 2009 .
Zuma has also presented South Africa as the gateway to the African continent and its 1 billion potential consumers . ""
South Africa provides the institutional stability , depth of financial markets , and regulatory efficiency that many corporates will look to capitalise on as a base for wider pan - African operations , "" notes a study by the Standard Bank ( one of the country 's four largest banks ) .
There are nevertheless limits to how far this argument can be taken , given the continent 's political complexity . ""
The future for South Africa is with the African market and it is a risky ploy to help competitors to enter it , "" warns Lyal White , head of the Centre for Dynamic Markets at Pretoria University . ""
Instead South African firms need to attract investors from Bric countries and then develop in other parts of the continent . ""
Zuma , who has promised to create 5 m jobs by 2020 , took 70 business executives with him to the Sanya summit . ""
Shoprite , a big retail firm , has huge potential for growth in India , but the government has so far refused to let it in .
Now there is a great opportunity to negotiate , "" says Simon Freemantle , a research analyst at Standard Bank .
"" Our banking and financial sectors are pretty sophisticated and have a strong hand to play in these countries , "" adds Dawie Roodt , chief economist of Efficient Group .

2011-05-28,"Nato has only one question as it prepares to unleash Apache helicopters against the forces of Muammar Gaddafi this week , and Captain Ali Mohammed , one of the defenders of the besieged rebel city of Misrata , can supply the answer .
If , as most pundits predict , tomorrow 's peace mission to Tripoli by South African president Jacob Zuma fails , Nato will hit the Libyan leader harder than it has ever hit him before .
British Apaches , together with French Tiger attack helicopters , will launch surgical strikes on Gaddafi 's forces besieging Misrata .
They have the ability to destroy individual gun positions in the town of Zlitan , west of Misrata , with less risk to the civilian population kept there as human shields .
But there is a problem .
This kind of war takes time , and time is the commodity Nato does not have as critics complain it has extended the original United Nations no - fly zone mandate into what is regime change in all but name .
The big question is whether the defenders will crumble under the onslaught , or fight with the same tenacity shown by their rebel enemy in Misrata . ""
If you use Apaches , it is sure they will run away , "" said Mohammed .
"" There is a big difference between Gaddafi 's men and ourselves .
I am defending my home , my family , my city .
But Gaddafi 's forces do not believe in what they are doing .
"" The captain has led a band of fighters in this shell - scarred city , not just surviving the onslaught but pushing pro - Gaddafi forces back to the outskirts .
Yet Gaddafi 's troops continue to rain death on the city outskirts , which shuddered under a bombardment of hundreds of mortars and missiles on Friday , fired from launchers too far back for the rebels to counter .
To respond , they need the Apaches , four of which are on the helicopter carrier HMS Ocean , cruising somewhere beyond the horizon visible from Mohammed 's position .
A second vessel , the French amphibious assault carrier Tonnerre , has four equally ferocious Tiger attack helicopters , plus a dozen of the more elderly Gazelles .
All are armed with Hellfire missiles which have the ability to be launched from five miles off with pinpoint accuracy , precisely destroying gun positions and machine gun nests , leaving the local civilians unharmed .
It is these weapons that the alliance hopes will finally break the will of Gaddafi 's forces .
Fast jets continue pounding targets in both Tripoli and behind the front lines .
In the skies across Libya , British and American Reaper drones , which can stay on patrol for 14 hours , circle endlessly .
They watch the few highways out of Tripoli day and night , using their own Hellfire missiles to destroy any vehicle they see , in effect making it impossible for Gaddafi to reinforce or supply his units at Misrata and those further west near Benghazi .
But his firepower has its limits .
The UN resolution mandating Nato 's action prohibits the use of ground troops , leaving the alliance needing to win with only the lightly armed rebel troops to actually take and hold ground .
Additionally , Apaches are vulnerable ; slow and ponderous , they dare not venture over enemy territory for risk of being shot down by machine gun fire .
Instead they are likely to linger over rebel lines , engaging only Libyan positions in the immediate vicinity .
Given enough time , the Apaches can take out gun positions one by one , but time is not on Nato 's side .
Many members , notably Germany and Turkey , were reluctant partners from the start and at the United Nations China and Russia have complained that the western alliance did not consult over the extension of a mandate designed to protect civilians into what is a full - scale war .
Nato needs victory quickly by breaking the will of Gaddafi 's troops .
"" Sixty per cent of Gaddafi 's army do not want to fight , "" says Abdulla Ali , a rebel army spokesman in Misrata .
"" They are forced there .
If they do not fight they are shot . ""
Mohammed says Nato has instructed his forces to stay behind a "" red line "" marked out along the Misrata front , allowing Nato to kill anything it sees west of that line .
It is an instruction he intends to obey .
His dark eyes betray the strain of fighting through the streets of his city for the past 70 days .
He stands , clad in a green shirt , pale jeans and black sandals amid a sand - encrusted checkpoint of corrugated iron and a few battered plastic chairs .
Around his chest is the shoulder strap of a battered AK-47 machine gun , on his shirt a small badge with the picture of Ramadan Swehli , hero of the city 's resistance against Italian occupation nearly a century ago , superimposed over the rebel red , green and black tricolour .
However , before the Apaches are unleashed , Nato has decided to give diplomacy a final shot .
The key part of this plan fell into place on Friday when Russia 's president Dmitry Medvedev announced – possibly through gritted teeth – that he now supported Nato 's demand that Gaddafi step down immediately and unconditionally .
That message will be delivered by Zuma in Tripoli tomorrow , coupled with the threat that if the Libyan leader refuses , Nato will unleash what will be the heaviest attack the alliance has mounted .
Yesterday brought a clear sign of its increasing impatience with the regime as a rare daytime air strike was launched on the capital of Tripoli .
For diplomats , the problem is not with Zuma 's negotiating skills , but with the fact that the message he conveys to Gaddafi offers no carrots , only sticks .
Capitulation means he faces certain death if he stays in Libya .
If he flees , any country willing to take him will shortly receive demands from the UN to hand him over to the International Criminal Court , whose judges are expected to issue an arrest warrant for crimes against humanity within weeks .
The chief prosecutor , Luis Moreno Ocampo , has already called for one of his sons , Saif , to be indicted , and more charges against three more members of the regime are expected to follow later this year .
In Misrata , few rebels expect the Libyan dictator to agree to step down , even in the face of Nato 's bolstered firepower . ""
He will not listen – he will stay and fight , "" said Osama Alfitory , a fighter from Benghazi who volunteered to come and help in Misrata , for him a brother - city .
"" This guy is insane .
I think he believes he will win in the end . ""
Nato hopes that if its renewed assault begins – which could happen as early as Tuesday night – Gaddafi 's army will start to think differently ."
2011-05-29,"African Union leaders are due to arrive in Tripoli on Monday in a last - ditch attempt to broker a diplomatic end to the fighting in Libya in advance of a sharp escalation expected this week , when British and French attack helicopters join the fray .
South Africa 's president , Jacob Zuma , will meet Muammar Gaddafi , who has so far defied efforts to force him to yield to western - backed pro - democracy rebels .
It is unclear whether Zuma will use his rapport with Gaddafi to ask him to leave Libya .
Even a personal appeal seems unlikely to succeed , as Gaddafi has told confidantes that it would betray the memory of his son Saif al - Arab to surrender power , and instead he wants to assume a background role while civil institutions are allowed to emerge from his four - decade rule .
But Britain and France , which are spearheading the strikes on Libya , have insisted Gaddafi leave , paving the way for the Benghazi - based Transitional National Council ( TNC ) to hold elections .
The other members of the G8 , Canada , Germany , Italy , Japan , Russia and the US , also called on Friday for Gaddafi to step down .
Moustafa Adul Jalil , chair of the TNC in Benghazi , said : "" The only condition for holding talks on resolving the crisis is that Gaddafi , his inner circle and his family have no future in the political arena of Libya and they must leave .
We only welcome the proposition regarding the ceasefire and peace settlement based on this condition . ""
The arrival of attack helicopters off the Libyan coast has left Gaddafi loyalists fearing an onslaught on ground forces that could clear the way for rebels in central Libya to advance on the capital .
The helicopters are expected to first be deployed on the outskirts of Misrata , which has been the scene of the most protracted and vicious fighting over the past three months .
Repeat Nato bombing raids have cleared the way for an untrained rebel army to seize most of Misrata .
But Gaddafi 's forces remain on the western outskirts of the city , from where they are still shelling rebel positions to the east .
Nato jets have so far limited their targets to Libyan government armour , radar installations , navy ships and sites they have identified as command and control centres used to direct attacks .
The six - hour journey by road from Misrata to Tripoli is now largely free of armour and is guarded by checkpoints staffed by soldiers carrying light weapons .
Flatbed lorries that had transported tanks to the front lines lay abandoned in olive groves near the western city of Al - Khums when the Guardian visited last week , and there were no obvious signs of missile batteries , heavy artillery , or any large weaponry that could pose a threat to the low - flying helicopters .
Tripoli was again hit by bombs dropped from Nato jets over the weekend , with Gaddafi 's compound in the centre of the capital struck repeatedly .
Watchtowers around Gaddafi 's compound
Bab al - Azizia , in Tripoli , were blown up in raids that the RAF said were designed to show Libyans that impenetrable compounds were a thing of the past .
The TNC has been given semi - legitimacy as a government by Paris , London and Washington , which have all hosted Abdul Jalil and have sent training staff and money to the nascent organisation .
On Sunday , Libyan officials were sticking to their position that the African Union 's plan for a negotiated ceasefire , followed by international supervisors arriving in Libya , would be the only way to end the conflict .
However , deputy foreign minister Khaled Khaim refused to comment on whether an exit strategy for Gaddafi would be discussed .
A former French foreign minister , who is visiting Libya as a lawyer to prepare a legal case on behalf of victims of Nato bombing , meanwhile said he was prepared to defend Gaddafi if he is sent to The Hague .
Roland Dumas , who served as foreign minister under FranÃ§ois Mitterrand , claimed he had seen several civilian victims of Nato bombing in a hospital and had been told by a doctor that there were as many as 20,000 more .
Nato says it has struck only military targets .
Despite promises by Gaddafi officials , journalists in Tripoli have been shown no evidence of large numbers of civilians killed or injured by Nato bombing .
"" This is brutal , brutal aggression against a sovereign country , "" Dumas told a news conference attended by people introduced as family members and supporters of relatives of civilian casualties .
"" At the moment we have been retained , we have a mandate on behalf of the victims of the military bombardment of NATO , who carried out their military action against civilians with the artificial - very artificial - cover of the United Nations , "" Dumas said .
"" Following an approach by the government of Libya , we have decided to make this trip to see for ourselves the condition of the victims and the situation , "" he said .
Dumas was accompanied by prominent French defence lawyer Jacques Verges , who said his goal was to "" unmask those assassins "" responsible for Nato air strikes .
Verges said he had wept in hospital upon meeting civilians wounded "" solely because they are Libyans "" .
Verges - whose clients have included Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie - and Dumas had been among lawyers expected to defend ousted Ivory Coast president Laurent Gbagbo , who is being investigated for alleged human rights abuses during the conflict sparked by the disputed 2010 presidential election .
Their names were dropped from the most recent list of Gbagbo 's lawyers .
Dumas was not able to describe the exact nature of the case he intended to launch on behalf of the wounded victims , but told Reuters he would make a more detailed announcement after returning to France and studying the case in more depth ."
2011-05-30,"South Africa 's president , Jacob Zuma , said on Monday night that Muammar Gaddafi was ready for a truce but gave no indication whether the Libyan leader was ready to give up power , as rebels and much of the international community are demanding .
Gaddafi made a rare public appearance for the meeting with Zuma , the South African 's second attempt to broker a ceasefire on behalf of the African Union .
Libya 's leader , who has been turned into a fugitive in his own capital by the ongoing Nato air strikes , welcomed Zuma at the Bab al - Aziziyah presidential compound wearing his trademark dark glasses .
But he appeared healthy , dispelling rumours he had been injured in the air strike that killed his son Saif al - Arab at the beginning of this month .
Gaddafi is reported to have shown Zuma the site of that attack .
Zuma said later Gaddafi was "" ready to implement the road map "" – a reference to an AU peace plan involving a ceasefire and agreement on humanitarian supplies and reforms .
The roadmap has already been rejected by the Benghazi - based rebels , and by Nato .
Zuma said Gaddafi had insisted that "" all Libyans be given a chance to talk among themselves "" to determine the country 's future , but made no mention of the Libyan leader 's possible departure .
His office denied rebel claims that the South African president had raised the subject .
The rebels ' morale was boosted by the dramatic defection of more senior Libyan officials .
Eight officers – five generals , two colonels and a major – told a news conference in Rome organised by the Italian government that they were among 120 to have abandoned Gaddafi in the past few days .
The officers said they had defected in protest at Gaddafi 's actions against his own people , citing killings of civilians and violence against women .
One of the eight accused pro - Gaddafi forces of genocide .
They claimed Gaddafi 's campaign against the rebels was rapidly weakening .
General Melud Massoud Halasa told reporters that Gaddafi 's forces were "" only 20 % as effective "" as before the rebellion , as "" not more than 10 "" generals remained loyal to him .
The defections come at a time of intense military pressure on the regime , with the use of British and French helicopter gunships expected in the next few days .
Meanwhile , armed westerners have been filmed on the frontline with rebels in the first apparent confirmation that foreign special forces are playing an active role in the Libyan conflict .
A group of six westerners are clearly visible in a report by al - Jazeera from Dafniya , described as the westernmost point of the rebel lines west of Misrata .
Five of them were armed and wearing sand - coloured clothes , baseball caps and cotton Arab scarves .
The sixth , apparently the most senior of the group , was carrying no visible weapon and wore a pink , short - sleeve shirt .
He may be an intelligence officer .
The group is seen talking to rebels and quickly leaving on being spotted by the television crew .
There have been numerous reports in the British press that SAS soldiers are acting as spotters in Libya to help Nato warplanes target pro - Gaddafi forces .
In March , six special forces soldiers and two MI6 officers were detained by rebel fighters when they landed on an abortive mission to meet rebel leaders in Benghazi , in an embarrassing episode for the SAS .
The group was withdrawn soon afterwards and a new "" liaison team "" sent in its place .
Asked for comment on Monday , a Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said : "" We do n't have any forces out there . ""
The subject is sensitive as the UN security council resolution in March authorising the use of force in Libya specifically excludes "" a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory "" .
Despite more than two months of bombing by Nato , rebels have remained unable to advance west of Misrata , or west of Brega , 300 miles to the east .
The capital , Tripoli , also remains in the grip of Gaddafi .
In April , William Hague announced that an expanded military liaison team would be dispatched to work with the Benghazi - based Transitional National Council , which is positioning itself as a democratic alternative to Gaddafi 's rule .
The foreign secretary said the team would help the rebels improve "" organisational structures , communications and logistics "" but stressed : "" Our officers will not be involved in training or arming the opposition 's fighting forces , nor will they be involved in the planning or execution of the [ TNC 's ] military operations or in the provision of any other form of operational military advice .
"" There were unconfirmed reports at the time that Britain would send former SAS members and other experienced soldiers to Libya under the cover of private security companies , paid for by Arab states , to train the anti - government forces ."
2011-06-02,"On Monday , the South African president , Jacob Zuma , once again went to Tripoli in an attempt to broker a peace deal between Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and the opposition forces .
As expected , he failed .
But mediation or ceasefire initiatives such as South Africa 's , and others encouraged elsewhere , have something wrong with them : they offer Gaddafi a lifeline at a point when he is facing an increase in defections and significant opposition progress on the battlefield , and when he is becoming increasingly isolated internationally – as shown last week when Russia shifted its position by calling on him to stand down .
It is clear that the west , in the form of the Nato - led coalition , has a strategy in Libya and it is working .
It should be left alone .
Three key components have comprised this strategy , the explicit objective of which has been to end Gaddafi 's reign of terror and the heart of which has been to ensure the Libyan uprising remains a Libyan - dominated enterprise , and not a western one .
First , western military strategy has , at the outset , been to hit Gaddafi , give the opposition a chance to progress and then hit the regime harder where progress was insufficient .
As part of this effort , rather than utilise its military capacity to full effect , Nato has limited its engagement to a gradual process of intensification , an approach that ensures progress – and , indeed , western involvement – depends on the efforts of Libyans on the ground .
For example , since the start of its operations in Libya three months ago , the west has resisted repeated opposition demands for attack helicopters .
I was witness to these desperate calls in Benghazi when , in a meeting , one senior opposition official called on the British envoy to Benghazi , Christopher Prentice , to deploy attack helicopters that could accurately and effectively attack regime targets .
Three months later , and after massive civilian casualties in besieged Misrata and other towns and cities in western Libya , the west has only just decided to deploy these helicopters , but at a point when a more organised and effective opposition army has made good progress and is now capable of making further progress on the battlefield .
Alongside training and advising opposition forces , the third key and under - appreciated part of this strategy of gradual military intensification has been the encouragement of political and military defections and , therefore , the crumbling of the regime from within .
It is working .
The latest high - profile defection to further demoralise the regime was that of Shukri Ghanem , the regime 's oil minister and former prime minister .
He was followed by the defection of eight Libyan army officers , including five generals , who were part of a wider group of 120 military personnel that defected in recent days .
Nato must as a result continue its job and work in tandem with and at the behest of the Libyan revolutionaries .
In fact , it will do well to consider formulating its current strategy into a benchmark for future military engagements – a strategy based not just on working in partnership with indigenous populations in the fight against dictatorship but also , first , their own capacity to fight and , second , efforts to train and possibly arm them when necessary .
Conversely , calls for a peaceful settlement with Gaddafi and his inner circle , made simplistically without any serious effort to define its terms , make no helpful contribution .
The most a ceasefire proposal can call for is a transitional , face - saving process that brings Gaddafi and/or one of his sons , along with the opposition , into a power - sharing arrangement that , at best and at some point , leads to elections .
As well as the array of problems likely to follow – including Gaddafi using the opportunity to reorganise himself and consolidate his position , as well as the bloodbath that will ensue in prison cells and far - flung compounds that the west will never know about – any such proposal would require mediation and monitoring by outsiders in the form of the UN and potentially the African Union .
It would also require a sizeable ground force to ensure both sides commit to the ceasefire and that there is an effective keeping of the peace .
That , however , would diverge from the lessons learned from post - conflict management in Iraq : any peace proposal that operates around conditions laid down by outsiders , and not Libyans , will be tantamount to an international trusteeship that will open up a Pandora 's box of problems .
For example , proponents of a negotiated ceasefire do not explain how regime loyalists should be dealt with as part of their grand plans or , more problematic still , what "" monitors "" would do if loyalists or anti - regime opposition forces are hunted down and killed systematically in a manner similar to post-2003 Iraq .
It is these realities that have to be considered when making calls for a ceasefire , which is right in principle but reckless in practice .
Nato should stick to its strategy , one that will eventually encourage other hardline regime elements to force Gaddafi and his sons out or , alternatively , force Gaddafi to accept that he is fighting a losing battle and flee the country – but only once the opposition comes knocking on the doors of Tripoli .
It is toward this objective that Nato and the international community should aim , since it is only once the opposition is on the brink of embarking upon and liberating Tripoli that the Gaddafis and their inner circle will accept their fate could be determined by their enemies .
Either way , it is Libyans who must choose how this conflict will end ."
2011-06-03,"South Africa is mourning Albertina Sisulu , a "" colossus "" of the struggle against apartheid , who has died aged 92 .
President Jacob Zuma led tributes to Sisulu , whose late husband , Walter , was a Robben Island prisoner and mentor to Nelson Mandela .
She had been watching TV at her home in Johannesburg on Thursday night when she had a coughing fit and slumped in her chair .
Paramedics were called but could not revive her .
Walter Sisulu married Albertina Notsikelelo in 1944 , with Mandela as best man .
The couple 's romance endured for more than half a century .
"" We loved each other very much , "" she once said .
"" We were like two chickens .
One always walking behind the other . ""
The Star newspaper said in a front page headline : "" A love story ends . ""
Walter Sisulu , who died in 2003 , spent 25 years on Robben Island alongside Mandela , whom he had brought into the African National Congress .
Albertina Sisulu was left behind to raise the couple 's five children .
She spent months in jail herself and her movements were restricted .
Trained as a nurse , Albertina campaigned for the rights of women and children .
She was a leader of the United Democratic Front , a vital anti - apartheid coalition in the 1980s , and also a leader in the ANC and its women 's league . ""
Over the years I got used to prison , banning and detention , "" she once said .
"" I did not mind going to jail myself and I had to learn to cope without Walter . ""
But when my children went to jail , I felt that the [ oppressors ] were breaking me at the knees .
"" She also served in parliament , winning a seat after the first multiracial elections in 1994 and serving four years .
It was she who nominated Mandela as president ; he was then unanimously elected by MPs .
Stalwarts of the long fight against white minority rule paid homage to her .
Zuma said : "" A matriarch and a nurse by profession , Mama Sisulu was one of the foremost mothers of the nation and the last of the colossuses of the struggle for the liberation of South Africa . ""
He added : "" While we mourn her loss , we must thank her most profoundly for the selfless service to all South Africans and humanity at large , for her generosity of spirit and for teaching the nation humility , respect for human dignity and compassion for the weak , the poor and the downtrodden . ""
The Nelson Mandela Foundation , representing the 92-year - old former president , said : "" A stalwart in our freedom struggle and in the early years of our new democracy and a pillar of strength for the Sisulu family when her husband Walter was in jail , she served as an example of selflessness and service . ""
As Nelson Mandela said in 2003 at the opening of the Walter Sisulu Paediatric Cardiac Centre , ' She deserves so much credit for the quality of a life of service that Walter led .
Her own sacrifice and service deserve as much of our respect and recognition . '
"" Mandela 's ex - wife , Winnie Madikizela - Mandela , said : "" The country has lost one of the greatest stalwarts .
It 's a great tragedy to lose her at a time when the country needs wisdom of her kind .
We thank God that she lived a full life . ""
Sisulu lived to see her children take prominent positions in post - apartheid , democratic South Africa .
Her daughter , Lindiwe Sisulu , is defence minister , while her son , Max Sisulu , is speaker of the national assembly ."
2011-06-27,"Muammar Gaddafi 's foreign minister is in Tunisia today to discuss a possible settlement to the ongoing conflict in Libya .
A settlement should be welcomed , but it has to begin with the departure of Gaddafi and his inner circle from Libya .
The problem is that there can be no way forward with Gaddafi still in place – which is why South African president Jacob Zuma has already failed twice to end the conflict through a political settlement .
There have been similar difficulties in Yemen where Arab Gulf states have sought – and so far failed – to implement a "" transition "" plan that does not require President Saleh 's immediate resignation .
A recent proposal relating to Libya from the International Crisis Group suffers from the same flaw .
The ICG envisages a two - phase road to peace where , firstly , peacekeeping forces are deployed so as to facilitate talks and allow for humanitarian assistance and , secondly , where a mutual declaration of a ceasefire leads to negotiations between the regime and the opposition Interim National Council ( INC ) .
The ICG argues that preserving Gaddafi and his inner circle is necessary , to ensure there is someone with the authority to deliver a ceasefire .
The problem , however , is what to do if Gaddafi proves unable or unwilling to deliver a ceasefire .
The ICG 's extensive report has no suggestions for dealing with this rather likely eventuality .
The ICG seems to want to keep Gaddafi , to avoid "" political chaos and collapse into a kind of warlordism "" .
But that would only happen if the entire political and security apparatus in the country were disbanded , as in post-2003 Iraq .
There is nothing to suggest that the INC , once in power , would embark upon such a course .
Another report , from the Royal United Services Institute ( RUSI ) , calls for a transitional "" face - saving process "" that would see Gaddafi hand power over to one of his sons , who would then hand power over to a regime insider , who would then establish an interim "" unity "" government with loyalist representation .
Unlike the ICG , RUSI at least maintains the option to resume hostilities and enforce resolution 1973 should the regime fail to abide by any settlement terms .
However , once military operations are halted it is going to be extremely difficult to restart them .
If this "" face - saving "" approach were adopted , the debate would switch from a simple issue of whether Gaddafi should go to the never - ending question of whether Gaddafi has had enough time to comply .
The problem is principally one of determining when and whether a brutal , authoritarian regime has failed to keep its promises .
Halting overt military action by the regime is only one part of the problem .
No international peacekeeping force will be able to shut down Gaddafi 's secret police , who are likely to continue their killings and torture in prison cells and far - flung compounds that the outside world will never know about .
Nor would the international community be in a position to do much about the repression of opponents and the detention of hundreds if not thousands of Free Libya activists , journalists and human - rights defenders .
In other words , a policing role will not be feasible or sustainable .
But there is something abhorrent about encouraging power - sharing between a dictator and a democratic , revolutionary force just when the former , an established force for instability that has proven it can not be trusted , is gradually being defeated by the military , and while defections from inside the regime are continuing .
It is vitally important that any ceasefire or political settlement gives no reason for Gaddafi to believe the international resolve for defeating him is diminishing .
Equally , there must be no reason for the people of Libya to fear that the vicious dictator will ever be in a position to exact revenge upon them ."
2011-07-27,"A man has been convicted of assault for spilling a glass of whisky on South African president Jacob Zuma .
Daryl Peense says the incident at a horse race in Durban in 2010 was a drunken accident .
But the 34-year - old racehorse owner was found guilty at a magistrates ' court in the city on Wednesday .
The court heard that Peense deliberately spilt the drink on Zuma from a balcony as the South African president walked underneath him .
Zuma 's bodyguard , constable Funani Nemaenzhe , told the court he saw Peense pour a drink from a balcony on to the president 's entourage .
Peense said he spilt the drink near Zuma but it did not touch him .
Legal fees for fighting the assault charge had ruined him financially .
"" It 's destroyed my life . ""
Peense is due to be sentenced in September .
Prosecutors have asked for him to be fined .
In another incident in 2010 , police detained Chumani Maxwele , a 25-year - old sociology student at Cape Town University , for 24 hours for allegedly gesturing with his middle finger at Zuma 's motorcade .
Maxwele said he was bundled into a police vehicle at gunpoint , had a bag pulled over his head and was intimidated , threatened and taken to court on charges of crimen injuria – the common - law South African crime of "" injuring dignity "" – and resisting arrest .
Helen Zille , of the Democratic Alliance , said the police actions were "" reminiscent of Robert Mugabe 's Zimbabwe , which the African National Congress is increasingly trying to emulate "" .
Five years ago Mugabe amended Zimbabwe 's traffic legislation to make it a crime to swear or gesture rudely at his motorcade .
South Africa 's human rights commission ordered the police minister to apologise to Maxwele .
It said Zuma 's bodyguards had violated Maxwele 's right to privacy and dignity ."
2011-08-19,"A firebrand youth leader seen as a threat to Jacob Zuma 's hopes of re - election as South African president faces possible expulsion from the governing African National Congress ( ANC ) .
Julius Malema , arguably the most colourful and divisive figure in South African politics , was charged with bringing the ANC into disrepute after calling for the overthrow of the democratically - elected government of neighbouring Botswana .
Analysts believe the public disciplinary measures could reflect a desire by Zuma and other party leaders to crush the youth league president , whose provocative outbursts on topics such as race relations and nationalisation of the mining industry are a thorn in their side . ""
Comrade Julius Malema has been charged with various violations of the ANC constitution , including bringing the ANC into disrepute through his utterances and statements on Botswana and sowing divisions in the ranks , "" the party said on Friday . ""
Comrade Malema will have an opportunity to defend himself against these charges in a properly convened hearing .
He will be entitled to be represented by a member of the ANC whose membership is in good standing . ""
Sources close to Malema , 30 , said the charges took him by surprise and that senior ANC figures plan to push for his expulsion in two weeks .
The ANC fined Malema 10,000 rand ( £ 840 ) and ordered him to attend anger management classes last year after he was found guilty of undermining Zuma .
A disciplinary committee further ruled that if he was found guilty of dividing the party again within two years , his membership would be suspended .
The youth league announced three weeks ago plans to establish a "" Botswana command team "" to unite the opposition in that country against "" the puppet regime "" led by President Ian Khama .
The statement caused international embarrassment and was swiftly condemned by the mother party .
Malema issued a belated apology .
This was the latest in a series of incendiary statements by the populist youth leader , who branded a BBC journalist "" a bloody agent "" and threw him out of a press conference , and insisted that white South Africans should be treated as "" criminals "" for stealing land from black people .
He recently paid a R50,000 ( £ 4,207 ) fine to People
Opposing Women Abuse after being convicted of hate speech , and was taken to court for singing an apartheid - era protest song containing the words "" shoot the Boer "" .
Perhaps most damagingly , Malema is under growing pressure from revelations about his financial affairs .
South African media have reported that a senior anti - corruption official plans an investigation into the awarding of government contracts to a firm linked to him .
To date none of this has prevented Malema making waves in the ANC where , it is widely reported , he has powerful sponsors in a faction trying to block Zuma at a conference next year to elect the party 's leaders .
This week the South African Sunday Times reported that Zuma threw Malema out of a meeting demanding : "" Who do you think you are , you think you are in charge of this country ? ""
Makashule Gana , youth leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance , said : "" It is a pity this urgency does not stretch to the multimillion - rand corruption allegations against Malema .
These allegations have so far gone unchallenged , un - repudiated and un - investigated by the ANC leadership .
We reiterate our call for the ANC to show it is serious about corruption by holding its cadres to account .
The South African public care more about Malema 's dubious enrichment than internal ANC factional battles . ""
Fiona Forde , author of the unauthorised biography An Inconvenient Youth : Julius Malema And The "" New "" ANC , said a showdown became inevitable after Malema 's re - election as youth league president this year .
"" This is a 30-year - old who has been redefining South African politics and is part of a 100-year - old movement , "" she said .
"" The ANC should have acted a long time ago but they waited and stood by and did nothing .
I think they were hoping Malema would not be re - elected for a second term .
He was re - elected and the first thing he did was talk about Botswana .
It was the straw that broke the camel 's back .
He 's spoken out of turn and done more serious things in the past and nothing happened .
Now they are looking for a way to nail him . ""
The move should be seen in the context of the threat posed by Malema to Zuma 's ambition to retain power , Forde added .
"" It 's about December 2012 when the party goes to the next leadership conference and Zuma knows he has to control Malema if he is to comfortably secure himself a second term . ""
Aubrey Matshiqi , research fellow at the Helen Suzman foundation , said : "" There 's growing pressure externally and internally on the ANC to act against Julius Malema .
The question is whether this stand is going to unite or divide the party .
"" We must remember that Malema is already on a suspended sentence .
If he is found guilty , his membership will be suspended .
On the other hand , if he decides to mobilise against this decision , he faces the possibility of expulsion . """
2011-08-25,"Civil rights groups in South Africa have condemned Jacob Zuma 's choice for the role of the country 's top judge , arguing that the nominee 's views on gender equality and marital rape "" make a mockery "" of the country 's constitutional rights .
Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng was a surprise pick for the position of chief justice , with many critics arguing that he lacked the experience and qualifications of rival candidates .
His apparently socially conservative views have also come under scrutiny because , as the head of South Africa 's constitutional court , he will be responsible for upholding one of the most progressive constitutions in the world .
Documents seen by the Guardian detail appeal cases at the superior court over the past decade in which Mogoeng 's judgments are being questioned by gender and legal activists .
One was a 2001 appeal by a man named Mathibe who tied a woman to the bumper of his car and "" drove that vehicle at a fairly high speed over a distance of about 50 metres "" .
Mogoeng ruled that the two - year sentence imposed was "" too harsh by any standards "" .
Among his reasons were that the accused had been "" provoked "" and "" the complainant did not sustain serious injuries "" .
Three years later a Mr Moipolai appealed against his sentence for the rape of his common law wife .
She was eight months pregnant , and another person was present during the attack .
Court records show Mogoeng upheld the conviction but reduced the 10-year sentence , meaning half was suspended for five years .
Marital rape is a crime in South Africa , but Mogoeng felt there were "" mitigating factors "" .
He listed these as : The appellant was a first offender ; the appellant and complainant were no strangers to each other ( they were lovers ) and said : "" But for the presence of [ another person ] , the appellant and complainant would probably have had consensual intercourse . ""
Another case was the 2007 appeal of a man named Modise , who had been jailed for five years for attempted rape .
He and his victim were undergoing a divorce and had not shared the same bed for almost a year .
One night , Modise went to the marital bedroom and later the complainant went to bed , where the incident took place .
Mogoeng was among the judges who suspended the man 's sentence , stating : "" The desire to make love to his wife must have overwhelmed him , hence his somewhat violent behaviour .
He , however , neither smacked , punched nor kicked her .
Minimum force , so to speak , was resorted to in order to subdue the complainant 's resistance . ""
The judges added : "" The case is not comparable to a case where a lady comes across a stranger on the street who suddenly attempts to rape her . ""
The documents – which also raised concerns over Mogoeng 's attitude to sexual orientation – are likely to intensify pressure on Zuma , who was cleared of a rape charge before his election as president , to rethink the nomination .
Louise Olivier , the law programme manager at the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa , said : "" The South African constitutional court has been regarded by jurists both internationally and on the continent as a model , socially and legally progressive and providing jurisprudence that protects and promotes human rights . ""
To appoint judge Mogoeng Mogoeng as its chief justice makes a mockery of the substantial constitutional advances made by the court .
His previous judgments on gender equality and marital rape indicate that he has scant regard for legal protections that most South Africans hold dear . ""
Olivier added : "" It also shows either that President Zuma 's legal counsel have not done their homework in finding these judgments , as it is unlikely that after reading them they would have advised him to recommend Mogoeng 's appointment , or his views on women 's rights and marital rape find resonance within the presidency . ""
South African media have reported that Mogoeng belongs to the Winners Chapel International church , which preaches that homosexuality is a perversion that can be cured .
The City Press newspaper said Mogoeng is a member of the Johannesburg branch and provides "" pastoral services "" , such as house visits , but does not preach .
There has already been a strong backlash against Zuma 's decision to overlook the deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke , widely seen as a formidable legal mind .
Pierre de Vos , an expert in constitutional law , said : "" It is as if president Zuma , acting like a spoilt child who could not get his way with the extension of the term of office of the outgoing chief justice because he relied on a clearly unconstitutional provision to do so , is now trying to get back at critics by indicating a wish to appoint one of the less suitable candidates to that post . """
2011-08-30,"Police in South Africa have used water cannon and stun grenades in battling with supporters of the leader of the youth wing of the African National Congress , who faces possible expulsion from the party in a power struggle with the country 's president , Jacob Zuma .
As tension within the ANC spilled out into public disorder , protesters backing Julius Malema , a charismatic and populist but consistently controversial figure , threw rocks and bottles at police , and burned ANC flags and posters of Zuma . ""
Zuma must go ! "" they chanted .
Riot police responded with water cannon and stun grenades , closing a series of streets near the ANC headquarters in central Johannesburg as vuvuzela - blowing Malema supporters tried to stop traffic .
Malema has been tipped as a possible successor to Zuma as party chief , a post that more or less guarantees the presidency in a country run by the ANC without break since the end of apartheid in 1994 .
However , he now faces a week - long disciplinary hearing , which could see him suspended from the ANC or permanently banned , casting him into the political wilderness .
The 30-year - old , who has attracted controversy for his campaign to nationalise South Africa 's hugely valuable mining industry , as well as a reportedly lavish lifestyle , was fined by an ANC disciplinary committee last year for allegedly undermining Zuma .
Malema was warned that his membership would be suspended if he was found guilty of dividing the party again within two years .
The penalty could be imposed if the committee agrees Malema brought the ANC into disrepute through a youth league statement calling for the overthrow of the democratically elected government of neighbouring Botswana .
It is a high - stakes game for both sides .
Zuma faces re - election as ANC chief next year and would welcome the sidelining of a critic who is a deeply divisive figure within the party .
While Malema has no direct role in making policy he is an influential figure with a committed power base , and it could badly damage Zuma were the president seen to be failing to overcome his adversary .
Speaking to reporters at the ANC 's headquarters , Malema said he would accept the committee 's verdict : "" If the ANC defines your future as expulsion , you need to accept that . ""
But , he added , he did not expect this to happen : ""
We have serious confidence in the leadership and organisation processes . ""
Malema also refused to budge on his calls for mining nationalisation , a position that has spooked foreign investors and brought warnings of international financial isolation .
He said : "" Nationalism will never change .
Expropriation without compensation will never change .
Whether you expel us or do n't expel us , these resolutions will never change . ""
Many of those battling police in central Johannesburg had been brought in on buses arranged by the youth wing .
The proposed mines nationalisation will be looked into at the same ANC meeting next year at which Zuma will seek re - election .
Malema has previously called a BBC journalist "" a bloody agent "" and thrown him out of a press conference , said a woman who accused Zuma of raping her had a "" nice time "" , and argued that white South Africans should be treated as "" criminals "" for stealing land from black people .
This year , he was also taken to court for singing an apartheid - era protest song containing the words "" shoot the Boer "" .
Perhaps most damaging in the long term have been a succession of allegations about Malema 's opulent lifestyle , and how it is financed .
The disciplinary panel is led by a senior ANC member , Derek Hanekom , and includes mining minister Susan Shabangu , who has criticised Malema 's calls for nationalisation .
They are hearing the cases of five youth league members alongside Malema .
At issue is a statement announcing plans to send a committee to Botswana to seek the removal of President Ian Khama , who the youth league accuses of co - operating with "" imperialists "" .
This was a particular embarrassment for Zuma , who has criticised Nato over its actions to remove the Gaddafi regime in Libya ."
2011-08-31,"South Africa 's ruling African National Congress has backed down in a power struggle with the controversial head of the party 's youth wing , reversing a decision to move a disciplinary hearing to a secret location following violence on Tuesday .
Officials said on Tuesday night that the hearing , which could suspend Julius Malema from the ANC , would be moved to an undisclosed location after clashes between riot police and Malema supporters outside the headquarters .
Police used water cannon and stun grenades against the crowds , who burned ANC flags and posters of South African president Jacob Zuma .
A party spokesman later said that Wednesday 's session would still go ahead at the ANC building .
But said the hearing could be moved if there was more trouble .
He did not explain the reason for the change , although local reports said Malema and his lawyers had objected to the original decision .
Addressing a crowd in central Johannesburg late on Tuesday , Malema urged supporters not to throw stones at police or journalists . ""
The police is not your enemy .
These are the people employed to protect you , "" South Africa 's Mail and Guardian newspaper quoted him as saying .
"" You must know who is the enemy , "" which prompted the crowd to chant , "" Zuma !
Zuma ! ""
There was no more trouble reported outside the ANC headquarters on Wednesdayyesterday .
Around 200 Malema supporters gathered behind barbed wire , guarded by riot police , and promised to maintain a vigil .
"" We are here to support our leader .
We are n't tired and we wo n't leave , "" one supporter told the newspaper told South Africa 's Mail and Guardian newspaper .
Malema , 30 , has no formal policy making power in the party but is very influential , with a committed powerbase .
He has angered Zuma and other leading ANC members by agitating for the nationalisation of South Africa 's hugely valuable mining industry , a move critics say would bring instant economic isolation .
His lavish lifestyle and fondness for contentious statements , for example a speech saying white South Africans should be treated as "" criminals "" for stealing land , has also proved divisive .
Malema was disciplined by the party last year for undermining Zuma and warned that a repeat offence within two years could lead to his suspension .
The current disciplinary hearing , involving Malema and five youth wing members , followed a youth wing statement calling for the overthrow of the democratically elected government of neighbouring Botswana .
It is a high - risk strategy for both sides .
If Malema is suspended he could lose his political powerbase .
However , if Zuma is forced to back down , it could greatly damage his standing in the party , which has ruled South Africa since the end of apartheid in 1994 .
Malema 's calls for mines nationalisation has alarmed some investors and is opposed by the mines minister , mines minister Susan Shabangu , who is part of the disciplinary panel .
Speaking at a mining conference in Perth , Australia , one of Shabangu 's advisers said the matter would be "" put to bed "" at the ANC conference in July next year .
"" Nationalisation is not policy for South Africa and there is no government process that is formulating a policy on nationalisation , "" Sandile Nogxina said .
Until the matter was resolved there would be "" some concern "" among investors , Nogxina conceded ."
2011-09-28,"The Dalai Lama may have stepped down from his political role as Tibetan leader but China is clearly prepared to use its economic clout to ensure the Buddhist spiritual guide remains radioactive on the world stage .
The technical excuses offered by the South African foreign ministry for dithering over an entry visa to the Dalai Lama are paper thin and have not spared the government the withering contempt of Archbishop Tutu , whose birthday celebrations are at stake , and derision from much of the South African press .
But President Jacob Zuma has already shown he would clearly rather endure these brickbats than lose Chinese investment , which has become a driving force in South Africa and across the rest of the African continent .
In 2009 , the government stopped the Dalai Lama from attending an event in the run - up to the World Cup , aimed at using football to combat racism , on the equally tenuous grounds that the visit would distract the media 's focus from the host nation .
China has recently invested $ 6bn in South Africa , much of it in the mining , construction and financial sectors , and it has overtaken the UK and US as the country 's biggest single trading partner .
The economic relationship was capped by an invitation to South Africa to join the Bric alliance of Brazil , Russia , India and China in April this year .
South Africa and China have increasingly aligned themselves on the international stage , most recently over Libya in the UN security council .
South Africa is particularly vulnerable to economic blackmail as high unemployment continues to threaten its hard - won political stability , and China has shown its readiness to carry a diplomatic grudge for years .
When France 's Nicolas Sarkozy met the Dalai Lama in 2008 , China immediately cancelled a planned summit with the European Union , and the Chinese premier , Wen Jiabao , avoided France on a European tour intended to develop business ties .
In an attempt to avoid a similar fate , Gordon Brown made sure he met the Dalai Lama outside Downing Street to emphasis the spiritual rather than political nature of the encounter .
In this case , the 80th birthday of the country 's best - loved cleric , the personal nature of the visit is even clearer , but such distinctions are immaterial to Beijing , and South Africa does not have the clout to defend them .
If the Dalai Lama is barred however , it will extract a political cost for Zuma 's government , deepening already entrenched public cynicism .
It is also likely to contribute to a continent - wide backlash against China 's increasingly heavy - handed presence in Africa – once welcomed as help from a developing world equal , but increasingly viewed as 21st century colonialism ."

2011-10-13,"Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall will have a retinue of at least 15 for their eight - day tour of South Africa and Tanzania next month , including an official artist , Clarence House has disclosed .
The 16,000-mile round trip , which for the prince includes brief stops in Kuwait and Qatar , will be undertaken in a royal - chartered Airbus .
The royal couple will meet neither the South African president , Jacob Zuma , nor Nelson Mandela – who at 93 is described as too frail to meet visitors , although he made an exception for Michelle Obama recently .
The prince is paying for his wife to travel by scheduled flight to Johannesburg to meet him when he arrives on 2 November .
He will also pay the travel costs of the unnamed artist .
Clarence House refused to identify the young artist "" for his own protection from the media , because he is very nervous "" , although his identity will presumably become obvious as the visit gets under way .
Previous artists on earlier trips have included Neale Worley and James Hart Dyke .
Their works were described by a Clarence House spokesman as the prince 's legacy contribution to the Royal Collection , alongside the Rembrandts , Vermeers , Van Dycks and Winterhalters . ""
He has decided his contribution will be paintings by up - and - coming British artists .
The latest has already been chosen by the prince 's art adviser , "" the spokesman said .
The artist has yet to receive his pre - tour briefing on such matters as how to address the prince .
Hart Dyke , one of whose pictures was entitled Gorr Mildred
, It 's That Royalty Lot after a remark he overheard , told the Guardian in an interview three years ago : "" You do see some amazing things …
[ and then ] you get back to Heathrow and the prince goes off in his car to Clarence House
and I get the tube home and think : ' Was that all a dream ? '
"" Also in the entourage of private secretaries , press officers , a personal assistant and equerry is a logistics manager and personal staff including a butler , valet , dresser , hairdresser and doctor .
The official part of the visit , arranged at the request of the government , will include trips to township projects , game reserves and gardens and visits in Zanzibar and Kilimanjaro in Tanzania , aimed at securing "" crucial partnerships and powerful relationships "" with the countries ."
2011-11-10,"A firebrand youth leader in South Africa has been axed by the governing African National Congress for bringing the party into disrepute .
Julius Malema was suspended for five years , meaning he must step down as president of the ANC 's youth wing , a party disciplinary committee ruled .
The charges against him referred to calling for regime change in neighbouring Botswana , unfavourably comparing president Jacob Zuma to his predecessor Thabo Mbeki and storming into a meeting of top ANC officials .
Derek Hanekom , head of the ANC disciplinary panel , said Malema had been found guilty of sowing serious divisions in the party and of bringing the 99-year - old liberation movement into disrepute . ""
Malema damaged the standing of the ANC and South Africa 's international reputation , "" Hanekom said , describing his remarks on Botswana as "" reckless and baseless "" .
Malema , 30 , has said he joined the ANC when he was nine years old .
He has become a polarising figure in South African politics with his call for the nationalisation of mines , demand to retake land from white "" criminals "" and singing of the apartheid - era protest lyric , "" Shoot the Boer . ""
The suspension of Malema should help pave the way for Zuma to secure a second term as ANC leader – and hence the country 's president – at a party conference in a year .
But the unexpectedly harsh sentence imposed on Malema , a significant power broker in the ANC , could provoke an anti - Zuma backlash .
It is also a blow to struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela - Mandela , who testified on Malema 's behalf at the disciplinary hearings .
The party said Malema had the right to appeal to the ANC disciplinary body .
Any appeal must be lodged within 14 days .
He can also appeal against the outcome to the ANC 's national executive committee – headed by Zuma .
Malema was writing a university exam on Thursday and was not available for comment ."
2011-11-10,"The mercurial , bewildering and outrageous career of South Africa 's leading young politician appeared finished on Thursday when he was axed by the governing party .
Julius Malema was suspended for five years from the African National Congress , meaning he must step down as president of the ANC youth league , the party 's disciplinary committee ruled .
The maverick had called for the overthrow of the "" puppet regime "" in neighbouring Botswana , unfavourably compared South Africa 's president , Jacob Zuma , to his predecessor , Thabo Mbeki , and stormed uninvited into a meeting of senior ANC officials – all this despite being anointed by Zuma as a potential future president .
He was found guilty of sowing divisions and bringing the 99-year - old party into disrepute .
"" The acts of misconduct for which the respondent has been found guilty are very serious and have damaged the integrity of the ANC and South Africa 's international reputation , "" said Derek Hanekom , head of the ANC disciplinary panel .
Malema , 30 , is the first leader to suffer such punishment since the youth league was co - founded by Nelson Mandela in 1944 .
However , he said he would appeal against the decision , ensuring that he will retain his position until that process is exhausted .
"" We are not intimidated by any outcome , "" he said .
"" We remain resolute , we 'll continue to fight … because the ANC is our home , and we 've not any other home except the African National Congress . ""
Malema warned : "" We must also fight for what we believe in .
We must never apologise .
The gloves are off . ""
Speaking in Polokwane , he was quoted by SAfm : "" Let the enemy enjoy , but that victory will not last . ""
Real leaders of the ANC must now stand up in defence of the ANC .
What I like about these people who have suspended us is that they are brave , they are not scared .
"" The punishment is a huge personal blow to Malema , who joined the party at the age of nine , when it was banned by the apartheid government .
He even wore an ANC badge on his township school uniform .
Malema became leader of the youth league in April 2008 after hotly disputed elections and soon raised eyebrows with declarations such as "" We are prepared to take up arms and kill for Zuma "" .
Many more breath - catching pronouncements were to follow , horrifying feminists and anti - racists .
He also threw a BBC journalist out of a press conference with the angry rejoinder : "" Go out .
Go out .
Bastard !
Go out .
You bloody agent ! ""
He also caused unrest by singing the apartheid - era protest lyric "" Shoot the Boer "" .
Malema styles himself as a champion of the poor .
But his fiery rhetoric calling for wealth to be redistributed from the white minority to the black majority has been mocked by critics who point to his own lavish lifestyle and a police investigation into corruption .
Some analysts praised the verdict – which included penalties for five other youth league leaders – as a sign of the ANC 's resilience .
Eusebius McKaiser , a political analyst , said : "" This is a day when the character and principles the ANC stands for scored a spectacular goal against Julius Malema .
The message it sent is that the ANC as an organisation is bigger and stronger than any individual , including him . ""
The political commentator Justice Malala added : "" The principles enunciated take us back to the ANC of Nelson Mandela , take us back to the ANC of Albert Luthuli , and that is where Julius Malema and his youth league made a huge miscalculation .
The ANC is bigger than them .
"" The ANC 's disciplinary outcome is also being interpreted in the context of infighting within the party .
Malema , considered to be a potential kingmaker , is understood to be campaigning to unseat Zuma when the party holds an elective conference late next year .
He has powerful allies , including Winnie Madikizela - Mandela , Mandela 's ex - wife .
But that threat to Zuma appears to have been neutralised , leaving the president a clear run at a second term .
William Gumede , a political commentator and author of Thabo Mbeki and the Battle for the Soul of the ANC , was cautious .
"" If he was n't suspended the authority of Zuma would have been gone .
Zuma has regained it but now he will need the tactical nous to deal with the fallout , "" he said .
Deep fissures remain in the ANC , Gumede warned .
"" The issues are not going to go away .
The real danger for Zuma is whether Malema can make the case symbolic of the issues of the poor .
Zuma is still limping .
It 's not a clear - cut victory .
"" The ANC will go into its centenary as divided as it has been in living memory .
There are no symbols of unity the party can rally around as it did in the past with Nelson Mandela and Oliver Tambo .
Zuma is a divisive figure . """
2011-11-15,"The Russian prime minister , Vladimir Putin , is used to receiving accolades in friendly nations , but even he may raise an eyebrow at the prize he has just been awarded in China : peacemaker of the year .
After two wars in Chechnya , one conflict in South Ossetia and two of the deadliest hostage relief operations in modern history , the former KGB officer was named on Monday as the winner of the second Confucian peace prize .
It is unclear if Putin is even aware of the award which was chosen by an obscure cultural organisation , the China International Peace Research Centre , from a field of nominees including Bill Gates , Angela Merkel , Kofi Annan , Jacob Zuma and a Tibetan Panchen Lama imposed by Beijing .
The 16-judge panel said that Putin deserved the award because his criticism of Nato 's military engagement in Libya was "" outstanding in keeping world peace "" , regardless of the fact that it had no bearing on the outcome of the north African conflict .
The short history of the prize is as controversial as the choice of winner .
The Chinese organisers claimed they established the award last year after preparing for years to create something that would "" promote world peace from an eastern perspective "" .
But the Confucian peace prize appeared more like a rushed and botched attempt to upstage the Nobel laureate status granted to jailed Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo .
The inaugural ceremony was widely ridiculed when the winner – former Taiwanese vice - president Lien Chan – failed to turn up .
A schoolgirl appeared in his place to collect the 100,000 yuan ( £ 9,500 ) cash prize .
This has not gone down well even with China 's authorities .
Two months ago , the ministry of culture distanced itself from the prize , disbanded the organisation behind it , and associated with another similarly named award .
Although these setbacks looked likely to mark the end of the group , the original organisers reformed in Hong Kong – which is not bound by the same rules as the mainland – and now plan to stage an award ceremony on 9 December , the day before the Nobel ceremony ."
2011-11-23,"Argentina and the Dominican Republic make the cut , but Peru and Venezuela do not .
The prime minister of Malawi is on the list , but South Africa 's president , Jacob Zuma , does not appear .
France 's president and prime minister both make the grade , as do the heads of state and government of Poland , Latvia and South Korea .
But , for Russia , only Dmitry Medvedev , as president , features ; the prime minister , Vladimir Putin , is conspicuous by his absence .
This is not a list of people invited to a critical geopolitical summit , or a tally of supporters at a crucial UN vote – though in some quarters it might be viewed as having similar diplomatic significance .
Rather , this is the list of those world leaders who got Christmas cards from David Cameron last year , his first as occupant of Downing Street .
The list of names , obtained by the Guardian following a freedom of information request , is revealing in a number of ways , not least for the ordering of recipients .
Top of the list is the US president , Barack Obama , with Angela Merkel , chancellor of Germany , second .
Given the UK 's ongoing military commitments in Afghanistan , it is perhaps fitting that Hamid Karzai , the country 's president , gets the number three spot .
Nicolas Sarkozy is fourth .
Next comes Kenya 's PM , then Canada 's .
The countries then follow in very loose alphabetical order , but not before five sheikhs , emirs and crown princes are listed from the United Arab Emirates .
Unlike almost every other recipient on the list , whose titles alone are detailed , each of the men 's names are given in full : His Excellency Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabr Al - Thani ( Qatar 's PM ) , His Highness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan
( Emir of Abu Dhabi ) , and so on .
It is not clear whether Australia 's prime minister , Julia Gillard , was an afterthought , which might explain why she is almost at the bottom despite being alphabetically near the top .
Nor is it immediately obvious why the presidents of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan were thought worthy of prime ministerial holiday greetings , while the leaders of neighbouring Tajikistan and Uzbekistan received nothing at all .
At least one representative from every EU country got a card , as did every nation in Nato – apart from Croatia and Iceland .
The presidents of Israel and the Palestinian authority were sent cards , as were Iraq 's prime minister and the pope .
But there were no greetings for the leaders of Syria , Zimbabwe and Egypt .
One can easily expect them not to appear this year either .
The 88 world leaders privileged enough to make the cut were the happy recipients of a card showing the prime minister and his wife , Samantha Cameron , on the steps of Downing Street , cradling their newborn daughter , Florence .
The message inside ?
A suitably inoffensive "" Wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year "" .
How to explain such a seemingly whimsical approach to spreading international festive cheer ?
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the list was compiled to reflect the engagements and contacts the prime minister had had throughout the previous year , which had led to the list altering year by year .
The Cabinet Office rejected the Guardian 's requests for the full list of Downing St Christmas card recipients , saying that releasing the names of junior officials in the prime minister 's office "" would prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs "" .
The department did reveal that 1,410 cards were dispatched last year , with more than half going to officials in the prime minister 's and deputy prime minister 's private offices and other government departments , and to other public servants , at a cost of £ 225 .
Austerity savings were made compared to the previous year in 2009 during Gordon Brown 's premiership when 1850 cards cost the public purse £ 1400 ."
2011-11-28,"Global warming already is causing suffering and conflict in Africa , from drought in Sudan and Somalia to flooding in South Africa , President Jacob Zuma said on Monday , urging delegates at an international climate conference to look beyond national interests for solutions .
"" For most people in the developing countries and Africa , climate change is a matter of life and death , "" said the South African leader as he formally opened a two - week conference with participants from more than 190 nations .
The conference is seeking ways to curb ever - rising emissions of climate - changing pollution , which scientists said last week have reached record levels of concentration in the atmosphere .
Zuma said Sudan 's drought is partly responsible for tribal wars there , and that drought and famine have driven people from their homes in Somalia .
Floods along the South African coast have cost people their homes and jobs , he said .
"" Change and solutions are always possible .
In these talks , states , parties , will need to look behind their national interests to find a solution for the common good and human benefit , "" he said .
The UN climate chief , Christiana Figueres , said future commitments by industrial countries to slash greenhouse gas emissions is "" the defining issue of this conference . ""
But she said that is linked to pledges that developing countries must make to join the fight against climate change .
She quoted Nelson Mandela : "" It always seems impossible until it is done . ""
The conference ends on 9 December ."
2011-12-21,"Jacob Zuma , the president of South Africa , has become embroiled in a row over the impact of Christianity on African culture after reportedly blaming the religion for the breakdown of traditional communities .
Zuma said Christianity â€ “ introduced by European missionaries mainly in the 19th century â€ “ had destroyed the safety net for orphans , elderly people and the poor , according to South Africa 's Times newspaper .
The front - page report prompted criticism from church leaders but was described as "" gravely misleading "" by presidential aides , who claimed that Zuma had been referring to "" western culture "" and not singling out Christianity .
Speaking at the launch of a road safety and crime awareness campaign in his home province , KwaZulu - Natal , Zuma was quoted as saying : "" As Africans , long before the arrival of religion and [ the ] gospel , we had our own ways of doing things . ""
Those were times that the religious people refer to as dark days but we know that , during those times , there were no orphans or old - age homes .
Christianity has brought along these things . ""
Zuma is South Africa 's first Zulu president and a devout follower of tribal custom including polygamy : last year he married his third wife after paying lobola , or bride price , at a traditional ceremony featuring singing , dancing and the wearing of leopard skins .
But like many South Africans , he balances indigenous ancestor worship with the Christian Godâ€š or at least gives that impression publicly .
Zuma was ordained as an honorary pastor at a meeting of independent charismatic churches in 2007 and has been linked to the influential Rhema church in Johannesburg .
He once declared that the African National Congress ( ANC ) "" will rule until Jesus comes "" in South Africa .
The South African Council of Churches said it was "" deeply disappointed "" by his remarks this week .
Reverend Mautji Pataki , the council 's general secretary , said : "" We do not understand why the president , whom we have always counted as one amongst us Christians , would find the Christian faith to be so hopeless with regard to building humanity . ""
Reverend Kenneth Meshoe , leader of the African Christian Democratic party , added : "" Firstly , the president needs to be rebuked for hypocrisy because for him to blame Christianity when he knows churches were at the forefront of the struggle is disappointing , and he knows that what he said is not true , having claimed to be a Christian himself . ""
Secondly , during elections he does n't run to the graveyards to get votes from the ancestors , but he runs to churches . ""
Stung by the growing controversy on Wednesday , Zuma 's spokesman Mac Maharaj expressed concern at the "" misleading manner "" in which Zuma 's remarks had been reported . ""
President Zuma said that while we welcome the advent of western culture , some useful traditional ways of doing things and aspects of African culture were undermined or even eroded , some of which were important for the cohesion of communities , "" Maharaj said .
"" The president indicated amongst other things that western culture had brought about the end of the extended family as an institution , leading to the need for government to establish old age homes , orphanages and other mechanisms to support the poor and vulnerable .
He added that even poverty was an unknown factor as neighbours were always ready to assist each other , giving one another milk or cattle where needed . ""
Maharaj continued : "" This does not in any way imply a negation or rejection of Christianity .
It is mischievous to draw such a conclusion .
The president was simply asserting African culture as a way in which many people used to live harmoniously , and lamenting the neglect of African culture . ""
Mathole Motshekga , the ANC chief whip , described the reports as "" gravely misleading "" and added : "" Irresponsible journalism will always find a creative way to mislead , and in this case it inexplicably saw an attack on Christianity in the president 's perfectly sound assertion . """
2012-01-25,"A leadership contest for the African Union , pitting a regional political and economic powerhouse , South Africa , against the small west African country of Gabon , has galvanised the AU summit .
The race between Jean Ping , who is seeking a second term , and Nkosazana Dlamini - Zuma , the South African home affairs minister and President Jacob Zuma 's ex - wife , has eclipsed the theme of this year 's summit , intra - African trade , a subject that sets pulses racing only among policy wonks .
The two - day summit officially opens on Sunday in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , although preliminary talks are already in train .
It will be the first without Muammar Gaddafi .
The former Libyan leader 's pan - African pretensions and mercurial presence lent an unpredictability to proceedings , with sessions dragging on until the wee hours .
It will also be the first with the full participation of the new Libyan and Egyptian authorities .
The fight to lead the AU has gripped Africa - watchers .
Ping has backing from francophone west Africa and Nigeria , while Dlamini - Zuma , who could become arguably Africa 's most powerful woman , has support from southern Africa , including Angola .
According to the Times Live website in South Africa , a lobbying team led by Maite Nkoana - Mashabane , the minister of international relations , has been crisscrossing the continent lobbying for Dlamini - Zuma . ""
This is a fascinating development which breaks an informal agreement that the big countries do not put forward names for the AU .
The outcome is impossible to predict , "" said Alex Vines , head of the Africa programme at Chatham House , the international affairs thinktank .
"" South Africa may be positioning itself for a bid for a permanent seat on the UN security council . ""
South Africa 's role in the AU is likely to grow even if Dlamini - Zuma fails to clinch the AU 's top job , with some of the organisation 's other big players , Algeria , Egypt and Libya , preoccupied with the fallout from the Arab spring .
Although the AU is often criticised for ineffectuality , Vines considered such criticism unfair .
"" The AU can play a constructive role in mediation efforts in Guinea and Ivory Coast , even though its intervention in Libya was unsuccessful , "" he said .
The summit will mark the official opening of a new AU headquarters , with a 20-storey main office building , a 2,505-capacity conference centre in the shape of giant flying saucer , and a sub - conference building with 32 conference rooms .
Built by the China State Construction Engineering Corporation and funded by China at a cost of $ 200 m , the impressive building is a symbol writ large of Beijing 's trade and diplomatic offensive in Africa .
President Hu Jintao will be in Addis this week to officially hand over the new HQ to African leaders .
Peace and security will be on the agenda against the backdrop of a humanitarian crisis in east Africa , a looming crisis in the Sahel , and rising tension between Sudan and South Sudan , which is also beset by internal strife .
The UN secretary general , Ban Ki - moon , has expressed his concern over deteriorating relations between Khartoum and Juba .
Ban , who will attend the summit , has urged both sides to do their utmost in their negotiations in Addis to settle differences over the sharing of oil revenues .
Such conflicts make it no easier to boost intra - Africa trade .
Trade within the continent grew from $ 48bn in 2005 to $ 76bn in 2009 , according to the 2011 African Development Bank 's annual effectiveness review , but continues to be hamstrung by cumbersome regulations and poor infrastructure .
Most African exports are still sent to markets in industrialised countries , with only 10%-12 % bound to other African nations .
This is less than half the level in other emerging markets .
Moreover , half of the continent 's intra - regional trade occurs within the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , dominated by South Africa .
Efforts to boost trade among African countries have come through several regional groupings , including a customs union within the East African Community ( EAC ) eliminating tariffs on goods traded within the region .
Efforts are also under way to mesh together different regional economic frameworks .
In west Africa , the Economic Community of West Africa ( Ecowas ) and the West African Economic and Monetary Union have stepped their co - ordination .
The most ambitious attempt at regional integration is the tripartite agreement between SADC , the EAC and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa ( Comesa ) , which will combine the three free trade areas into a single economic entity free of tariffs and quotas .
Integration of the three blocs has already boosted trade among the 26 tripartite countries to $ 27bn in 2008 , from $ 7bn in 2000 .
Lack of infrastructure , however , remains a major hindrance to close economic ties on the continent .
Transport costs are still two or three times higher than in other parts of the world , and 40 % of sub - Saharan Africans live in landlocked countries with the lowest road densities in the world .
In addition , much of the intra - African trade that exists is done so informally , and is untaxed and unregulated , making it difficult to estimate its true level ."
2012-01-31,"As the world 's political and business leaders arrive home exhausted by the World Economic Forum in Davos , one might ask which of the world 's toughest challenges were identified , let alone solved , on the magic mountain .
Timely , then , that yesterday the UN launched the report of the UN secretary general 's high - level panel on global sustainability .
Co - chaired by South Africa 's president Jacob Zuma and Finland 's president Tarja Halonen , the panel seeks to build on the Brundtland Report , now a quarter of a century old , to shape our common future and , more immediately , the forthcoming Rio+20 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in June 2012 .
Whereas Brundtland voiced what needed to be heard , the panel has focused on what needs to be done .
And rightly so , action in the panel 's view has much do with the economics of sustainability , a topic poorly dealt with by Brundtland , but since thrust into the limelight .
Talking about economics is one thing , however , advancing practical proposals to align our global economy to sustainability outcomes is quite something else .
So has the panel succeeded on these terms ?
The panel 's report focuses not so much on what business has to do , but what governments need to do to get business more firmly on the sustainability track .
Some of the policy guidance is obvious , but nevertheless obviously right , such as moving forward on the correct pricing of natural resources .
And the panel makes specific proposals on how to progress such pricing .
Most contentious , especially in the light of recent fuel price riots in Nigeria , is a strong policy push to remove fossil fuel subsidies that currently deliver perversely negative carbon prices and cost global taxpayers about $ 1tn annually , money that could be used more effectively elsewhere .
Also highlighted is the incredible potential of the annual global public procurement of $ 4tn ( or more ) as a powerful policy instrument for re - pricing natural resources by incentivising new enterprises , business models and entire sectors .
Reshaping the financial markets The panel has shown the courage to call out the financial markets , arguing for them to invest in a resilient , sustainable economy for future generations .
Emphasise is to go beyond metrics and reporting and niche sustainability products and investors , all necessary but inadequate in themselves in getting the job done .
The panel argues for reform at the core of financial markets in reshaping the fiduciary base that guides institutional investors in how they can and can not invest , alongside calls for remuneration and other incentives to be suitably realigned .
The potential role of today 's $ 5tn of sovereign wealth funds ( expected to be $ 10tn by the end of this decade ) in investing long and taking account of both policy and commercial factors is highlighted .
The panel also bites the bullet in arguing for fiscal and regulatory measures to overcome the short - termism that not only catalysed the current economic recession , but also forms a particular constraint in investing in sustainability - aligned businesses and infrastructure .
While not overtly endorsing the contentious financial transactions tax , the panel is clearly pointing in that direction .
Brundtland catalysed a truly new narrative , and this is a tough act to follow .
The panel has not offered a strong catalytic narrative that is likely to be embraced by policy makers internationally , let alone touch people on Main Street .
Maybe such a narrative was just too big an ask amid an economic crisis that will not go away .
But while this may disappoint some , it is just as well that the seductive fashion for "" make it simple "" has been avoided .
It is a complex affair to reshape an intricate system of seven billion souls living within a $ 70tn - a - year economy of interconnected sovereign jurisdictions housing communities with diverse histories , cultural mind maps and interests .
Anyone pointing to "" silver bullet "" solutions is almost certainly part of the problem .
The key role of governments The panel 's proposals , if implemented even in part with focus and urgency , could take us a long way in overcoming perverse incentives and unlocking and directing the talent , creativity and resources of people , business and societies in shaping the change we need .
But the challenge is how to turn proposals into practise .
Moving to action might be helped by taking the policy guidance forward to the UN 's event in Rio this coming June .
But Davos revealed a wearily low level of expectations by all parties as to what Rio+20 would deliver .
The real action will not be through such spectacles , however successful they are executed .
Governments are a crucial part of the implementing front line .
Much can be done at the national level , all the more so given the manifest weaknesses of today 's inter - governmental processes .
Business clearly has a critical role to play , and at its best has demonstrated its capacity and will to advance the sustainability agenda .
As highlighted in my Year of the Unreasonable , business working collectively could commit to and achieve a great deal on many sustainability fronts by re - engineering their value chains .
Such efforts could be amplified many times over , as the World Economic Forum 's recent report on sustainable consumption , More with Less , points out , if citizens can be catalysed into complementary action in their roles as consumers , voters and investors .
Ultimately , the panel 's efforts are to be applauded .
While not a finished work , the panel has done its job , and what was needed , in signposting some of the big policy moves , all perfectly feasible , which are needed to shunt the global economy onto a sustainable pathway .

2012-02-04,"A maverick youth leader in South Africa is facing life in the political wilderness after a failed appeal against suspension from the governing African National Congress .
Julius Malema 's bid to overturn a five - year suspension was dismissed by party officials on Saturday , effectively stripping him of the presidency of the ANC 's youth wing .
Malema was once anointed a possible future leader by president Jacob Zuma but has since become his political nemesis .
Charges that he sowed divisions and brought the ANC into disrepute were upheld by the party 's disciplinary committee , which described some of Malema 's appeals as "" naive and absurd "" .
Malema is the first leader to suffer such punishment since the youth league was co - founded by Nelson Mandela in 1944 .
The loss of political influence and access to lucrative contracts represents a bitter blow to the ANC diehard , who joined the party aged nine and has become arguably South Africa 's most talked about and polarising politician .
He once threw a BBC journalist out of a press conference , yelling : "" Bloody agent ! ""
Following the announcement , Malema and fellow youth leaders made an attention - grabbing visit to the home of anti - apartheid struggle veteran Winnie Madikizela - Mandela in Soweto , according to local media reports .
The ex - wife of Nelson Mandela has publicly backed Malema against Zuma .
Saturday 's verdict will be regarded as a boost to Zuma 's hopes of re - election at a party conference later this year .
Malema , a radical voice for the nationalisation of mines and seizure of white - owned land , has become a rallying figure for his political enemies .
The youth league president was suspended in November on charges that included comparing Zuma unfavourably to his predecessor , Thabo Mbeki , for failing to promote the "" African agenda "" .
Malema was also found guilty of calling for regime change in neighbouring Botswana , a source of diplomatic embarrassment .
"" Discipline is one of the key pillars in the life of the ANC , "" Cyril Ramaphosa , a senior ANC figure and head of the appeals committee , said at the party 's headquarters in Johannesburg .
In a minor reprieve , Malema and other youth leaders were cleared of the charge that they knowingly barged into and disrupted a meeting of the ANC 's top national officials .
They were also granted leave to appeal against the length of their suspension within 14 days .
Malema , who is also facing a criminal probe into his finances , had retained his position as youth league leader while the appeal was heard .
He was cheered by supporters at the ANC 's centenary celebrations in Bloemfontein last month , although he was denied a chance to address them .
According to some reports , Malema is considering an alternative career as a cattle farmer ."
2012-02-25,"The former South African president Nelson Mandela is comfortable in hospital after receving treatment for a "" long - standing abdominal complaint "" , the government has said .
The Nobel peace laureate , 93 , was "" fine and fully conscious "" following a diagnostic procedure and would be discharged on Sunday or Monday , President Jacob Zuma said .
"" We wish him a speedy recovery and assure him of the love and good wishes of all South Africans and people throughout the world , "" Zuma said in a statement .
It is understood Mandela was admitted to hospital to establish the cause of the problem and that his stay did not involve surgery .
Mandela became South Africa 's first black president in 1994 after spending 27 years in prison for his fight against racist apartheid rule , and was awarded a Nobel peace prize for his work .
His public appearances have become increasingly rare , and he was hospitalised last year for acute respiratory infection .
He spent several days at Johannesburg 's Milpark hospital and has since spent his time between Johannesburg and his ancestral village of Qunu in South Africa 's impoverished Eastern Cape .
Mandela occupies a central position in the psyche of South Africa and earlier this month the central bank issued a new set of bank notes bearing his image .
His last major public appearance was in July 2010 at the final of the World Cup in Johannesburg 's Soccer City stadium ."
2012-03-12,"A renegade youth leader expelled by South Africa 's governing party has made a surprise apology and begged to be allowed back .
Julius Malema , a political foe of the president , Jacob Zuma , was thrown out of the African National Congress ( ANC ) this month for sowing divisions and bringing the party into disrepute .
The 31-year - old remained defiant until Sunday night when , in an unusually contrite interview with South Africa 's public broadcaster , he said ANC membership had been "" my life "" after he joined the party aged nine and rose to become its youth league president . ""
Please leave me with a card because the imagination of being outside the ANC is too scary , "" Malema told SABC television .
"" I love the ANC , I do n't have anything except the ANC . ""
A party disciplinary committee found Malema guilty of comparing Zuma unfavourably with his predecessor , Thabo Mbeki , and calling for the overthrow of the democratically elected government in neighbouring Botswana .
Malema , wearing a black beret and yellow T - shirt with a portrait of Nelson Mandela , said on Sunday : "" I want to also apologise to the leadership of the ANC for anything that they think I have done wrong .
"" I did not do it deliberately .
I was making a contribution .
I thought it was strengthening the movement as required by the constitution of the ANC youth league to support the movement . ""
Malema said that if necessary he would take his appeal against expulsion all the way to an ANC conference scheduled for the end of the year , adding : "" I will die with my boots on . ""
Asked what his options were if he exhausted all appeal options , Malema said he would continue with his studies , pursue business interests and continue cattle farming .
If finally confirmed , his expulsion would help clear the way for Zuma to win a second term as ANC leader at the same conference .
Malema has previously criticised the ANC 's leadership for lacking the radical policies , such as nationalising mines and seizing land without compensation , that he says are necessary to liberate South Africa 's black majority from poverty , unemployment and inequality .
Malema is also facing a police investigation into his business dealings , but on Sunday he rejected persistent media allegations that he had used his political position to influence the awarding of government tenders to his cronies .
"" There is no court of law that has found me corrupt .
I have never had power to channel tenders , "" Malema said .
"" This media will destroy democracy in South Africa . ""
The media needed a structure "" with teeth "" that would enforce regulation , he added .
South Africa 's parliament is considering a protection of information bill that critics say will threaten freedom of speech .
The ANC has also proposed a media appeals tribunal , which is proving equally controversial ."
2012-05-21,"It began with an impression of a man 's penis in an art gallery where only a tiny fraction of the population would normally set foot .
Now it has become a national debate running the gamut from freedom of expression to the right to privacy , from the nature of racism to "" what is art ? "" , and is being seen as nothing less than a test of South Africa 's constitutional democracy .
On Wednesday the president , Jacob Zuma , will bring a court action to argue that a painting showing him with exposed genitalia should be removed because it violates his right to dignity and makes a mockery of his office .
The claim is disputed by the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg , which is displaying the 1.85m - high ( 6 ft 1 in ) painting , entitled The Spear , as part of artist Brett Murray 's Hail to the Thief II exhibition .
Freedom of speech is protected in South Africa but Zuma 's governing African National Congress ( ANC ) believes that , in this instance , it has a case beyond mere censorship of its critics .
It contends that the artwork is playing up to crude stereotypes of African male sexuality .
It is no doubt aware that Murray is white .
Zuma states in a legal affidavit : "" The continued display of the portrait is manifestly serious and has the effect of impugning my dignity in the eyes of all who see it .
In particular , the portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests that I am a philanderer , a womaniser and one with no respect .
It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of my fellow citizens , family and children . ""
In terms of the theme of the exhibition , my portrait is meant to convey a message that I am an abuser of power , corrupt and suffer political ineptness . ""
The president added that he was shocked and "" felt personally offended and violated "" .
The ANC has been rallying around its leader over the painting .
Gwede Mantashe , its secretary general , said on Monday : "" It 's rude , it 's crude , it 's disrespectful . ""
If it had been a white man depicted , the reaction would have been very different , he added , but as far as many people were concerned , black people were just objects .
"" I said , ' How about the idea of going to court tomorrow and as we sit there we can take off our trousers ? ...
we can walk around with our genitals hanging out ' .
"" It 's crude â€ ¦ we have not outgrown racism in our 18 years [ of democracy ] . ""
Ngoako Selamolela , president of the South African Students ' Congress , added : "" This arrogance is ideological and an attack to the very value and moral systems of the majority African people and many other religious persuasions . ""
And Wally Serote , a leading poet and writer , suggested the painting was no different to labelling black people "" kaffirs
"" â€ “ a highly offensive term .
"" Blacks feel humiliated and spat on by their white counterparts in situations like this , "" he was quoted as saying .
"" We all need to learn that as creative people we have a responsibility to see that our work contributes to building a new South Africa , free from prejudice . ""
Zuma is a polygamous Zulu who has married six times and has four wives .
In 2010 , he publicly apologised for fathering a child out of wedlock , said to be his 20th overall .
In 2006 , he was cleared of raping an HIV - positive friend but caused anger by saying he took a shower after having sex with her . ""
It will be his sexual legacy that we will remember more than anything else , "" said the columnist Mondli Makhanya in South Africa 's Sunday Times , adding : "" His sexual endeavours are therefore fair game for artists , cartoonists , comedians , radio DJs and tavern jokers . ""
Other South Africans , both black and white , have taken the view that , as a public figure , Zuma should be thick - skinned when it comes to satire .
Tselane Tambo , daughter of the late ANC stalwart Oliver Tambo , reportedly posted on a social networking site : "" So the Pres JZ has had his portrait painted and he does n't like it . ""
Do the poor enjoy poverty ?
Do the unemployed enjoy hopelessness ?
Do those who ca n't get housing enjoy homelessness ?
He must get over it .
No one is having a good time .
He should inspire the reverence he craves .
This portrait is what he inspired .
Shame neh ! ""
The row has been good for business at the gallery , where staff estimate there were 50 or 60 visitors at any one time on Saturday , more than double the usual attendance .
A spokeswoman for the gallery said : "" The gallery provides a neutral space in which ' dialogue and free expression ' is encouraged .
In this space the ANC 's right to condemn the work is acknowledged as much as the artist 's right to display it .
This , the gallery believes , is democracy at work . ""
But the gallery can not give up its right to decide what art will hang on its walls .
For this reason we are opposing the application brought by the ANC and President Zuma for the removal of the artwork . ""
The Goodman Gallery will be increasing security and may search visitors , she added , amid rumours of a possible public protest .
South Africa 's Sunday Times reported that The Spear had been sold for 136,000 rand ( Â£10,345 ) to a German buyer ."

2012-05-22,"A painting depicting the South African president , Jacob Zuma , with his genitals exposed has been vandalised , leading to ugly scenes at an art gallery in Johannesburg .
One man painted a red cross across Zuma 's face and penis while a younger man spread black paint over the image .
The younger man was reportedly assaulted by security guards .
The 1.85-metre - high painting , entitled The Spear , has bitterly divided South Africans , with the governing African National Congress ( ANC ) describing it as "" rude , disrespectful and racist "" , but others defending the artist Brett Murray 's right to freedom of speech .
South Africa 's Eyewitness news identified one of the vandals on Tuesday as a university professor , and said he "" took a small can of red paint and slowly marked two large ' X ' symbols over the genitals and the face with a paintbrush . ""
After a while , another man with a small can of black paint smeared the painting using his hands . ""
It added : "" Footage on eNews showed security forcefully cuffing the men with cable ties after the painting had been defaced . ""
Andrew Harding , the BBC 's Africa correspondent , was at the Goodman Gallery and tweeted : "" Zuma picture smeared with black paint .
Man who did it tells me ' picture was offensive . '
gallery guard assaults him .
2nd man arrested too . ""
He continued : "" Red and black paint now covers Zuma portrait .
Two men responsible now taken away .
Gallery closed . ""
The BBC quoted one of the men as saying : "" I 'm doing this because the painting is disrespectful to President Zuma . ""
A private security company was guarding the painting when the incident happened at around 11 am .
The BBC website reported that one man wielding a paint brush was pounced on by guards and headbutted at one point .
Harding tweeted : "" Young black man was beaten by guards .
Older white man treated much more courteously .
"" The suspects were arrested and taken to a nearby police station .
A spokesman for the Goodman Gallery said : "" One man painted a red X across Zuma 's face and the second covered the painting with black paint . ""
Murray said earlier that his work was never meant to hurt anyone but an "" attempt at humorous satire of political power and patriarchy within the context of other artworks in the exhibition and within the broader context of South African discourse . ""
Earlier , a crowd of ANC supporters gathered near a court in Johannesburg where the party was seeking to have the painting removed .
It was decided that a full bench of the high court would hear the case on Thursday .
Judge Kathree Setiloane said : "" This is a matter of great national importance . ""
Meanwhile , as the temperature of the debate continue to soar , Enoch Mthembu , spokesman for the Nazareth Baptist church , commonly known as the Shembe church , called for retribution against Murray . ""
This man has insulted the entire nation and he deserves to be stoned to death , "" he told the Times of South Africa . ""
What he did clearly shows his racist upbringing because art does not allow people to insult others .
"" This is an attack on the culture of the majority , the black people of South Africa .
With our culture we are allowed to marry many women .
And white people must understand that and tolerate our culture as we do theirs .
We are not like some of them who prefer prostitutes as they regard women as sex objects . ""
The painting has reportedly been bought by a German collector for about R136,000 ( Â£10,345 ) ."
2012-05-23,"South African president Jacob Zuma is taking an artist and a gallery to court to have a painting depicting him as a Lenin figure with his genitals exposed taken down .
His spokesman says the painting "" undermines the esteem of the highest office in the land and impugns the president 's constitutional right to dignity "" .
His court papers further say his reputation has been tarnished .
His children issued a press release and joined him in court , saying the artist has no respect for their father .
Here in South Africa we have been talking about President Zuma 's sexual peccadilloes for a long time .
Zuma , who was accused of rape in 2006 ( and later cleared ) , has 21 known children .
When he married his latest wife â€ “ his fourth current wife and his sixth in total â€ “ Zuma told her : "" Those who came before you did n't close the door on you and no one closed the door on them .
So I expect you to do the same . ""
Analysis of his presidency never concludes with policy discussion â€ “ on which Zuma has proven weak â€ “ but with his sexual lifestyle .
Columnist Mondli Makhanya wrote this week : "" In every other conversation , the debate about the president is not about his political , economic and societal vision , but about which bodily form he is gazing at â€ ¦ the president can spend one whole weekend celebrating his wife 's 40th birthday , spend the following weekend celebrating his own 70th birthday with his three wives and his fiancee , and then spend the entire following weekend turning the fiancee into a full wife .
Three weekends of fantastic fun .
This is a wonderful country .
Truly wonderful . ""
Makhanya had his tongue firmly in cheek , of course .
In truth , the damage Zuma has done to the image of the black man everywhere is untold .
If the image of his two predecessors , Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki , was of nation - builders and cool intellects , Zuma 's is of a man whose concentration is on sex and political self - preservation .
He has done more to provide fodder for racist stereotypes than any black South African has done .
Thankfully , enough of us know that the stereotype is false .
So what is Zuma 's argument ?
There is nothing in our constitution that enjoins us to respect the head of state , or to genuflect before him .
This is a constitutional democracy , not a monarchy .
Respect is earned , and very few would say that the president has earned our respect given his lifestyle .
Meanwhile , last week schoolchildren had to go to court to force him to provide books still outstanding six months into the school year .
His reputation on this score is in tatters .
All this , however , is irrelevant when one considers South Africa 's constitution â€ “ hailed by many as among the most progressive in the world â€ “ and its bill of rights .
The right to free expression is entrenched .
This includes the artist Brett Murray 's right to artistic creativity .
In turn , the constitution protects Zuma 's right to privacy and dignity .
As a public figure , however , Zuma 's rights in this regard are limited .
Further , his flaunting of his sexuality
â€ “ he arrives at government functions with all his wives in tow and enjoys suggestively belting out his signature song "" Pass Me My Machine Gun
"" â€ “ makes him fair game for cartoonists , artists , satirists and newspaper columnists .
But this is not to say that South Africans are united on this issue .
My friend of 25 years was among those who turned up at court in Johannesburg yesterday to have the painting pulled down .
He was not there , he told me , to support Zuma .
He was there because "" in African culture "" such depictions are disrespectful .
The culture argument is a nonsense .
Just last week an ANC MP said gay people can be cured by a traditional healer because homosexuality was not part of "" African culture "" .
Further , African culture is not homogeneous .
And our constitution does not provide for it in any case .
The painting was defaced yesterday .
Yet the debate â€ “ which has now included death threats against the artist â€ “ must go on .
If Zuma wins the right to have the painting banned then we must expect to see a country that bends to populism and patriarchal conservatism and not the progressive South Africa which boasts a constitution adopted in Mandela 's day .
Today it is an artist .
Tomorrow it could be abortion , and gay people , and cartoonists , and books .

2012-05-24,"Jacob Zuma , the South African president , is going to court to argue that a painting that depicted him with an exposed penis should be banned .
Zuma 's governing African National Congress ( ANC ) is bringing a legal action against the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg over the work , entitled The Spear , by artist Brett Murray .
The case is due to go before a full bench of judges on Thursday , despite the painting having been defaced by two men earlier in the week and subsequently removed from the gallery .
The ANC has urged "" all South Africans "" to join Zuma , his family , the ANC and its alliance partners at the South Gauteng high court because "" of the outrageous depiction of the president in the so - called art by Brett Murray and the Goodman Gallery . ""
Jackson Mthembu , the party 's national spokesman , said : "" We call upon all South Africans to support this noble course and to demonstrate rejection to this act of indecency , vulgar and disrespect of the constitution of our country and the values it stands for . ""
Let us all unite against those seeking to undermine our hard - won democracy and our democratic institutions , but above all , the people of South Africa . ""
He added : "" The ANC extends its appreciation for public support and messages received from various organisations and individuals , both black and white , on this matter .
This form of unison is a sign of condemnation by all South Africans to the so so - called craft . ""
The ANC is also seeking to force the City Press newspaper to remove a photograph of the painting from its website .
Lawyers for the Goodman Gallery and City Press will argue that The Spear can not be banned because the South African constitution protects the right to artistic expression .
In a legal affidavit , Murray argues the work "" is an attempt at humorous satire of political power and patriarchy within the context of other artworks in the exhibition and within the broader context of SA discourse . ""
He says : "" I never intended the artwork to cause any hurt or to harm the dignity of any person . ""
Murray adds that during the apartheid years he created satirical images which attacked abuses of power : "" For many years I have used , and continue to use , symbols with sexual connotations representative of political power and patriarchy . ""
He is supported by several leading South African artists including William Kentridge ."
2012-05-24,"In recent days I have been speculating about what would happen if a major art gallery showed a painting of Barack Obama or the Queen with their genitals hanging out , or whether such a display is even likely .
There would be a furore , no doubt , but nothing on the scale of the rambunctious blitzkrieg that has hogged headlines for the past week in South Africa , where an image of president Jacob Zuma with exposed penis has earned that inexhaustible accolade "" painting gate "" .
Along with about 99 % of people in the country , I learned about Brett Murray 's artwork , The Spear , not from visiting the Goodman gallery in Johannesburg or reading about it in the arts pages , but from a press release issued by the governing African National Congress . ""
ANC outraged by Brett Murray 's depiction of President Jacob Zuma , "" announced the subject heading .
The message read : "" The African National Congress is extremely disturbed and outraged by the distasteful and indecent manner in which Brett Murray and the Goodman gallery in Johannesburg is displaying the person of Comrade President Jacob Zuma . ""
It was not that The Spear shows Zuma mimicking the pose of Vladimir Lenin in a Soviet - era propaganda poster that riled the ANC .
It was rather what one international correspondent , quoting Philip Larkin , referred to as those "" tuberous cock and balls "" .
The party that in the past remained silent in the face of corruption , its own people dying from Aids and human rights violations in Zimbabwe , just could not shut up about this crime against humanity .
Zuma said he "" felt personally offended and violated "" .
The ANC secretary - general , Gwede Mantashe , argued that the painting proved black people were still regarded as objects in South Africa .
"" We have not outgrown racism in our 18 years [ of democracy ] , "" he said .
He was not alone in that view .
A church leader demanded that Murray be "" stoned to death "" for insulting African culture .
Murray is white and from Cape Town , often portrayed as the country 's last bastion of white privilege .
But on Wednesday the Times of South Africa devoted its front page to photos of the young Murray wearing an ANC T - shirt and examples of his anti - apartheid artwork , under the sarcastic headline : "" Murray , the ' racist ' "" .
In the afternoon came another ANC press release , this one entitled "" ANC calls on all South Africans to defend the President "" , and more reminiscent of a call to arms from the ailing Muammar Gaddafi than a spat over the latest Damien Hirst .
It wanted supporters to gather on Thursday outside the high court in Johannesburg where the ANC is seeking to have the painting censored .
All this for a work that no longer exists after two men daubed The Spear with paint , perhaps making an artistic statement of their own before being arrested .
They made a brief appearance in court on Wednesday with one , businessman Barend la Grange , claiming he painted one "" X "" for the ANC , which he described as going in the wrong direction , and another for Murray because he had mocked Zuma .
In another twist , a security guard who was filmed headbutting and flipping over the other man , taxi driver Louis Mabokela , was arrested and appeared in the same court on an assault charge , laid by Mabokela on Tuesday evening .
In my view , the desecration of The Spear is no great loss to the history of art , since it is rather blunt satire about a betrayal of ANC ideals that I 've seen done better elsewhere ( notably by the cartoonist Zapiro ) .
One local activist told me : "" Freedom of speech defenders will always tell you that just because it 's bad art , it should n't be banned .
At the same time , just because it should n't be banned does n't mean it 's good art . ""
And Tendai Biti , the Zimbabwe finance minister on a visit to Cape Town , observed : "" I ca n't imagine a British artist painting the Queen 's private constitution .
To call it art ?
I do n't think so . ""
In Zimbabwe and many other African countries , he noted , the editors of newspapers that published photos of The Spear would be under arrest .
So on one level the fact that the ANC has to rely on press releases , and is obliged to go through the courts , is a positive sign of South Africa 's constitutional health and commitment to freedom of speech .
But it does suggest a thin skin on the part of Zuma â€ “ a Zulu polygamist with four wives and more than 20 children â€ “ and the ANC .
The party has been in power for 18 years , commands an overwhelming majority in parliament and is certain to win the next general election .
Should n't the movement of Nelson Mandela and Oliver Tambo be big enough to ignore a man with a paintbrush and concentrate on governing ?
Are n't there genuine crises in South Africa , and Africa , more worthy of whipping up an existential frenzy ?
The answer may have less to do with the ANC 's 100-year history than with its present state : a big , unwieldy bandwagon riven by factionalism that threatens Zuma 's hold on the presidency .
Its recent attacks on the press , in the form of possible state regulation and a "" secrecy bill "" that could put journalists in jail , have been attributed to internal insecurities and neuroses . ""
Contrary to many an opinion , the ANC 's best friend these days is by now the infamous painting by Brett Murray , "" argued Daily Maverick columnist Sipho Hlongwane .
"" As things stand , they have reason to thank the artist for giving them a unique opportunity to further secure their core voting constituency from the further encroachment by the liberal infidels . ""
He added : "" The party has been handed a golden opportunity to engage in dog - whistle politics , which it is utilising to a great extent . ""
Deploying the revolutionary rhetoric of the anti - apartheid struggle , the ANC 's massive attack on The Spear may be a symptom of a need to rally against a common enemy â€ “ putting off , a little longer , the war against itself ."
2012-05-24,"One of the most heated debates in South Africa 's recent political history reached a moment of farce today when three high court judges were asked to adjudicate on whether to ban a portrait of the president with his penis exposed .
The work , The Spear , by Brett Murray , unleashed a brouhaha that has hogged headlines for more than a week in South Africa and earned that inexhaustible accolade "" painting - gate "" .
It was not that it showed President Jacob Zuma in a pose mimicking Soviet - era propaganda portrayals of Lenin â€ “ chest thrust out , arm aloft , coat - tail flowing in the wind â€ “ that riled the ruling African National Congress ( ANC ) .
It was , rather , the addition of his genitalia .
The ANC sounded the klaxons and leapt to battle stations , denouncing the painting as rude , disgusting and racist .
Today it took the matter to a regional high court in Johannesburg , arguing that the image violated Zuma 's constitutional right to dignity .
It also demanded that the City Press newspaper remove a photo of The Spear from its website .
Zuma , 70 , is a Zulu polygamist who has married six times , and has four current wives and 21 children .
He has admitted fathering one child out of wedlock in 2010 and once stood trial for and was acquitted of rape .
In an affidavit , he stated : "" The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer , a womaniser and one with no respect . ""
The gallery and the artist , Brett Murray , counter that freedom of expression , also protected by the constitution , is at stake .
The hearing was broadcast live on national television .
ANC leaders were present , along with several of Zuma 's children , who have joined their father in the legal challenge .
Arguments Outside the courthouse , hundreds of ANC supporters danced and sang , following a call by the party for "" all South Africans to defend the president "" .
As arguments began , the judges closely questioned Zuma 's lawyer , Gcina Malindi , on points of law , race , art and the limits of their ability to control publication on the internet .
Malindi argued that the court should hear not just the opinions of a "" super class "" of art experts but how the painting was likely to be seen by the country 's black majority , denied education under the apartheid system .
Malindi , who is black , said that many black people still lived in poverty after the end of apartheid in 1994 .
He then broke down in tears when a judge asked him how the court could halt viewing of an image widely distributed on the internet .
His colleagues rushed to put their arms around his shoulders .
Jackson Mthembu , an ANC spokesman , described Malindi as a leading member of the anti - apartheid movement , who had been tortured for his activities .
"" That 's why this is emotional , "" he said .
The painting went on show at the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg earlier this month and came to the ANC 's attention a week later , after local media reported that it had been sold to an anonymous buyer .
It would probably have gone unnoticed but for the ANC 's declaration of war .
The ANC , which in the past has been criticised for remaining silent in the face of corruption , its own people dying from Aids , and human rights violations in Zimbabwe , whipped up opposition to The Spear , putting a logo on its website homepage that says : "" President Zuma has a right to human dignity and privacy . ""
The name of the painting also evokes the old armed wing of the ANC , Umkhonto we Sizwe ( which translates as "" Spear of the Nation "" ) as well as cruder analogies .
The case is being fought over a work that essentially no longer exists .
On Tuesday the painting was defaced by a white businessman â€ “ peacefully taken into custody by security guards â€ “ and a black taxi driver , who was head - butted and body - slammed by a guard .
The businessman claims he was making an artistic statement of his own , critiquing both the ANC and Murray , while the taxi driver has laid an assault charge against the guard .
The Spear saga has pushed all the buttons that inflame emotions and headlines in South Africa 's national discourse .
The ANC , backed by trade unions , the Young Communist League and some black commentators , has invoked the rhetoric of the anti - apartheid movement , saying the work symbolises lingering racial oppression â€ “ still a defining prism for much public debate here .
Forgive Gwede Mantashe , ANC secretary - general , told Reuters last week : "" From where I am sitting , that picture is racist .
It is disrespectful .
It is crude and it is rude .
The more black South Africans forgive and forget , the more they get a kick in the teeth .
"" Murray is far from the first white person to criticise the ANC and be labelled a racist .
He is from Cape Town , often seen as the country 's last bastion of white privilege .
But on Wednesday the Times of South Africa devoted its front page to photos of the young Murray wearing an ANC T - shirt and examples of his work that used to lampoon the white minority regime , under the sarcastic headline : "" Murray , the ' racist ' "" .
Murray 's defenders say a painting of Nelson Mandela with his penis exposed is unlikely .
Respect is earned , they say , and Zuma has not done so , sexually or politically .
Two black commentators , Mondli Makhanya and Justice Malala , have argued that say Zuma has defined himself by his sexual lifestyle .
Malala wrote in the Guardian : "" He has done more to provide fodder for racist stereotypes than any black South African has done . ""
Politically , there is a widespread perception that Zuma is treading water and needs a headline - grabbing diversion from South Africa 's real crises : corruption , the failure to deliver services , and growing inequality .
The ANC is said to be riven by factions and insecurities , and in need of a common enemy to rally against .
Sipho Hlongwane , a columnist for the Daily Maverick , argued : "" As things stand , they have reason to thank the artist for giving them a unique opportunity to further secure their core voting constituency from the further encroachment by the liberal infidels . ""
The judges called a recess after the emotional display by Zuma 's lawyer on Thursday .
After a break of more than two hours , they agreed to resume at a later date .
As the febrile arguments raged on the internet , some observers may have been tempted to paraphrase Henry Kissinger : the politics are vicious precisely because the stakes are so small ."

2012-05-25,"South Africa 's governing African National Congress ( ANC ) has been criticised for demanding a boycott of a national newspaper that reproduced a controversial painting of President Jacob Zuma .
The ANC urged "" all South Africans , members of the ANC and the alliance , to indefinitely boycott buying the City Press newspaper "" until it removes images of The Spear , which shows him with his genitals exposed , from its website .
The party also wants advertisers to withdraw their business .
It said : "" The City Press has , therefore , become a paragon of immorality , abuse and perpetrator of injustice and slander .
Their refusal to remove this portrait from their website and their controlled social media is a clear indication that this newspaper does not belong to our shared democratic dispensation and values . ""
This newspaper has singled itself as anti - ANC , the president , our democracy and the majority of South Africans . ""
Outside a court hearing in Johannesburg on Thursday , where the party was seeking to have the painting banned , the ANC national spokesman , Jackson Mthembu , whipped up a crowd of supporters by chanting : "" Boycott City Press !
Boycott City Press ! ""
Ferial Haffajee , the paper 's editor - in - chief , questioned the ANC 's motives , noting that pictures of The Spear are now widely available on Facebook , Twitter and Wikipedia . ""
The boycott call is really now more about the painting , "" she told South Africa 's eNews channel .
Haffajee also described higher education minister Blade Nzimande 's demand for a boycott of the paper as "" deeply disturbing "" .
She said : "" He must be very angry and that saddens me .
I am devastated by this week , by our descent into defacement and boycott over discussion and debate . ""
Reflecting the pressure that she and the paper are under , Haffajee tweeted : "" Contrary to some opinion , I do n't have balls and yes , I am hurt and scared .
But , first , I 'm a journalist and act in that interest . ""
The ANC 's stand was condemned by the South African National Editors ' Forum ( Sanef ) .
"" While we recognise the right of the ANC to advise members on how to exercise their consumer decisions , the call for a boycott of a newspaper is tantamount to intimidation and abuse of power , "" it said .
"" This kind of behaviour is unbecoming of a party that functions in an open democratic stage and especially one which leads the national government . ""
But on Friday the ANC hit back , describing Sanef 's remarks as "" inconsistent and opportunistic "" .
Mthembu said : "" We believe that our withholding of our buying power together with all South Africans who believe that the painting is offensive , in the instance of City Press , we should demonstrate our outrage at their refusal to remove the painting on their website . """
2012-05-28,"A South African newspaper has removed a controversial image of Jacob Zuma from its website , after coming under pressure from the African National Congress ( ANC ) , explaining : "" The atmosphere is like a tinderbox .
"" The weekly City Press was subjected to a call by the governing ANC for a reader and advertiser boycott after refusing to remove a photo of a painting that depicts the South African president with exposed genitals .
The boycott appeared to backfire on Sunday , with the paper selling out at many newsagents , but its editor took the picture down on Monday "" out of care and fear "" .
The satirical painting , The Spear , has provoked one of South Africa 's most polarising political debates in recent years , with the ANC and others construing it as reopening the wounds of racial apartheid , while others have defended artist Brett Murray 's right to free expression . ""
That we are now a symbol of a nation 's anger and rage is never the role of media in society , "" Ferial Haffajee , the editor of City Press , wrote on Monday .
"" We take down the image in the spirit of peacemaking â€ “ it is an olive branch .
But the debate must not end here and we should all turn this into a learning moment , in the interest of all our freedoms . ""
Of course , the image is coming down from fear too .
I 'd be silly not to admit that .
The atmosphere is like a tinderbox : City Press copies went up in flames on Saturday ; I do n't want any more newspapers burnt in anger . ""
One of her reporters had been banned from covering a trade union meeting , Haffajee added , while vendors of the paper were most at risk . ""
For any editor to respond to a threat to take down an article of journalism without putting up a fight is an unprincipled thing to do , so we 've fought as much as we could .
It does n't serve City Press or South Africa to dig in our heels and put our fingers in our ears .
""
The ANC welcomed the move but still demanded an apology .
Jackson Mthembu , the party 's national spokesperson , said : "" We appreciate what has been done .
We appreciate that at least Ferial is saying she can now understand the pain . ""
All that we are saying to her , is can she apologise for the pain .
Please apologise to the people of South Africa .
This pain has been so deep seated . ""
He added : "" We will then call off the boycott . ""
Earlier Haffajee did issue an apology in an open letter to Zuma 's daughter Duduzile .
"" I understand that what is a work of satire to me is a portrait of pain to you , "" it read .
"" I understand the impact on your little brothers and sisters , who may face teasing at school . ""
Playground cruelty leaves deep scars .
And if they and your dad saw the work in our pages and it caused harm , then I apologise from the bottom of my heart . ""
City Press 's U - turn was condemned by South Africa 's main opposition party , the Democratic Alliance , with a warning : "" We must never give in to bullies . ""
Mmusi Maimane , its national spokesperson , said : "" Whatever one may think of the painting , no political figure â€ “ no matter how powerful or influential â€ “ has the right to tell any newspaper what it is allowed to publish or not ; similarly no one should be able to tell an artist what he or she is allowed to paint . ""
He added : "" It is unfortunate that president Zuma and the ANC chose to intimidate the City Press into taking down the painting from its website , and it is equally unfortunate that the City Press has caved in to this pressure after a valiant attempt to fight for what is right . ""
This kind of self - censorship will stop our democracy in its tracks .
We will never forget how the apartheid government bullied its critics in the media , many of them into submission .
Those who stood firm against the bullies carried the torch of media freedom in those dark days .
We must keep that flame alive . ""
City Press 's initial stance had an unlikely defender in Julius Malema , the expelled president of the ANC 's youth wing .
In a column for the paper on Sunday , Malema said he intended to buy two copies , explaining : "" Banning newspapers simply because we disagree with them , and boycotting them on the basis of believing that our conception of truth is absolute , poses a real threat to our democracy . ""
The intervention of Malema , who has fallen out bitterly with Zuma , fuelled theories that The Spear has been a gift for Zuma 's base to manipulate public anger and mobilise support before he faces ANC factions in an election contest in December .
The ANC and its allies are organising a protest march on Johannesburg 's Goodman Gallery on Tuesday / today , where the painting hung until it was vandalised by two protesters and removed .
Although it is now widely visible on the web , including on a page of Wikipedia , the ANC will continue its legal action to have the painting and images of it banned .
A court case has been postponed indefinitely ."
2012-05-28,"Early today I published a copy of the controversial painting of South African president Jacob Zuma ( It shows him in a Leninist pose , but with exposed genitalia ) .
I did this as an act of solidarity with the country 's Sunday newspaper , City Press , after Zuma 's ruling party , the ANC , called for the paper to be boycotted .
Now , as David Smith reports from Johannesburg , the paper has removed the "" penis painting "" from its website .
Editor Ferial Haffajee , having held out for 10 days , explained her decision to remove the image , known as The Spear , in a lengthy editorial .
It was being taken down , she wrote , "" out of care and fear . ""
She wrote : "" That we are now a symbol of a nation 's anger and rage is never the role of media in society .
We are robust and independent , yes , but divisive and deaf , no ...
We take down the image in the spirit of peacemaking â€
“
it is an olive branch .
But the debate must not end here and we should all turn this into a learning moment , in the interest of all our freedoms . ""
Then came a key section headlined "" Fear "" .
She wrote : "" Of course , the image is coming down from fear too .
I 'd be silly not to admit that .
The atmosphere is like a tinderbox : City Press copies went up in flames on Saturday ; I do n't want any more newspapers burnt in anger .
My colleague has been removed from a huge trade union congress and prevented from reporting ...
Our vendors are most at risk . ""
And then she explained the nature of the climbdown : "" For any editor to respond to a threat to take down an article of journalism without putting up a fight is an unprincipled thing to do , so we 've fought as much as we could .
It does n't serve City Press or South Africa to dig in our heels and put our fingers in our ears .
The threats and invective against the writer of the review and a couple of us in the middle of the debate have been painful and have wrought a personal cost . ""
Without being in the least bit critical of Haffajee , and recognising the pressure she was put under , I am leaving mine up on this site .
I am sad to see that WAN - IFRA , which was still publishing the image this morning , has taken it down too without explanation ( see George Brock too ) .
It is a bad day for press freedom when a global organisation that is supposed to fight censorship censors itself ."
2012-05-29,"Thousands of supporters loyal to South Africa 's president , Jacob Zuma , have marched on an art gallery to protest at a satirical painting that showed him with exposed genitals .
Filling the streets of Johannesburg with the black , green and gold colours of the African National Congress the demonstrators gathered on Tuesday outside the Goodman Gallery , eye of a political storm since it displayed Brett Murray 's work
The Spear .
The march featured ANC flags , songs and toyi - toying â€ “ dance associated with the struggle against racial apartheid â€ “ and shirts and placards with declarations such as "" President Zuma has a right to human dignity and privacy "" , and "" We say no to abuse of artistic expression "" .
Riot police and vehicles were waiting outside the gallery .
The mood was generally peaceful despite a few homemade placards that referred to the racial dimension of the furore , stating "" Whites hate blacks "" , and "" Draw your white father naked , not our president "" .
The gallery , which previously displayed a part of Murray 's exhibition in its windows , had removed the works and put up a big slogan instead : "" The Goodman Gallery respects your right to protest . ""
A series of leaders from the ANC and allies addressed the crowd , denouncing the painting as racist to loud cheers and calling for it to be placed in a "" museum of shame "" .
Buti Manamela , national secretary of the Young Communist League , told protesters : "" The movement has always promoted freedom of expression , but you can not denigrate important figures . ""
Gwede Mantashe , the ANC 's secretary - general , announced triumphantly : "" Comrades , in the presence of everybody , the Goodman Gallery has watched your march and they committed to removing that portrait from their website .
"" There was jubilation and claims of "" victory "" , but the gallery later denied Mantashe 's claim , saying that the talks did not mean a settlement .
By late on Tuesday afternoon Murray 's disputed painting , The Spear , was still visible on the website .
The ANC called off its boycott of the City Press newspaper , which had published an image of the painting but had agreed to remove it on Monday .
Zuma is asking a regional high court to issue an order saying the display of the now - defaced painting violated his constitutional right to dignity .
In a separate hearing regarding The Spear , South Africa 's film and publication board on Tuesday conceded that it did not have the legal jurisdiction to classify any content published or broadcast by media outlets , but said it would forward complaints to the national press ombudsman .
One reporter tweeted a comment made during the proceedings : "" It is not a penis designed to titillate .
It is a penis that is part of a political statement . """
2012-05-29,"Supporters of the South African president , Jacob Zuma , have been urged to march on an art gallery on Tuesday in protest at a painting that depicts him with exposed genitals .
The governing African National Congress ( ANC ) called on "" all South Africans "" to demonstrate outside Johannesburg 's Goodman Gallery , which provoked a political firestorm by displaying Brett Murray 's artwork The Spear .
Two protesters last week defaced the controversial painting , removing it from the gallery .
But that will not prevent the ANC flexing its muscles in defence of Zuma . ""
The march called by the ANC is a protest against the continued display and exhibition in that gallery 's website of an insulting portrait of president Jacob Zuma , "" said Jackson Mthembu , the ANC 's national spokesperson .
"" It is also meant to condemn the defacing of an ANC logo with an inscription ' FOR SALE ' and ' SOLD ' as it continues to be displayed in that gallery .
"" We believe all these actions by the gallery are not only a violation of the right to dignity of cde [ comrade ] president Jacob Zuma but are a clear and calculated attack on the ANC .
We therefore again call on all South Africans , members and supports of the ANC and our alliance partners to come and register their outrage at this insult and attack on our president and the ANC . ""
The march will begin at Johannesburg 's Zoo Lake park and head to the gallery at 10 am local time .
The women 's wing of the ANC has said its members will be among those taking part .
A spokeswoman , Troy Martens , said : "" We will be demanding the painting be removed from every platform it is being displayed .
This painting is an icon of destruction towards our unified country and let 's call for its removal as a unified body of proud South African citizens from all walks of life . ""
Hundreds of ANC supporters gathered outside a regional high court last week as the party sought to have the painting banned ."
2012-06-02,"There was only one news story in South Africa at the end of last month .
A painting of President Jacob Zuma 's penis swept the national agenda and ignited pungent debate on the web .
Zuma 's supporters called it disgusting , racist and demeaning to African culture ; defenders of artistic freedom said Zuma had not earned the nation 's respect .
Even after the work had been defaced and removed , the governing African National Congress continued to whip up mass hysteria , "" calling on all South Africans to defend the president "" by mobilising in support of a court action .
Proof of a nation in turmoil ?
Not really .
This was , in fact , a good week for South Africa .
No one died .
No artists were jailed .
The president 's men were forced to make their argument in court .
While much of the debate was base and opportunistic , the affair ultimately spoke more of a vibrant , noisy constitutional democracy than a thought - policed dictatorship .
There could be no more salutary reminder of this than reading Donald McRae 's exquisitely framed memoir , Under Our Skin , recalling a not - so - distant era when people were dying , and being tortured , and being conscripted to fight in defence of a twisted ideology .
Artistic expression and political expression really were a matter of life or death .
McRae , a white boy of British descent , grew up in a comfortable middle - class bubble .
His narrative begins with a child 's eye view – innocent , non - judgmental and decontextualised – of daily life under apartheid , capturing how the young observe injustice with mild curiosity rather than repulsion .
More telling than harrowing accounts of atrocities is the casual , unthinking racism in the apartheid state 's DNA .
With studied blissful ignorance , McRae 's father refers to black boys anonymously as "" John "" , rather than learning their names , when hiring them to help with odd jobs .
The family 's black domestic servant is not allowed to use the same knives and forks or dining table .
Many of the black people he meets are similarly unquestioning of the status quo .
This is also a father - and - son story .
In his unfailingly crisp and understated prose , McRae recalls with great tenderness how his dad nursed him when he cut his face open on a metal bedstead .
Yet this same man is among the silent majority whose actions , or non - actions , underpin state - sponsored segregation and terror .
The book raises a question that has nagged anyone with a racist grandparent – to smile politely or to challenge ossified prejudice .
Thus Barack Obama famously said he could never disown his white grandmother – "" a woman who helped raise me , a woman who sacrificed again and again for me , a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world , but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street , and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe "" .
Politics invades the personal .
Having painted a childhood not so different from British suburbia – the Beatles , cricket , girls – McRae recounts the creeping chill of military conscription , which saw white boys bullied and beaten by little Hitlers in preparation for futile border wars .
When he declares himself a conscientious objector , his relationship with his father is torn apart .
There is even a chance that he might be subjected to electric - shock treatment .
Could his father stand by while a chunk of his brain is burned ?
Ultimately McRae is sent for psychiatric treatment .
Fortunately , his psychiatrist hits the nail on the head , comparing his situation to Joseph Heller 's Catch-22 .
For apartheid South Africa is like a bizarre , bloated satire of a nation in which all logic is inverted .
So it did for good men like Neil Aggett , a white doctor and anti - apartheid activist , tortured to death in detention .
But there is redemption here .
McRae 's father can not escape a picture in his office at the national electricity provider : "" Against a canvas of blue sky , giant cooling towers and gleaming electrical plant shimmered in the distance .
And yet , curiously , an African mud hut in the corner of the photograph always caught his eye .
It was a black home without electricity , and its contrast with the lavish new power station haunted him . ""
With the rebellious McRae already exiled in Britain , his father embarks on a programme to electrify South Africa 's black townships , previously "" Dickensian "" places where people used coal fires for heat and candles for light .
He becomes , in a quiet way , one of the heroes , "" Mr Electricity "" .
Refreshingly , this book does not attempt to over - analyse white South African identity , in the vein of other literature and journalism that it is tempting to describe as the unbearable whiteness of being .
As McRae acknowledges , South Africa 's post - apartheid glow was short - lived , and a new set of complexities arose .
Poverty , inequality and unemployment are rampant and more of that casual racism survives than many would like to admit .
But it is equally clear there is no lost golden age to yearn for , no cause for a paralysing nostalgia .

2012-06-06,"Last Tuesday the ANC 's secretary - general walked out of a Johannesburg art gallery and told supporters massed outside : "" Mission accomplished . ""
The party of Nelson Mandela had just forced the gallery to take down a painting showing President Jacob Zuma in a Lenin pose with his genitals exposed , and bullied a feisty newspaper to remove the image from its website .
Ferial Haffajee , the editor of the City Press newspaper , who had faced death threats and an ANC boycott , said she had decided to remove the image from the newspaper 's website out of "" care and fear "" .
Fear is a word journalists â€ “ and some of the party 's own leaders â€ “ have come to associate with the ANC lately .
In the governing party 's increasingly paranoid worldview , the media have become the single greatest enemy of the ANC .
"" We must realise that in this elections the main opposition is the media , "" said ANC secretary - general Gwede Mantashe in the runup to local elections last year .
Hence the passage , in November , of the Protection of Information Act , known here as the secrecy bill .
If signed into law , the bill would mean that journalists and their sources face up to 25 years in prison without recourse to a public interest defence .
It is a piece of legislation that reeks of the stench of the apartheid regime that the ANC helped vanquish in 1994 .
How did the party of Nelson Mandela â€ “ a brave fighter for freedom of expression and the authors of one of the world 's most progressive constitutions â€ “ get here ?
And why now ?
The reasons are numerous : the heavy burden of incumbency over the past 18 years ; the emergence of a paranoid , securocratic cadre of leaders under Zuma ; continued failure to deliver the jobs it promised its core support base ; and the spectre of loss of power .
After Mandela 's fairly benign five - year term he was replaced in 1999 by Thabo Mbeki , a prickly character whose relationship with the press soured when he was heavily criticised for his Aids denialist views .
Yet there was never any move towards legislated gagging of the media under the Mbeki administration .
It was when Zuma , a former ANC intelligence chief , won party elections in 2007 that the party embraced a conspiratorial outlook and began systematically putting up the barricades .
In this new administration , power is obtained and maintained through control of the intelligence services and their ability to control the flow of information .
Until just weeks before his election as president of the country , Zuma faced 783 counts of corruption .
The National Prosecuting Authority controversially dropped the charges when he produced an illegally obtained tape in which prosecution chiefs discussed his case .
This , he claimed , proved a conspiracy against him .
Zuma went on to pack his administration with ex - colleagues from the security and intelligence wings of the ANC .
The secrecy bill was put before parliament by Zuma 's State Security Minister , Siyabonga Cwele .
Cwele harbours a deep resentment of the media after his wife was exposed by the press and later convicted for recruiting drug mules for an international crime syndicate .
Over and above these paranoid , securocratic tendencies , however , the ANC 's growing antipathy towards the media is driven by the growing realisation that after 18 years in power its support is waning and its electoral hegemony is under threat .
The ANC recorded an impressive 69.6 % in the 2004 elections under Mbeki .
In 2009 it received only 65.9 % and support slipped further to 62 % in the local elections in May last year .
The opposition Democratic Alliance , however , is beginning to shed its image as a shrill , largely white party and is growing fast .
At the first democratic elections in 1994 it attracted 1.73 % of the vote .
This had swollen to 23.8 % in the local elections last May.
Electoral defeat may not be at the door just yet , but the ANC is well aware that most liberation movements falter and fail after 20 years .
The ANC 's close Zambian ally , Kenneth Kaunda 's UNIP , lost elections after 27 years .
Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF had to use violence to steal the elections in 2008 after 28 years in power .
South African analysts predict that the ANC faces a loss at the polls in 2024 , 30 years after Mandela first became president .
Another source of alarm for the ANC is the fact that the voting demographic is changing .
For the first time ever , South Africans who will vote at the next election in 2014 will include the so - called "" born - frees "" â€ “ the generation born after both the democratic election in 1994 and after Mandela 's release in 1990 .
For many of them , relying on the mythology of "" the struggle "" is meaningless .
This reduction of the "" liberation dividend "" can be seen from the tapering off of the ANC 's electoral hegemony and by increased rioting in poor townships .
There were more violent protests by communities demanding services in May this year than there have been in any month since 2004 .
How can there not be ?
Out of a population of 49 million , 7.5 million South Africans are out of work .
More than half of 18- to 25-year - olds are unemployed .
This is the ANC 's greatest failure , and where it fears the opposition will come from .
The key reason for the emergence of a culture of intolerance , however , is the fact that the ANC faces a leadership crisis .
The progressive Mandela era of leaders has been replaced by a weak , paranoid and incompetent cadre , at the head of which stands Zuma .
He lacks the moral authority to stand against his party and stop the adoption of the legislation .
In this leadership vacuum the securocrats have seen the gap and pushed the ANC towards the dangerous waters of gagging the media .
When Zuma signs the act into law , as he is expected to , it is this callow ANC which will shout "" mission accomplished "" .

2012-06-13,"She is a former social worker with a corporate background and diploma from the University of Wales .
She is also , South Africans hope , the saviour of the nation 's corruption - riddled , scandal - plagued police service .
Mangwashi Victoria Phiyega has been named by President Jacob Zuma as the national police chief , one of the toughest assignments in South African public life .
Although crime rates have gently declined in recent years , they remain vastly higher than in the United States or Europe , with an average of 43 people murdered every day .
Phiyega is the first woman to hold the job , a breakthrough praised by the women 's wing of the governing African National Congress .
"" We believe having a strong woman at the helm of the police service will bring a renewed focus to overcoming the scourge of gender - based violence , such as rape , which has become a growing concern across the country , "" said ANC spokesperson Troy Martens .
But the new police commissioner faces a battle on her own doorstep that could prove no less intractable : to clean up the image of an institution that has come to symbolise the deflated expectations and tainted polity of democratic South Africa .
Before 1994 the police were brutal enforcers of the apartheid state , most notoriously when opening fire on unarmed protesters in the 1960 Sharpeville massacre and 1976 Soweto student uprising .
The demise of white minority rule and election of Nelson Mandela required a deft transition in the security forces .
Like her two predecessors , Phiyega has been criticised for lacking any policing experience .
She holds qualifications including an MA in social sciences from the University of Johannesburg and a postgraduate diploma in business administration from the University of Wales .
Phiyega began her professional career as a social worker and has worked for child welfare organisations , as well as the state - owned transport enterprise and Absa bank .
Her appointment was condemned on Wednesday by the South African Police Union .
"" We were of the opinion that the president would [ have ] learnt that non - police officers have not made any good national police commissioners , "" said its general secretary , Oscar Skommere .
"" The continued imposition of others in the top SAPS [ SA Police Service ] office is not only an insult to tens of deserving officers , but it also demoralises them . ""
Johan Burger , a former high - ranking officer who is now a senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies , said : "" The fact it 's a woman does n't matter much .
Over the past decade women in the top ranks is nothing new … including two out of five deputies .
To me
it 's an absolute irrelevance .
"" The real question is whether someone who has no background in policing and the police as an organisation will be able to establish themselves to deal with the many difficulties the police have both internally and externally . ""
Her appointment is a vote of no confidence in the senior police management .
There are many good , honest and hard - working officers in the senior ranks , and this is a slap in the face .
It 's humiliating to have someone brought in from outside . ""
Burger accused the ANC of appointing police commissioners on the basis of allegiance to the party rather than their ability to fight crime . ""
Part of the problem was the need to transform ; it came at a price .
They decided the only way they could control the police was to appoint someone from the ranks of the ruling party rather than the police itself .
"" It 's was n't even about race : there were some very talented and experienced black and coloured police officers but they chose to appoint someone from the governing party .
Once you appoint them , then they make similarly poor appointments . """
2012-08-25,"Jacob Zuma , the president of South Africa , could be ousted later this year after what has been described as "" a string of unbelievable errors "" in his handling of the mine massacre that shocked viewers around the world .
Zuma is facing criticism for a sluggish response to one of post - apartheid South Africa 's biggest disasters , in which 34 striking mineworkers were gunned down by police .
With factionalism rampant in the governing party , some believe the episode could tip the balance against him when he seeks re - election at an African National Congress ( ANC ) conference in December .
Critics say that in the hours after the bloodshed at the Marikana platinum mine in the north - west of the country , Zuma was slow to return to South Africa from a summit in neighbouring Mozambique .
By the time he did reach the mine , it was "" too dark "" to address the angry mineworkers , he was quoted as saying last week .
Instead the president visited survivors in hospital and read a prepared speech to journalists at a game lodge owned by Lonmin , the company that owns the mine , announcing a commission of inquiry .
Many of those present described the address as flat .
Rubbing salt into Zuma 's wounds , his arch political enemy , Julius Malema , addressed the miners the following day , earning cheers as he accused Zuma of presiding over mass murder and called for him to resign .
Zuma did speak to the mineworkers last week , but he failed to attend a memorial service , where the limelight was again stolen by Malema , the expelled president of the ANC youth league .
The South African press has accused Zuma of misjudgment in his handling of the shootings .
An editorial in the Times said : "" Being a leader comes with a responsibility and in this case the president , or his advisers , failed to read the mood .
Sometimes a leader needs to suspend protocol and take charge of a situation in his country .
Zuma 's absence from the ' crime scene ' gave others space .
"" If history has shown that a major national crisis can make or break a presidency , the omens for Zuma are grim .
Susan Booysen , a political scientist at Wits University in Johannesburg , said : "" A wise government takes pre - emptive steps and there had been danger signals for several weeks .
Zuma did n't make a good impression by going to a private lodge .
He only went to the miners ' territory after Julius Malema had been there , so he came in on a weak wicket .
"" It was a string of unbelievable errors that came together .
I think that , on balance , he came across as weak .
There is not much in Zuma 's favour except the swift announcement of a commission of inquiry . ""
Booysen , author of The African National Congress and the Regeneration of Political Power , added : "" Does it really matter ?
I think it does .
If [ deputy president ]
Kgalema Motlanthe becomes a candidate , this will be important .
Opponents of Zuma will pull everything out of the closet to throw at him , just like they did against President Thabo Mbeki . ""
Motlanthe , who served as interim president between Mbeki and Zuma , has not yet revealed his ambitions for the ANC elective conference in Mangaung .
But in June he openly questioned Zuma 's concept of a "" second transition "" for South Africa and criticised aspects of the party leadership .
Zuma is seen as vulnerable over personal scandals , such as fathering a child out of wedlock , domestic plagues ranging from corruption to unemployment to non - delivery of school textbooks , and foreign policy controversies over the government 's stand on the conflicts in Ivory Coast and Libya .
Without a clear and popular rival , Zuma remains the favourite to lead the ANC into the next general election in 2014 .
He enjoys a powerful home base in the province of KwaZulu - Natal , the biggest ANC voting bloc , and significant allies such as the South African Communist party .
However , some of the provinces , certain sections of the trade union movement and the ANC youth league may feel that they have received a boost for their candidate : "" Anyone but Zuma "" ."
2012-09-12,"Just nine weeks into a new job that pits his critical intellect and earlier game - changing Aids treatment advocacy against the need to relegitimise a very sick multilateral institution , the most startling contradictions were laid out in front of the World Bank president , Jim Yong Kim , in South Africa .
Yet during his trip , those contradictions were barely acknowledged , despite the fact that the country is screaming out for decisive leadership and moral clarity .
Last Thursday , Kim met President Jacob Zuma , finance minister Pravin Gordhan and other cabinet ministers in Pretoria , and then , down the road in Johannesburg , he praised the World Bank 's local International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) staff , who are dedicated to private - sector investments , and even recorded a brief video while visiting Mailtronic Direct Marketing , a successful , IFC - funded small business specialising in printing and posting .
In his blog the next day , Kim was effusive about the trip , including "" possible collaboration on an issue dear to my heart : fighting the spread of tuberculosis "" .
Really ?
If this is not public relations gimmickry , and if Kim genuinely wants to tackle TB , it would mark a U - turn in the bank 's historic trajectory .
From 1951 , the bank lavishly financed the then - apartheid regime 's Eskom energy parastatal , which built coal - fired power plants and transmission lines that entirely avoided black townships and villages .
The majority of the country 's people were left to use dirty indoor energy ( paraffin , coal and wood ) for cooking and warming their shelters , regardless of the profuse particles produced that could lead to or exacerbate respiratory illnesses .
Bank - financed electricity mainly supplied South Africa 's mining houses and smelters , as is still the case ( the main customer of the Medupi coal - fired power station currently being built will be BHP Billiton , which consumes more than 10 % of the country 's power to smelt aluminium ) .
Then and now , this facilitated South Africa 's notorious migrant labour system , with low pay to migrant workers who succumbed to TB in squalid , single - sex , 16-to - a - room hostels and shacks .
Kim failed to address these historic issues , which are mirrored in his institution 's current portfolio , especially the IFC 's controversial commitment ( approved by former president Paul Wolfowitz in 2007 ) of $ 150 m in equity / credit lines to Lonmin at the Marikana mine , as well as the $ 3.75bn for the Medupi plant north of Pretoria , pushed through by his immediate predecessor , Robert Zoellick .
The 34 victims of the Marikana massacre were mainly migrants from Lesotho and the Eastern Cape .
Their migrant labour status replicates apartheid , including health vulnerability in disease - ridden shack settlements .
Many more low - income South Africans have shifted to dirty energy sources ( pdf ) that spread TB , thanks to electricity price increases of 128 % from 2008 - 12 , justified by Eskom 's "" build programme "" , which features Medupi .
Worsening price and access problems , in turn , have prompted thousands of "" service delivery protests "" that often became violent .
The very day Kim arrived , hundreds of Medupi workers downed tools over grievances associated with outsourcing , and protests forced an evacuation of the construction site .
"" Coal is a difficult issue , "" Kim said at his Pretoria press conference , while promising to help with South Africa 's $ 100bn coal - centred infrastructure expansion .
Medupi alone will spew 25 m tonnes of CO2 annually , more than the emissions total of 115 countries .
Then Kim 's spin turned surreal .
"" There was a very strong sense that this clean coal project [ Medupi ] was the way to go , "" he said .
The very phrase evokes a shudder , considering an estimated 10,000 people die annually from multilateral - financed , coal - fired power plants , according to the Environmental Defence Fund .
Given the ongoing mining chaos here , including widespread acid mine drainage wrecking eastern South Africa 's water , "" clean coal "" is a contradiction in terms .
The renewable energy piece of the Eskom loan was acknowledged as a "" fig leaf "" by William Moomaw , a bank consultant to the Medupi loan .
What about Kim 's enthusiastic praise for Mailtronic 's "" great story "" ?
Organised labour here valiantly opposes "" tenderpreneur "" dealings that cause state shrinkage via outsourced tenders on behalf of entrepreneurs .
The World Bank pushed Pretoria to privatise after Nelson Mandela took office in 1994 , and it was insensitive for Kim to promote outsourced printing when the government should be building internal mass - communications capacity .
Equally dubious was the claim that IFC 's stake in Mailtronic 's junk - mail paper / packaging waste – with its promotion of rampant consumerism – contributes to fighting poverty .
As the neoliberal Columbia University economist Jagdish Bhagwati said of the US - led nomination and selection process in April , it was of a piece with the "" linguistic obfuscations that dominate American public debate "" , and allowed Kim to gain presidency of the World Bank unfairly .
Though I would quickly diverge from Bhagwati 's agenda , Kim 's visit here gives further reasons for him to resign , before more futile statements are uttered in defence of the indefensible at the World Bank ."
2012-09-20,"South African rebel Julius Malema was robbed of a platform this week when thousands of Lonmin miners decided to call off their six - week strike , just as he was breathing life back into his political career on the back of their industrial woes .
Over the space of a few weeks , Malema had successfully tapped into the anger aroused by the merciless massacre of 34 miners in mid - August by police officers .
He heaped scorn on the poor handling of the crisis by President Jacob Zuma , the man who had only recently expelled him from the ruling African National Congress ( ANC ) .
Daily , he roamed the platinum and gold belts in the north - west of the country imploring workers to down tools and join their peers in solidarity .
He gave them hope and offered the prospect of a socialist South Africa in the near future , urging them to rise up against the white owners of the mines and claim what he believes is rightfully theirs .
And they responded with thunderous applause .
Malema was in his element .
Little more than three months after Zuma cut short his political career , there he was , back on the frontline again , rallying the masses and driving the headlines , with hordes of local and international TV cameras tailing him with the same intensity as they always had .
It reminded me of something he once told me in the time I spent with him while researching my book .
It was about two years ago and for some reason , which I can not now recall , he had come within a hair 's breadth of the wrath of the ANC .
"" They ca n't get me , "" he laughed heartily .
"" I 'm the one with the nine lives .
They ca n't bring me down . ""
Malema 's words ring as true today as they did then .
Though he spells doom , if not terror or worse , for many South Africans , he is a locomotive force among millions of dispossessed South Africans .
And therein lies the secret of his staying power : Malema is a metaphor for modern South Africa , with its fractured social lines and its divided sense of self .
He embodies what Cameroonian philosopher Achille Mbembe refers to as "" lumpen radicalism "" : "" a political tradition of unruliness â€ “ and at times resistance â€ “ in which fantasies of male power , control and desire have always been deeply entangled with ' war envy ' "" .
It is the kind of radicalism which is also deeply embedded in millions of South Africans , which is why Malema can relate them with the ease that he does .
In many respects , he has picked up where Winnie Madikizela - Mandela left off many years ago .
A revolutionary figure in her day , she was fearless and radical and pushed way too close to the edge .
Like her , Malema has taken to fanning the flames in townships across the country , hastily reviving the revolutionary tradition as he taps into the racial and social anger that continues to bubble beneath the surface with his war - like talk .
It is not surprising that he was quick to make his way to the mining belts last month when violence erupted .
It was his perfect storm .
For many South Africans , though , it was as if they were gaping at an atrocity all over again .
Yet what is often lost in any understanding of Malema 's provocation , is the fact that he operates in a country that has infinite political opportunity for a man of his ilk , underpinned as South Africa is by a sophisticated first - world economy but bogged down by the harsh realities of the third world and ruled by an ANC that has got lost in its transition from liberation movement to ruling political party .
It was , after all , a failure on the part of Zuma to take control of the recent mining crisis that allowed Malema make his comeback in the manner that he did .
The return of the miners to work on Thursday may have left Malema without an immediate cause , but it would be wrong to think we have seen the end of him .
With the poorest 20 % of the population living off 1.4 % of all available income , unemployment teetering around the 40 % mark , and a gross dereliction of duty on the part of the ANC leadership , Malema 's pickings are as rich as his prospects are healthy .
His future is guaranteed .
It 's South Africa 's that appears shaky ."
2012-09-21,"A warrant has been issued for the arrest of the South African politician Julius Malema on charges of corruption .
Malema , who was expelled from the governing African National Congress ( ANC ) this year and has become an outspoken critic of President Jacob Zuma , is expected to appear in court next week .
South Africa 's City Press newspaper reported that the warrant related to charges of fraud , money laundering and corruption involving government contracts .
Malema has always vehemently protested his innocence .
Nicqui Galaktiou , a lawyer for Malema , said she had not yet seen the contents of the warrant .
"" We were notified today that a warrant had been issued and we have been negotiating with the authorities regarding Mr Malema 's appearance in court , "" she told eNews Channel Africa "" He will hand himself over voluntarily at a court appearance next week .
"" The case would be heard in Polokwane in Limpopo , Malema 's home province , Galaktiou added .
The date has not yet been confirmed .
Malema , 31 , was removed as president of the ANC Youth League in March but remains one of South Africa 's most electrifying politicians .
He seized on the recent industrial unrest to call for a national mining strike , turning himself into a lightning rod for workers ' anger over the yawning gap between rich and poor .
But critics regard him as an opportunistic demagogue who has cynically manipulated the situation in an attempt to revive his political career and oust Zuma .
Asked if the charges were politically motivated , Galaktiou replied : "" That is our belief up to now .
Once we 've seen the charges , we 'll have a better idea . ""
At a press conference in Johannesburg on Tuesday , Malema claimed that Zuma was likely to move against him .
"" If we are illegally arrested tomorrow , we would have been arrested by Jacob Zuma , "" he said .
Malema was willing and ready to go to jail and was not intimidated , he added .
"" I have nothing to hide â€ ¦ I only have my convictions .
Nothing will stop me from fighting for economic freedom , not even my death ...
We are unshaken . ""
Reports that Malema is facing arrest have been swirling since long before the crisis erupted at the Marikana mine .
He has been under investigation by the elite Hawks detective unit for alleged corruption relating to his Ratanang Family Trust and its shareholding in On - Point Engineering , a company that has made millions of rand from government tenders in Limpopo .
A separate report into the matter by South Africa 's anti - corruption ombudsman , the public protector , is also said to be imminent .
Many commentators have questioned how a self - proclaimed champion of the poor can fund a lavish lifestyle that includes champagne parties , a Breitling watch and a Mercedes - Benz .
In a recent interview with the Guardian at his home in Sandton , dubbed the wealthiest square mile in Africa , Malema denied any wrongdoing .
"" I 'm waiting for the day I 'm going to be charged with corruption because to be judged that I 've got where I am because of corruption is incorrect , "" he said .
"" There is no judge or any credible institution which has arrived at that conclusion .
For as far as I 'm concerned , I 'm innocent until proven otherwise .
"" How am I corrupt when I 've never worked for government , I 've never dished out tenders for government , I 've never sat in any committee that gives tenders in government .
How am I influencing those people ?
Who did I influence ? ""
Asked about his personal wealth , Malema replied : "" I 'm not worth anything .
There should n't be a temptation to get into people 's bank accounts , but just take it from me , I 'm worth nothing .
Half of what I have belongs to the bank . ""
As in previous court appearances , Malema and his supporters are likely to spare no expense in mounting a legal defence .
On Friday the opposition Democratic Alliance welcomed the arrest warrant . ""
The South African public are sick and tired of politically connected individuals abusing public procurement to line their own pockets , "" said Dianne Kohler Barnard , the shadow police minister .
"" Now that Julius Malema is outside of the ANC fold , he clearly lost the protection from law enforcement agencies that he once appeared to enjoy . """
2012-10-11,"It now seems an almost innocent time .
Earlier this year the burning political issue in South Africa was a painting of the president with his genitals exposed .
That was before police opened fire on striking miners , killing dozens , and the nation was swept by a wave of industrial unrest .
But while President Jacob Zuma has been criticised for a muted response to the mining crisis , his supporters have mobilised in a furious campaign to ban Brett Murray 's painting The Spear .
At first the censors agreed , and classified The Spear as unsuitable for those under 16 .
But now they have reversed their decision , rejecting the argument that the artwork is offensive to African culture .
Prince Mlimandlela Ndamase , spokesman for South Africa 's Film and Publication Board , said its appeal tribunal "" has set aside the classification decision "" after meeting about two weeks ago .
The tribunal found that the classification board had been "" heavily influencedâ€ ¦ by the need to affirm the dignity of African males and to protect sensitive persons and children "" .
But there had been no evidence before the board that "" the painting would be harmful to children on the grounds that it seriously undermines and is insensitive to African culture "" .
The argument that the presence of nudity in the painting by default deems it "" potentially disturbing , harmful or inappropriate to children "" is flawed , the tribunal added .
"" It would mean that every artistic work that contained nudity would be deemed presumptively harmful to children . ""
The tribunal also upheld the classification board 's finding that The Spear was not pornographic .
The Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg , which originally displayed the painting , had challenged the original "" 16N "" rating on the ground that it was "" impermissible and unsustainable "" .
Lara Koseff , a spokeswoman , said : "" We are delighted with the result and certainly feel vindicated . ""
This victory has cemented the gallery 's mission to uphold its status as an activist space dedicated to nurturing freedom of creative expression in South Africa .
It has also set a crucial precedent for the future of visual art in this country .
We believe that it was extremely important to legally challenge the principle of censorship of the arts . ""
Koseff welcomed the overturning of the presumption that the display of nudity was harmful to children . ""
The argument would imply that Pablo Picasso 's Nude Youth painting and Michelangelo 's sculpture David would be deemed presumptively harmful for children . ""
The Spear caused uproar when it went on show at the gallery in May.
Zuma said in court documents that the artwork undermined his constitutional right to dignity .
Its portrayal of his genitals was widely seen by his supporters as a racist attack on his culture and polygamous ways .
But the gallery and the artist defended their right freedom of expression .
Murray said in a legal affidavit that it was part of an exhibition criticising the ruling African National Congress for greed and corruption .
He also said that details of Zuma 's sex life had become part of the public debate in South Africa .
"" I am not a racist , "" Murray said .
"" I do not produce art with an intention to hurt , humiliate or insult . ""
The painting was later taken down after two men defaced it with paint , claiming they were acting independently of each other in defence of the president .
On Thursday , Blade Nzimande , the higher education minister and a Zuma ally who was outspoken against The Spear , condemned the board 's reversal .
"" It is wrong , "" he told the Guardian . ""
This painting is disgusting and insulting to the president .
"" We take this very seriously .
We feel it is an insult to the black majority in this country .
We feel our act of reconciliation is being taken for granted by the white population . ""
Asked if the ANC had a reaction , its national spokesman , Jackson Mthembu , replied by text message : "" No . ""
In August another painting of Zuma with his penis exposed went on display in Cape Town .
But Ayanda Mabulu 's work , Umshini Wam , raised barely a few murmurs ."
2012-10-12,"There are two gestures now essential to understanding South African politics .
One is a rolling hand motion as practised by football fans when calling for a player to be substituted .
The player they want yanked off is the president , Jacob Zuma .
The other is the cupping of a hand at a downward angle to represent a shower head â€ “ a mocking reference to Zuma 's six - year - old gaffe about showering after having sex with an HIV - positive woman , of which the cartoonist Zapiro constantly reminds him .
Both these gestures were prominent , accompanied by much singing and stomping , at Thursday night 's launch of the authorised biography of Kgalema Motlanthe , Zuma 's deputy and his only credible challenger in an African National Congress ( ANC ) leadership contest in December .
Indeed , this was less a book launch with wine - sipping literati than a raucous anti - Zuma rally attended by top dissidents Tokyo Sexwale , Mathews Phosa and rebels from the ANC youth league .
In the absence of US - style presidential debates in South Africa ( Zuma v Thabo Mbeki a few years ago would have been an amusing clash of styles ) , this was the closest thing the rank and file could get to a proper look at Motlanthe .
For it could be argued that Motlanthe 's principal strength in the presidential race is that he is n't Zuma .
The 63-year - old is a private man and opaque politician ; few voters would be able identify a clear Motlanthe agenda .
He is the tabula rasa on to which the "" anyone but Zuma "" campaign can project their hopes and , perhaps , wishful thinking .
The publication of his biography , therefore , risks letting in daylight upon magic .
At the launch in the great hall at Johannesburg 's Wits University , Ray Hartley , editor of the Sunday Times , said : "" I think this book does introduce South Africa to Kgalema Motlanthe for the first time . ""
It does give us our first detailed picture of the deputy president .
Those of us in the fourth estate have been scratching around to try to work out who is the man who was the third president of South Africa . ""
Third president ?
Yes , Motlanthe was a kind of caretaker president for seven months after Mbeki was ousted and before Zuma won the 2009 general election .
But president he was .
The record will always show that he wore the crown and so does my memory .
On my first day covering Africa for the Guardian , I attended a press conference with President Motlanthe specifically for foreign journalists ( more than three years later , we are still waiting for Zuma to do the same ) .
In fact , South African journalists mining advance copies of the biography are yet to come up with a blockbuster revelation .
There have been tales about Motlanthe saving Zuma from expulsion from the party , Motlanthe disagreeing with the decision to expel the youth leader Julius Malema and Motlanthe expressing discontent over various government failings .
But still little to fire up voters either way .
"" The man is truly a biographer 's delight , "" the author , the former trade unionist Ebrahim Harvey , told the audience on Thursday night , implying that Motlanthe will not be losing much sleep over its contents .
Harvey said he had spent almost 200 hours with the politician over three years ( adding that Mbeki only gave his biographer 45 hours ) . ""
He decided to open up his mind both personally and politically in this biography , "" he said .
"" It was a very courageous step . ""
Motlanthe is a man with nothing to hide , he continued .
Even when a newspaper falsely claimed that Motlanthe was having an affair with a 24-year - old , not once was he "" morose , dejected , looking troubled "" , but instead showed "" amazing fortitude "" .
Harvey insisted that the timing of the book 's publication , just two months before the leadership election in Mangaung , was pure coincidence .
But then he took a swipe at the ANC over its response to the deadly unrest sweeping the country 's mines . ""
The ANC pretence that we do n't have a social crisis in this country is quite ridiculous .
In that respect the timing for me is much more important than Mangaung . ""
Next up was the man himself â€ “ like Zuma , a former inmate on Robben Island .
Motlanthe was , as ever , charming and cerebral but not exactly charismatic . ""
I thought a political biography has got to be written by someone who is going to be critical and make an assessment of the work we do , the positions we adopt and so on , "" he said .
"" I did not want a book that is only about positive issues . ""
He then told a story about a trip to Italy where he was impressed by a new teaching method .
"" Things are always changing , "" he observed innocently , prompting the biggest roar of the night from a crowd that could see only the subtext of leadership elections .
Motlanthe paused .
Against whoops and whistles , he continued : "" For me the irony is already lost because I 'm talking about â€ ¦
This is science .
It 's not about names of places .
I can see that you are trapped within the geographic names of Mangaung ( where the leadership election will take place ) .
There are many other important things about Mangaung than just the ANC elective conference . ""
He ended on a somewhat sombre note .
"" I 've told my comrade Trevor [ Manuel , the planning minister ] , in my will , I leave very clear instructions when I pass , my obituary or tombstone â€
“ if anybody believes I deserve a tombstone
â€ “ should say : ' Others made suggestions and he implemented . '
""
Which , in the ranks of political epitaphs , is never going to challenge Abraham Lincoln or Winston Churchill .
That apart , we still did n't learn much about the man who would be king ( again ) .
The wild cheers seemed to be driven more by out - with - the - old desperation than desire for the new . ""
More bloody riddles from the masters of spin , smoke , mirrors and obfuscation , "" remarked one journalist on the way out .
"" What does this guy really stand for except ABZ â€ “ anyone but Zuma ? """
2012-10-22,"Thabo Mbeki , the former president of South Africa , has broken a four - year silence to deliver a withering verdict on the state of the nation as it reels from violent strikes and dampened self - confidence .
Although he did not mention the president , Jacob Zuma , by name , Mbeki 's first intervention in domestic politics since being forced from office in 2008 was widely interpreted as an attack on his successor .
The 70-year - old said he was "" deeply troubled by a feeling of great unease that our beloved motherland is losing its sense of direction , and that we are allowing ourselves to progress towards a costly disaster of a protracted and endemic general crisis "" .
Mbeki continued : "" I , for one , am not certain about where our country and nation will be tomorrow , and what I should do in this regard , to respond to what is obviously a dangerous and unacceptable situation of directionless and unguided national drift . ""
Having succeeded Nelson Mandela as president in 1999 , Mbeki was forced to resign after the governing African National Congress ( ANC ) turned against him and elected Zuma .
He has subsequently declined to comment on day - to - day politics in South Africa and the ANC .
But the killing by police of 34 striking miners at Marikana and continued violent unrest in the mining sector , along with a deepening sense of national malaise at home and abroad , may have prompted Mbeki to speak out .
Zuma is facing a leadership contest in December . ""
Among others , that feeling of unease is informed by questions I have not been able to answer about what happened which allowed the eminently avoidable massacre at the Lonmin Marikana mine in the north - west province to happen , "" said Mbeki , who was giving a lecture at Fort Hare university in Eastern Cape province .
"" My feeling of unease is also informed by what I sense is a pervasive understanding throughout the nation that there is no certainty about our future with regard to any of our known challenges , and therefore the future of the nation . ""
Mbeki warned : "" I am convinced that it would be treacherous to hide our heads in the sand and behave as though we remain on course in terms of the achievement of our shared and various national objectives . ""
He went on to quote some lines from Hamlet : "" ' The time is out of joint .
O cursÃ
© d spite/
That ever I was born to set it right ! '
I dare say that the time during which we live is out of joint .
The challenge each one of us faces is whether we have the courage to set it right . ""
With factional tensions still high in the ANC , Mbeki 's critique earned a sharp rebuke from Zuma 's allies .
Gwede Mantashe , the party 's secretary general , told South Africa 's Sunday Times : "" We are dealing with old problems .
But if his judgment is that we are losing direction , it is up to him .
"" There were statistics released this week on the impact of the HIV / Aids programme that is in place now .
Life expectancy has grown from 52 years to 60 years .
That is an improvement .
If you look at the sharp decline in infant mortality â€ ¦ if you look at the sharp decline in the transmission of mother - to - child [ HIV transmission ] â€ ¦ that is progress .
If these achievements are a loss of direction , it 's fine . ""
S'dumo Dlamini , president of the Congress of South African Trade Unions , said : "" Now we will not accept it when there is an insinuation or a direct pronouncement that our country is directionless or leaderless .
I want to challenge the former president [ about ] what is he doing right now to provide the leadership he says this country does not have .
"" The debate came just as Zuma was pleading with politicians and commentators "" to stop talking our country and economy down "" .
An Economist magazine cover story headlined ""
Cry the beloved country : South Africa 's sad decline "" has caused a stir following the downgrading of the economy by international ratings agencies
Moody 's and Standard and Poor 's .

2012-11-09,"Eight opposition parties in South Africa have tabled a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma – a move unprecedented in the country 's 18-year democratic history .
Political analysts described the attempt to force Zuma 's resignation as largely symbolic since the dominant African National Congress ( ANC ) is bound to vote it down , but it reflects growing disaffection in the country at large . ""
The South African people are bearing witness to the emergence of a government and a country different to that envisaged by President Nelson Mandela and those who fought to liberate South Africa from oppression and ushered in a new democratic order in 1994 , "" the parties said in a joint statement .
They cited a series of setbacks that have blighted what was meant to be a year of celebration of the ANC 's centenary , including the police massacre of 34 striking mineworkers at Marikana and the so - called "" Nkandlagate "" scandal over the spending of taxpayer millions on Zuma 's private residence .
The government 's failure to deliver textbooks to schoolchildren in Limpopo and Eastern Cape provinces , the downgrading of South Africa 's credit rating by two major ratings agencies and mounting disrespect for the constitution and judiciary were also given as reasons .
Combined with growing unemployment and "" the uncontrollable and rising tide of corruption in the public service "" , all of these collectively point to "" the reality that ours is a country which lacks decisive leadership and vision , "" the parties said .
Mangosuthu Buthelezi , veteran leader of the Inkatha Freedom party ( IFP ) , said the decision to support the motion had not been easy for him or his party . ""
Since we achieved liberation in April 1994 , the IFP has done its best to support all presidents of South Africa , because we understood that even though we did not vote for them , they carry the responsibility of making our country succeed ; and if they fail , we fail , "" he said .
"" However , we have reached a point at which we can no longer support this president . ""
There has been increasing criticism of Zuma within the ranks of the ANC and by its expelled youth leader , Julius Malema .
This week saw the launch of a "" forces of change "" website before an ANC internal leadership contest next month , where Zuma could face a challenge from his deputy , Kgalema Motlanthe .
Lindiwe Mazibuko , parliamentary leader of the Democratic Alliance , who tabled the motion , said the parties are seeking the support of ANC MPs who oppose Zuma 's bid for a second term and pushing for a secret ballot .
"" We want to give the opportunity to those members of the ANC who want to search their conscience and make a decision about whether they want to re - elect President Zuma for another term , or allow him to continue what we see as a failed term , "" she said .
But with the ANC holding 264 of the 400 seats in parliament , the opposition would need a dramatic rebellion on the ANC benches .
The motion is more likely to rally MPs around the president and may even strengthen his hand .
The office of Mathole Motshekga , the ANC chief whip , declared its resolve to "" quash any frivolous and narrow publicity - seeking gimmicks masquerading as motions "" by opposition parties .
It added : "" The motion by a group of opposition parties is not based on any fact or evidence , and therefore amounts to nothing but character assassination .
In our view , it is a waste of parliament 's time ; a playful , silly publicity stunt and therefore belongs to the rubbish bin . ""
Parliament 's programme committee , chaired by speaker Max Sisulu , will decide if and when the motion should be debated .
Commentators applauded the opposition 's bold but doomed initiative .
Prince Mashele of the Centre for Politics and Research said : "" It 's not going to damage the president or change anything essentially .
But I think it 's a smart move .
There have been many embarrassing scandals and there has been no sign that members of the ANC give a damn , so this plants a seed of desperation on the part of those who wo n't stand by while it 's happening . """
2012-11-29,"The South African government acted unlawfully in failing to give the Dalai Lama an entry visa in time to attend the archbishop emeritus Desmond Tutu 's 80th birthday celebrations , a court has ruled .
The supreme court of appeal 's unanimous judgment strongly criticised the then home affairs minister , Nkosazana Dlamini - Zuma , an ex - wife of the president , Jacob Zuma , and now head of the African Union .
The government was accused of banning the Dalai Lama last year because of a fear of offending China .
A furious Tutu , who had invited the Tibetan spiritual leader to deliver a lecture in Cape Town , likened the African National Congress ( ANC ) to its racial apartheid predecessor .
The Dalai Lama and others in his entourage had applied for visas through the South African high commission office in New Delhi , India , about two months ahead of the planned visit , the court in Bloemfontein heard .
Even though the application met all requirements , the South African government did not issue the visa and the Dalai Lama ultimately withdrew his application .
"" What is justified by the evidence is an inference that the matter was deliberately delayed so as to avoid a decision , "" the ruling by judge Robert Nugent said .
"" It hardly needs saying that the minister is not entitled to deliberately procrastinate .
Procrastination by itself establishes unreasonable delay . ""
Nugent acknowledged that pressure from China , a major trading partner with South Africa , played a part in the delays .
The Dalai Lama wants increased autonomy for Tibet , the homeland from which he has been exiled since 1959 .
China accuses him of being a separatist .
"" I accept that the proposed visit raised matters of high diplomatic importance , justifiably calling for consultation , advice and consideration , "" the judge ruled .
"" But that begs the question what time was required to complete that process . ""
However , the judge said he did not find any evidence that officials had plans to deny the visa outright .
Tutu welcomed the court 's verdict . ""
An independent judiciary is one of the most critical cornerstones of a democracy , "" he said .
"" This finding of our appeal court reflects positively on our judiciary and our country . ""
His holiness is the holiest person I have had the fortune to meet .
He has endured more than 50 years in exile .
His grace , magnanimity and lack of bitterness are truly remarkable . ""
Tutu added : "" I look forward to seeing him again soon , and perhaps I will invite him to celebrate my 90th birthday . ""
Opposition politicians who brought the appeal said the verdict had upheld the rule of law in South Africa .
Mosiuoa Lekota , president of the Congress of the People , said : "" Any citizen who wishes to invite a friend from abroad can not be pressurised by government not to do so .
It is held that justice delayed is justice denied .
Likewise procrastination purposefully pursued is unconstitutional and unlawful . ""
How often must our law courts remind the ruling party to honour the constitution and recognise its supremacy in our legal framework ? ""
He added : "" In taking a position to delay the processing of the Dalai Lama visa , the government denied archbishop Desmond Tutu his constitutional right to invite his holiness . ""
The response from the government 's home affairs department was brief .
"" The department has noted the judgment handed down today by the supreme court of appeal on the Dalai Lama matter , "" said the deputy director general Jackie Mckay .
"" In line with our constitution , the department respects the ruling of the supreme court in this regard . """
2012-12-13,"The centenary year of the African National Congress began with songs and champagne but ends as an unqualified annus horribilis .
South Africa suffered rising public protests , credit rating downgrades , education failures , a verbal brawl over a painting of the presidential privates and a massacre of 34 striking workers in the bloodiest state crackdown since racial apartheid .
Many presidents would dread a leadership contest at the end of such a year , especially when a 248 m rand ( Â£18 m ) security upgrade of his private residence has become another political firestorm .
Yet Jacob Zuma goes to the ANC conference in Mangaung next week widely expected to receive a vote of confidence , in effect guaranteeing him the most powerful job in Africa until 2019 .
In his wood - panelled office in Pretoria , Zuma did not appear burdened by history or the Cassandras who foresee burning towers and a Zimbabwe - like fall for the nation of Nelson Mandela .
The 70-year - old was breezy , upbeat and hard to dislike , a demeanour his supporters perceive as steady pragmatism â€ “ and his detractors see as hopelessly glib and out of touch .
The official opposition gave him a F - grade for 2012 and is seeking a parliamentary vote of no confidence .
In a wide - ranging interview , he discussed the mining crisis , his nemesis , Julius Malema , gay rights in Africa and that painting .
"" Nobody expected Marikana , "" said Zuma , of the police shooting of workers at the Lonmin platinum mine in August .
"" But I think you ca n't fail to appreciate that Marikana happened in a democratic country .
If it was during apartheid , there were many Marikanas almost on a daily basis , and there was nothing that anyone could do . ""
He said the establishment of a judicial commission of inquiry into the shootings showed how South Africa had changed .
"" You would not have had that during apartheid days .
That 's the beauty of democracy , because it does n't mean that when you have got democracy there will be no such mishap and shocking things .
I think the test is how does the country handles that .
To me , that is the difference . ""
But in most democracies would not the police minister , at least , have fallen on his sword ? ""
Well , I do n't know about other countries .
Again it 's a question of how people look into that .
What is it that caused Marikana , really ? ""
A dispute over wages had led to unrest , he said .
"" Now you ca n't say the minister of police is responsible for that , to start the thing .
When the workers were striking , they had every other kind of weapon in their hands .
In fact , long before the shooting , 10 people had died , including two policemen , two security policemen . ""
In a vein likely to anger families and supporters of the slain mineworkers , Zuma asked : "" How many other people would have died if , for example , police did not move to disarm these people ?
Nobody can tell .
At a spur of the moment , a mistake happened .
Now if such a mistake happened , you throw the minister away ?
I do n't know on what basis . ""
Marikana could be the defining event of Zuma 's presidency and has certainly shone a harsh light on South Africa 's mining sector , where for more than a century lack of safety has cost well in excess of 50,000 lives .
Migrant workers continue to live far from their families in grim conditions , carrying out hazardous work for what many argue is pitifully low pay .
In what appeared to be a warning to international mining companies such as Lonmin , which is listed on the London stock exchange , Zuma said : "" If we do n't tackle the change , and that mining should transform , you will from time to time have such situations .
It 's not the first time that people have this kind of strike wherein many people die .
We 've got to transform that , particularly if it is one of the backbones of our industry . ""
The conditions of workers should change .
They ca n't continue to be what they were many decades ago .
I would imagine Marikana in a democratic South Africa has been a wake - up call to say : let us fix the conditions of the workers and make the conditions to be in keeping with what this industry is producing .
I think it contributes a lot in terms of the economy .
It almost borders on exploitation , as it were , the conditions of employment , the level of the salary , etc .
I believe this is a moment to transform . ""
The interview , conducted before Mandela 's admission to hospital with a lung infection put the nation on edge , took place at South Africa 's version of the White House .
The light sandstone Union Buildings , at 99 a year younger than the ANC , are a visual metaphor for the republic 's rich and sometimes jarring contradictions .
Designed by Sir Herbert Baker , the "" Union "" refers to that of Boers and British , not the black majority ; statues of Botha and Hertzog dominate the lawns ; first world war memorials carry mostly Anglo - Saxon names .
It was in the midst of all this that Mandela was inaugurated in 1994 and Zuma 15 years later .
Political liberation has been achieved but , ask Zuma 's critics on the left , has economic liberation been sacrificed ?
The latest census shows white people still earn six times more than black people , though the gap is slowly narrowing , while a recent study found that black people directly own less than 10 % of the Johannesburg stock market .
"" We have a history in South Africa of an entrenched white monopoly capital , "" Zuma said .
"" The economy in South Africa was racially structured for many decades , if not centuries .
I do n't think in 18 years you could solve that unless you have a miracle .
I think we 've got all the policies in place to deal with that issue . ""
Black people had been denied access to the mainstream economy and to education , he added , but nationalising mines or seizing farms were not the answer .
"" It 's a tough struggle to deal with that and therefore the monopoly continues .
In other places , they get freedom , they say , ' Sorry , we nationalise , ' and it has had its own consequences in other countries .
We are a constitutional democracy .
We must deal with things properly within the framework of the law and then the constitution .
I think we are making good inroads , which I think is in keeping with the massive programme of education we are putting in place . ""
Yet South Africa is one of the most unequal societies on the planet .
The ANC 's union allies have warned of a "" ticking timebomb "" with unemployment at 36.2 % hitting young black people especially hard .
Bishop Jo Seoka , president of the South African Council of Churches , recently warned that a revolution could go from mines and wine farms to townships to suburbs .
Moeletsi Mbeki , a political economist and brother of the former president Thabo Mbeki , predicted South Africa 's "" Tunisia Day "" will come in 2020 .
Will the country blow ?
"" I do n't think there 's a ticking timebomb , "" Zuma said .
"" Unemployment is a global issue â€ ¦ but in South Africa it gets exaggerated precisely because of the history , because of the fact that of the unemployed , quite a good percentage is unemployable , and this is what we 've got to deal with .
If there were no measures taken to deal with the problem , I 'll be saying people are correct . ""
Such an answer is unlikely to satisfy Malema , who as president of the ANC youth league called for radical steps to overhaul the economy .
He was expelled for ill - discipline this year .
Asked how he felt about Malema 's personal attacks , Zuma replied : "" I do n't feel much because to me it has exposed what type of a person he is , it has exposed the depth of his politics , it has exposed to me the level of his care and love of the organisation .
When he says he loves it , anyone who loves this organisation does not behave like that .
I do n't think I 've got time to waste on such matters really . ""
Is Malema 's political career finished ? ""
Well , I 'm not going to guess that , but I think it will depend on how people move .
You could have your political career continue but in a totally different way .
But in the ANC he has been expelled , and I 'm not certain that he 's doing anything for people to think expelling was not the right remedy . ""
Malema has tried to land any punch on Zuma that he can , including the president 's private life : he is a traditional Zulu polygamist with four wives and 21 children .
He has been criticised for culturally fundamentalist remarks about women and gay people .
Other leaders on the continent have described homosexuality as "" unAfrican "" .
So where does Zuma stand on gay marriage , which was legalised by South Africa in 2006
â€ “ the first African country to do so ?
"" That does not necessarily require my view ; it requires the views of South Africans , "" he said carefully .
"" We have a constitution that is very clear that we all respect , which I respect .
It has a view on that one , that gay marriage is a constitutionally accepted thing in South Africa .
So no matter what my views would be . ""
Asked how he would react if one of his children told him they were gay , Zuma replied : "" I 'd react in a particular way , but she or he would have taken a decision .
I would respect that , for that 's what the constitution says .
There are small things that would have made me to have a feeling , otherwise I would not be a parent .
If for example I had a child , and I 'm sure I would want to have a grandchild one day , no matter how much I accept the reality but inside I would be saying , ' I wish I would have had a grandchild , but nevertheless the person has taken the decision , on the constitution I must accept . '
"" Zuma 's own sex life became a talking point in 2012 when he was depicted as Lenin with exposed genitals in Brett Murray 's satirical painting The Spear .
The president 's supporters marched on the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg and two protesters defaced the artwork .
There was a toxic debate about art , race and the right to offend in which people mostly talked past each other .
What did The Spear say about South Africa today ?
"" There will be individuals who think differently .
I do n't think in a country you can have people thinking and feeling exactly the same .
I think it is people have got their own ideas , they want to express them .
I might have a view about it , but some people might have a different view about it .
"" I thought it was rather vulgar , "" Zuma said .
"" Particularly if you portray a particular person ( that way ) , but of course I think the population did express itself at that time , which will tell you it is not everybody who approved of it .
I think in fact the majority did not approve of it â€
¦
Some white people , for example , thought that was not helpful to deal with the race issue in the country . ""
The ANC , Africa 's oldest liberation movement , has much to be proud of but , after 18 years in government , has by its own admission committed "" sins of incumbency "" .
It goes to conference wracked by infighting that Zuma insists is the lifeblood of internal democracy .
The party will win the 2014 general election comfortably enough , but its hegemony is eroding , raising the spectre of a traumatic defeat in 2019 or 2024 .
Would it accept the will of the voters , unlike other liberation movements such as Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF ? ""
Of course , yes , "" said Zuma , who once declared the ANC would rule until Jesus came back .
""
No doubt , ANC will accept it early in the morning .
We 'll accept it .
That 's it . """
2012-12-13,"On Tuesday afternoon , as Nelson Mandela lay in hospital fighting to recover from a lung infection , the ANC he once led was feverishly fighting off accusations by the country 's top clerics that its leaders had "" lost their moral compass "" .
"" We know that even though the dream of a just , non - racial and prospering democracy is temporarily in eclipse
â€ “ being throttled by the actions ( or lack of it ) of a generation of leaders that seems to have largely lost its moral compass â€ “
the people of South Africa are capable of rising to reclaim their future , "" the clerics warned in their letter to the ANC president , Jacob Zuma .
The clerics ' denunciation of the party came two days after 33 prominent business figures called for action to arrest a decline in confidence in South Africa 's future , warning the country could "" unravel "" if challenges in education , corruption and unemployment were left unresolved .
In response , the ANC secretary - general , Gwede Mantashe , said the critics were "" mischievous "" and the party should be allowed to run its own affairs .
His reaction shocked very few : the ANC is routinely dismissive of civil society voices and is increasingly distant from the concerns of its poor , mass base .
As the 4,500 delegates descend on Mangaung on Sunday to elect new leaders and chart a new path forward after 18 years in power , the ANC is more divided than ever before .
The party was founded by young black professionals on this same spot , 100 years ago .
The house that the ANC 's leaders built over the ensuing century , which was kept together through exile and prison by Mandela and his generation of leaders , is in crisis .
In provincial conferences to nominate new leaders , three of the nine meetings had to be abandoned owing to squabbling and violence ; a provincial leader was shot at ; internal voting was allegedly rigged in the Eastern Cape to favour Zuma .
Restless poor
After a splinter group walked away from the ANC following Zuma 's election in 2007 and his removal of the ex - president Thabo Mbeki , many are now openly speaking about the possibility of another rupture .
There are two issues the ANC must face .
The first is leadership .
Zuma is most likely to stay in power as he commands support from his home base , KwaZulu Natal , and at least five other important provinces .
But the president , a master at manipulating internal ANC processes , faces myriad scandals that have divided the party .
Last week it was revealed he had used a network of benefactors â€ “ including tapping Mandela for a 3 m rand ( Â£214,000 ) gift â€ “ who shelled out millions of rand to sustain him and his 21-child family .
The country 's public protector is investigating allegations that he built himself a R240 m renovated mansion in his home village using taxpayers ' money .
Many staunch supporters , such as the leading Aids activist Zackie Achmat , have declared that they would not vote for the party in the 2014 election if Zuma is returned as ANC president .
Corruption in the ranks remains endemic â€ “ in the Northern Cape province the party 's top five leaders are in the dock for fraud and corruption .
They continue to shamelessly serve in government .
The second challenge is policy .
In 18 years in power , South Africa remains glaringly divided .
The ANC , in the face of a deteriorating economy and pressure from the poor , is flirting with policies such as the nationalisation of mines and expropriation of land , spooking domestic business and international investors who fear a Zimbabwe scenario .
The leadership battle has so far overshadowed policy issues .
As the Marikana mine massacre and the rise in service delivery protests this year clearly showed , the poor are restless .
The party will need to introduce some serious reforms to convince them something is indeed being done .
Unfortunately this is unlikely to happen .
Party leaders frequently bemoan the quality of ANC members , accusing them of lacking "" political education "" and therefore being obsessed with the largesse that comes with party membership .
As can be gleaned from the widespread support for the scandal - soaked Zuma and a general lack of interest in policy , except for the populist type , not much by way of rejuvenation will take place at this conference .
Zuma will be returned to power , the ANC will ignore civil society voices and its grip on power will continue to loosen .
Mandela is old and frail and may well pass soon .
The ANC he leaves behind will continue to be a shadow of its former self as it is consumed by corruption , arrogance , greed and a growing distance from its core source of power and legitimacy â€ “ the poor ."
2012-12-13,"Kgalema Motlanthe , the deputy president of South Africa , has ended months of speculation by confirming he will run against Jacob Zuma for the top job next week .
The leadership contest is likely to dominate and divide the most important meeting of the African National Congress ( ANC ) for five years .
Some 4,500 delegates will descend on Mangaung , a municipality containing the city of Bloemfontein , where Africa 's oldest liberation movement was born a century ago .
Motlanthe 's announcement on Thursday was greeted with "" great excitement and jubilation "" by the ANC 's youth wing , but the general consensus is that he has left it too late .
The enigmatic number two remained tight - lipped about his intentions until three days before the conference , frustrating a so - called "" anyone
but Zuma "" campaign , which saw the president as vulnerable in a year of turmoil .
The ANC is still a party of "" comrades "" and "" cadres "" , where individuals claim to defer to the collective .
Such is the peculiar shadow war within it that only last week Motlanthe delivered an ANC centenary lecture lavishing praise on his rival for the presidency .
It is all about as far removed as can be imagined from the chest - beating and insult trading of a US primary campaign .
At a recent press conference with foreign correspondents , Motlanthe , 63 , took meek humility to new extremes , protesting : "" I have a political attitude
but I 'm not a politician . ""
Asked by the Guardian to define what sets him apart from Zuma , the reluctant candidate replied : "" We agree on broad policy of the ANC , we participate , we work together in all of those issues , we debate where our take on any situation is different and agree on what the next step ought to be .
But it 's not ideological differences , as it were . ""
As Motlanthe continued to procrastinate , South Africa 's media already declared the election for Zuma based on votes taken by a show of hands in ANC branches around the country .
These showed overwhelming support for the president in his home province , KwaZulu - Natal , which has by far the most conference delegates , as well as Mpumalanga , North West , Free State , Eastern Cape and Northern Cape .
The final tally gave Zuma 2,521 branch nominations and Motlanthe 863 , results likely to be more or less reflected on the conference floor .
With all the usual advantages of incumbency , Zuma benefited from a disciplined re - election campaign orchestrated by loyal supporters in influential positions .
Some party diehards may have felt that , whatever Zuma 's weaknesses , continuity is preferable to a bitterly divisive regicide such as that against Thabo Mbeki at the last such conference at Polokwane in 2007 .
But there have also been widespread allegations of vote - rigging , the use of "" ghost "" delegates to boost Zuma 's numbers and eruptions of political violence ; in one instance , an armed gang reportedly burst into a branch meeting and threatened to shoot members who did not vote for Zuma .
With Zuma all but certain to lead the ANC into the 2014 general election , the biggest suspense at Mangaung is around the question of who will be elected his deputy – and heir apparent .
The struggle veteran turned tycoon Cyril Ramaphosa is way out in front after the provincial nominations while the incumbent Motlanthe is trailing last , party because of tactical voting by Zuma supporters .
The rest of the 53rd national conference , due to start on Sunday under the shadow of Nelson Mandela 's ongoing hospital stay , is expected to discuss how to implement a national development plan produced by a government - appointed brains trust .
Other likely issues include job creation , land reform , organisational renewal and state intervention in the mining sector following violent unrest including the shooting of workers at Marikana . ""
The ANC will emerge from Mangaung more united if it musters the moral courage for the serious introspection required to reclaim the moral high ground , "" wrote Pallo Jordan , a party stalwart and former arts and culture minister , in the Business Day newspaper .
Zwelinzima Vavi , general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions , said on Thursday the unity of the ANC was "" sacrosanct "" and delegates should not devote their main energy to a leadership contest .
"" We all agree that the national conference at Mangaung can not be ' business as usual ' .
Our broad movement and the country is demanding a clear message of change . """
2012-12-16,"As Nelson Mandela lay in hospital for a second week , the movement he led in the struggle to liberate South Africa gathered in an attempt to bury bitter divisions and rekindle his vision .
President Jacob Zuma opened the 53rd conference of the governing African National Congress ( ANC ) to a vociferous reception as many delegates sang , stomped and raised two fingers above their heads to signal his second term , implying his position in this week 's leadership contest is secure .
In a sweltering marquee of white and the ANC colours of black , green and gold , Zuma led thousands of supporters in a Zulu rendition of a struggle song : "" The road we are on is long , Mandela told his followers , we will meet on freedom day . ""
The president then delivered some unusually stark warnings to a 100-year - old party that many feel is losing its moral compass .
He suggested this year 's Marikana mine tragedy , in which 46 people died during a wildcat strike , showed the risk of losing touch with the party 's grassroots .
"" We need to avoid the danger of distance between leaders and members , both at the workplace and in the communities , "" Zuma said .
"" It is important for the ANC to maintain ongoing contact with the masses at all times .
We should explain to people when services are coming to them , and if there is going to be a delay , they also need to be told .
"" We should engage our people more , even on the question of unacceptable violence that accompanies some of the strikes and protests , which we condemn in the strongest terms . ""
The ANC has endured infighting and even assassinations as members scrap for rewards , threatening its future .
Zuma chided : "" Other alien tendencies to be eliminated from the movement as part of renewal [ include ] the negative lobbying for positions , which includes smear campaigns in the media as well as gossip and rumour - mongering about one another . ""
Also cCommon are the disrespectful public spats as well as hurling insults at other comrades or members of the public , thereby bringing the ANC into disrepute .
More seriously , we have experienced the shocking occurrences where armed comrades disrupt ANC meetings . ""
This then raises the question what exactly could be so much at stake , that people would go so far to get their own way in the organisation .
"" Zuma , himself no stranger to corruption allegations , called for it to be purged from the party . ""
Comrades , we must also frown upon other alien practices such as the use of money to buy the support of ANC members .
We should not allow a situation where those who have money turn members of the ANC into commodities . ""
Speaking for more than 90 minutes against a backdrop with the slogan "" Unity in action towards socio - economic freedom "" , Zuma insisted the ANC has a plan for economic growth and job creation : "" We want to dismiss the perceptions that the country is falling apart , "" he said .
The leadership elections will take place during the five - day conference in the city of Bloemfontein , in the municipality of Manguang , Free State province .
It was reported on Sunday that Cyril Ramaphosa , a former mineworkers ' leader and now one of South Africa 's richest men , has agreed to run for deputy president .
Mandela , 94 , remains in hospital in Pretoria after suffering from a lung infection and undergoing gallstone surgery ."

2012-12-18,"Amid apartheid - era songs and hoots from vuvuzelas , South African President Jacob Zuma has swept to victory in his party 's leadership contest , effectively securing the continent 's most powerful office until 2019 .
Zuma trounced his only challenger , deputy president Kgalema Motlanthe , who ran a largely muted and reluctant campaign , by 2,983 votes to 991 at the African National Congress ( ANC ) conference .
A beaming Zuma came to the stage immediately after the announcement ( video ) , waving to the cheering crowd with both hands .

â€ “ signalling that he should be substituted like a footballer â€ “ against them , mimicking the gesture then throwing their arms apart and hollering in unison .
Later , the president broke from the conference programme to "" address one of the fundamental principles of the ANC : the unity of the African National Congress "" .
He said : "" The conference has spoken and all of us are part of that decision . ""
His three - quarter majority defied political gravity in a year that witnessed police massacre 34 striking mineworkers amid spreading unrest , chaos in the education sector , and a scandal over expensive security upgrades to his own home .

2012-12-18,"When the announcement came today that President Jacob Zuma had obliterated his opponent here in Mangaung at the ANC 's national conference to retain his leadership of the party for another five years by a 75 % majority , the sweaty , packed conference marquee erupted in jubilation .
Zuma had not just managed to see off deputy president Kgalema Motlanthe and his noisy supporters , but his grip on the party had been tightened considerably too .
He was master and commander , and his increased support â€ “ up from 60 % in his first term
â€ “ had handed him the ability to proceed with major changes if he so wished .
Yet , after the formalities were done , Zuma asked the sleep - deprived delegates ( voting had proceeded through the night ) if he could eat into their lunchtime and say a few words .
His message was not triumphalist , but one that went to the heart of the challenges he now faces after a noisy , bruising and divisive battle .
Zuma told the 4,500 delegates that unity was paramount in the party and said their conduct after winning â€ “ or losing â€ “ should not lead to demonisation of others .
He had no other message for them , just a reiteration of unity and asking them to respect democratic processes .
He did so because he knew he may have won this battle , but the war is still raging .
In regional party conferences preceding the big meeting on Sunday , violence flared and allegations of vote - rigging abounded .
Delegates had to use three different colour - coded ballot papers because a court challenge hung ominously over the proceedings , meaning that some of those who voted may have to be disbarred .
Corruption within the party is now considered endemic , with allegations of "" vote buying "" inside the party being confirmed by Zuma himself in his political report , while many ANC senior leaders are accused of being on the take .
Those who stood against Zuma believe the blame must be put squarely at the president 's door .
His victory also raises another spectre : what happens now ?
After Zuma ousted Thabo Mbeki in 2007 as party president he then kicked him from the state presidency nine months later .
A splinter party , Cope , was formed on the back of this and gained 7 % of the vote in the 2009 general election .
Now many in Zuma 's camp are calling for Motlanthe 's head , accusing him of dividing the party .
The most likely scenario is a cabinet reshuffle in which Motlanthe and several others will be axed .
Zuma may not wish to do so â€ “ he is keenly aware of the reputational risk of such a move â€ “
but those around him are already baying for blood .
Zuma 's next hurdle is the 2014 general election .
Many contend that Zuma , who is wracked by numerous personal scandals , is an electoral liability for the party of an ailing Nelson Mandela .
The ANC has lost support in the past two elections in every province except Zuma 's native KwaZulu Natal , and many fear that his personal problems damage the party 's electoral base .
Just the day before Zuma 's party victory a survey found that his national approval level is 52 % , while the defeated Motlanthe 's is at 70 % .
Speculation is that Cyril Ramaphosa , the ANC 's newly elected deputy leader , will slowly be pushed to become the face of the party and that his position as deputy president will take on elements of a prime minister , thus relegating Zuma to a ceremonial leadership role similar to the one played by Nelson Mandela in the 1990s .
But this is unlikely to happen .
Zuma 's victory can be ascribed largely to the fact that he is a man who is trying to do everything in his power to ensure that charges of corruption â€ “ controversially dropped against him under dodgy circumstances just weeks before he became president in 2009
â€ “ are not reinstated against him .
For this to happen he has to keep his hand on the steering wheel , and is unlikely to cede power to a deputy .
So the ANC that emerges from the conference on Thursday will still be a party dominated by a man who is soaked in allegations of corruption and personal scandal .
He may have won the party leadership battle decisively , but Zuma 's presence in the ANC continues to be the achilles heel of a party that looks set to shed even more support in the next election ."
2012-12-25,"Nelson Mandela is in good spirits and is looking much better ' said President Jacob Zuma after paying a Christmas morning visit to the 94-year - old former South African president in a Pretoria hospital .
Mandela was admitted for care on 8 December and has been treated for a lung infection and gallstones at an undisclosed hospital .
It is the longest time he has spent in hospital since his release in 1990 , after 27 years in prison .
Zuma said he had visited ' Madiba '' â€ “ the clan name by which Mandela is known to South Africans â€ “ alongside the former president 's wife , GraÃ§a Machel and members of the Mandela family .
"" We found him in good spirits .
He shouted my clan name , Nxamalala , as I walked into the ward .
He was happy to have visitors on this special day and is looking much better .
The doctors are happy with the progress that he is making . ''
Prayers were said for the elder statesman at midnight masses and Christmas Day services across South Africa .
The African National Congress and the Zulus ' King Goodwill Zwelithini had earlier sent their good wishes and calls for prayers .
Presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj told the Guardian that Mandela had "" quite boisterously '' called out Zuma 's clan name . ' '
Very few people use that name .
When you use a clan name , you do n't just say it , you actually shout it . ''
Maharaj did not disclose details of Mandela 's condition but said he was being treated by a top team of specialists . ' '
I think it is quite legitimate with a 94-year - old to be cautious .
You want to be absolutely sure that progress has reached such a stage that everyone is confident [ before discharging them ] .
An infection in the lung can have a side effect in the toe , then go back to the chest .
You can not be too careful . ''
He said he would not disclose the hospital at which Mandela is being treated . ""
Let us not crowd him .
I want to shield him
and I really want to shield the family , '' said Maharaj , 77 , who visited Mandela last week and is a close friend .
From 1964 until 1976 , Maharaj served hard labour alongside Mandela at Robben Island prison , off Cape Town , where both men worked in a limestone quarry .
Mandela contracted tuberculosis during that time .
Mandela , who was president of South Africa from 1994 â€ “ 1999 , retired from public life in 2004 .
He was last seen in public in July 2010 , during the closing ceremony of the World Cup , when he was driven through Johannesburg 's Soccer City stadium on an electric golf cart .
He has been admitted to hospital in Johannesburg and Pretoria three times in the past two years , including for an acute respiratory infection in January 2011 .
In May this year , the presidency announced that he had moved permanently to Qunu , a rural village in the Eastern Cape , where he spent much of his childhood .
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , visited him there in August .
On 5 December , shortly before Mandela 's latest admission to hospital , a South African air force Dakota plane crashed en route from Pretoria to Mthatha â€ ” close to Qunu .
Reports said up to 11 people died in the crash in poor visibility in Giant 's Castle , in the Drakensberg mountains .
The route is used every week by members of Mandela 's security and medical team , prompting speculation â€ “ denied by the air force â€ “ that the flight was carrying medical personnel , medicines or equipment for the elder statesman ."
2013-01-07,"As Zimbabwe gears up for elections later this year , Robert Mugabe 's opponents are welcoming the re - election of South African president Jacob Zuma as leader of the ANC .
Unlike his predecessor Thabo Mbeki , Zuma is seen by the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) parties , pro - democracy civil society groups and private media as less sympathetic to the Zimbabwean president . ""
Mugabe stuck with Zuma "" , ran one banner headline after the ANC conference in Mangaung .
Mbeki 's negotiation of the 2008 power - sharing agreement that left Mugabe 's powers largely intact and Morgan Tsvangirai in a poorly defined and weaker prime ministerial post was considered a betrayal of the democracy cause in Zimbabwe by critics of the former South African president .
For his part , Mugabe once described Cyril Ramaphosa , the new deputy president of the ANC , as "" a white man in a black man 's skin "" .
His return to top - level politics is therefore regarded by the opposition as a bonus .
Zuma 's victory allows him to remain South Africa president until the 2014 elections when he will seek a second and final term , which is all but guaranteed given his party 's electoral dominance .
Crucially , this means he retains his role as the southern African regional facilitator of political reforms in Zimbabwe .
The reforms are part of a power - sharing agreement the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) brokered in 2008 to resolve the crisis that followed the controversial presidential election earlier in the year .
Zuma recently denied having any differences with Mugabe , claiming that they "" were freedom fighters together "" .
But some members of Mugabe 's party , the Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front ( Zanu - PF ) , would have welcomed a Zuma defeat in Mangaung .
According to an insider , "" Mbeki is a hero for protecting us from western regime change .
Zuma did not oppose western regime change against ( Muammar ) Gaddafi ( in Libya ) , so we know he is capable of giving us up to the west "" .
Moreover , Zuma is accused by some in Zanu - PF of supporting the reformation of the party 's oldest rival , the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union ( Zapu ) , under the leadership of Dumiso Dabengwa .
Zapu , a close ally of the ANC during southern Africa 's liberation struggle years , will challenge Zanu - PF in the upcoming elections .
Conversely the Zuma camp alleges that Zanu - PF secretly aided former ANC Youth League leader Julius Malema 's various bids to undermine Zuma 's presidency and his campaigns for nationalisation of mines and takeover of white - owned commercial land in South Africa .
These suspicions and allegations underline the testy nature of the Zuma - Mugabe relationship , despite the recent public denials by Zuma and Zanu - PF 's national chairman , Simon Khaya Moyo .
Mugabe 's enemies are hoping for external help to ensure an effective transfer of power in the election .
The MDC trade minister , Priscilla Misihairabwi - Mushonga , went as far as to claim that SADC member states would intervene in Zimbabwe if the vote was not free and fair .
"" I have no doubt that if things went to the worst in Zimbabwe there would be a military intervention ...
The mood I see in SADC summits is that they will not allow a situation where Zimbabwe will go through an election that is not free and fair again .
And they will be right in order to do that intervention , which is why some of us believe that there is still hope "" , Misihairabwi - Mushonga said .
But , realistically , the likelihood of a SADC - led military invasion in Zimbabwe is low .
Even if there was the political will , member states do not have the necessary military or financial capacity .
Zuma has insisted on the implementation of political reforms before new elections , with the adoption of a new constitution being a benchmark â€ “ much to the chagrin of Zanu - PF .
However , elections are constitutionally due in June and Zuma is unable to speed up the pace of reform .
Zanu - PF is counting down the clock , as an election under the old rules would suit Mugabe 's party .
The fear among the pro - democracy camp is that reforms guaranteeing an even campaign field will not have been completed by June .

2013-02-16,"The scene was set for pomp and pageantry , though , to be fair , it was not everyone 's idea of riveting television .
The opening of parliament in Cape Town , which always falls close to the anniversary of Nelson Mandela 's release , is South Africa 's day to stand on ceremony and hear the president 's state of the nation address .
Whatever president Jacob Zuma promised this year , few are likely to remember .
The event had been utterly eclipsed by a drama unfolding almost 1,000 miles away in Pretoria .
On Thursday morning South Africans learned that Oscar Pistorius , one of their greatest sporting exports , had allegedly shot dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp , a model and reality TV contestant .
In a country where front pages are usually dominated by strikes , corruption and power struggles , and debates about inequality and race , this was something different – and something photogenic .
The glamorous celebrity couple were dubbed "" South Africa 's answer to Posh and Becks "" , albeit somewhat prematurely after only a few months of dating .
Suddenly , veteran correspondents of Africa 's wars found themselves trying to "" doorstep "" neighbours , chase police cars and track down former girlfriends .
Pistorius – known as the Blade Runner because of his hi - tech artificial legs – denies murder , but in America the case is already being compared to that of OJ Simpson , setting the stage for one of the most sensational trials in South African history .
This sudden , unexpected tragedy has been traumatising to an already fragile national psyche .
It has provoked debate about the country 's deep - rooted culture of violence , especially against women , and raised questions over whether Pistorius , white and wealthy , will be treated more favourably than the 160,000 inmates who endure incarceration in Africa 's most overcrowded prison system .
Craig Freimond , a film director and writer , was about to give a reading to school pupils last Thursday when he heard the news : "" A woman came in and said Oscar Pistorius has been arrested for shooting his girlfriend .
I was just , like , '
No , no , that 's impossible ' .
One of our greatest heroes shoots his girlfriend ?
It 's seismic .
I find it very upsetting .
It 's definitely triggering some kind of deep emotional response in South Africans . ""
Like many compatriots , Freimond had accepted the Olympian and Paralympian 's status as a role model without question .
"" We have very few of them in this country .
Maybe because of our dividedness , we do n't have that many heroes who cut across all groups .
This guy cut across everything .
He was the superhuman soul . ""
Initial reports suggested that the killing was a "" horrible accident "" in which Pistorius mistook his girlfriend for an intruder – a believable enough scenario in a nation which , according to police figures , saw 16,766 robberies at residential premises last year .
On radio and in social media , South Africans expressed support and pity for the 26-year - old athlete .
But as Thursday wore on , police dismissed the theory , insisting it had not come from them , and said that four shots had been fired after neighbours heard shouting .
Public sympathy for the runner began to wane , especially when the media began to piece together Pistorius 's "" dark side "" : an investigation into reckless driving following a boat crash , a night in police custody after an alleged assault ( a charge later dropped ) , a reported threat to break a man 's legs in a dispute over a woman .
Then there was his interest , perhaps obsession , with guns .
An interview in the New York Times magazine found Pistorius talking about how he drew a pistol to search his home when his alarm went off .
By Friday there was a sense of disillusionment for many as Pistorius appeared in court to face a charge of premeditated murder . ""
The dude was at the height of his powers , "" said Freimond .
"" It 's inconceivable that a hero to so many millions of people would do such a thing . ""
The tragedy has led to calls for a debate about gun control and gun culture like that which is convulsing another country with a tortured racial history : America .
Last weekend Trent Barcroft , chief executive of Chrysler South Africa , was in intensive care after being shot during a robbery outside Johannesburg .
In 2010 , Swedish bride Anni Dewani was shot dead while on honeymoon in Cape Town ; her British husband , Shrien , is still fighting extradition .
The great majority of cases never make headlines .
Up to six million South African civilians own guns – around 12 % of the population – according to estimates .
Airports and casinos have prominent signs directing people to storage rooms to deposit their weapons .
Many keep them for self - defence , citing the country 's spectacular crime rate , but triggering an inevitable arms race with criminals .
Gated communities such as the one where Pistorius lives , with high walls and electrified fences , provide security but arguably inflame the divide between the haves and the have - nots .
"" There 's no question that there 's a gun culture , "" said David Bruce , a criminal justice researcher .
In the late 1990s and early 2000s there was an effective campaign , he added , meaning that South Africa now has strong laws on gun ownership .
The Firearms Control Act of 2004 limits individuals to one gun for self - defence , and guns have since been overtaken by "" sharp instruments "" as the principal cause of murders .
Many are still illegally owned , however . ""
The South African trope about ' you 've got the laws and policies , what about implementing them ? ' would appear to apply in this case , "" said Bruce .
The national murder rate has been declining for years , though an average of 43 lives are still taken every day .
Steenkamp 's death came on the same day as public events decrying gender violence and just weeks after the gang rape and murder of a teenager prompted comparisons with a similar incident in India .
On Friday one TV news presenter asked bluntly : "" Why are South African men so violent ? ""
Belying stereotypes , both Pistorius and his girlfriend were white and well - off .
Eusebius McKaiser , an associate at the Wits Centre for Ethics in Johannesburg , said : "" It shatters the idea that perpetrators and victims look a certain way .
It shatters the belief that domestic violence is solely a product of poverty . ""
From the treatment of pets to voting in TV talent shows , race still worms its way into almost every South African issue .
The immediate aftermath of the shooting brought online comments from white people blaming the failure of the black government to tackle crime for making the likes of Pistorius feel they need guns to defend themselves .
One news site had to suspend its comments section as racist opinions poured in .
Pistorius has , perhaps glibly , been described as a hero to all South Africans when in fact sport often divides along racial lines .
White people make up only 9 % of the population , and his appeal in black townships and villages has rarely been tested .
On the day after the killing , the editorial of the Sowetan newspaper was devoted to the fall of a sporting "" legend "" – not Pistorius but Phil Setshedi , a football coach jailed for match fixing .
McKaiser added : "" For many black South Africans , any embarrassment they have about this story going global is mitigated by the fact that ' he 's not one of us ' .
This is the way race plays out in South Africa . ""
In court on Friday , as Pistorius repeatedly broke down and sobbed , chief magistrate Desmond Nair said he was anxious to avoid any perception that the Olympian would receive "" preferential treatment "" .
Yet the magistrate acceded to a request for Pistorius to spend the weekend at a police station rather than the grimmer surroundings of prison , as would be the normal convention .
One advocate taking part in the case admitted the decision was based on Pistorius 's fame rather than special needs due to his disability .
"" There are plenty of disabled people in jail , "" he said drily .
The fallen champion is due back in court on Tuesday to apply for bail , which police have said they will oppose .
Given the vagaries of South Africa 's delay - prone courts , it could be many months before he stands trial .
The magistrate has already ruled that TV cameras will not be allowed .
The first exchanges at Friday 's court hearing pitted advocate Gerrie Nel – best known for the successful prosecution of a national police commissioner for corruption – against advocate Barry Roux for the defence .
The rapid arrival of Stuart Higgins , former editor of the Sun , to strengthen Pistorius 's PR operation suggested that the media circus is coming to town .
But whatever the wider implications , for many this remains a compelling story about one extraordinary man and his unfathomable fall from grace .
Six months ago Oscar Pistorius was on the track , performing to cheering crowds , one of the jewels in London 's Olympic and Paralympic crown ; today he is languishing behind bars , contemplating a possible life sentence .
South Africa might do well to heed Bertolt Brecht 's old line : "" Unhappy the land that is in need of heroes . """
2013-06-08,"The office of South Africa 's president has announced former leader Nelson Mandela has been taken to hospital because of a lung infection .
A statement from President Jacob Zuma 's office said Mandela had a recurrence of the illness in the last few days and was transferred to a Pretoria hospital after his condition deteriorated at about 1.30am on Saturday .
The statement said Mandela , who is 94 years old , was in a serious but stable condition and receiving expert medical care .
The anti - apartheid leader became president in South Africa 's all - race elections in 1994 .
His health has been failing in recent years .
A South African government spokesman , Mac Maharaj , told BBC television that family accompanied Mandela to hospital and remained with him there . ""
Former President Mandela has had this condition for many years .
It first manifested itself when he was in prison .
As he 's grown older we have to take into account his frailty , therefore doctors act on the matter with great caution and hospitalise him whenever they think it necessary . ""
Zuma 's statement said he wished Mandela a quick recovery on behalf of the government and the nation and requested that the media and the public respect the privacy of the former leader and his family .
Mandela 's forgiving spirit and belief in racial reconciliation helped hold South Africa together at a time of extreme tension in the run up to the 1994 elections .
The Nobel peace prize laureate , who was imprisoned for 27 years by the white regime , became the first democratically elected president of South Africa in that year ."
2013-06-11,"Security has been stepped up at the South African hospital where Nelson Mandela is receiving intensive care for a fourth day .
Six uniformed police officers guarding the Mediclinic heart hospital in Pretoria on Tuesday morning have been stopping and searching every vehicle entering the main gate .
The increase in security came as South Africa 's president , Jacob Zuma , described Mandela 's condition as "" very serious "" .
In an interview shown on the public broadcaster SABC , Zuma said he had been briefed thoroughly by doctors .
"" I was very confident that they know what they 're doing
and they 're doing a very good job , "" said Zuma .
"" Whilst it 's very serious , he 's stabilised and we are all praying for him really to recuperate quickly . ""
Zuma 's spokesman Mac Maharaj told SABC : "" He 's not in an intensive care unit .
He 's receiving intensive care treatment .
That is to ensure that no visitor coming to see him brings an infection from outside that he may be susceptible to . ""
Mandela 's ex - wife Winnie Madikizela - Mandela and his three surviving children visited him in hospital on Tuesday .
Children gathered outside his home in Houghton , Johannesburg , and sang best wishes for his health .
Some of the 94-year - old 's oldest comrades have called for him to be granted peace .
Denis Goldberg , who like Mandela was sentenced to life imprisonment at the 1960s Rivonia trial , said : "" I think it 's time for us to accept that each of us plays our role and then moves on .
It 's the natural order of things .
This desperate effort to hold on is to say we ca n't do it without Nelson Mandela .
I 'm saying we have new leaders , and new leaders must step up to the plate and they have got to hit the home runs .
That 's what we need at every single level , not just the highest level . ""
The 80-year - old added : "" Let him go , let him go , with our love , with our admiration and our wish to emulate him . ""
But many continue to pray that he can beat the odds again .
William Gumede , a political academic , told eNews Channel Africa : "" It 's going to be very difficult for people to accept that it 's time to let go , and Mandela is coming close to a glorious innings .
We must now celebrate his life . ""
This week the foundation led by Desmond Tutu described Mandela as an extraordinary gift . ""
As the beloved father of our nation uTata Nelson Mandela once again endures the ravages of time in hospital , "" it said .
"" Our prayers are for his comfort and his dignity .
We send our blessings to the doctors and nurses responsible for his care . ""
But some have detected a subtle shift in the national mood and an acceptance that this is one battle the anti - apartheid hero may not be able to win.""Qunu prepares for the worst "" was the front - page headline of the Sowetan newspaper , referring to Mandela 's home village .
It said some residents were preparing to turn their homes into bed and breakfasts for visitors in the event of his death .
This is Mandela 's fourth spell in hospital since December .
His wife , Graca Machel , is at his bedside ."
2013-06-12,"Nelson Mandela is "" responding better "" to treatment , leaving officials "" very happy "" with the progress in his condition , the South African president , Jacob Zuma , has said .
The 94-year - old former president is spending a fifth day in hospital in Pretoria after suffering a recurrence of a lung infection .
While the mood has been particularly sombre during this latest stay in hospital , Zuma hinted on Wednesday that there were grounds for optimism .
"" I 'm happy to report that Madiba is responding better to treatment from this morning , "" he told parliament in Cape Town .
"" We are very happy with the progress that he is now making , following a difficult last few days .
"" We appreciate the messages of support from all over the world .
It is an honour for us as South Africans to share Madiba with the international community . ""
A big media contingent is gathered outside the Mediclinic heart hospital in Pretoria .
Zuma added : "" We fully understand and appreciate the global interest in this world icon .
We are so proud to call him our own .
"" We urge South Africans and the international community to continue to keep President Mandela and the medical team in their thoughts and prayers . ""
Wednesday marks the 49th anniversary of the struggle hero Mandela being sentenced to life imprisonment by the apartheid regime , Zuma noted .
The progress report will be cautiously welcomed by millions of South Africans .
Annika Larsen , a reporter on eNews Channel Africa , said : "" I think I 've just heard South Africa breathe a huge sigh of relief â€
¦
That 's probably the best news we 've heard on Nelson Mandela in the last five days . ""
Local media reported that Mandela 's wife , GraÃ§a Machel , and grandchildren Ndaba , Zenani and Mandla were seen visiting hospital on Wednesday .
Zenani Mandela - Dlamini , South Africa 's ambassador to Argentina , has also returned home to visit her father .
Security at the hospital remains tight .
South Africa 's Times newspaper said its team went to the hospital coffee shop and observed plainclothes policemen questioning several visitors about their business there .
The paper quoted a doctor as saying that even the movement of medical staff was restricted : "" It 's crazy .
From yesterday no one can come in or out without being stopped and searched .
There are certain floors to which access , even for medical staff , has been limited . ""
Stairwells are under guard and lifts are being monitored , the paper added .
Mandela spent 27 years in prison , the bulk of them on Robben Island , before his release in 1990 .
He was elected South Africa 's first black president four years later and served a single term .
His last major public appearance was at the football World Cup final in 2010 .
Ahmed Kathrada , a fellow former Robben Island inmate , was quoted by the New Age newspaper as saying : "" I think we should allow him to rest with his family close by .
I do wish and pray that he will recover so that we can benefit from his presence . """
2013-06-24,
2013-06-27,"Nelson Mandela 's condition has improved and he "" remains critical but is now stable "" , South African officials said on Thursday .
President Jacob Zuma visited Mandela in hospital in Pretoria after abandoning a planned trip to a summit in Mozambique .
Mandela 's medical team advised him of a slight improvement in the former president 's health .
"" I cancelled my visit to Mozambique today so that I can see him and confer with the doctors , "" Zuma said .
"" He is much better today than he was when I saw him last night .
The medical team continues to do a sterling job .
We must pray for Tata 's health and wish him well .
We must also continue with our work and daily activities while Madiba remains hospitalised . ""
The presidency added that it was disturbed by rumours being spread about Mandela 's health and appealed for his privacy to be respected .
Mandela 's eldest daughter has given a rare insight into his condition and accused foreign journalists of behaving like vultures .
Makaziwe Mandela said Zuma 's decision to scrap his travel plans showed that "" anything is imminent .
I can also state that God only knows when it is the time to go . ""
In an interview with the public broadcaster SABC she said Mandela was still opening his eyes and still reactive to touch .
"" We will live with hope until the final end comes .
I do n't want to lie .
He does n't look good .
But he 's still opening his eyes .
He might be waning off but he 's still there .
I think for us as his children and grandchildren , as long as he 's still there we want to give him the positive support , the positive energy . ""
Makaziwe vented family frustration at the intense media scrutiny that has followed their every move .
"" There is sort of a racist element with the foreign media , where they just cross boundaries , "" she said .
"" You have no idea what is happening at the hospital .
In the middle of Park Street they just stand .
You ca n't even get into the hospital .
Truly , like vultures , it is like they are waiting for the last carcasses .
That is what we feel as a family . ""
It was understandable that journalists were interested in Mandela 's health , she added , "" but they are going overboard "" .
She contrasted the situation with the death of Margaret Thatcher earlier this year .
"" Is it just because we 're an African country that they feel they do n't have to respect this ?
I just think it 's crass .
If people think they really care about Nelson Mandela they should respect that .
Part of him should be respected , not everything of him should be out in the public . ""
Zuma visited Mandela at about 10 pm on Wednesday and found he remained in a critical condition .
Doctors "" are still doing everything they can to ensure his wellbeing "" , the presidency said .
Officials did not deny claims that he was on a life - support machine . ""
Yes he is using machines to breathe , ""
Napilisi Mandela was quoted as saying in media reports after visiting the hospital on Wednesday .
"" It is bad but what can we do ? ""
Mandela 's grandchildren gathered up cards , flowers and stuffed animals outside the hospital on Thursday and took them inside .
They gave thanks for the public 's support .
Members of a South African Salvation Army choir prayed and sang outside the hospital and the African National Congress ( ANC ) youth league spoke about Mandela 's achievements .
Hundreds of people from South Africa , around the continent and the world gathered at the site along with numerous international TV crews .
Mandela has already spent 20 days in the hospital with a recurring lung infection , his fourth admission in six months .
Many South Africans appear to be slowly coming to terms with the prospect of losing the father of the nation .
The US president , Barack Obama , is due to arrive in South Africa on Friday as part of a three - nation Africa tour he has already started in Senegal .
Officials said it was too early to say whether Obama 's schedule in Johannesburg and Cape Town on Saturday and Sunday might be affected by Mandela 's worsening condition .
Meanwhile an Australian politician apologised on Thursday to South Africa 's high commissioner for incorrectly announcing that Mandela had died .
The resources minister , Gary Gray , acknowledged he wrongly told guests attending a dinner at Parliament House on Wednesday that the anti - apartheid leader was dead .
"" I apologise unreservedly and am deeply sorry to have relayed what I thought was reliable advice , "" Gray said ."
2013-07-30,"Phumzile Mlambo - Ngcuka has just witnessed blatant sexism on her doorstep .
The Zimbabwe president , Robert Mugabe , castigated Lindiwe Zulu , a top South African diplomat , as an "" idiotic street woman "" and urged his South African counterpart , Jacob Zuma , "" to stop this woman of theirs from speaking on Zimbabwe "" .
Far from challenging Mugabe 's crude chauvinism , Zuma publicly distanced himself from Zulu and gagged her .
"" I thought it was really unfortunate because she 's there as a professional , "" Mlambo - Ngcuka says .
"" Her gender is neither here nor there . ""
And South Africa 's response ?
"" I think they should have nuanced it differently , "" she replies , diplomatically .
Formerly the deputy president of South Africa , Mlambo - Ngcuka takes the helm next month at UN Women , a three - year - old agency still striving for enough funds , recognition and a chance to make its mark .
The 57-year - old replaces Michelle Bachelet , who resigned in March to run for another term as president of Chile , at a time when some perceive a global backlash against women 's rights .
"" I do n't know if it 's a clear backlash , "" Mlambo - Ngcuka says , during an interview at the Umlambo Foundation , which she set up in 2008 to support schools in poor areas of South Africa .
"" I think we 're competing with many other issues .
Maybe there 's a little bit of fatigue . ""
At the same time , women 's issues have become more complex .
If you look at new violations against women , like cybercrime - related gender - based violations , if you look at human trafficking , that is very well organised and well - funded , and it 's a push - of - a - button money exchange .
There 's a sense in which we have to become smarter about how we fight these women 's issues and recruit new people .
For instance , the law enforcers in many of our countries might not have moved as fast to identify these new crimes and deal with them as effectively as possible .
So there 's a lot to learn , also for us as the women 's movements . ""
But Mlambo - Ngcuka is also likely to face older barriers of tradition , religion and culture , including from those who are quick to denounce feminism as a western ideology that is being imposed from outside .
She believes the days of such excuses from the powerful are numbered .
"" I do n't think there are many governments who have a leg to stand on as far as that is concerned , which does n't mean it does n't happen , but they do n't have the courage to stand up and say that , "" she says .
"" The fact that , in many countries , sexism can be criminalised means that it is very difficult to be a leader and public representative and be blatantly sexist . ""
In countries such as Afghanistan , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , India , Pakistan , Somalia and South Africa itself , however , there remains a yawning chasm between legal theory and the daily reality of women 's lives on the ground .
The new UN Women executive director says : "" Rape has become , for instance , one of the weapons in war situations that is used specifically against women , with impunity .
That tells you there are deep - rooted traditional attitudes towards women .
"" If we also look at the problem that is still with us , of child brides , which happens in full view of communities , you 've got parents of one family actually giving up a child to another family to take as a wife way before that child is ready to be an adult .
Those campaigns against child brides still remain a very important part of the struggle for women 's rights .
We do need to make the fight visible and we do need to look at how we support governments and NGOs , which are a crucial part of taking these battles forward .
You need to support them to have their voice heard , and louder . ""
You also need to engage with traditional institutions .
In many countries there are organised traditional authority institutions ; one needs to engage with them head on because not all members of those institutions are backwards in their thinking .
There 's still some people you could actually win over and they become the inside voice in those institutions to advocate for a more gender - responsible approach . ""
Mlambo - Ngcuka arrives at the UN as the millennium development goals ( MDGs ) near their culmination and debate begins in earnest on development agenda after 2015 when the MDGs expire .
UN Women says the MDGs have spurred significant progress , but yielded uneven results , including lack of progress on reducing maternal mortality .
About 800 women die every day due to childbirth and other pregnancy - related complications .
The agency has proposed a stand - alone gender equality goal in any future development targets , which would include indicators to monitor performance .
"" I do n't think post-2015 we can have an emphasis around women that is less strong than what we had in the MDGs as we have them now , "" Mlambo - Ngcuka says .
"" We have not arrived at where we want to go .
The MDGs continue to be concerned about poverty more than anything else .
If you do not put women at the centre of this fight against poverty , we just wo n't achieve what we want to achieve . ""
The former teacher , who led a gender - equality organisation during the racial apartheid era , also wants a strong emphasis on education .
"" Education for me is a cross - cutting priority .
It is the equaliser , not only for girl - children but for all the women who need second chances . ""
As deputy to president Thabo Mbeki , Mlambo - Ngcuka was the most senior female politician in South African history .
When Mbeki was ousted by his own party , the African National Congress , it spelled an abrupt departure for Mlambo - Ngcuka too .
She does not believe her gender was a factor .
Last year , another South African woman , Nkosazana Dlamini - Zuma , was elected chair of the African Union , but still only two of the continent 's 55 countries have female presidents : Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia and Joyce Banda of Malawi . ""
Still a long way to go
, "" Mlambo - Ngcuka says with a sigh .
"" It is a lonely club .
Thank God they are such strong women themselves
â€ “ it will take a lot of strong men to really put them down .
But I also know that the issues closest to their hearts have not been able to top the agenda . ""
New kid on the block UN Women is the new kid on the block , with everything still to prove .
Mlambo - Ngcuka contends that the agency should not be judged too harshly .
"" There has n't been enough time for all the things it has started to be proved decisively â€ ¦ you can never look at funding as the only thing on which you could implement and build your programmes .
"" Collaboration is essential because within the UN you 've got different institutions who have a critical mandate that impacts on women .
UN Women must not try and be the health experts but we must be able to work with the WHO [ World Health Organisation ] in such a manner that we even enhance the impact that they have on women .
The same with [ UN Children 's Fund ] Unicef . ""
Mlambo - Ngcuka believes the struggle for gender equality is still a work in progress , and what women share in common is more important than their differences . ""
Let 's face it , when a rapist stands in front of you and there 's two women â€ “
one is rich , one is poor , one is educated , one is not â€ “
you are in danger in the same way and it just takes away whatever divides for you .
That is why for me it is very important for women â€ ¦ in different political parties , different institutions [ to ] fight these ills together .
"" Some gender activists blame a lack of leadership for South Africa 's attitudes towards women , noting that Zuma is a polygamist with four wives , has stood trial for rape after having unprotected sex with an HIV - positive woman ( he was acquitted ) and once remarked that it is "" not right "" for women to be single .
Mlambo - Ngcuka goes into diplomatic mode again for this topic .
"" I leave the people to judge , "" she says , laughing .
"" Let me reflect on it .
I 'll get back to you on that one . """
2013-09-01,"Nelson Mandela has been discharged from hospital but remains in a critical and at times unstable condition , South African officials said on Sunday .
The 95-year - old former president spent 12 weeks at the Mediclinic Heart Hospital in Pretoria and will continue to receive intensive care at his home in the Johannesburg suburb of Houghton .
Mac Maharaj , a friend of Mandela and spokesman for President Jacob Zuma , said : "" Former president Nelson Mandela has this morning , 1 September 2013 , been discharged from the Pretoria hospital where he has been receiving treatment .
We would like to wish him all the best as he continues his recovery at his Johannesburg home . ""
Using Mandela 's clan name , he continued : "" Madiba 's condition remains critical and is at times unstable .
Nevertheless , his team of doctors are convinced that he will receive the same level of intensive care at his Houghton home that he received in Pretoria . ""
His home has been reconfigured to allow him to receive intensive care there .
The healthcare personnel providing care at his home are the very same who provided care to him in hospital .
If there are health conditions that warrant another admission to hospital in future , this will be done .
"" Mandela was admitted to hospital on 8 June when , it later emerged , his military ambulance suffered a breakdown and had to wait on the roadside for backup .
Rumours about his condition circulated , news teams were scrambled from around the world and South Africans braced for the worst , with crowds gathering outside the hospital and some saying it was time to "" let him go "" .
An unseemly battle between Mandela family members over the final resting place of his late children â€ “ and by implication Mandela himself
â€ “ was fought in court .
Yet the anti - apartheid hero clung on and , against the odds , was joined by his family for a celebration of his 95th birthday on 18 July , a day marked around the world .
Some upbeat accounts even described him sitting up in bed with earphones watching TV .
Reports on Saturday that he had been discharged from hospital were denied .
Maharaj added : "" During his stay in hospital from the 8th of June 2013 , the condition of our former president vacillated between serious to critical and at times unstable .
He has received full medical support and continues to do so .
He has also received visits from family , friends and colleagues .
Despite the difficulties imposed by his various illnesses , he , as always , displays immense grace and fortitude .
"" Madiba has been treated by a large medical team from the military , academia , private sector and other public health spheres .
We thank all the health professionals at the hospital for their dedication .
Most media have also been notably responsible and we thank them also for the maturity and understanding that all have in general displayed . ""
He concluded : "" We now call on all to allow the former president and his family the necessary private space so that his continuing care can proceed with dignity and without unnecessary intrusion . ""
Ambulances and Mercedes vans , along with TV crews , could be seen outside Mandela 's home on Sunday , where well - wishers have gathered to pray ."
2013-09-03,"About 80,000 gold miners in South Africa walked out on strike on Tuesday night , raising fears of renewed violence in the crisis - hit industry and underlining the government 's dwindling authority .
President Jacob Zuma admitted that he could only plead with companies and unions to find a peaceful solution and avoid seriously damaging the economy , already hit by sluggish growth and a contagion of strikes in other sectors .
But the parties remain poles apart .
The National Union of Mineworkers ( NUM ) accused captains of industry of "" arrogance "" forcing it to embark on nationwide industrial action "" that will change the gold mining landscape forever "" .
The dispute over pay comes a year after 46 people died during unrest in the platinum belt and amid signs that the century - old mining industry model is broken .
For years South Africa was the world 's top gold producer , accounting for more than two - thirds of output in 1970 , but it has slipped to fifth place with just 6 % of global production .
The NUM is demanding rises of up to 60 % after talks broke down .
The union , which represents about 64 % of South Africa 's 120,000 gold miners , said it rejected "" with contempt slave wages as represented by an increase of a meagre 6.5 % or R300 ( Â£18.68 ) per month "" .
It claims bosses have continuously awarded themselves huge bonuses . ""
The NUM has noted government 's wishes that industrial action be avoided and dares the state to explain which side it is on , "" spokesperson Lesiba Seshoka added .
"" The union is aware of the devastating impact industrial action would have on the economy , which is largely a white man 's economy with no benefits for poor black mineworkers . ""
A wave of strikes across South Africa , including in the auto industry and construction sectors , has sent the rand to four - year lows .
A shutdown in gold production will cost the country more than Â£22 m a day , according to estimates , and the NUM has suggested it could go on until Christmas .
Zuma urged mining houses and unions to reach a wage agreement soon , conceding : "" Government can only appeal to parties to find a solution .
I do n't think we can tell the management of the mine ' accept what the workers are saying ' , nor can we tell the workers [ that ] .
"" We just appeal that the two parties must find one another because a protracted strike is not helpful to the country nor to the industry itself .
The strike hurts both sides .
Both sides must be ready to give and to take as well . ""
But the troubles afflicting mining over the past two years , including the police massacre of striking workers in Marikana and its aftermath , have exposed the limitations of the African National Congress .
Aubrey Matshiqi , a political analyst and research fellow at the Helen Suzman Foundation , said : "" The sense I get is the government is becoming increasingly helpless .
What might save the mining sector is the relationship between employer and union : you need courage on both sides to be very honest about their needs and willingness to sacrifice .
The worst thing they can do is to marry themselves to short - term gains .
"" All is not yet lost for the industry , Matshiqi insisted .
"" It 's a crisis but I do n't think it 's inevitable that it will deepen .
A deepening is avoidable depending on how the protagonists conduct themselves . ""
Even the NUM 's demands are eclipsed by the more radical Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union , which is pushing for 150 % pay rises , claiming that the industry is still locked into apartheid - era pay structures despite 19 years of democracy .
The gold mining companies are the London - listed AngloGold Ashanti , Gold Fields , Rand Uranium , Harmony Gold , Evander Gold , Sibanye Gold and Village Main Reef .
They say the demands are unrealistic , given rising costs and falling bullion prices .
Matshiqi warned : "" Listening to the unions this morning , I heard a hardening of attitudes which may facilitate violence .
If one union accepts the offer and the other does n't , violence may be the way one union thinks it can keep the strike going .
This calls for a high level of maturity on both sides . "" rest ."
2013-09-12,"Campaigners in South Africa were celebrating on Thursday after President Jacob Zuma rejected controversial secrecy laws that threatened journalists and whistleblowers with long prison terms .
In a surprise move , Zuma refused to sign the protection of state information bill because it did not pass "" constitutional muster "" and knocked it back to parliament for revision .
It had been widely assumed that the president 's approval was a mere formality .
The proposed "" secrecy bill "" puts those in possession of classified information at risk of jail sentences of up to 25 years .
Activists have compared it to apartheid - era crackdowns and warned of a "" chilling effect "" on investigative journalism and those seeking to expose government corruption .
Retired archbishop Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela 's foundation have spoken out against the proposed legislation .
But it is also widely conceded that , after heated national debate , the current bill is a significant improvement on legislation first drawn up five years ago .
The president 's unexpected decision to send it back means that it is now likely to be watered down further still .
"" I have given consideration to the bill in its entirety and the various opinions and commentaries regarding the constitutionality and tagging of the bill , "" Zuma told the parliamentary press gallery association on Thursday . ""
After consideration of the bill and having applied my mind thereto , I am of the view that the bill as it stands does not pass constitutional muster . ""
He added : "" The constitution requires that the president must assent to and sign the bill referred to him or her by the national assembly .
However , in terms of section 79(1 ) of the constitution , if the president has reservations about the constitutionality of the bill , he or she may refer it back to the national assembly for reconsideration . ""
In this regard , I have referred the bill to the national assembly for reconsideration insofar as sections of the bill , in particular sections 42 and 45 , lack meaning and coherence , consequently are irrational and accordingly are unconstitutional . ""
In April , the bill was passed in parliament 's national assembly with 189 votes in favour , 74 against and one abstention .
It is intended to repeal an old apartheid law , the protection of information act of 1982 , which is not in line with the democratic constitution .
But it faced opposition from rival political parties , editors , lawyers and civil society groups as well as international organisations .
They argued that the bill is unconstitutional because it lacks a clause to protect those who publish information that they deem to be in the public interest .
Despite being accused of ramming the legislation through , Zuma 's party , the African National Congress , said it "" welcomes "" his ruling .
The office of its chief whip said : "" We appreciate the president 's views on the bill .
Indeed , parliament must ensure that an appropriate process is instituted to ensure that amendments are accordingly effected .
It is important that the laws parliament pass are of highest quality and are not in conflict with the constitution .
"" We are confident that the amendments would further strengthen the bill and its objectives of protecting citizen 's information and enhancing national security through protection of sensitive government information . "" Zuma 's intervention was welcomed by Mandela 's long - time friend and lawyer George Bizos , who said : "" I said before they passed it there will be a long queue of lawyers at the constitutional court , so he must have received good advice .
I 'm very pleased .
It would have been a threat to freedom of expression . ""
Murray Hunter of the civil society group
the Right2Know campaign told the eNews Channel Africa : "" I think we are definitely celebrating .
This is an important day .
While it 's not over , this is a sign that as citizens working together , mobilising , we certainly are able to bring change . ""
Zuma sent the bill back to the drawing board despite reportedly speaking out against the media earlier this week .
Addressing a group of journalism students , he was quoted as saying : "" Who do you think in reality you serve when reporting : the interest of the public that you claim , as the media you stand for , or the interest of the owners and managers of the paper ? ""
Zuma reportedly said the South African media claimed to act as society 's watchdog , but "" they were never elected .
I 've argued with them that they were never elected , we were elected and we can claim that we represent the people .
They do say they represent the people .
[ But ] does the population or public determine what is reported ?
They do n't . """
2013-11-22,"The South African government has warned that media outlets publishing photographs of President Jacob Zuma 's house face prosecution .
State security minister Siyabonga Cwele said : "" No one , including those in the media , are allowed to take images and publicise images . ""
The ban on pictures follows a long - running controversy over Zuma 's residence in Nkandla , in the province of KwaZulu - Natal .
It is a huge compound , with a mini - football pitch , gym , helicopter pads , a tuck - shop for one of Zuma 's four wives and a pen for livestock .
A scandal erupted when it was discovered that more than Â£12 m of state funds was used to refurbish the property , prompting many media outlets to publish aerial shots of the property .
Ministers have defended the expense as necessary for "" security upgrades "" and have justified the ban on pictures by invoking the 1980 National Key Points Act , which prohibits publicity for "" installations of strategic importance . ""
The South African National Editors Forum ( Sanef ) says the act is being misused .
It issued a statement saying "" ministers are using security laws to avoid accounting to the public on the Nkandla upgrades . ""
Sanef 's chairman , Mpumelelo Mkhabela , said ministers were threatening to prosecute journalists for publishing public interest information .
"" There 's an assumption that the media has somehow put the president 's security at risk , which is not true , "" he said .

2013-12-05,"Africa will never have seen anything like it .
Amid unfathomable grief , the death of Nelson Mandela will be marked with the biggest and most watched events ever organised on the continent .
South Africa 's president Jacob Zuma said on Thursday night : "" Our beloved Madiba will be accorded a state funeral .
I have ordered that all flags of the Republic of South Africa be lowered to half mast â€ ¦ and to remain at half - mast until after the funeral . ""
The funeral will rival that of Pope John Paul II in 2005 , which drew five kings , six queens and 70 presidents and prime ministers as well as 2 million faithful .
The closest British equivalent may have been the 1965 state funeral of Winston Churchill .
Every living American president is expected to attend , health permitting , along with foreign dignitaries ranging from Prince Charles to the Zimbabwean president , Robert Mugabe .
Celebrities who considered themselves close to Mandela , such as Oprah Winfrey , are also set to fly in .
All this spells an unprecedented planning and security nightmare for South Africa at the very moment that it is plunged into mourning for its father figure .
The country is likely to come to a virtual standstill for two weeks as Mandela 's death is marked in various ways ; some of them spontaneous and impossible to predict .
"" He is the hero of the planet , "" a senior foreign diplomat said .
"" It 's going to be the biggest state funeral since Winston Churchill , and I think any country would struggle to organise that . ""
An internal South African government document seen by the Guardian sets out a provisional 12-day schedule from the moment of death .
Although it was drawn up more than a year ago and is subject to revision , it provides an insight into how officials have prepared for a historically unique moment .
"" Body to be taken and moved to the mortuary under police guard , plans for possible live coverage are being worked on , "" it says for day one .
"" Condolence books to be opened on all foreign missions , Nelson Mandela Foundation , Union Buildings , and possibly Soweto Mandela Museum , "" it adds for day two .
On day three , foreign diplomats will be briefed in Pretoria and logistics for Mandela 's lying in state will be discussed .
On day four , various dignitaries will visit the Mandela family .
By day six there will be a memorial service attended by dignitaries and organisational leaders "" as the body will be there .
The ceremony will be addressed by President Jacob Zuma , there will be screens outside the city hall , and possibly Soweto , Cape Town and various other places . ""
According to the draft , on day eight , Mandela will lie in state at Pretoria city hall for three days .
"" Body will be kept there until very late on every day , and then removed to be prepared for the following day â€ ¦ inside a coffin with glass at the top for viewing . ""
On day nine , the South Africa military will rehearse for the official state funeral at the Union Buildings , where Mandela was inaugurated as president following the first democratic elections in 1994 .
International heads of state will arrive at airports in Pretoria and Johannesburg .
There will be more arrivals on day 10 , along with street closures , "" all security measures to be implemented , final preparations at the Union Buildings , including dropping of equipment to be used during the ceremony â€ ¦ Body to be taken later for final dressing . ""
A procession from the mortuary to the Union Buildings will take place on day 11 , followed by a state funeral at the Union Buildings amphitheatre , attended by heads of state .
It will be shown on screens in the grounds and Pretoria city hall , where massive crowds are expected .
The memo states : "" Body to be removed after the ceremony , and then later flown by the military to Qunu [ Mandela 's home village in Eastern Cape province ] overnight for final burial . ""
The final day in the plan reads : "" Morning procession through the streets , and then to the family home for final burial at the Mandela home compound , not the family cemetery . ""
Guests at the state funeral will almost certainly include Barack Obama , his wife , Michelle , who visited Mandela in South Africa in 2011 , and their daughters , as well as Bill and Hillary Clinton , who knew him well .
Other former US presidents and large cabinet and congressional delegations are also expected .
A source at the British high commission in Pretoria said Prince Charles and the prime minister had been pencilled in .
The African National Congress 's allies in Africa and beyond , such as Cuba , will also figure prominently , along with heads of state and royalty from around the world .
But South African officials have purportedly told diplomats they should not expect their dignitaries to get VIP treatment â€ “ the priority is on South Africans , then other African leaders and fellow liberation movements , then the rest of the world .
The events will draw a vast armada of international news crews , reporters , photographers and pundits , some of whom have been preparing for this moment for many years .
Rumour has it that major networks long ago booked hotel balconies overlooking the Union Buildings as well as houses in Qunu , although there is still likely to be an almighty scramble for vantage points and accommodation .
Away from these major focal points , there will also doubtless be memorial events in cities , towns and villages all over the country .
South Africa is a jarring blend of hi - tech modernity and inadequate infrastructure , sometimes sitting side - by - side .
The coming days will test its ability to host a global event as never before , dwarfing the challenges of the 2010 football World Cup , widely hailed as a triumph over sceptics . ""
The passing of the former president will be one of the biggest news events internationally for decades , "" said Eusebius McKaiser , a political analyst and associate of the Wits Centre for Ethics .
"" The implication that 's unpredictable from a logistical point of view is that we just ca n't anticipate what the burden will be on the South African state .
It 's going to be a huge security challenge for us .
The World Cup , by comparison , is very small .
And the sombre tone will be very different from the World Cup , which was joyous . ""
Openly discussing the prospect of Mandela 's death has almost been taboo in South Africa , especially among government officials .
Some claim it goes against African culture to do so .
But McKaiser hopes security preparations have been going on behind the scenes : "" Potential lunatics might want to capitalise on a moment when South Africans are feeling vulnerable .
It will be a difficult time
but hopefully the people in charge of security will get on with being professional . ""
South Africa is not high on the list of international terrorism targets , McKaiser noted , but countries will need to co - ordinate their efforts .
"" There will be a big galaxy of senior statesmen under one airspace .
If you were a terrorist looking for an unexpected opportunity to cause nuisance , South Africa will become a potentially interesting target . ""
J Brooks Spector , a Johannesburg - based political commentator and former US diplomat , said : "" The South African government will face an overwhelming logistical challenge , just as virtually the entire nation has gone into a state of profound mourning .
Every world leader who can possibly make the trip will want to join the funeral and the other ceremonies as South Africa says a final ' goodbye ' to Nelson Mandela . ""
He added : "" Sorting out the protocol issues and logistical support will tax the South African government and African National Congress to the utmost .
Ultimately , organisers will have to count on the goodwill of their guests to roll with the punches and inevitable glitches of getting dignitaries
â€ “ foreign and domestic â€ “ in and out all of these events , together with the thousands of South Africans desperate to pay their own last respects .
"" It will be like a simultaneous opening and closing ceremony of the World Cup , a presidential inauguration and a monarch 's coronation .
It will be the ultimate test .
"" The feuding family One of the subplots of the next two weeks may be internal conflict in the Mandela family .
His grandson and oldest male heir , Mandla , has been accused of making plans to bury Mandela in the village of Mvezo , where Mandla is chief .
Other family members , and the government , are said to prefer Qunu , about 25 miles away , where Mandela lived in retirement .
Mandela married three times and fathered six children .
Some observers point to animosity between factions , in particular the descendants of his first wife , Evelyn Mase , who died in 2004 , and second wife , Winnie Madikizela - Mandela , whom he divorced in 1996 but who remains a prominent figure .
His widow , GraÃ§a Machel , is no less formidable .
It will be a setback for South Africa 's epic logistical exercise , when the country is trying to show the world its best , if these rivalries come boiling to the surface ."
2013-12-06,"South Africa is set for a week of mourning after the death of Nelson Mandela , the most universally loved and revered leader in history , through a series of events to celebrate his life .
The president , Jacob Zuma , announced an extended schedule of activities , befitting Mandela 's status as South Africa 's most beloved son , starting with a day of prayer on Sunday and culminating in a state funeral expected to rival that of Pope John Paul II in 2005 .
"" We should all work together to organise the most befitting funeral for this outstanding son of our country and the father of our young nation , "" said Zuma , anticipating the massive logistical challenge ahead .
The president announced a memorial service to be held at the FNB stadium in Johannesburg , the venue of the 2010 World Cup final , on Tuesday 10 December , which is expected to be broadcast around the world .
Mandela 's body will then lie in state in Pretoria for three days , in a glass - topped coffin allowing well - wishers to pay their respects .
A funeral will be held on 15 December , attended by world leaders including David Cameron , Barack Obama and Bill and Hillary Clinton .
Mandela 's final resting place will be the modest village of Qunu in the Eastern Cape , a place where Mandela wrote in his memoir , Long Walk to Freedom , that he had spent "" some of the happiest years of my boyhood "" .
The strength and breadth of Mandela 's global appeal was reflected by the range of tributes from world leaders , piling up with every minute that passed after his death at home in Johannesburg at 8.50pm ( 18.50 GMT ) on Thursday night .
Presidents and prime ministers , from Washington to Beijing , Havana to Delhi , from Jerusalem to the West Bank , all claimed to draw inspiration from the South African legend .
Mandela set a benchmark for statesmanship against which all others have been measured .
It is not just the powerful who mourn his death .
Many people , interviewed around the world , expressed their sense of loss , and in many places gathered to pay their respects .
An impromptu shrine sprang up in London 's Trafalgar Square as people left flowers outside the South African embassy , scenes of countless anti - apartheid protests during his long imprisonment .
In Kiev , where Ukrainians have gathered for anti - government demonstrations around the clock for the past week , protesters took a moment to recall Mandela 's legacy . ""
He had many troubles in his life .
He was in prison , but he was waiting and he achieved what he wanted , "" said Alena Pivovar , an anti - government protester .
"" We have the same situation now .
We have some barriers , but we have to pass them . ""
In New York City 's Harlem neighbourhood , Franco Gaskin , 85 , an artist , stood before a mural featuring Mandela that he had painted on a shop front almost 20 years ago .
He remembered Mandela visiting there in 1990 .
"" It was dynamic , everyone was so electrified to see him in Harlem , "" Gaskin said .
"" I idolised him .
He leaves a legacy that all of us should follow . ""
In his home country , where Mandela 's death was felt most keenly , many South Africans voiced anxieties about the future of a nation without an adored father figure who made reconciliation and dignity the twin pillars of his political philosophy .
Mandela sought to follow in the footsteps of earlier heroes of peaceful resistance such as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King , but not even they were lionised around the globe by so many leaders from such a wide ideological spectrum .
America 's first black president paid tribute to Mandela in a sombre statement delivered from the White House .
Barack Obama described the personal inspiration he had drawn from the man he called Madiba .
"" I am one of the countless millions who drew inspiration from Nelson Mandela 's life , "" said a visibly moved Obama .
"" And like so many around the globe , I can not fully imagine my own life without the example that Nelson Mandela set , and so long as I live I will do what I can to learn from him . ""
The US president , who met Mandela once as a senator but was prevented from visiting him during a trip to South Africa in June by his illness , has been reluctant to over - emphasise the comparisons , but revealed how much his own political career had been influenced by the anti - apartheid struggle .
"" My very first political action , the first thing I ever did that involved an issue or a policy or politics , was a protest against apartheid , "" said Obama .
"" I studied his words and his writings .
The day that he was released from prison gave me a sense of what human beings can do when they 're guided by their hopes and not by their fears . ""
In China , Mandela 's mantle was claimed by both the Communist regime , which had backed the anti - apartheid struggle , and opposition activists , who now seek to emulate it .
President Xi Jinping , who supported opponents of apartheid throughout the cold war , praised Mandela 's victory in the struggle and his contribution to "" the cause of human progress "" .
Human rights activists pointed out that Mandela 's life and death were a reminder of the struggles of homegrown advocates for democracy and an open society , such as the imprisoned Nobel peace prize laureate , Liu Xiaobo . ""
This moment magnifies how evil the current regime is , "" Hu Jia , an activist said .
In the Middle East , the Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , and the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , found rare common cause in paying homage . ""
He was never haughty , "" Netanyahu said .
"" He worked to heal rifts within South African society and succeeded in preventing outbreaks of racial hatred . ""
Abbas said Mandela was a "" symbol of freedom from colonialism and occupation "" and his death was a great loss for Palestine , whose cause he championed .
"" The Palestinian people will never forget his historic statement that the South African revolution will not have achieved its goals as long as the Palestinians are not free , "" Abbas said .
Many Palestinians and international observers have drawn parallels between Israel 's occupation of Palestine and the apartheid regime in South Africa , and Mandela was frequently cited as an inspirational hero for Palestinians .
Abbas described Mandela as the "" most courageous and important of those who supported us "" .
He added : "" The name Mandela will stay forever with Palestine and with all Palestinians . ""
In Iran , the official English - language Twitter account of the president , Hassan Rouhani , said : "" With a heavy heart , we say goodbye to Nelson Mandela .
Surely , his legacy will remain a source of inspiration and courage . ""
Manmohan Singh , the Indian prime minister , referenced his country 's own independence leader , Gandhi . ""
A giant among men has passed away .
This is as much India 's loss as South Africa 's .
He was a true Gandhian .
His life and work will remain a source of eternal inspiration for generations to come .
I join all those who are praying for his soul . ""
Gandhi spent formative years as a political activist in South Africa and Mandela knew Gandhi 's son Manilal , historians pointed out .
In London , David Cameron said Mandela was a towering figure : "" A great light has gone out in the world .
Nelson Mandela was a towering figure in our time ; a legend in life and now in death , a true global hero .
Across the country he loved they will be mourning a man who was the embodiment of grace .
Meeting him was one of the great honours of my life . """
2013-12-06,"Australian leaders past and present have extended their sorrow and condolences over the death of Nelson Mandela , who died in his South African home on Thursday .
South African president Jacob Zuma announced the passing of the countryâ€ ™ s first black president on Friday morning , saying â€œOur nation has lost its greatest son .
Our people have lost a father .
But though we knew that this day would come , nothing can diminish our sense of the profound and enduring loss.â€ �
Australian prime minister Tony Abbott offered condolences to the Mandela family on behalf of the Australian government and community .
â€œNelson Mandela will forever be remembered as more than a political leader , he was a moral leader , â€ � said Abbott in a statement .
â€œHe spent much of his life standing against the injustice of apartheid .
When that fight was won , he inspired us again by his capacity to forgive and reconcile his country .
While the world may never see another Nelson Mandela , he has inspired countless men and women throughout the world to live more courageous and honest lives.â€ � Abbott told ABC radio that the former South African leader was â€œa truly great manâ€ � and â€œone of the great figures of Africa , one of the great figures of the last centuryâ€ � .
Opposition leader Bill Shorten and deputy opposition leader Tanya Plibersek said that we must live by Mandelaâ€ ™ s example .
â€œToday we have lost the light of our world , â€ �
they said in a joint statement .
â€œMandela was a true leader , a statesmen and the defining symbol of reconciliation .
He achieved perhaps more than any other leader in his pursuit of peace , acceptance and justice .
The slow struggle for reconciliation does not end today â€ “ not for South Africa , and not for any of us , â€ �
they said .
â€œLet today renew our resolve for reconciliation .
Mandela was an example to the world â€ “ we must live by that example.â€ �
Former prime minister Julia Gillard said the world has lost a great man .
â€œAs we grieve for Nelson Mandela we should also celebrate his tremendous victory over prejudice and hate ,
â€ � she tweeted .
Former prime minister Bob Hawke , who was instrumental in the release of Mandela from prison , said the former South African president will forever be remembered as â€œthe father of democracy in South Africa "" . ""
His courage and character has been an inspiration to many , both within and beyond South Africa , "" Hawke said .
"" His long campaign and self - sacrifice for political freedom for his people in South Africa was unparalleled in the 20th century . ""
Mandela told Hawke in 1990 , during a visit to the Australian parliament , â€œI want you to know , Bob , that I am here today , at this time , because of you . ""
Former Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser wrote , in a tribute to Mandela , that of all the people he has met , â€œhe was by far the greatestâ€ � .

2013-12-08,"South Africans have flocked to churches for a national day of prayer to remember Nelson Mandela and pray for the country 's future , following the death of South Africa 's first black president on Thursday .
Millions thronged to churches , mosques and synagogues to hear preachers and clerics reflect on the most famous South African of them all .
In Bryanston , Mandela 's ex - wife Winnie and several family members attended a service along with the current president , Jacob Zuma .
At the Regina Mundi church in Soweto , there was standing room only at the 9 am mass , as hundreds of worshippers and a formidable number of camera crews packed the aisles to hear Father Sebastian Rossouw describe Mandela as a guiding light for the nation .
At the church , famous for being a meeting place for anti - apartheid activists and around which the 1976 Soweto uprising took place , Rossouw echoed the mantra that is fast becoming a theme here : "" Mandela was our light in the darkness , "" he said .
"" Learn from his life .
Madiba claimed his humanity and showed the heights to which humanity can rise .
But we can have another Mandela .
So to say there will never be another as great is wrong .
Amongst us is another who can be like him . ""
In Cape Town , under an already searing early morning sun , several hundred people filled St George 's Cathedral , the 19th - century church that Desmond Tutu transformed into a bastion of resistance against apartheid .
Beneath a central panel depicting a black Christ , ANC members , some with the party 's flags draped over their shoulders , sat side by side with tourists and students .
Margaret Mervis and her daughter had come to the service , each clutching bouquets of flowers .
More than 40 years ago , as a student in the whites - only University of Cape Town , Mervis recalled , Mandela had inspired her to join regular protests staged by students . ""
Right here in the cathedral we were teargassed ; some of us who were detained were never the same again .
We thought many times of leaving this country but Mandela taught us we all have to fight for justice .
The courage Mandela had was something special , he was just an amazing human being . ""
As children in their Sunday best played hopscotch on the stairs outside , a visitor from Sri Lanka stepped to the pulpit to read a short piece .
"" We want you to know that the world is looking to you to understand the power of reconciliation .
South Africa stands tall when it comes to forgiveness , and Sri Lanka can learn from that , "" she said , referring to the country 's almost three - decade - long battle with the Tamil Tigers separatist movement .
Sunday is a day when many South Africans visit their dead and candles were lit in graveyards around the country as well as at the spots that have become flower - covered shrines â€ “ at Mandela 's various homes past and present , at churches , under his statues and in squares and streets named for him .
There was no day of rest for South Africa 's road workers .
With foreign dignitaries expected to arrive ahead of the memorial events planned for this week , potholes were being filled and grass verges cut .
On the road to the 90,000-capacity Soccer City stadium where Johannesburg 's main memorial service is to be held on Tuesday , there was feverish painting of kerbs and road lines .
In Pretoria , where Mandela 's body will lie in state from Wednesday , there were similar scenes and people have been urged to line the route his coffin will take .
Cape Town will hold its open service on Wednesday .
Security advance parties were filling out hotels on Sunday before the arrival of dozens of world leaders this week , ahead of Sunday 's funeral at Mandela 's birthplace of Qunu in the Eastern Cape .
Already the talk is of the biggest funeral ceremony in the world ."
2013-12-09,"It was the performance of his career .
When the South African president , Jacob Zuma , wearing a sombre black Nehru - collar tunic , addressed the nation and much of the world just before midnight last Thursday to break the news of Nelson Mandela 's death , he rose to the occasion .
Even Zuma 's critics have praised the gravitas and carefully crafted prose with which he captured the national mood , his description of Mandela as the nation 's "" greatest son "" striking a chord like Tony Blair 's "" people 's princess "" remark after the death of Diana .
The moment took the heat off an ailing , scandal - hit presidency .
Only a week earlier Zuma had been besieged by negative headlines about the spending of 215 m ( Â£12.6 m ) rand of taxpayers ' money on his private home in the village of Nkandla .
Analysts had been predicting that he could lead Mandela 's African National Congress ( ANC ) to its worst - ever result at next year 's election .
Less than an hour after Mandela 's death was announced , however , ANC supporters in party colours and regalia were among those rallying outside his house singing liberation - era songs .
The surge of nostalgia for Mandela has inevitably recalled the ANC 's past glories .
Some believe that this could revive its fortunes at the ballot box .
William Gumede , a political author and academic , said : "" Mandela 's death has rescued Zuma politically .
He was getting to a tipping point with Nkandla and other crises .
It was also the week when the unions were going to decide whether to form their own political party but now that has been postponed . ""
So the ANC might get some temporary relief .
Its own polls had said the highest they could get in the election was 55 % and the lowest 45 % .
But now they might get 60 % again because people who 'd decided they were n't going to vote may now give them one more chance . ""
But Gumede added : "" If that happens it will only be a temporary thing because then there may be a really big backlash .
As people focus on Mandela 's legacy and compare him to Zuma , they will see the contrast is so big . ""
That is the flipside .
Inevitably the question is now being asked : after almost 20 years in government , has Mandela 's beloved ANC lived up to his dreams or betrayed his inheritance ?
He was an unswervingly loyal party man and used to joke that after death he would join the nearest ANC branch in heaven .
But Bill Keller , who reported for the New York Times from Johannesburg in 1992 - 95 , mused two decades later :
"" I imagine that some days the news - if it penetrates the fog that I 'm told enshrouds the 94-year - old Nelson Mandela - must break his heart . ""
The ANC believes it has a positive story to tell .
At a meeting with Southern Africa 's Foreign Correspondents ' Association in Johannesburg in June , Zuma listed the party 's achievements since it came to power with Mandela as president in 1994 .
He said it had built millions of homes , given many people access to water for the first time and provided more social grants to the poor and vulnerable : from 2.5 million in 1993 to 16 million today .
The proportion of households with electric lighting rose from 51.4 % in 2001 to 84.6 % in 2011 .
The South African economy , Zuma contended , had expanded by 83 % under the ANC .
National income per capita had increased 40 % from 27,500 rand in 1993 to 38,500 rand in 2012 .
Disposable income per capita of households had gone up by 43 % .
Total employment had increased by more than 3.5 million since 1994 , he claimed .
Average real wages in mining and industry had increased by more than 150 % .
And after its early and well - chronicled failures , the government has tackled the HIV / Aids epidemic , leading to a rise in life expectancy .
According to Zuma , every type of crime , except white - collar crime , has been reduced .
Even the scourge of corruption was being dealt with , he insisted .
And now there is a national development plan to slay the three - headed dragon of poverty , unemployment and inequality .
Asked by the Guardian to reflect on the ANC 's successes and failures in government , Zuma replied : "" If you had taken government in 1994 from apartheid , which had destroyed the country , you will realise that the challenge is very huge .
There will be things that in 20 years , the scars are still showing , and certainly we are looking at what it is we are doing to improve the state of the country . ""
Generally , I know people do n't compare where we 've come from and what we 've done .
There are many issues we are still dealing with .
We have not done what we would have wanted , to implement all our correct policies , for a variety of reasons , but we believe we have made very good progress .
We believe in 19 years we have made progress that no other African country that emerged from colonialism has made .
We believe we have done a lot . ""
The pernicious legacy of apartheid , with its systematic denial of education to millions of black people , and its spatial segregation written into the very landscape of the country , can not be dismissed lightly .
The growing number of tourists who visit South Africa today find gleaming airports , shopping centres patronised by all ethnic groups and spectacular stadiums built for the successfully hosted 2010 World Cup .
They even visit townships such as Soweto where there is evidence of a developing middle class .
This remains Africa 's most powerful economy .
But perhaps Mandela 's greatest tribute is South Africa 's liberal constitution , lauded around the world , and democratic institutions .
Elections are held every five years and judged free and fair .
Although the ANC remains dominant , and its willingness to accept defeat at the polls has not yet been tested , Mandela 's humble decision to step down after one term ensured that this would be no repeat of Robert Mugabe 's Zimbabwe .
The party and the country are already on a fourth leader .
South Africans also have an independent judiciary , robust media and dynamic civil society
â€ “ a crucial force in the turnaround on Aids policy .
There is , however , a counter - narrative about Africa 's oldest liberation party that is every bit as compelling .
This is the story of a party , and a country , in perpetual crisis , from an education system that remains shambolic no matter how much money is thrown at it to an unbridged chasm between rich and poor .
By this critique , the ANC is rife with corruption , with the misallocation of lucrative government tenders giving rise to a new term : "" tenderpreneurs "" .
The most egregious instance was a 1990s international arms deal costing an estimated 70bn rand ( Â£5.5bn ) of taxpayers ' money .
A decade later , with much of the military equipment redundant , official inquiries continue into allegations that bribes worth more than 2bn rand were paid to individuals and the ANC itself .
This story of the ANC reached a nadir in 2012 when police shot dead 34 striking mineworkers at Marikana , the worst state security crackdown since the apartheid days .
The idea of a black government gunning down black workers would surely have given Mandela the heartbreak that Keller described .
The men held primarily responsible for all of this are Mandela 's successors .
Thabo Mbeki was widely regarded as the power behind the throne even when Mandela was president , with the latter content to be a globetrotting figurehead .
Mbeki 's own tenure , whatever its merits , is now tainted in memory by a so - called "" Aids denialism "" that delayed the distribution of life - saving antiretroviral drugs and his failure to hold Zimbabwe 's Robert Mugabe to democratic account .
After a brief interim under Kgalema Motlanthe , the presidency passed to Zuma , seen by opponents as personifying much of the present malaise .
Bribery and racketeering charges against the polygamous populist were dropped just before his election , which was earned in part by whipping up support with the apartheid - era rallying song "" Bring me my machine gun "" .
Among the many opposition parties , street protesters and journalists who warn that the ANC government is delivering too little too slowly is Zwelinzima Vavi , general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions , currently suspended over alleged misconduct .
Unemployment stands at a massive 36.7 % using the most realistic definition , he noted in a June 2013 speech , with the proportion of those out of work for more than a year at 68 % .
Vavi cited a 2010 report showing that 44 % of workers in South Africa live on less than 10 rand a day , which only just pays for a loaf of brown bread . ""
So 44 % of workers in South Africa are working for a loaf of bread a day , "" he said .
"" It is still intrinsically a low - wage colonial economy . ""
Even though we created an estimated 1.9 million jobs between 2002 and 2007 , these jobs seem to have increased rather than decreasing the levels of poverty , and since then more retrenchments have thrown even more people into poverty . ""
From luxury wine estates to squalid and violent informal settlements , South Africa remains one of the most unequal societies in the world .
Vavi cited figures showing that half the population lives on 8 % of the national income , while recent estimates suggest that the top 5 % of earners earn 30 times more than the bottom 5 % .
And ethnicity , a boundary Mandela did so much to cross , is still a defining factor in life chances and many social contexts .
The South African Institute of Race Relations found the median salary for black people in 2011 was 2,380 rand , while white people earned 10,000 rand .
"" This is the story of inequalities in South Africa , "" Vavi said .
Blaming apartheid for such ills will no longer do , according to Zuma 's critics , who say it is time the ANC took responsibility .
Bantu Holomisa , who was expelled from the party and now leads the United Democratic Movement , said : "" There were some areas where the country under the ANC made achievements : Mandela and [ his successor Thabo ]
Mbeki moved with speed to put institutions in place .
But the challenge has been their effectiveness .
Nine out of 10 times
you find the good work was undermined by the deployment of cadres who could n't get work in parliament . ""
He continued : "" Unfortunately , corruption seems to have engulfed the top echelon of the movement .
The main failure was not to understand the difference between the ANC and the government .
Whenever there was a scandal they tended to close ranks at the expense of the nation .
When we celebrate 20 years of democracy in 2014 , people will be saying the ANC is showing signs of imploding . ""
Holomisa remained close to Mandela even after leaving the ANC and visited him in hospital in June 2013 . ""
Definitely this is not the country that he dreamed about , "" he reflected .
"" Whoever thought South Africa would be led by someone [ Zuma ] facing nearly 800 corruption charges , which were unceremoniously taken out of court ?
I do n't think the Mandelas and Sisulus would be impressed by what Zuma is doing . ""
Obbey Mabena , an ANC veteran , who is critical of the party 's current leadership , pointed to the slow pace of land redistribution , the illegal bulldozing of homes and the Marikana massacre .
"" It 's pretty much the way things were under apartheid .
Nothing has changed except the faces of those in parliament , which means the country is heading for disaster . ""
Progress versus decline , corruption versus integrity , building a new nation versus dragging it towards catastrophe : both narratives compete in any evaluation of the ANC under and after Mandela .
And this , perhaps , was always inevitable as a 101-year - old liberation movement dedicated to the overthrow of colonialism and apartheid suddenly found itself at the levers of power .
Steven Friedman , of Rhodes University and the University of Johannesburg , said : "" There 's always a sense in a new democracy of over - promising and under - delivering .
It 's in the nature of new democracies .
"" I think that where the ANC must take responsibility is that they did indicate that they were serious about actually placing this country on a different path rather than simply integrating people into the old path . "" I think that has been a failure on their part but obviously it is not their failure alone .
Business [ and ] other interest groups could have adjusted better than they did . ""
Friedman gave the ANC nine marks out of 10 for conventional macroeconomic management since it came to power .
But he added : "" If you 're looking at really coming up with imaginative plans to deal with what is really the central South African problem since the 1990s â€ “ that is , how do we deal with poverty and inequality without really crippling the market economy â€
“
I think they 'd have to get two or three out of 10 , but
then so would everybody else . """
2013-12-11,"Nelson Mandela 's state memorial service was attended by more than 90 000 people and 100 heads of states , paying their last respects to a man who is not only a national hero but also a global icon for peace , hope and reconciliation .
It was a day of eulogies to Mandela , but some say it was overshadowed by the boos and jeers that the sitting president , Jacob Zuma , received when he walked into the stadium and again when he was about to address the crowd .
The commotion set social media alight , with commentators disagreeing on whether it was appropriate behaviour for a memorial service .
It certainly raised the stakes for the upcoming general election .
In a public statement , the ANC said that those who booed during Mandela 's memorial service did South Africa a disservice and embarrassed the country .
ANC deputy president and business tycoon , Cyril Ramaphosa , tried to take control of the situation and told the crowd to be disciplined in front of international visitors .
Many people backed this view and felt that Nelson Mandela 's memorial was not the appropriate platform to voice political discontent .
Sam Mgobozi , a recent UCT graduate , was representative of many South Africans : "" I think it is incredibly insensitive , rude and , quite frankly , treasonous .
Today is n't a budget speech or a State of the Nation Address or any public policy address .
Today is about celebrating and inculcating the memory of Nelson Mandela . ""
The service should have been a perfect marketing opportunity for the ANC , as it was his political home for 71 years .
He died an ANC member and once joked that the first thing he would do upon arrival in heaven is to find a branch to join .
You ca n't take Mandela out of the context of the ANC â€ “
it was the party that won the election
not him personally .
Had the current ANC lived up to Mandela 's vision , his passing would have been the perfect opportunity to remind South Africa and the world what it had achieved in ending apartheid and fighting inequality .
Unfortunately , it seems that his death might have had the opposite effect .
Many South Africans feel that the occasion has shown that the ANC 's term in office has been underwhelming , and that the former liberation movement has failed as a government .
As much as I agree that the booing was inappropriate and in bad taste , it did however send a clear message from the people .
It was also fitting for the ANC to be served with the same medicine that it has been distributing to the people in the last 20 years .
When it was voted into power in 1994 , there was a lot of expectation in South Africa .
The party had 300 years of inequality to address and promised "" a better life for all "" .
But their term in office has been rife with scandal , corruption , maladministration and self - enrichment .
So yes , it was inappropriate to boo at the memorial .
And yes , South Africa was embarrassed .
But it was n't the booing , or even the reports that the official deaf signer was a "" fake "" that has been the most embarrassing to the country or to Mandela 's legacy .
That honour goes to the current ANC .
A president who squanders millions while his people live in squalor is far more embarrassing to South Africa and the world .
Let us hope that the masses will boo him where it matters most , at the polls ."
2014-01-28,"South Africa 's main opposition party will field a black candidate for president for the first time , it announced on Tuesday , effectively firing the starting gun for the most fiercely contested election in two decades of democracy .
Mamphela Ramphele , an anti - apartheid activist and former partner of black consciousness leader Steve Biko , will represent the Democratic Alliance ( DA ) against incumbent president Jacob Zuma of the African National Congress ( ANC ) .
Ramphele agreed to join the DA after her own party , Agang SA , failed to gain traction among voters and was reported to be broke .
The political marriage brings together a charismatic leader who lacked organisational resources and a party that has strong structures but has long battled a perception that it is white - dominated and evocative of the apartheid past .
The national elections , likely to be held in April or May , have been described as a "" tipping point "" and will be the first since the death of former president Nelson Mandela .
His party , the ANC , is on course to retain power but widespread frustration at corruption , poverty , unemployment and weak public services offers rival parties a chance to eat into its majority .
Ramphele , aiming to become the country 's first female president , was a black consciousness activist and mother to two children with Biko , who was beaten to death in apartheid police custody in 1977 .
She is close to DA leader Helen Zille who , as a campaigning journalist , exposed Biko 's death .
Zille later served as Ramphele 's head of communications when she was vice - chancellor of the University of Cape Town .
On Tuesday the women sat side by side at a press conference in Cape Town . ""
I can think of no better person to be our presidential candidate in this crucial election , "" said Zille , embracing her new political ally .
"" This is a game - changing moment for South Africa . ""
Zille , who will remain as DA party leader , added later : "" Nobody in their right mind would accuse her being a candidate who wants to bring back apartheid
â€
¦
It removes the race card from that debate .
"" Ramphele , 66 , alluded to the loss of Mandela as a symbol of the changing political landscape .
"" I believe this decision is in the best interests of South Africa as we head into turbulent waters , "" she said .
"" The death of Nelson Mandela has changed many things for South Africa . ""
She added : "" Today is another astonishing moment in what we offer the people of South Africa , and once again the world .
A moment to once again glimpse the greatness that is in us .
"" The DA has been steadily growing its support base and claims to be the most racially diverse party in the country , although many analysts have said it urgently needs a black leader to appeal to the country 's black majority .
It gained 16.66 % of the popular vote at the last election in 2009 , still well behind the ANC 's 65.9 % .
Ramphele , who in the past criticised the DA as a "" white party "" , said : "" We are going to take away the excuse of race and challenge the ANC to be judged on its performance .
We are taking away that race card and putting it in the dustbin . ""
The realignment provoked a mixed reaction .
Zille 's predecessor as DA leader , Tony Leon , said : "" This gives the DA and opposition a lot of momentum carrying right through to the election .
South Africa is still largely in thrall to the politics of political identity rather than personality . ""
But Eusebius McKaiser , a political analyst and author of the forthcoming book
Could I Vote DA ? , condemned the party 's leadership for demonstrating "" incredible insecurity "" about its ability to win support .
"" If they were confident , why would they need to court the leader of another party ? ""
He added : "" It is a tactical misstep on the part of the DA .
It wo n't cost them votes but it will cost them internal tensions .
Not everyone in the party agrees with it , including senior black members I 've spoken to . ""
Gwede Mantashe , secretary general of the ANC , said : "" It 's a rent - a - leader and a rent - a - black - face . ""
Referring to Agang SA , he said : "" It 's another report of another stillborn party .
A party that dies before it is born .
"" Ramphele is a medical doctor , academic , former World Bank managing director and mining company executive ; last year she revealed her personal wealth as 55 m rand ( Â£3 m ) .
Her fledgling Agang SA party looks set be swallowed up by the DA , leaving some members with a sense of betrayal .
Nomboniso Gasa , an academic who introduced Ramphele to the media at an Agang SA launch event nearly a year ago , expressed disappointment at her U - turn : "" I do think Mamphela has been extremely untidy in the way she 's dealt with this .
I do n't think she 's been as open as she could have been .
It raises questions about how she understands political leadership and it makes me uncomfortable .
She has a problem of credibility because she told people one thing
and she 's doing a completely different thing .
""
A survey by Ipsos published earlier this month showed the ANC 's national support dropping to 53 % , with the DA rising to 18 % and Julius Malema 's Economic Freedom Fighters on 4 % .
Agang SA polled only 1 % ."
2014-05-03,"Nicholas Ngonyama gazes across the valley and his eye settles on a palatial cluster of sand - coloured buildings whose thatched roofs glow in the autumn sunshine .
"" I 'm not happy , "" mutters the homeless , jobless man .
"" The country is not happy .
Too much money was spent on one man 's home .
That money could have been spent improving the lives of the people .
It feels like he is spitting in our face . ""
President Jacob Zuma 's personal Xanadu , complete with stately pleasure - dome , has imposed itself on the landscape of one of South Africa 's poorest areas , Nkandla , in KwaZulu - Natal .
It covers the equivalent of eight and a half football pitches and has swallowed 246 m rand ( Â£13.7 m ) of taxpayers ' money . ""
Nkandlagate "" has become the defining scandal of Zuma 's five - year reign and left him fighting for his political life in this week 's elections .
"" Chances are slim that the majority of people here will vote for him , "" says Ngonyama , 46 , whose children live with his parents since he lost his home to a fire in 2009 .
His home is a shack without water and he looks with disbelief on Zuma 's folly .
"" We do n't have houses .
We ca n't even begin to explain the reasoning behind the expenditure of such an amount of money for one man . ""
The Nkandla affair is seen by many as the ultimate symbol of an African National Congress that is rotten to the core .
Abusing public funds to build private mansions was once the preserve of kleptocrats elsewhere in Africa , such as Mobutu Sese Seko in Congo or Jean - BÃ
© del
Bokassa in the Central African Republic .
South Africa , under founding president Nelson Mandela , believed it was different .
But the spiralling costs at what was once billed as Zuma 's Camp David prompted rival politicians to lay criminal charges and call for his impeachment .
One commentator described it as "" worse than Watergate "" .
The president has repeatedly insisted that he paid for the buildings from his own pocket , but South Africa 's public protector accused him of unethical conduct and told him to repay the costs of a swimming pool , amphitheatre , visitor centre , cattle enclosure and chicken coop , all built as part of a state - funded upgrade .
So far there is no sign of him doing so .
The sprawling homestead is a jarring sight in one of the world 's most unequal societies .
It was described as "" opulence on a grand scale "" by the public protector , who remarked that it "" leaves one with the impression of excessive and unconscionable ' Rolls - Royce ' security constituting an island in a sea of poverty and paucity of public infrastructure "" .
Allister Sparks , a columnist on Business Day , wrote : "" Nkandlagate is about personal greed and moral shamelessness .
It is about looting public money so that one man and his family can live in extravagant opulence for the rest of their lives â€ “ amid some of his people 's most abject poverty . ""
Indeed , since I last visited this remote village five years ago on the eve of Zuma 's election , precious little has changed : donkeys and cows graze by the roadside , boys in ragged T - shirts wield sticks , and modest mud - brick dot the hills .
Precious little , that is , except the luxury residence with its helipad , bulletproof windows and three - metre - high military - grade security fence , which looked like a construction site in 2009 but is now fit for a king .
Back then , Zuma was regarded with hope : an impoverished Zulu herd boy and former inmate of Robben Island
, he had risen to become the most powerful man in Africa .
Singing , dancing and showing the common touch , he appeared to be a breath of fresh air after the aloof , donnish , pipe - smoking Thabo Mbeki .
To critics , the Nkandla estate therefore represents a betrayal of the people all the more painful as they contemplate how the millions could have been spent for general benefit .
Of 114,416 people living in the area , about 40 % are unemployed .
Only 10,000 households have electricity , 7,000 have no access to piped water and 12,000 rely on pit toilets .
On Friday , watched by guards in red T - shirts with rifles , residents gathered for a meeting in a white marquee on a hill overlooking Zuma 's homestead .
Arthur Thamsanqa Ntuli , mayor of Nkandla , thought about 90 % of those present were jobless .
"" We also have a lot of people who do not get water , "" he said .
"" Even when there are pipes , sometimes people go a month without water .
And we still have large areas where there is no electricity .
The people of Nkandla , 20 years after the beginning of democracy , are still left behind in terms of the provision of services required .
"" Where there is any money available , I wish it could be used to provide water and electricity , improve education by building libraries and laboratories , provide orphans with bursaries and create job opportunities for Nkandla people . ""
Ntuli , a member of Mangosuthu Buthelezi 's Inkatha Freedom Party ( IFP ) , said the ANC had lost a local byelection after the Nkandlagate scandal broke .
"" The fact that his municipality is led by the IFP is evidence that the majority in Nkandla have decided to turn their backs on the president and the ANC .
The way people vote in national elections is often different , but we hope the ANC wo n't get the same as in 2009 . ""
Some fear to speak out against Zuma in a province with a long history of violence ; according to crime researcher David Bruce , there have been more than 100 assassinations here in the past decade .
Sthandiwe Hlongwane , who lives a short walk from the estate , says : "" I can not comment on the situation because that could be risky for me .
It could put my life in danger .
"" There are people supporting Julius Malema [ leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters party ] but they are n't coming out .
They say the only way to do it is go to the polls .
They are scared to come out in public . ""
Hlongwane was the beneficiary of a publicity stunt in January when Malema and his colleagues built her a house .
Thirty ANC supporters were arrested after throwing stones and water bottles at their rivals when it was handed over .
Although she still lacks running water and uses an outdoor toilet , she is grateful for the upgrade .
"" It 's made a big difference , "" says Hlongwane , 31 , who has children aged five and seven .
"" I used to live in a mud house .
This has made it easy for me to live .
I 'll vote for Julius Malema .
If you look after me , I 'll have to look after you , and that 's what Malema did . ""
But there are still plenty of yellow ANC T - shirts in evidence in Nkandla , and Zuma 's face adorns countless lamp - posts .
KwaZulu - Natal was the only province where the party 's share of the vote increased in 2009 and , with the IFP a fading force , this stronghold could be decisive in pushing the ANC towards a two - thirds majority .
Zuma , who won the last election just after more than 700 bribery and corruption charges were dropped against him , has shown his powers of survival .
But elsewhere , in urban centres and among the middle class , Nkandlagate follows him like a shadow .
Dali Mpofu , a lawyer and lifelong ANC member who defected to the Economic Freedom Fighters , says : "" In all the rallies that we go to , I make a point of not always talking about Nkandla , but people almost force you to because it 's a big issue for people on the ground .
"" It 's a simple issue of if one person can have a 250 m rand house while they are living in the shack , obviously that ca n't be just a ' by the way ' issue .
The premier of Gauteng [ province ] this weekend said that they get asked this whenever they do their door - to - door campaigns , and I have no doubt that she 's right about it .
"" The saga has also split the ANC .
Some party stalwarts have even asked people to vote tactically against it , either by voting for a small party or spoiling their ballot .
Addressing a room packed with mineworkers and the unemployed in Johannesburg last week , Ronnie Kasrils , a former intelligence minister , said : "" We are saying that what is more important than the party is the ideas of the party , and it 's the ideas that we are defending . ""
If the party forgets such ideas , then we will stand against that and we will stand with our people who are demanding what we have promised them all our lives
â€ “ a better life .
So after 20 years yes , of achievements , of a right to vote and so on , we can not stand idly by when we see these crimes of corruption and murder . ""
On Sunday the 72-year - old Zuma will make his case in a speech at the ANC 's final election rally , hoping to avoid a repeat of the unprecedented booing he received at the same stadium during Mandela 's memorial service .
While the party is assured of a fifth consecutive victory on Wednesday , if it polls less than 60 % of the vote , senior ANC figures â€ “ who have spent much of the campaign finding ways to apologise â€ “ will probably be panicked into wielding the dagger against him .
Should he fall , his likely successor is Cyril Ramaphosa , set to become deputy president after this week 's election .
Once a firebrand miners ' leader , he went into business and was serving on the board of platinum producer Lonmin at the time of the police massacre of mineworkers at Marikana in 2012 .
Soon after he was criticised for bidding 19.5 m rand for a prize buffalo and calf at a nearby auction .
Kasrils and old comrades who fear that the ANC 's elite are losing their working - class credentials will have found little consolation last week when Ramaphosa addressed the media in an Edwardian - era mansion framed by Tuscan colonnades and Palladian windows , built to entertain the mining Randlords of Johannesburg .
"" My great ambition is to be president of a golf club where I am playing , "" he teased .
"" That is my greatest dream .
I 'd like to be president of that .
"" I 'd also like to be president of my fishing club .
I go fishing , and there is a club that I belong to .
I want to be president of that .
That is the sum total of my ambitions , to be president of one of the two .
No other ambition do I have . """
2014-05-05,"Jacob Zuma , the president of South Africa , has described how his wife was raped by burglars more than a decade ago as he sought to justify the use of public funds to upgrade security at his private home .
Critics seized on the remarks , describing them as inappropriate in a country where millions of women have no protection from sexual violence .
Zuma gave a long , testy and unapologetic speech defending the 246 m rand ( Â£13.73 m ) of state funds spent on his homestead in Nkandla in the impoverished KwaZulu - Natal province â€ “ a political scandal that has done little to dent his confidence of victory in elections on Wednesday .
Responding to a question from the Guardian during a media briefing in Johannesburg , he said the African National Congress had provided him with security throughout his career as a provincial official , deputy president and president so there was nothing out of the ordinary .
"" There were issues that had called for security , particularly in my homestead , "" he elaborated .
"" My homestead was burned twice during violence .
And secondly my wife , criminals came , raped my wife during the time I was still the MEC [ member of the executive council ] ...
[ or ] probably I had become deputy president . ""
So the issue of security at Nkandla has not been a theoretical issue .
Further , there was a court case about it .
So those who say you need security , it 's not because it 's just a normal thing .
Two serious incidents had happened to my home .
One , burning it , not once , twice . ""
Second , break in by criminals , raping my wife , they were arrested , charged , convicted .
And people who are in government , once Zuma became the president , they had to raise the level of security to that one of a president .
I do n't think there 's anything abnormal about it . ""
The rape incident was known to many South African journalists but not made public because of laws protecting the identity of rape victims .
But in 1998 , the national broadcaster SABC did report that Zuma 's wife was sexually assaulted when a group of men broke into their home before stealing with some of the family 's belongings .
A traditional Zulu polygamist , Zuma did not say which of the four wives he had at the time was the victim .
One has since committed suicide , while he has divorced fellow politician Nkosazana Dlamini - Zuma , now chairperson of African Union .
Zuma himself was tried and acquitted of rape in 2006 .
The president 's revelation just before an election was condemned as opportunistic and cynical in some quarters .
Natasha Joseph , a journalist at South Africa 's City Press newspaper , tweeted : "" Rape is a horrific crime â€ “
I sincerely hope President Zuma does not use it to justify huge HUGE tax money spend on his home . ""
William Gumede , a political academic and biographer , said : "" We want the president to talk about the high level of violence but this is not the right way .
He is saying the right thing for the wrong reason .
"" Only the president gets protection but the ordinary grassroots members and supporters do n't .
Instead of saying : ' I will fight for the ordinary voter in townships and informal settlements , ' he 's saying : ' I need protection . '
I think it 's inappropriate . ""
Mark Peach , communications director of Agang SA , a party led by struggle stalwart Mamphela Ramphele , said : "" What is disturbing is the possibility that Zuma is using rape â€ “ a serious problem in this country â€ “ to try to generate some sympathy for what is clearly a massive case of maladministration and in some instances , corruption , in his government . ""
In March , a report by South Africa 's public protector found Zuma had unduly benefited from the security upgrades .
It accused him of unethical conduct and told him to repay the costs of a swimming pool , amphitheatre , visitor centre , cattle enclosure and chicken coop at the homestead ."
2014-05-06,"Confident , defiant and a little indignant in his final campaign appearance , President Jacob Zuma has predicted that the African National Congress will win overwhelmingly when 25 million South Africans go to the polls on Wednesday .
Nearly 2,000 military personnel will help oversee 22,263 voting stations in the country 's fifth election since the end of white minority rule .
The ANC juggernaut is widely predicted to crush 28 rival parties nationally , though it seems likely to fall short of a two - thirds majority .
Zuma would follow Thabo Mbeki as only the second president in democratic South Africa to serve two terms .
Nelson Mandela stepped down in 1999 after one term , while Kgalema Motlanthe was in office for eight months as interim president .
A former cattle herder , freedom fighter and Robben Island
prisoner , 72-year - old Zuma has proved himself the great survivor of post - apartheid politics .
He was tried and acquitted of raping a family friend , sacked by Mbeki as deputy president and has faced more than 700 charges of racketeering , corruption , money laundering and fraud .
In the past year alone he was pilloried for spending millions of taxpayers ' money on his rural homestead and was booed on live television during a memorial service for Mandela last December .
Yet the teetotaller , a traditional Zulu with four wives and 21 children , has outsmarted and outmanoeuvred every political rival to retain an iron grip on the governing party .
Speaking off the cuff at a media briefing in Johannesburg on Monday , Zuma was at once charming but unusually feisty and pugnacious .
He repeatedly told the assembled journalists how they could do their jobs better .
He betrayed no hint of self - doubt and did what critics say he has done masterfully throughout his career : portrayed himself as a victim .
For example , while political rivals claim that South Africa has lost 94bn rand ( Â£3.6bn ) to corruption since Zuma took office in 2009 , the president sought to turn the tables . ""
Before 1994 nobody talked about corruption in this country , and there was a lot of corruption , "" he said .
"" The ANC was the first organisation to talk about corruption : there is corruption , we 're going to fight it . ""
If you talk about corruption in South Africa , only the ANC is doing something about corruption â€ ¦ All others , including you guys , you write about it , you talk about it , you criticise it , but you do nothing about it .
The ANC does something about it . ""
He added : "" Now , I always say , but what 's happening in this country ?
Instead of people saying : ' Thanks ANC , you started a war against corruption and you are fighting it ' , you say this organisation is corrupt .
But that is deliberate misinforming yourselves and the country .
The ANC is fighting corruption â€
¦
If I was a journalist , I would have a special column to talk about this matter , to clarify the matter for the people of this country . ""
He was equally combative on the controversy surrounding 246 m rand ( Â£14 m ) worth of state - sponsored security upgrades at his home in Nkandla , KwaZulu - Natal province .
Public protector Thuli Madonsela said Zuma had benefited unduly from the excessive upgrades to his Nkandla home , which included a chicken coop , amphitheatre and swimming pool .
But again , he claimed , he was the victim of media misrepresentation .
"" I 'm a citizen and I 'm sure I also need protection .
And if the public protector has a duty to protect , she has to protect me as well so that I 'm not unfairly described to the public , that this is the house .
Because you make a person who does not know believe that indeed , this must be equivalent to so many millions .
"" If I was a reporter , I would have said : ' This allegation that President Zuma is corrupt , he embezzled 250 m building his house , is not correct ' , and made the headlines as you are making the headlines about the allegation .
You have not done so
and I do n't think it is a fair treatment to a citizen because you want that impression to remain .
"" Opposition parties have called for Zuma to be impeached , while commentators such as Allister Sparks have described the scandal as "" worse than Watergate "" .
Zuma 's response this week is likely to strike them as the height of arrogance .
"" I 'm not worried about Nkandla , "" Zuma continued during a long , impassioned answer .
"" I think people who 've been talking about it is you guys , the media , and the opposition .
The people are not worried about it .
Absolutely it 's not an issue with the voters , it 's an issue with the bright people .
Very clever people , it 's a big issue . ""
Zuma insisted that the buck did not stop with him , even when it came to his own home . ""
Now , I ca n't be responsible for construction , to know that so and so has inflated prices and say what are you doing here ?
It 's not my business .
Mine is to supervise the governance , not the building or construction of a house .
It 's not my duty .
Why should I be charged for it if some people inflated prices ?
I 'm running a country , I 'm not running a construction in a home .
"" Zuma 's ANC has lost the support of retired archbishop Desmond Tutu , a giant of the anti - apartheid struggle who has become increasingly critical of the party in recent years .
Yet this too was imperiously brushed aside .
"" My understanding is that bishops and pastors are there to pray for those who go wrong , not to enter into political lives , "" Zuma said .
"" Should I now stand here and oppose Tutu and go toe - to - toe with Tutu ?
I do n't think so . ""
The ANC is expected to garner 63.9 % in Wednesday 's vote , according to the latest Ipsos Mori poll , just two points less than in 2009 .
But many people are expected to stay away , disillusioned with the governing party but at a loss for a viable political alternative .
High unemployment and protests over poor service delivery will continue to dog the government after the last vote is counted .
William Gumede , a political academic and biographer , described Zuma 's attacks on the media as ridiculous , adding : "" The authority of the office of the president has been eroded under him .
The moral authority of the ANC has disappeared . """
2014-05-09,"The African National Congress ( ANC ) has brushed off political scandals and economic discontent to win a fifth consecutive South African election , results showed on Friday , although the party fell short of regaining a two - thirds majority .
With all votes counted , the ANC had a 62.2 % share of the vote , down from the 65.9 % it won in the 2009 election , according to the national election commission .
The result guarantees a second five - year term for the controversial president , Jacob Zuma .
The leading opposition party , the Democratic Alliance , was on 22.2 % , up from 16.6 % at the last elections .
Often criticised as white dominated and redolent of the apartheid era , the party said it gained 1.1 million new voters , including 700,000 votes from black South Africans .
Two new parties that have captured global media attention met very different fates at the ballot box .
The Economic Freedom Fighters , led by firebrand Julius Malema , who cites Hugo ChÃ¡vez and Robert Mugabe as inspirations , won more than 1 million votes to come in third on 6.3 % .
But Mamphela Ramphele , a former political and romantic soulmate of black consciousness founder Steve Biko , failed spectacularly .
Her party , Agang SA , launched with much fanfare last year promising to "" rekindle the South Africa of our dreams "" , secured just a fraction of a percentage point .
"" Mamphela has destroyed her political brand and value , "" Zille said on Friday .
"" She had a big brand value before voters rejected her . ""
Agang SA never recovered after Ramphele surprised her own party by agreeing to be the Democratic Alliance presidential candidate .
Her kiss for the cameras with Alliance leader Helen Zille proved to be a kiss of death â€ “ the pact collapsed within a week .
Turnout was put at 73 % of the 25 million South Africans - roughly half the population - who registered for the national and provincial elections held on Wednesday .
The Democratic Alliance achieved its best ever result , topping 4 million votes , although its growth failed to meet some expectations .
Zille said : "" We are on track to achieve our historic mission of realigning politics and unseating the ANC from national government in the next decade .
I 'm hoping that it 'll be a bit earlier than that . ""
Some analysts have called on Zille , who is white , to make way for a black opposition leader.[http://www.iol.co.za / news / for - the - da - s - sake - zille - must - step - down-1.1644800 ]
Asked if she would now step down , the former journalist replied : "" I genuinely do not know . ""
The relatively unknown African Independent Congress ( AIC ) surprised many pundits by securing nearly 100,000 votes , something which one official attributed to its similar name , similar logo and proximity to the ANC on the ballot paper .
Among the biggest losers was the Congress of the People , a party that broke from the ANC"
2014-05-26,"The South African president , Jacob Zuma , has appointed the country 's first openly gay cabinet minister , a move thought also to be a first in Africa and a symbolic step on a continent enduring a homophobic backlash .
Lynne Brown becomes the public enterprises minister in a cabinet that includes South Africa 's first black minister of finance .
Brown , 52 , who is coloured ( of mixed race ancestry ) , was born in Cape Town and was premier of Western Cape until the African National Congress ( ANC ) lost control of the province to the opposition Democratic Alliance in 2009 .
According to a 2008 profile of her by the South African Press Association , she began her career as a teacher and gained a certificate in gender planning methodology at University College London .
"" I ca n't bear working in an environment where things do n't get done , "" she was quoted as saying .
"" I 'm not a flamboyant type of person ; I get things done . ""
Her personal interests were said to be playing golf , reading and "" an admiration of arts and culture "" .
She is not seen as a gay rights activist but her ascent to a cabinet post was described on Monday as a significant moment .
Eusebius McKaiser , a broadcaster and political author , who is gay , said : "" It is , sadly , probably newsworthy , I guess , insofar as the social impact of openly gay people in high - profile public leadership positions can not be discounted in a country like South Africa where levels of homophobia , including violence against black lesbian women , remain rife . ""
The symbolism matters from an African perspective , too , given other countries around us are enacting and enforcing laws criminalising same - sex sex and lifestyles . ""
Steven Friedman , director of the Centre for the Study of Democracy , said : "" I think it 's worth drawing attention to .
She 's not a gay rights campaigner
â€ “ it 's not recognition in that sense
â€ “
but the fact that under the most socially conservative president since 1994 there is the first openly gay minister in such a position is significant .
""
South Africa was the first African country to legalise gay marriage but Zuma , a traditional Zulu polygamist , has been criticised for culturally fundamentalist remarks and failing to condemn anti - gay crackdowns in Nigeria and Uganda .
Asked by the Guardian in 2012 about his views on same - sex marriage , the president replied : "" That does not necessarily require my view , it requires the views of South Africans .
We have a constitution that is very clear that we all respect , which I respect .
It has a view on that one , that gay marriage is a constitutionally accepted thing in South Africa .
So , no matter what my views would be . ""
Zuma , 72 , who was inaugurated on Saturday for a second term , named Nhlanhla Nene as finance minister , the first black person to hold the position .
Nene , 55 , had served as deputy to the widely respected Pravin Gordhan , who is of Indian ancestry .
Nene , whose first name means "" luck "" in Zulu , is a former parliamentarian and chair of the finance portfolio committee .
He spent 15 years at the insurance firm MetLife , where he was a regional administrative manager and where , during racial apartheid , he organised the country 's first strike in the financial sector .
Razia Khan , Africa 's regional head of research for Standard Chartered Bank , said : "" Nene is an old hand at the treasury .
He will be seen to represent policy continuity . ""
Cyril Ramaphosa , a former miners ' union leader turned billionaire businessman , becomes deputy president .
But Friedman suggested he was far from certain to succeed Zuma . ""
That 's far more complicated .
He does n't like taking political risks .
The succession may revolve around some regional issues .
KwaZulu - Natal is the biggest province and they 're pushing to choose the next president .
I do n't think the other provinces will be keen on that . ""
After a punishing five - month strike in the platinum mines , the mineral resources minister , Susan Shabangu , was removed .
The police minister , Nathi Mthethwa , who was in office during the killing of 34 striking miners at Marikana in 2012 , was also shifted from his post ."
2014-10-20,"South Africaâ€ ™ s president , Jacob Zuma , has criticised Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ s defence team for arguing the Paralympian should be spared prison because he is disabled and â€œhas moneyâ€ � .
Zumaâ€ ™ s first public comments about the most closely watched trial in the countryâ€ ™ s post - apartheid history came as Pistorius , convicted of culpable homicide for the killing of Reeva Steenkamp , awaits sentencing on Tuesday .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s lawyers called expert witnesses last week to testify that South African jails are ill - equipped for disabled people because , for example , the showers lack handrails .
His lawyer warned that even in a hospital section the athlete would be exposed to diseases .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not sure why that comes into the picture ,
â€ �
Zuma told the Guardian in Pretoria .
â€œThey were taking that too far in my view .
There are people who are [ physically ] challenged in prisons ; itâ€ ™ s not an issue here .
That brings an unfortunate thing , an added thing , because a man has money.â€ �
The president added : â€œI thought that was an unfortunate debate .
You donâ€
™ t need it , because there are people who are disabled who are in prison .
Why it is raised as if he was the first one to be convicted ?
I thought they were pushing it too far.â€
� Zuma , a former inmate on Robben Island during white minority rule , said he was saddened by the fall of Pistorius â€ “ â€œa hero in a very special way , â€ � â€ “ but felt the trial had shown the strength of the judicial system .
â€œVery fair , very open .
Not just to other people but even to South Africans , because usually South Africans are not informed .
This time around , in their own houses they were informed as to how things
happen.â€
�
He also backed judge Thokozile Masipa , whose decision to clear the double amputee athlete of murder was widely attacked .
â€œThe fact that the judge says heâ€ ™ s acquitted of murder , but on culpable homicide convicted , teaches people I think something in law , that you donâ€ ™ t just say because the life was lost itâ€ ™ s a murder , â€ � he said .
â€œIt could be murder , it could be an unintended kind of thing .
I think people must have learned .
â€œThe judge was under a bit of criticism , particularly because sheâ€ ™ s a woman and women felt that she was not sympathetic to women , but sheâ€ ™ s applying the law .
So Iâ€ ™ m just saying it was an interesting lesson for us.â€ � Masipa will decide in the high court in Pretoria on Tuesday whether to meet the prosecutionâ€ ™ s demand for 10 yearsâ€
™ imprisonment , grant the defenceâ€ ™ s request for house arrest and community service , or seek a middle ground .
Either side could then appeal and prolong the case yet further .
The sentencing hearing last week focused scrutiny on South Africaâ€ ™ s ability to cope with disabled people in jails notorious for overcrowding , tuberculosis , violent gangs and allegations of torture .
Zach Modise , the acting national commissioner of the department of correctional services , told the court that it deals with 128 disabled prisoners on a daily basis , some of whom are blind , paraplegic or have had limbs partially or totally amputated .
â€œIn the continent of Africa
, there are no better facilities than those that we have in our country ,
â€ �
he said , adding that he had also visited facilities in the UK and New Yorkâ€ ™ s
Sing Sing maximum security jail and found South Africa compared favourably .
He gave assurances that Pistorius would be held in a hospital section to cater for his specific needs .
But watchdogs have raised concerns .
Ruth Hopkins , an investigative journalist at the Johannesburg - based Wits Justice Project , visited the hospital section of Pretoriaâ€ ™ s Kgosi Mampuru II prison two years ago , where the athlete is likely to be sent .
â€œI did see a number of inmates cleaning but it did seem quite rundown and understaffed , â€ � she said .
â€œThe general problem with the department of correctional services is that the legal framework is very robust and impressive but in practice itâ€ ™ s a whole different ballgame .
However , I donâ€ ™ t think Oscar Pistorius will run into a lot of problems because he has a name and connections and network and most importantly money .
Most of the cases we investigate are poor people who lack money or the ability to navigate the criminal justice system.â€ �
Golden Miles Bhudu , who spent five months in jail in 2009 , recalled seeing an inmate without legs forced to help himself get meals and left in the sun all day because he was unable to pay fellow prisoners .
â€œThe conditions for disabled people leave a hell of a lot to be desired , â€ � said Bhudu , now a spokesman for the South African Prisonersâ€ ™ Organisation for Human Rights .
â€œIt all depends how well connected outside and how rich you are .
It will be difficult if itâ€ ™ s you or me and no one knows us .
But Oscar Pistorius is a millionaire .
He will have to pay a protection fee to prisoners and some corrupt correctional officers to look after him .
Some officers will run to him to offer care and protection.â€ �
Meanwhile , on the eve of sentencing , Pistoriusâ€ ™ s siblings have spoken publicly about their anguish and unwavering support for the athlete .
His sister , Aimee , recalled the moment that she learned 29-year - old Steenkamp had been shot .
â€œWhen
I first heard what had happened obviously my initial reaction was just shock and devastation and extreme heartache ,
â€ �
she told ITV News .
â€œMy first thoughts were that knowing my brother , â€ ¦ the kind of person he is â€ ¦ he must have thought it was an intruder , before I knew the facts.â€
�
She added : â€œI do not doubt my brother at all .
I have the privileged position of knowing my brother â€
“ his strengths , his faults as you do when youâ€ ™ re as close as we are .
And yet knowing those things , I know that people who think maliciously are so far from the truth.â€
�
The family have been seen shaking their heads in court while listening to prosecutor Gerrie Nel .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s brother , Carl , said : â€œI canâ€ ™ t relate to the Oscar
thatâ€ ™ s been portrayed by the prosecution .
Oscar growing up , up until now , is the same person .
Heâ€ ™ s bold , heâ€ ™ s
brave , heâ€ ™ s got courage ,
heâ€ ™ s got charisma , heâ€
™ s exciting and fun , thoughtful and intelligent , and has been the perfect fit as a middle child between us three siblings .
â€œI believe Oscar without a reservation .
Thereâ€ ™ s not an inkling of reservation as to what I believe Oscar says â€ ¦
We can not speculate ahead of final sentencing but what I do know for certain , regardless of the outcome , the three of us will stand together and continue to stand together.â€ �"
2015-02-13,"Thabo Mbeki , the former president of South Africa , believes that his successor Jacob Zuma was wrong to duck a question in parliament that led to unprecedented chaos and a fresh round of national soul searching .
In Mbekiâ€ ™ s view , Zuma should have directly answered when asked by opposition MPs when he will repay millions in public funds spent on security upgrades at his private homestead , the Guardian has been told .
He thinks it would have been the easiest way to deal with the issue .
Instead Zuma , heckled during his state of the nation address on Thursday evening , sat down as the parliamentary speaker ordered armed security guards and police to drag the Economic Freedom Fighters kicking and fighting out of the chamber .
Several people were injured in the brawl , dubbed a national embarrassment and broadcast around the world .
Mbeki lost a bitter power struggle with Zuma in 2008 and has since offered only coded criticisms of his rival .
But addressing students at the University of South Africa in the capital , Pretoria , on Friday , the 72-year - old said : â€œI think we would all of us agree that what happened in parliament yesterday was very troubling .
â€œIâ€ ™ m sure that all of us , including the parliamentarians , never expected that such a thing would happen in parliament ...
I sat in the same hall from 1994 to 2008 and either listened to or participated in making many state of the nation addresses and nothing of the sort ever happened.â€ �
Mbeki did not make direct reference to the controversy around Nkandla , the homestead on which , anti - corruption watchdog found , 246 m rand ( Â£13.73 m ) of taxpayersâ€ ™ money was spent in a display of â€œopulence on a grand scaleâ€ � amid a sea of poverty .
But he said he felt the problem was â€œbigger than parliamentâ€ � .
In an apparent swipe at speaker Baleka Mbete for insisting that MPsâ€ ™ questions are not allowed at a state of the nation address , he continued : â€œMy reading of the problem is the problem is political , and you donâ€
™ t use administrative instruments to resolve a political problem ...
If the problem is political , youâ€ ™ re not going to change it by quoting a rule .
Youâ€ ™ ve got to confront the political problem.â€ �
Politicians are elected by the people to solve problems , he added .
â€œLetâ€ ™ s answer that question .
Letâ€ ™ s not say , â€˜Youâ€ ™ re out of order , you canâ€
™ t ask thatâ€ ™
.â€ �
Mbeki went on : â€œThereâ€ ™ s something that is politically wrong , not administratively wrong .
Letâ€ ™ s isolate it .
What is the political problem ?
Letâ€ ™ s put aside for a moment the rulebook .
If we start there , itâ€ ™ s not going to solve our problem .
Thatâ€ ™ s what I think.â€

On Friday South Africa reflected on the ugly scenes that unfolded 25 years to the week after the release from prison of its first black president , Nelson Mandela .
Zuma told a breakfast session in Cape Town : â€œOur democracy is extraordinarily user - friendly , you can do whatever you want in South Africa , itâ€ ™ s a strength , at the same time itâ€ ™ s a weakness.â€ �
But Julius Malema , leader of the EFF , said : â€œIt is a sad day that elected representatives can be beaten by police .
All of us should agree that South Africa is in a crisis .
This has put our democracy in a serious danger.â€ � Mmusi Maimane , parliamentary leader of the biggest opposition party , the Democratic Alliance , which staged a walkout over the use of armed security , said : â€œThe scenes last night inside parliamentâ€ ™ s chambers tell the story of a national embarrassment that played itself out not just here , but on news networks across the globe .
â€œThe forceful invasion of the chambers by armed police officers was a fundamental violation of the constitution , and the separation of powers between two spheres of state.â€ �
Many commentators pointed to the jamming of mobile phone signals in the parliament chamber ahead of Zumaâ€ ™ s speech , preventing journalists from filing stories and pictures , as a worrying sign of a government crackdown freedom of expression .
The influential Business Day newspaper declared in a front - page headline : â€œChaos sign of SAâ€ ™ s democratic decline.â€ �
It argued : â€œUnthinkable less than five years ago , the disturbing scenes that unfolded in and outside the national assembly last night are cause for SA to pause and reflect on why and how the country has arrived at this point .
SA is in the mess that played out in parliament precisely because it has prioritised acquiescence to executive sensibilities over the critical need to do what is right.â€ �"
2015-02-19,"Jacob Zuma , the president of South Africa , is under official investigation for using hate speech against a man who died 338 years ago .
Complaints have been lodged with a human rights watchdog after Zuma blamed South Africaâ€ ™ s ills on the countryâ€ ™ s first white settler , Jan van Riebeeck , a Dutch administrator who opened the way for European colonisation .
â€œYou must remember that a man called Jan van Riebeeck arrived here on 6 April 1652 , and that was the start of the trouble in this country , â€ �
Zuma reportedly told a recent fundraising dinner in Cape Town .
â€œWhat followed were numerous struggles and wars and deaths and the seizure of land and the deprivation of the indigenous peoplesâ€ ™ political and economic power.â€ �
Van Riebeeckâ€
™ s arrival â€œdisrupted South Africaâ€ ™ s social cohesion , repressed people and caused warsâ€ � , he said .
The comments , and the backlash against them , illustrate how a tormented racial history dating back centuries is in constant tension with the aspiration of a â€œrainbow nationâ€ � .
The opposition Freedom Front Plus ( FF Plus ) party , representing Afrikaner interests , accused Zuma of causing polarisation and lodged a charge of hate speech with the South African Human Rights Commission ( SAHRC ) .
Pieter Mulder , leader of the FF
Plus , said Zuma was resorting to â€œscapegoat politicsâ€ � .
He told parliament on Wednesday : â€œThe honourable president says a man called Jan van Riebeeck arrived here , and that was the start of problems in the country .
I can prove the president is wrong .
But what did he say in plain language ?
He said , when white people arrived here the trouble started .
â€œWhat is the understanding of ordinary ANC supporters ?
They understand that if one gets rid of the white man , all problems are solved .
Get rid of the cockroaches and all problems go away.â€
�
The SAHRC confirmed that it is investigating the FF Plus complaint and two other complaints of hate speech against Zuma .
â€œWe have accepted these complaints and have started with the investigation , â€ � its spokesperson Isaac Mangena said .
Van Riebeeck , working for the Dutch East India Company , founded the settlement at the southern tip of Africa that became Cape Town .
The day of his arrival used to be a public holiday known as Founderâ€ ™ s Day , but was abolished by the new democratic government in 1994 .
Van Riebeeckâ€ ™ s face also used to adorn the national currency , the rand , which now bears the image of the first black president , Nelson Mandela .
Dave Steward , the executive director of the FW de Klerk Foundation , wrote last month :
â€œThe anti - Jan van Riebeeck campaign is yet another example of the disturbing and increasingly overt anti - white posture of the president and the ANC .
Indeed , the ANCâ€ ™ s core programme , its â€˜national democratic revolutionâ€ ™ , is the continuation and completion of its â€˜liberationâ€ ™ struggle against white South Africans whom it views as â€˜antagonistsâ€ ™
.â€ �
Zuma stuck to his guns on Thursday during a state of the nation debate .
â€œIt is history , â€ � he told parliament in Cape Town .

I said that Jan van Riebeeck landed here our problems began â€ ¦ itâ€ ™ s a historic fact .
Wars happened , people were removed .
It is written down , itâ€ ™ s not me concocting it.â€
�
The president reiterated , however , his commitment to Mandelaâ€ ™ s vision of a non - racial society , insisting that there had never been an intention to drive white people out of the country .
â€œIâ€ ™ ll never be racist .
I fight against those who suppress minorities.â€ �
Zuma appeared calm , and earned social media plaudits for a statesmanlike performance during his speech , after a week of personal and political turmoil in South Africa .
His state of the nation address last Thursday descended into chaos and fisticuffs when armed security were called to remove the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters ( EFF ) after they raised questions over lavish public spending on Zumaâ€ ™ s rural homestead .
There was also an uproar over the use of a jamming device that blocked journalistsâ€ ™ mobile phone signals .
Zumaâ€ ™ s predecessor , Thabo Mbeki , claimed he had mishandled the situation , and in parliament this week Mmusi Maimane , the parliamentary leader of the Democratic Alliance , delivered a scathing verdict .
â€œFor you , honourable president , are not an honourable man .
You are a broken man , presiding over a broken society .
You are willing to break every democratic institution to try and fix the legal predicament you find yourself in , â€ � he said .
Zumaâ€ ™ s ally Baleka Mbete , the speaker of the national assembly , was forced to apologise after describing the EFF leader Julius Malema as a â€œcockroachâ€ � , a word that to many ears had grim echoes of the Rwandan genocide ."
2015-03-11,"Jacob Zuma , the president of South Africa , is facing calls to apologise after proposing that teenage parents be separated from their babies and banished to Robben Island , notorious as a jail during the apartheid era .
Zuma , whose political career has been punctuated by gaffes about women and gay people , was responding to a debate on his annual address to traditional leaders when he referred to teenage parents .
â€œThey must be taken and be forced to go to school , far away , â€ � he was quoted as saying by the South African Press Association ( Sapa ) .
â€œThey must be educated by government until they are empowered and they can take care of their kids ; take them to Robben Island or any other island , sit there , study until they are qualified to come back and work to look after their kids.â€ � Robben Island , off Cape Town , has a tortuous history including spells as a leper colony , quarantine station , mental hospital and political prison that incarcerated Nelson Mandela and Zuma himself during white minority rule .
It now hosts a museum and has a small resident population .
The president acknowledged that he came under fire when he first expressed such views during his election campaign six years ago .
But allowing teenagers to leave school was proving an untenable burden on society and the welfare state , he added .
â€œThe women protested , â€˜I want to take their kids away from them and blah , blah , blah.â€ ™
So I kept quiet , because I was saying in no way can you have young kids being mothers of other kids and young boys being fathers of kids , they know nothing of it.â€ �
South Africaâ€ ™ s biggest opposition party called on Zuma to apologise to the nation .
Phumzile van Damme , a spokeswoman for the Democratic Alliance , said : â€œAs the holder of the highest office in the land , the president has done an embarrassing , and offensive disservice to the countryâ€ ™ s teenage pregnancy crisis and his governmentâ€ ™ s role in addressing the socio - economic problems that underpin
it.â€
�
She added : â€œThe presidentâ€ ™ s comments are devoid of any responsible solutions to curbing teenage pregnancy , which require that we adopt a whole of society approach involving all stakeholders in developing young people with the aim of producing responsible , skilled and well - resourced adults .
â€œActual prevention of teenage pregnancy is far more difficult than making wild statements about separating young mothers from their children , as President Zuma has chosen to do â€ ¦ The presidentâ€ ™ s comments are not only irresponsible , but expose a deep - seated patriarchal thinking behind his words.â€ �
As criticism mounted on social media , Zumaâ€ ™ s office issued a statement claiming he had not singled out girls for criticism .
â€œPresident
Zuma was emphasising the need for teenagers to focus on their studies and said children should not be raising children , â€ � it said .
â€œIn his remarks he referred to both boys and girls .
The statements by commentators that the president singled out girl children only for criticism with regards to teenage pregnancy is incorrect.â€ �"
2015-05-26,"An official investigation into the Marikana mine massacre will be released by the end of next month , South Africaâ€ ™ s president , Jacob Zuma , has announced .
The shootings by police in August 2012 left 34 mineworkers dead and more than 78 injured on what has been described as South Africaâ€ ™ s darkest day since the end of apartheid .
Zuma immediately announced a judicial commission of inquiry which sat for 293 days and heard evidence including claims police planted weapons on some of the dead bodies to fit a false narrative .
The commission submitted its report to Zuma at the end of March and pressure for it to be made public has grown ever since .
Zuma told parliament on Tuesday : â€œI know and appreciate the anxiety of those who are affected .
However , it would be inappropriate for me to just release the report without applying my mind sufficiently .
The report will be released before the end of next month.â€ � Members of the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters staged a silent protest in parliament by holding up pieces of paper that said â€œRelease Marikana
reportâ€ � in bold red type .
Zumaâ€ ™ s governing African National Congress welcomed the announcement .
It said : â€œThe ANC in parliament appreciates and shares the anxiety of the families and others affected by the tragic events at Marikana regarding the public release of the report .
However , it would be inappropriate and a dereliction of duty on the part of the president to unduly act hastily in his consideration of the report .
â€œWe believe that the work that the commission conducted during the course of almost three years , which culminated in this report , was thorough , careful and meticulous .
It is therefore important that the president does not unnecessarily rush in his engagement with it , but considers it comprehensively and carefully to ensure appropriate measures are taken to ensure that the tragic events at Marikana do not recur.â€ �
Despite Zumaâ€ ™ s pledge , a lawyer representing the injured and arrested victims of the police crackdown said some of them want to press ahead with a planned court action in a bid to force his hand .
Andries Nkome , who is also representing the Association of Mineworkers and Construction union , said : â€œOur clients are taking credit that they were able to get the president to commit to release the report but he is still treating them with contempt , having ignored their request for a commitment by 2 pm on Sunday and waiting to address parliament instead.â€ � His clients remain concerned that they will not have time to prepare for civil claims due to the expiry on 16 August of the three - year period in which they can be lodged .
He said : â€œSome are saying we ought to proceed with the case ...
some are saying we must push through and get a date.â€ �
Earlier , Nkome told South Africaâ€ ™ s
Star newspaper his clients were also concerned by reports that lieutenant - general Zukiswa Mbombo , the North West province police commissioner , intends to retire at the end of the month .
He said Mbombo was among those his clients held directly responsible â€œfor their physical and emotional scarsâ€ � .
He added : â€œOur clients are of the firm view that her imminent departure is largely motivated , in whole or in part , by a deliberate desire to escape the obvious consequences of her criminal and or otherwise unlawful conduct in connection with the Marikana massacre â€ ¦ the failure to release the report is also calculated to let her off the hook.â€ � Sabata Mokgwabone , a spokesman for North West police , rejected the claims .
He said : â€œThe retirement of Zukiswa Mbombo has got nothing at all to do with the Marikana commission .
Sheâ€ ™ s reached 60 years and is going on retirement.â€ �
He said he could not comment on the allegation that her conduct was criminal or unlawful and added : â€œWe will wait for the Marikana report to be released.â€ �
During her testimony , Mbombo conceded that police intervention at the mine in 2012 was a failure .
She said there were mistakes in the police communication systems used on the day of the shooting .
Nkome said his clients noted that the national police commissioner , Riah Phiyega , had been offered a different posting by Zuma .
He said : â€œThe feeling that my clients have [ is that they ] will not be able to hold them accountable because they will not be holding that office any more.â€
�
However , Zumaâ€ ™ s office has rejected Nkomeâ€ ™ s statements about Mbombo and Phiyega as â€œfalseâ€ � .
Spokesperson Harold Maloka said : â€œThe president does not manage the careers of provincial police commissioners and as such has nothing to do with the reported retirement .
Linking the president to this matter and insinuating that it could be linked to the processing of the Marikana report by the president is malicious and mischievous .
â€œMr
Nkome also repeated the already refuted allegations that President Jacob Zuma has met the national police commissioner , Riah Phiyega , and discussed an alternative deployment for her .
Reports of the said meeting and alleged discussions are a complete fabrication and have been refuted by the presidency .
Anyone who repeats these allegations is perpetuating a lie.â€ �
Among the questions raised by Marikana was the role of Zumaâ€ ™ s deputy , Cyril Ramaphosa , a director and shareholder of the mine owner Lonmin at the time , and whether he encouraged the police to go on the offensive .
The Marikana Support campaign , Right2Know campaign and the SA History Archive have also stepped up pressure for the immediate release of judge Ian Farlamâ€ ™ s report .
They submitted a request under the Promotion of Access to Information Act , which gives the presidency 30 days to respond .
The groups said : â€œIt has been more than two and a half years since the Marikana massacre on 16 August 2012 , and there have been no arrests made for the murder of the 34 miners who were killed while striking â€ ¦ the commission report and findings are crucial to determining the truth about what happened at Marikana , to hold those responsible for the massacre to account and ensure justice is served.â€ �"
2015-05-26,"Survivors of the Marikana mine massacre are taking the South African president , Jacob Zuma , to court in an attempt to force the release of an official investigation into the killings .
The shootings by police in August 2012 left 34 mineworkers dead and more than 78 injured on what has been described as South Africaâ€ ™ s darkest day since the end of apartheid .
Zuma immediately announced a judicial commission of inquiry which duly sat for 293 days , hearing evidence including that police planted weapons on some of the dead bodies to fit a false narrative .
The commission submitted its report to Zuma at the end of March .
But nearly two months later , after stating that he â€œis still processing the report and will release it publicly in due courseâ€ � , the president has offered no clue as to when the potentially explosive contents will be made public .
In an attempt to force Zumaâ€ ™ s hand , injured and arrested victims of the police crackdown are turning to the courts .
Last week a letter was sent to the presidency giving Zuma a deadline of 2 pm on Sunday to announce when he would release Judge Ian Farlamâ€ ™ s report .
Andries Nkome , a lawyer representing the injured miners and Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union , told South Africaâ€ ™ s
Star newspaper : â€œWe have not received a response .
We will now proceed with court papers .
We are finalising them on Monday morning and by this afternoon we will have a case number and date.â€
�
The application is expected to be made in the high court in Johannesburg .
Nkome said he feared that should the reportâ€ ™ s publication be delayed any further , his clients would not have time to prepare for civil claims which lapse on 16 August .
He wrote to Zuma : â€œSuch civil claims will be extinguished on August â€ ¦ due to the expiry of the three - year period within which such claims have to be instituted.â€ �
Nkome said his clients were also concerned by reports that Lieutenant - general Zukiswa Mbombo , the north - west province police commissioner , intends to retire at the end of the month .

2015-06-15,"The South African governmentâ€ ™ s brazen decision to bypass the high court in Pretoria and seemingly allow Omar al - Bashir , the Sudanese president accused of genocide and war crimes , to leave the country on Monday raises serious questions about the ANC - led administrationâ€ ™ s commitment to the rule of law and looks like an enormous V - sign aimed at key allies , including the US , Britain and the international criminal court .
The act of defiance by the president , Jacob Zuma â€ “ and there can be little doubt he was directly involved â€ “ places him at the head of a growing band of African leaders who argue that the ICC , which issued arrest warrants for Bashir in 2009 , is biased against Africa and has become an oppressive tool of western powers .
Zumaâ€ ™ s ostensible â€œanti - imperialistâ€ � stance will be popular in the developing world , reflecting a larger north - south split .
From Bashirâ€ ™ s point of view , his successful Houdini act marks a breakthrough in his continuing attempt to end Sudanâ€ ™ s diplomatic isolation .
The fact that he attended a prestigious African Union summit in a country that is a state party to the ICC , was granted de facto immunity from prosecution , hobnobbed with fellow pariahs such as Zimbabweâ€ ™ s Robert Mugabe and got away scot free , is one in the eye for his tormentors , principally the Americans , who continue to sanction his regime .
For the ICC , Bashirâ€ ™ s vanishing act , following his similar though less dramatic escapades in Egypt , Libya and Saudi Arabia , is a significant setback in the courtâ€ ™ s quest to establish its effectiveness and extend its reach .
It may now face a full - scale rebellion led by South Africa of many of the African countries that originally signed up to the court in droves .
The constitutional and legal issues raised by the South African governmentâ€ ™ s pre - empting of the high court are far reaching .
It is unconvincing to argue , as the government did in court , that its pre - summit offer of immunity to Bashir superseded its international obligations under the Rome statute , which created the ICC .
All state parties to the statute are obliged to cooperate fully with the court and may face UN security council sanctions if they fail to do so .
Zumaâ€ ™ s government did not just fail to cooperate .
It sent justice department lawyers to court to argue , in effect , on Bashirâ€ ™ s behalf .
It defied a direct appeal from the ICC prosecutor , who asked Pretoria â€œto spare no effort in ensuring the execution of the arrest warrantsâ€ � .
It ignored similar appeals from the US state department and the EU and raised the stakes by questioning the ICCâ€ ™ s authority .
An ANC national executive committee statement said : â€œThe African National Congress holds a view that the ICC is no longer useful for the purposes for which it was intended â€ “ being a court of last resort for the prosecution of crimes against humanity ... countries , mainly in Africa and eastern Europe ... continue to unjustifiably bear the brunt of the decisions of the ICC , with Sudan being the latest example.â€ �
In a clear dig at the US , which like China , Russia and India is not an ICC signatory and is sometimes accused of double standards , the ANC claimed â€œgross human violations committed by non - signatory countries go unpunishedâ€ � .
It called for the Rome statutes to be reviewed to ensure all UN members were subject to the same level of scrutiny .
Mondayâ€ ™ s events will increase concern in the US and elsewhere about South Africaâ€ ™ s international outlook .
In 1993 , Nelson Mandela declared that â€œhuman rights will be the light that guides our foreign policyâ€ � .
But Pretoria has often appeared to side with egregious human rights abusers , such as Mugabe .
Its UN voting record on Burma , Belarus , Cuba and Iran has aligned South Africa with authoritarian states such as China and Russia .
South Africaâ€ ™ s defiance will dismay the ICC , which is still recovering from its inability last year to pursue crimes against humanity charges against Kenyaâ€ ™ s president , Uhuru Kenyatta .
Fatou Bensouda , the ICC prosecutor , complained that her investigation had been blocked by the Kenyan authorities and suggested witnesses had been interfered with , which she claims is a problem commonly encountered elsewhere .
The ICC has also frozen inquiries in Darfur , western Sudan , where Bashirâ€ ™ s human rights crimes are alleged to have taken place , due to a lack of UN support .
Bensouda said last year that the security councilâ€ ™ s lack of foresight had hurt the people of Darfur .
This failure â€œreflects badly not just on the international justice system of which the ICC is only a part , but it also greatly undermines the credibility of this council as an instrument of international peace and securityâ€ � , she said .
The ICC has nine situation investigations under way at present , all in Africa .
Responding to criticism that its focus is too narrow , or even racist , it has since launched preliminary inquiries into alleged crimes in Ukraine , Palestine , Iraq and Honduras .
Bensouda argued recently that this growing caseload demonstrated the courtâ€ ™ s increased effectiveness .
She said : â€œThis is testament to the ever growing legitimacy of the court ...
this shows how in less than 15 years of existence , the court has managed to establish itself as a credible , professional , independent instrument.â€ �
Bensouda said the ICC would be expanding its remit to include childrenâ€ ™ s rights and sexual and gender - based crimes .
Speaking before the case of Bashir in South Africa arose , Bensouda admitted big problems remained over perceptions of the ICCâ€ ™ s judicial independence .
She said : â€œThere is a continuous need to shield the court from politicisation at national and international levels .
The court has to be allowed to carry out its mandate impartially and independently , without fear or favour.â€ �"
2015-06-16,"Something much greater than just South Africaâ€ ™ s reputation as a human rights leader on the African continent died on Monday .
When Sudanâ€ ™ s President Omar al - Bashir was allowed to escape the country in a private jet â€ “ in defiance of a domestic court order and international law â€ “ Nelson Mandelaâ€ ™ s democracy stood in solidarity with the Big Men of the African Union , who have declared the international criminal court ( ICC ) a racist organisation that targets Africans for trial .
The events unfolded like a John le CarrÃ © novel : just minutes before South Africaâ€ ™ s president Jacob Zuma delivered his opening address on Sunday to the African Union summit in the glitzy Sandton Convention Centre in Johannesburg , the Pretoria High Court ordered that the government should ensure that Bashir could not leave the country .
But incredibly , the government managed to â€œloseâ€ �
the Sudanese president , insisting for hours after he took off at 11.46am on Monday that it did not know whether he had left or not , claiming that he may have gone shopping .
Bashir was indicted in 2009 by the ICC for alleged genocide and war crimes in Darfur .
Allowing him to escape was a kick in the face of the 400,000 people who have died in the ongoing conflict â€ “ and the 2.5 million who have been displaced .
Over the past few years pressure from African leaders criticising the ICC has grown , with many claiming its cases target African leaders only .
In December Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni , who has been in power since 1986 , said the ICC was a â€œtool to targetâ€ � Africa .
Rwandaâ€ ™ s president Paul Kagame has accused the court of â€œselectiveâ€ � justice .
This is in some sense true : since its establishment in 2002 , the ICC has heard 22 cases and indicted 32 individuals .
All of them are African .
South Africa , though a signatory to the Rome Statute through which the court was established , has lately joined this chorus , with the governing ANC saying on Saturday : â€œThe ICC is no longer useful for the purposes for which it was intended â€ “ being a court of last resort for the prosecution of crimes against humanity.â€ � While this stance may have endeared the country to the rest of the African Union â€ “ where it seeks to be a significant player â€
“
it reveals a troubling contradiction : signatory to the Statute on the one hand , while flirting with those who seek to defy its precepts on the other .
But this isnâ€ ™ t the first time the country has displayed its ambivalence towards the ICC :
in 2010 South Africa invited Bashir to the now scandal - mired World Cup , attracting plaudits from some on the continent and gaining street cred for shaking its fist at the west .
Big men Many South Africans arenâ€ ™ t surprised by the weekendâ€ ™ s events .
Over the past seven years the country has sided with the dodgiest leaders in the world in the name of â€œthe national interestâ€ � .
The authorities have refused the Dalai Lama a visa to enter South Africa at the invitation of Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other Nobel laureates at least three times at the behest of China , with whom we have signed a 10-year agreement pledging â€œpolitical mutual trust and strategic co - ordinationâ€ � , while President Zuma is having a full - on bromance with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin , remaining silent about the Kreminâ€ ™ s alleged assassination of opposition politicians .
Robert Mugabe , accused of the murder of thousands of his own citizens in the 1980s and the torture of many more in the 2000s , was wined and dined on a state visit here a few months ago .
And Bashir ?
South Africa has defended him since the ICC issued its first warrant for his arrest in 2009 , under the guise of building ties with the African Union .
In effect , the South African government has broken its own laws and acted in defiance of a court order .
A government lawyer , William Mokhari , told the court that Bashirâ€ ™ s departure will be fully investigated .
But that is academic .
The government did nothing to arrest him .
Politically , this much we know : by protecting Bashir and letting him escape , our country has openly taken sides with the Africaâ€ ™ s tyrants , and not their victims ."
2015-08-11,"The South African president , Jacob Zuma , has angered conservationists in neighbouring Zimbabwe by speculating that the experienced hunter who killed Cecil just saw a â€œnice lionâ€ � and was unaware of the animalâ€ ™ s importance .
Walter Palmer , a dentist from Minnesota in the US , has claimed he was led to believe the hunt that ended in the lionâ€ ™ s death was legal and he had no idea the big cat was â€œa known , local favouriteâ€ � and part of a research study .
Zuma appeared to sympathise with Palmerâ€ ™ s defence when questioned by the Guardian at a press conference in the South African capital , Pretoria , on Tuesday .
He said : â€œWhat it sounds like from a distance [ is ] that the hunter did not know that Cecil was so popular , just saw a lion , and killed a lion , and itâ€ ™ s Cecil , and Cecil is very well loved and it caused a problem , because everyone wants to go and see Cecil .
I think itâ€ ™ s just an incident.â€ �
Prompting laughter in the room , Zuma quipped : â€œI was told by somebody that there is a brother of Cecil .
Who ?
There is Jericho .
Thanks God , now people will ask if Jericho is among these lions and they will not shoot , I would imagine .
â€œReally I didnâ€ ™ t think it could become such a big issue , but it is a big issue because Cecil was loved .
But I think maybe that the fellow did not know .
And he just took a nice lion and it was Cecil.â€ �
Zuma did not respond to a question about South Africaâ€ ™ s own hunting laws .
He said earlier : â€œI was wondering , what is the surname of Cecil ?
But that wouldnâ€ ™ t get an answer .
Well , I think Zimbabwe has laws about hunting and everything ...
Itâ€ ™ s a matter that Zimbabweans can deal with the hunters .
In every country there is hunting , there are rules , etc.â€ �
The jocular tone contrasted with that of the Zimbabwean president , Robert Mugabe , who on Monday castigated the â€œvandals who come from all overâ€ � to hunt , and the UK environment minister , Rory Stewart , who described the killing of Cecil as a â€œdeeply horrifying situationâ€ � and a â€œdisgusting actionâ€ � .
The hunt early last month provoked a worldwide backlash when it emerged that Cecil was a popular attraction among visitors to the Hwange national park and was wearing a tracking collar as part of an Oxford University research project .
Zumaâ€ ™ s remarks were swiftly condemned in Zimbabwe on Tuesday .
Emmanuel Fundira , the president of the Safari Operators Association of Zimbabwe , said : â€œIâ€ ™ m surprised that President Zuma would make a such a comment with regard to an animal hunted in a neighbouring country .
I find it very undiplomatic and very unfair to comment on a sovereign state.â€ �
Fundira insisted Palmer knew what he was doing when he shot Cecil with a bow and arrow just outside a protected area .
He said : â€œHe has hunted lion before and itâ€ ™ s clear he was looking for a lion with a unique and bigger mane .
Cecil was a known icon in Zimbabwean tourism .
As far as Iâ€ ™ m concerned , this was definitely premeditated poaching .
It was unethical.â€ �
Johnny Rodrigues , the chairman of the Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force , said of Palmer :
â€œI donâ€ ™ t believe he didnâ€ ™ t realise .
He knew he was there and he was after the trophy .
Itâ€ ™ s a very feeble excuse .
He would have known it was the wrong place to go and shoot .
He canâ€ ™ t turn around and say , â€˜I didnâ€ ™ t knowâ€ ™ .
Thatâ€ ™ s no excuse at all.â€ � Responding to the South African
presidentâ€ ™ s comments , he said : â€œZuma can say what he likes .
Everyone is entitled to their opinion.â€ �
Palmer , a seasoned trophy hunter , became the target of abuse over the incident and went into hiding after protests outside his dental practice .
Police in south - west Florida said last week that vandals had spraypainted the words â€œlion killerâ€ � on the garage door of his holiday home .
Palmer has apologised for killing Cecil and appeared to blame Theo Bronkhorst , the Zimbabwean hunter who led the expedition , for misleading him .
Bronkhorst has been charged with failing to prevent an illegal hunt and , if convicted , faces up to 15 years in prison .
His trial has been set for 28 September ."
2015-10-02,"A satirical artwork apparently depicting â€œthe presidentâ€ ™ s penisâ€ � has been condemned as racist by the South African government .
Anton Kannemeyerâ€ ™ s cartoon , R is for Respect , shows a giant black penis and scrotum hovering above a group of angry black demonstrators carrying a banner that demands :
â€œRespect for the presidentâ€ ™ s penis now!â€
�
The image is a reference to the 2012 controversy over another painting , The Spear by Brett Murray , which portrayed President Jacob Zuma with exposed genitalia and led to a protest march , court case and national debate around black African identity and the right to freedom of speech .
Kannemeyer , who is white , recalled : â€œAt the time there was this whole furore , there were people toyi - toying [ a protest dance ] in the streets , really upset about the fact that the presidentâ€ ™ s penis was drawn , and I remember at the same time in the newspapers there was an article saying that 75 or so primary school black children , girls , were pregnant .
â€œOne of the things mentioned during this time was that we donâ€ ™ t talk about the black manâ€ ™ s penis .
So I have a right to talk about the white manâ€ ™ s penis but not the black manâ€ ™ s penis , â€ � he said .
â€œI think that sounds like censorship and not the kind of thing I should do .
I think R is for respect , respect for the presidentâ€ ™ s penis now , and it must be drawn.â€
�
Asked if he feared a political backlash like that seen against The Spear , Kannemeyer replied :
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know what the presidentâ€ ™ s penis looks like so I can not really draw it .
I can just draw a symbolic penis ; thatâ€ ™ s really what it is .
â€œI hope
thereâ€ ™ s not a backlash .
I think itâ€ ™ s a work that investigates that work .
I hope the debate doesnâ€ ™ t stop there .
People need to talk about these things.â€ � Kannemeyer is known for his controversial explorations of ethnicity and politics .
His show , E is for Exhibition , which opened at Johannesburgâ€ ™ s Stevenson gallery on Thursday , features mockery of Zuma and the former president Thabo Mbeki as well as an image of a wheelchair - bound rugby star beside a masturbating Jesus .
A cartoon of the paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius , kneeling on a running track with the South African flag , is entitled M is for Murder and Mayhem â€
“ Pistorius was cleared of murdering his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , but convicted of culpable homicide .
But it was R is for Respect , a 217 cm x 150 cm black ink and acrylic work , that earned a swift rebuke from the government .
Buti Manamela , deputy minister in the presidency , said : â€œWe donâ€ ™ t have time for bigotry and what clearly is racism being projected as art .
Hopefully the artist feels good about himself and I donâ€ ™ t think we want to be preoccupied with this when the country has far more important concerns.â€ � Manamela , who three years ago threatened to close down the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg for displaying The Spear , added : â€œIf you want to ridicule the leadership of the country , thatâ€ ™ s your privilege .
Itâ€ ™ s quite sickening.â€ �
Others joined the condemnation .
Charl Blignaut , arts editor at the City Press newspaper , said : â€œPersonally , I regard the work as racist .
And , yes , it makes a considerable difference that the artist is white .
â€œOf all the ways to criticise president Zuma , of all the symbols to pick , this is the most problematic because itâ€ ™ s a trope
â€ “ the rampant black penis â€ “ that plays into a painful history of not only the exoticisation of the black male body but also the fear of the virile black male that subconsciously drove so much of apartheid policy , alcohol and drug legislation , and separationist philosophy .
â€œIt both fetishises and emasculates the black man , while neatly stereotyping him too , â€ � he said .
Eusebius McKaiser , an author and columnist , said : â€œThis work is simply weak from an aesthetic viewpoint .
It is neither elegantly plain nor textured with new , fresh , layered meaning .
â€œIts aim â€ “ to critically engage popular opposition to The Spear â€ “ is laudable .
But the execution is limp â€ “ pardon the pun .
So the work raises no interesting moral or aesthetic questions .
It is simply an unimaginative restatement of well - rehearsed criticism.â€ �
The Spear by Brett Murray , who is also white , caused uproar when it was exhibited .
Zuma and the governing African National Congress took the Goodman Gallery to court and the painting was eventually defaced by protesters .
Bitter arguments raged over whether it was legitimate political satire at a presidentâ€ ™ s expense or should be viewed in the context of the denigration of black bodies and dignity over centuries .
On Friday Murray came to Kannemeyerâ€ ™ s defence .
â€œEvery artist will have their own limit and should be able to push the envelope , â€ �
he said .
â€œThey should be able to do that freely .
Iâ€ ™ m 100 % for freedom of expression .
As Noam Chomsky said , if you donâ€ ™ t respect freedom of expression for those you despise
, you donâ€ ™ t respect freedom of expression .
And everyone has a right to their own opinion of this work.â€ �
Murray added that the comedian Trevor Noah , the new host of the Daily Show in the US , had lampooned Zumaâ€ ™ s penis years ago but with little outcry .
â€œGlobally , when a person in a position of power has a reputation for sleeping around â€ “ Silvio Berlusconi , Bill Clinton â€ “ satirists and comedians will have a go .
Whether heâ€ ™ s
black or white doesnâ€ ™ t matter , although it certainly complicates the issue in South Africa.â€ �"
2015-10-23,"South Africaâ€ ™ s student movement has scored a big victory after plans to raise university fees were scrapped following weeks of nationwide protests that culminated in a mass gathering outside the main government offices .
The largest demonstration took place at the Union Buildings ,
South Africaâ€ ™ s
seat of government in Pretoria .
More than 10,000 people gathered on Friday to demand that proposed fee rises be scrapped , and called for the president , Jacob Zuma , to personally address their concerns .
It was the largest single student protest since the 1976 Soweto uprising â€ “ an iconic moment in the fight against South Africaâ€ ™ s apartheid regime â€ “ and participants represented a broad cross - section of the countryâ€ ™ s racial groups and political parties .
Although the presidential podium was erected twice , Zuma never appeared , choosing instead to make the announcement in the press room inside the main building .
â€œWe agreed that there will be a zero increase of university fees in 2016,â€ �
he said after a meeting with student leaders .
Universities had proposed fee rises of up to 11.5 % next year , arguing they need higher fees to keep up standards .
Zumaâ€ ™ s
non - appearance infuriated protesters .
A small minority tore up security fences , burned portable toilets and threw rocks at police .
The police responded forcefully , using teargas , rubber bullets and stun grenades to disperse the crowd .
Running battles between small groups of protesters and police continued after sunset , damaging several vehicles .
â€œItâ€ ™ s wrong .
We were invited here by the president , and weâ€ ™ ve been waiting all day .
We had to react .
We had to show the president this is serious , â€ � said Tobago Madiba , 21 , a student from the Tshwane University of Technology , his eyes closed after exposure to teargas .
The demonstration had begun peacefully , with protesters chanting and holding up signs with slogans .
When some protesters began to throw rocks , others tried to dissuade them by chanting â€œNon - violence ! Non -
violence!â€ � Student leader Mcebo Dlamini , a key organiser at the University of Witwatersrand , said students had not caused any violence .
â€œThere is no violence here .
We have seen students reacting to the brutal system of the ANC [ the ruling party].â€ � Stephen Grootes , a political commentator , said the success of the student protests posed a headache for the ANC .
â€œWhat this does reveal is the ANCâ€ ™ s inability to deal with a multiracial , multiclass and multiparty group of people who refuse to buy into the old political narrative , â€ � he said .
There were protests in most big city centres throughout the country .
Hundreds of South African and international students also attended a solidarity rally outside the South African high commission in London .
It is unclear whether the students will put their placards away and return to class on Monday .
Many were angered by the forceful nature of the police response , while others were determined to use this momentum to push for the scrapping of university fees altogether .
â€œNow we know Zuma is a coward .
Heâ€
™ s not a man .
We want more now , not just a 0 % increase .
We want free education , â€ � said Ngavatshedzo Mpepu , 24 , from the University of Pretoria ."

2016-03-17,"The South African leader , Jacob Zuma , has denied letting a family of wealthy industrialists hand out posts in his cabinet , as he battles to contain a snowballing corruption scandal that could threaten his presidency .
Ahead of a key meeting of the ruling partyâ€ ™ s leadership this weekend , a top power - broker from Zumaâ€ ™ s
own African National Congress has warned that the country risks becoming a â€œmafia stateâ€ � if corruption is not tackled .
At the heart of the controversy is the relationship between Zuma , his allies and associates , and the wealthy , influential and colourful Gupta family , who once used a military airforce base to fly in guests from India for a glitzy wedding .
On Wednesday the countryâ€ ™ s
deputy finance minister , Mcebisi Jonas , said in a public statement that members of the Gupta family had offered him the ministerial post in December , after the incumbent , Nhlanhla Nene , was abruptly sacked .
He said he had rejected the job â€œout of handâ€ � , because the offer of a cabinet post from someone outside government â€œmakes a mockery of our hard - earned democracyâ€ � .
The Guptas denied the allegation , saying it was â€œtotally falseâ€
� and â€œjust more political point scoring between rival factionsâ€ � within the ANC .
Nene , who had a combative relationship with Zuma , was instead replaced by a virtually unknown backbencher , but he lasted for less than a week .
As the rand and government bonds were battered on global markets , top ANC powerbrokers reportedly forced Zuma to backtrack and appoint an experienced former finance minister .
Jonasâ€ ™
s claim this week prompted one of the ANCâ€ ™ s top power brokers to warn that the country risked sliding into a â€œmafia stateâ€ � if a web of corruption and influence peddling that critics say has been spun around the government was not untangled .
â€œWe need to deal with this .
It will degenerate into a mafia state if this goes on , â€ � the ANC secretary - general , Gwede Mantashe , told Bloomberg .
â€œThe fact we are talking about this so boldly now shows that things are going to change.â€ �
But in a combative appearance before parliament , Zuma rejected accusations that he had delegated control of the finance ministry to the Gupta family .
â€œI am in charge of the government , I appoint in terms of the constitution ,
â€ � Zuma said , to cheers from ruling party parliamentarians .
â€œThere is no minister who is here who was ever appointed by the Guptas or by anybody else.â€ �
Jonas is not the only politician to allege the Guptas brokered top jobs in South Africa .
Former ANC member of parliament Vytjie Mentor earlier this week said in a posting on Facebook that she had been offered the post of minister of public enterprises while she was in the Gupta mansion in 2010 , when Zuma was in a nearby room .
Zumaâ€ ™ s office have denied this , Reuters reported .
Opposition party members have also claimed that the sports minister was helped into his job by the Guptas , allegations he has denied .
The Gupta family emigrated from India in 1993 , seeking business opportunities in post - apartheid South Africa , and now preside over a wide range of corporate interests from mining to IT and media .
They have denied any role in deciding any ministerial jobs .
In their statement on Wednesday they said : â€œAny suggestion that the Gupta family or any of our representatives or associates have offered anyone a job in government is totally false.â€ �"
2016-03-18,"A South African business family accused of exploiting ties with President Jacob Zuma to chose pliable candidates for top cabinet and business jobs say they have been made scapegoats for the countryâ€ ™ s economic woes , and are victims of racist hate speech .
Laying out their case in a two - page spread in a newspaper they own , the Guptas skirted allegations that they offered the finance ministerâ€ ™ s job to his deputy a few months ago , and tried to trade another cabinet post for business favours in 2010 .
Instead , under the headline â€œGupta Family : The Inconvenient Truthâ€ � , they detailed the familyâ€ ™ s history , businesses , tax contributions and role in job creation , and laid out rebuttals to other accusations .
The Guptas , who originally hail from India , arrived in South Africa soon after the collapse of the apartheid regime , convinced there would be lucrative business opportunities .
Their family IT business , originally based in a Johannesburg garage , has since grown into a conglomerate that employs several thousand people .
â€œAs the global economic slowdown began to bite , the family became the scapegoat for every calamity and misfortune that South Africa has faced , â€ � the Guptas said in a statement .
â€œWe have been quiet until now but given the recent xenophobia and hate speech against us , now is the time to set the record straight.â€ �
They said their relationship with the current president began in 2000 , long before he came to power , and they rejected all allegations of corruption .
â€œOur position remains : happy to face the consequences for any wrongdoing , hard though to deal with â€˜whispering campaign , â€ � the statement added .
The editorial came after Zumaâ€ ™ s spirited defence of his conduct in parliament on Thursday , but neither have served to contain the scandal .
On Friday the former head of South Africaâ€ ™ s state electricity firm was the latest to join the chorus of accusations of graft , saying that his departure from the post last year had been organised by the Guptas because he was not sufficiently pliable .
â€œTwo months after the appointment , they called me and said they will have me fired because I am not playing the game
, â€ �
Zola Tsotsi told the Mail and Guardian weekly newspaper .
â€œI was forced to resign shortly after that.â€ � The Gupta family â€ “ the most notable members of which are the brothers Ajay , Atul and Rajesh â€
“ has also insisted that many of the allegations against it are not evidence of corruption , but simply fallout from political infighting ahead of local elections later this year , which are already forecast to be challenging for the Africa National Congress ( ANC ) .
â€œWe play no role in the hiring and firing of anyone outside of our own business , â€ � Nazeem Howa , CEO of Oakbay
Investments â€ “ part of the Gupta business empire , told Reuters .
â€œThese allegations are nothing more than political gossip and innuendo.â€ �
But that stance has enraged many in the ANC , including its secretary general Gwede Mantashe , ahead of a key party meeting this weekend .
â€œItâ€ ™ s arrogance to the superlative degree , â€ � the BBC quoted Mantashe saying .
â€œThe threat of corporate capture is a real threat .
When you corrupt individual politicians to actually act as your proxies in the ANC to become agents of business interests then thatâ€ ™ s corporate capture.â€ � Zumaâ€ ™ s fate and his relationship to the Guptas â€ “ who have also given his son a seat on the board of several companies â€ “ is not officially on the agenda .
But it is expected to be the main focus of discussion , as the ANC grapples with its worst crisis since the 2008 dismissal of Thabo Mbeki ."
2016-03-24,"South African police have announced a corruption probe into President Jacob Zumaâ€ ™ s son Duduzane and the Guptas , a family of businessmen accused of wielding improper political influence .
A spokesman for the elite â€œHawksâ€ � police unit said it would investigate the graft allegations after a complaint was made by the Democratic Alliance ,
South Africaâ€ ™ s main opposition party .
â€œWe have received the docket in the matter between the DA and the Guptas and we are to investigate it ,
â€ � the spokesman told Talk Radio 702 .
Although the Guptasâ€ ™ relationship with Zuma has been a source of controversy for years , it burst into the open last week when senior figures went public to say the family had exerted undue sway , including offering cabinet positions .
The Guptas , whose businesses stretch from media to mining , have denied the allegations and say they are pawns in a plot to oust Zuma .
The ruling African National Congress ( ANC ) said on Sunday that it had full confidence in Zuma but would investigate the allegations by senior politicians â€ “ including the deputy finance minister , Mcebisi Jonas â€ “ that they were offered positions by the Guptas .
Zuma has acknowledged the Guptas are his friends but denies anything improper .
Zumaâ€ ™ s son , Duduzane , is a director â€ “ along with Gupta family members â€ “ of at least six companies , documents show .
The swirl of controversy has become known as â€œGuptagateâ€ � .
The South African deputy president , Cyril Ramaphosa , a powerful figure in the ruling party , was reported on Wednesday as saying that the â€œANC is not for saleâ€ � .
â€œThe ANC refuses to be captured .
Those who might want to capture the ANC and make it their own and influence it to advance personal or corporate interests , you have come to the wrong address , â€ � he was quoted by the Rand Daily Mail website as saying at an academic summit in Johannesburg .
â€œThis is going to be a defining moment , â€ �
he said .
â€œWhat is good is that the Gupta family has said that they are willing to cooperate.â€ � â€œIt is not only the Gupta family .
There are a number of others as well who have tried to capture the state , â€ � he said .

2016-03-31,"South Africaâ€ ™ s top court has ruled that the president , Jacob Zuma , failed to uphold the constitution when he ignored a state order to repay some of the government funds used in an Â£11 m upgrade to his private residence , including a swimming pool and amphitheatre .
The court also ruled that parliament , which is dominated by the ruling African National Congress , had failed in its obligations by not holding Zuma to account .
In what will be a costly judgment for Zuma in financial and political terms , the constitutional court ordered that he must personally pay back the cost of those improvements to his residence , Nkandla , that were not essential for security , including a cattle enclosure , a visitor centre and a chicken run .
The national treasury should determine the reasonable costs within 60 days , the judges ruled , with Zuma required to pay the bill just over a month later .
He has denied any wrongdoing .
Opposition parties , who referred the case to the constitutional court , have said that they will seek the presidentâ€ ™ s impeachment .
In a unanimous judgment , the 11 constitutional court justices said a damning 2014 report by the public protector , Thuli Madonsela , into the spending was legally binding and that remedial action should have been upheld .
Zuma showed a â€œsubstantial disregardâ€ � for the constitutional power of the public protector , who had ordered him to repay the public purse for the renovations , the court found .
â€œThe president is the head of state , his is the calling to the highest office in the land , he is the first citizen of this country , â€ � said the chief justice , Mogoeng Mogoeng .
â€œThe nation pins its hopes on him to steer the country in the right direction .
â€œIn failing to comply with the remedial action , the president thus failed to uphold , comply and respect the constitution .
The president may have been acting on wrong legal advice , in good faith .
But the illegality still stands.â€
�
The case was brought by Madonsela alongside the countryâ€ ™ s largest opposition parties â€ “ the Democratic Alliance and the Economic Freedom Fighters party , led by long - time Zuma rival Julius Malema .
Dozens of armed police officers , an armoured vehicle and a barbed - wire barricade were placed outside the court in Johannesburg as the judges delivered their verdict on the six - year saga .
Zuma , beleaguered by several scandals including the sacking of the finance minister , Nhlanhla Nene , which led to major protests and an economic crisis for the rand , offered to pay back some of the money on the residence last month , saying he received incorrect legal advice .
Zumaâ€ ™ s lawyer , Jeremy Gauntlett , previously admitted that the improvements to the sprawling mansion were not solely based on security concerns , as had previously been claimed by the president .
The opposition parties and Madonsela refused to withdraw the case from the constitutional court , despite Zumaâ€ ™ s admission .
Madonselaâ€ ™ s original report called for Zuma to repay the cost of upgrades to Nkandla and outlined estimates of Â£131,000 for the swimming pool and a parking garage for VIP guests , and Â£56,000 for a cattle culvert .
Zuma then refused to pay and ordered new investigations by the public works and police ministries that generally exonerated him , including one widely ridiculed that found that the swimming pool was a reservoir designed to protect against fire .
Mogoeng said the president did not challenge the public protector through due process , preferring to use the separate investigations as a shield , considering himself to be â€œlawfully
absolvedâ€ � .
In his judgment , Mogoeng praised Madonselaâ€ ™ s office , which he said should not be undermined , and described the public protector as â€œthe embodiment of a biblical David who fights the very well resourced Goliath that [ is ] the impropriety of government officialsâ€ � .
The ANCâ€ ™ s majority in the national assembly may be enough to save Zuma from any impeachment proceedings by the opposition following the ruling , but it will make it harder for those in his party to continue to support him .
Outside court , the Democratic Alliance leader , Mmusi Maimane , said Zuma should resign immediately .
â€œPresident Jacob Zumaâ€
™ s action amounts to a serious violation of the constitution , and constitutes grounds for impeachment , â€ � he said .
In his judgment , Mogoeng said parliament had a constitutional obligation to hold the president accountable and â€œeffectively flouted their obligationsâ€ � by passing a resolution nullifying the findings of the public protector and replacing them with its own findings .
â€œThis , the rule of law is dead against , â€ � the judge said , calling the resolution unlawful .
â€œIt is another way of taking the law into oneâ€ ™ s own hands.â€ �
In a statement , the ANC said it respected the unanimous judgment by the constitutional court , declaring the party had â€œfull confidence in the judiciaryâ€ � .
Malema challenged the ANC to call an early general election , not due until 2019 .
â€œParliament has failed our peopleâ€šâ€ � he told a news conference .
â€œLet South Africa elect honourable people who will uphold the constitution .
â€œWhy must we continue with failed institutions ?
This is an opportunity for South Africa to unite and remove a criminal from office.â€ �
At a press conference in Pretoria after the hearing , a smiling Madonsela said the decision was â€œbetter late than neverâ€ � .
â€œItâ€
™ s not my place to say whether or not the president is fit for office .
My job was to protect the public from improper conduct , â€ � she said .
â€œNow the constitutional court has confirmed I did my job properly
and it is someone
elseâ€ ™ s job to see what happens next .
â€œBut I would say to those who exercise public power , donâ€ ™ t reject those who disagree with you , because you might just head for a cliff if you surround yourself with people who are yes men.â€ �"
2016-03-31,"Itâ€ ™ s not a good look for a young democracy when its president is convicted in the countryâ€ ™ s highest court of failing to respect the constitution .
In finding President Jacob Zuma guilty of exactly that on Thursday , and ordering him to pay back state money spent on upgrades to his personal home , South Africaâ€ ™ s constitutional court highlighted just how wayward the countryâ€ ™ s under - fire leader has become .
The judgment was unequivocal : â€œThe President has failed to uphold , defend and respect the constitution as the supreme law of the land , â€ � said Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng , delivering the judgement at the court in Johannesburg .
But while the court verdict , delivered unanimously by a full bench , is a damning indictment of the executive , it is also a timely reminder
that South Africaâ€ ™ s
young democracy is a lot stronger than it is given credit for .
Under immense strain , its checks and balances are working .
Itâ€ ™ s not just the judiciary that is keeping things on track .
The only reason the Nkandla scandal came to light is thanks to the damning report published by public protector Thuli Madonsela in March 2014 â€ “
and it is the action recommended in it that Zuma has been found guilty of ignoring .
Another example is last yearâ€ ™ s nationwide student protests , under the # FeesMustFall banner .
They showed civil society is alive and well in South Africa â€ “ and capable of effecting real change .
After months of unrest , the department of higher education and training was forced to scrap fee increases which were not only unpopular , but also a clear violation of the spirit of the ruling African National Congressâ€ ™ commitment to free tertiary education for all .
Take also the furore which followed the abrupt sacking of finance minister Nhlanhla Nene in December .
Under immense pressure from all quarters â€ “ including other cabinet ministers , party stalwarts , prominent businesspeople , civil society organisations and the media â€ “ President Zuma was forced into a humiliating capitulation , eventually reappointing the widely respected Pravin Gordhan to lead the treasury .
Zumaâ€ ™ s close relationship with a prominent Indian business family , the Guptas , has also come under close scrutiny following claims that individuals associated with the family were dictating cabinet appointments .
These revelations , and many others about both the Guptas and corruption in government more generally , have come from a fiercely independent media , another pillar of South Africaâ€ ™ s democracy .
It is the judiciary , however , that on Thursday provided the most dramatic check on the presidentâ€ ™ s power â€ “ exactly as it is designed to do .
The court ordered Zuma to pay back a portion of the money spent on upgrades to his opulent home at Nkandla in KwaZulu - Natal province , with the amount to be determined by the treasury and approved by the court .
It could well run into the tens of millions of rands , money which Zuma may or may not have .
In the same judgment , the court had harsh words for the ruling party - dominated National Assembly , finding that it too had failed to live up to its constitutional obligations .
The criticism was fair , however it should be noted that the Nkandla case only reached the constitutional court thanks to applications lodged by the Democratic Alliance and the Economic Freedom Fighters ( EFF ) , the two main opposition parties in parliament .
â€œZumaâ€ ™ s journey ends hereâ€
¦ Zumaâ€ ™ s case ends here .
Anyone who wants to question this matter any further would be questioning the court , â€ � said EFF leader Julius Malema , reacting to the decision .
Ranjeni Munusamy , a political analyst who has written extensively about the Nkandla case , said â€œit is unprecedented to have the highest court in the land pronounce on the conduct of the head of the executive and on parliament.â€ �
â€œThis leaves South African in an unprecedented space .
While the court has spelled out what needs to be done regarding the money spent on Nkandla , itâ€ ™ s unclear whether the president can continue to serve as head of state with any form of legitimacy , â€ � Munusamy said .
This is uncharted territory for South Africa , but if the Nkandla scandal has taught us anything it is that the countryâ€ ™ s institutions , as well as the checks and balances built into its constitution , are more than capable of rising to the challenge ."
2016-04-02,"One of South Africaâ€ ™ s most revered anti - apartheid activists dramatically intervened in the growing row over President Jacob Zumaâ€ ™ s future by urging the countryâ€ ™ s embattled leader to step down .
In a development described by analysts as potentially pivotal , Ahmed Kathrada , who was jailed alongside Nelson Mandela in 1964 , called on Zuma to quit after the countryâ€ ™ s highest court ruled on Thursday that the leader had acted dishonestly over state spending on his private mansion .
In a letter addressed to the president and published on Saturday , Kathrada said the scandal that has engulfed Zumaâ€ ™ s seven - year presidency had reached the point where only his resignation would allow the government to recover from â€œa crisis of confidenceâ€ � .
Kathrada wrote : â€œIn the face of such persistently widespread criticism , condemnation and demand , is it asking too much to express the hope that you will choose the correct way that is gaining momentum , to consider stepping down?â€ �
This condemnation echoed calls for Zumaâ€ ™ s resignation from opposition parties led by the Democratic Alliance , Economic Freedom Fighters , Inkatha Freedom party ( IFP ) and the United Democratic Movement ( UDM ) , which stressed Zumaâ€ ™ s failure to even apologise unreservedly to South Africans .
UDM leader Bantu Holomisa said Zuma had given the country â€œthe middle fingerâ€ � , and IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi dismissed Zumaâ€ ™ s presidential address to the nation last Friday as â€œobfuscationâ€ � .
The opposition has launched impeachment proceedings against Zuma , but these are unlikely to prove fruitful given the large majority the African National Congress ( ANC ) has in parliament , where it holds 249 out of 400 seats in the national assembly .
Yet the response of the ANC itself to Zumaâ€ ™ s reaction has become a focus of concern for many South Africans , exposing the divide between the â€œelder
statesmenâ€
� of the party , such as Kathrada , and its younger members .
Last Friday , after the address , ANC secretary - general Gwede
Mantashe said the president had â€œhumbledâ€ � himself : â€œWe are comfortable with the fact he has apologised.â€
�
But the intervention from 86-year - old Kathrada may carry considerable weight within the party , which has governed the country since apartheid ended in 1994 .
Mandela and Kathrada were among eight ANC activists sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted of trying to overthrow the apartheid government during the 1963 - 1964 Rivonia trial .
The scandal is probably the biggest yet to hit Zuma , whose leadership has been mired with repeated accusations of wrongdoing since he took office in 2009 .
The latest revelations follow reports that the Guptas , a powerful business family close to Zuma , had a hand in choosing cabinet members .
Last month a government official claimed that members of the Gupta family had offered him the post of finance minister .
Other scandals include a dodgy arms deal over which the former president Thabo Mbeki fired Zuma as his deputy , and another where Zuma was charged with the rape of a friendâ€ ™ s daughter but later acquitted .
In 2014 an independent inquiry found that Zuma got the government to pay for lavish improvements to his home at Nkandla , in KwaZulu Natal .
The president refused to pay back some of the Â£10 m state funds spent on renovation of the property , and this led to the constitutional courtâ€ ™ s ruling last Thursday .
In March 2014 a report by the public protector , a similar role to an ombudsman , found that Zuma had â€œundulyâ€ � benefited from non - security upgrades such as a swimming pool , cattle kraal , chicken run , amphitheatre and visitorsâ€ ™ centre at his sprawling residence .
Extracts from Kathradaâ€ ™ s letter I have agonised for a while before writing this letter to you .
I have been a loyal and disciplined member of the ANC and broader Congress movement since the 1940s .
I have always maintained a position of not speaking out publicly about any differences I may harbour against my leaders and my organisation , the ANC .
I would only have done so when I thought that some important organisational matters compel me to raise my concerns .
Today I have decided to break with that tradition .
The position of president is one that must at all times unite this country behind a vision and programme that seeks to make tomorrow a better day than today for all South Africans .
It is a position that requires the respect of all South Africans , which of course must be earned at all times .
I am not a political analyst , but I am now driven to ask : Dear Comrade President , donâ€ ™ t you think your continued stay as President will only serve to deepen the crisis of confidence in the government of the country ?
And bluntly , if not arrogantly , in the face of such persistently widespread criticism , condemnation and demand , is it asking too much to express the hope that you will choose the correct way that is gaining momentum , to consider stepping down ?
If not , Comrade President , are you aware that your outstanding contribution to the liberation struggle stands to be severely tarnished if the remainder of your term as President continues to be dogged by crises and a growing public loss of confidence in the ANC and government as a whole .
To paraphrase the famous MK slogan of the time , â€œThere comes a time in the life of every nation when it must chose to submit or fightâ€ � .
Today I appeal to our President to submit to the will of the people and resign .
Yours comradely , Ahmed M Kathrada"
2016-04-05,"The South African president , Jacob Zuma , has survived an attempt to impeach him after the African National Congress party gave him its backing .
But his long - term future is still in doubt after a string of influential figures called on him to step down .
The motion to unseat the president was launched by opposition MPs after the constitutional court ruled that he had ignored an order to repay state funds spent on a lavish upgrade of his private home .
The ANC , which controls almost two - thirds of parliament , ensured the president won , with 233 MPs voting against the impeachment motion and 143 in favour .
But , beyond parliament , there are growing calls for Zuma to leave , arguing his reputation has been irretrievably tarnished by the ruling on his home renovations and a second controversy involving the Guptas , a family of wealthy industrialists with close ties to Zuma .
The Guptas have been accused of exploiting their relationship with the president to choose pliable candidates for top cabinet and business jobs in a scandal that came to light after the countryâ€ ™ s respected finance minister , Nhlanhla Nene , was abruptly sacked in December .
Zuma has fended off accusations of corruption , influence - peddling and rape since before he took office in 2009 , but the current swirl of scandals over both his home renovations and ties to the Guptas is arguably the biggest challenge he has faced .
At the weekend one of the countryâ€ ™ s most respected anti - apartheid fighters , an activist tried and jailed alongside Nelson Mandela , called for him to step down .
Ahmed Kathrada made the call in a letter to Zuma after the court ruling .
On Tuesday the respected former finance minister Trevor Manuel also joined those calling for Zuma to go , saying he had violated his oath of office .
Zuma did not attend the proceedings in parliament .
On Friday , the 73-year - old president gave a televised address to the nation in which he apologised and said he had never knowingly or deliberately set out to violate the constitution .
Several major firms have cut ties with the Guptas , saying the association is too risky .
The South African branch of global accounting firm KPMG , Barclays Africa and investment bank Sasfin have all announced they will no longer do business with one of the Gupta family companies , Reuters reported .
In an email to KPMG staff , local chief executive Trevor Hoole said he had decided to stop auditing the Gupta mining firm Oakbay Resources and Energy after consulting regulators , clients and KPMGâ€ ™ s internal risk departments .
â€œI can assure you this decision was not taken lightly but in our view the association risk is too great for us to continue , â€ �
Hoole said in the email , seen by Reuters .
â€œThere will clearly be financial and potentially other consequences to this , but we view them as justifiable.â€ � Oakbay confirmed the end of the 15-year relationship .
Barclays Africa , which runs South Africaâ€ ™ s biggest retail bank , Absa , also confirmed it no longer had a relationship with Oakbay , which is valued at 16bn rand ( Â£752 m ) on the Johannesburg stock market .
In an annual report from last August Oakbay listed Absa as its bank , Reuters reported .
A spokeswoman for Sasfin told Reuters on Monday the bankâ€ ™ s relationship with Oakbay would formally end on 1 June .
The Gupta family deny exploiting their relationship with Zuma and say they have been made scapegoats for the countryâ€ ™ s economic woes and used as pawns in internal party politics .
The Gupta family emigrated from India in 1993 , seeking business opportunities in post - apartheid South Africa , and now preside over a wide range of corporate interests from mining to IT and media .
Their close ties to Zuma , whose son sits on the board of at least six Gupta - owned companies , and extravagant lifestyle have drawn criticism before , perhaps most memorably when they used an air force base to fly in guests for a private wedding ."
2016-04-05,"Pressure to impeach Jacob Zuma , South Africaâ€
™ s much criticised president , reflects broader , rising public discontent with the ruling African National Congressâ€ ™ s senior leadership , a widening democratic deficit and steadily deteriorating economic conditions .
The Nkandla scandal , for which Zuma was belatedly forced to apologise last week , has been under investigation since 2012 , when it was revealed that the cost of taxpayer - funded luxury improvements to the presidentâ€ ™ s rural home had risen nearly tenfold .
The row has dragged on , poisoning public debate and undermining confidence in government .
An official inquiry in 2013 cleared Zuma of any wrongdoing , saying the work , which included a new swimming pool and cattle ranch pens , was needed for security reasons .
But the following year Thuli Madonsela , South Africaâ€ ™ s public protector , accused Zuma of misuse of public money and unethical conduct .
Her report , waspishly entitled Secure in Comfort , noted that the estimated $ 23 m cost was eight times what was spent on securing two private homes for former president Nelson Mandela , and more than 1,000 times what was spent on South Africaâ€ ™ s last apartheid - era president , FW de Klerk .
Zuma repeatedly claimed he had used his own money to pay for building work .
And even as the row intensified , the national assembly , where the ANC controls more than 60 % of the seats , continued to protect him , passing a resolution whose apparent purpose was to nullify Madonselaâ€ ™ s findings .
Zuma finally changed his tune last week after South Africaâ€ ™ s highest court ruled unanimously that he had violated the constitution .
Baleka Mbete , the assembly speaker , who is overseeing the impeachment debate , is facing opposition demands that she , too , resign over her alleged efforts to cover Zumaâ€ ™ s tracks .
Like Zuma , she has refused to go .
Zumaâ€ ™ s survival may be short lived .
Expectations are growing that , like former president Thabo Mbeki , forced out prematurely in 2008 , he will not last until the end of his second term in 2019 .
He is under fire from all sides , including the main opposition Democratic Alliance ( DA ) , church leaders , Mandela era veterans , the media and online petitioners .
â€œJacob Zuma is the cancer at the heart of South African politics .
He is not capable of honourable conduct , and can not continue to be president of our country , â€ � the DA said before the impeachment debate .
â€œThe president can no longer be considered a fit and proper person to remain the commander - in - chief of the South African nationaldefenceforce , nor can any of the parliamentary members who so stubbornly protected him be considered fit and proper persons to hold office as members of parliament , â€ � said JG â€œPikkieâ€ � Greeff , national secretary of South Africaâ€ ™ s national defence union .
More significant , perhaps , is the way Nkandla is being used by Zumaâ€ ™ s internal party rivals , political allies and breakaway factions to press for a more wide - ranging governance shake - up .
Chief among the latter is party renegade Julius Malemaâ€ ™ s Economic Freedom Fighters .
Malema regularly abuses Zuma , but his main beef is with the ANCâ€ ™ s elitist old guard as a whole .
These critics point to persistent , deeprooted problems including the failure to care for the poorest in society , high - level corruption , a crumbling education system , influence - peddling by wealthy businessmen and chronic economic mismanagement .
South Africaâ€ ™ s economy is set to grow at its slowest pace this year since the 2009 recession and faces a possible credit rating downgrade .
The rand has fallen in value amid a sharp decline in foreign investor confidence .
Unemployment is at 34 % , according to the World Bank .
The Communist party , a long - time ANC ally , revealed the nervousness at the heart of South Africaâ€ ™ s ruling apparatus .
It congratulated Zuma on his apology but wondered why the corrosive effect of the Nkandla scandal had not been neutralised earlier .
Much more was now needed , the SACP said .
The courtâ€ ™ s ruling amounted to a warning that â€œdecisive action is now imperative , otherwise the continuing loss of moral authority , political paralysis and fragmentation of our movement will continueâ€ � .
A widespread sense of disappointment and disillusionment over the ANCâ€ ™ s perceived failure to significantly correct the economic injustices of the apartheid era is the biggest challenge facing those in the partyâ€ ™ s top echelons currently clinging to Zumaâ€ ™ s sinking ship .
They may yet decide to cast him off before all are dragged down .
The next big test may be local elections , due by August , in key cities such as Pretoria and Johannesburg .
Any change would be hard won .
â€œThe veterans have sway within the ANC , â€ � Somadoda Fikeni , a politics professor at the University of South Africa , told Bloomberg News .
â€œItâ€ ™ s an indictment against the current leadership , which says despite any logical argument â€˜we are going ahead defending our leaderâ€ ™
.â€ �
Gwede Mantashe , the ANCâ€ ™ s secretary general , said the partyâ€ ™ s top leaders saw no reason to remove Zuma .
And the presidentâ€ ™ s powers of patronage are considerable .
More than 70 % of the national executive committeeâ€ ™ s members elected in 2012 were part of a bloc that backed him for the presidency .
Many were directly appointed to government posts by him .
Max Sisulu , son of the ANC legend Walter Sisulu and a former national assembly speaker , said parliamentâ€
™ s failure to hold Zuma to account was painful and lessons should be learned .
â€œParliament must put its house in order and do the right thing ,
â€ � he said .
â€œIt was quite clear from the start what was needed .
If there is something wrong , you fix it .
Our people were able to change the whole system of apartheid and establish democracy .
This is fixable.â€ �"
2016-04-06,"As South African satirist Tom Eaton put it on Twitter , asking parliament to impeach the president was like asking hyenas if they wanted to stay huddled round the carcass .
There was only ever one possible answer , and the National Assembly duly delivered it on Tuesday , comprehensively rejecting the oppositionâ€ ™ s motion to remove Jacob Zuma .
Just 143 of the total 400 MPs voted in favour of the motion to impeach , with the African National Congress ( ANC ) closing ranks to protect its embattled leader .
Even the newly - reappointed finance minister Pravin Gordhan , thought to be a key figure in the ruling partyâ€ ™ s anti - Zuma camp , cast his vote in support of the president .
The impeachment motion was tabled following last weekâ€ ™ s groundbreaking constitutional court ruling which found that Zuma had failed to uphold the constitution over expensive upgrades made using public money to his private home in Nkandla .
While Zuma apologised for acting unconstitutionally , he maintained that he had done so â€œin good faithâ€ � and promised to pay back the cash .
He also ignored calls for his resignation .
That the ANC accepted this line , and defended Zuma so vociferously in parliament , should come as no surprise given that the president has hand - picked many of the ruling party MPs .
But it is also a reflection of the partyâ€ ™ s longstanding emphasis on displays of public unity , even when there are serious divisions behind the scenes .
â€œThere are members of the ANC who no doubt hate Zuma , but they hate the opposition more .
They can not be seen to be collaborating with the opposition , irrespective of the principle at stake , â€ � said political analyst Ralph Mathekga .
Mathekga argued the vote in parliament should be interpreted as the ANC uniting against the opposition rather than behind their leader , and that it doesnâ€ ™ t mean Zuma is now guaranteed to see out his term , which expires in 2019 .
â€œI think for the short term , it means that this is not the type of exit that the ANC would like to see him undergo .
It does not necessarily mean he is safe altogether , â€ � Mathekga added .
Stephen Grootes , a journalist who has interviewed many of the key players in the Nkandla scandal , agrees that Zuma has been strengthened by the defeat of the impeachment motion â€ “ but only for now .
â€œIt looks like Zuma is safe for the short to the medium term , for the next six months or so , but at the same time the ANC is going to come under more pressure than ever before , particularly at local government elections , â€ � he said .
United opposition
At the conclusion of parliament on Tuesday , the major opposition leaders â€ “ including the Democratic Allianceâ€ ™ s Mmusi Maimane , the Economic Freedom Fightersâ€ ™ Julius Malema and the United Democratic Movementâ€ ™ s
Bantu Holomisa â€ “ gave an unprecedented joint press conference in which they promised to work together to remove Zuma from power .
Itâ€ ™ s clear that as the ANC puts on a united front the opposition has responded in kind , collaborating to become a formidable force ahead of upcoming local elections , scheduled for between May and August this year .
A successful opposition campaign could also strengthen the hand of the anti - Zuma faction within ANC .
â€œAt this point
Zumaâ€ ™ s camp is still in charge .
He has appropriated the internal processes of the party to the point where there is little recourse against him .
His detractors must do sufficient political work on the ground and stage a mutiny within the branches at the lower levels of the party .
â€œIf the ANC performs very badly at local elections they have a strong case to make at the lower levels , â€ � said Mathekga .
Zuma has been nicknamed â€œthe Teflon presidentâ€ � in recognition of his ability to withstand scandal after scandal .
While last weekâ€ ™ s constitutional court ruling has provided him his greatest hurdle to date , so far his reputation as a political survivor remains intact , and even enhanced by the ANCâ€ ™ s latest show of parliamentary support .
But heâ€ ™ s not out of the woods yet .
Facing a united , invigorated opposition , and heading towards crucial local elections , heâ€ ™ s still got plenty of work to do if he is going to remain in power ."
2016-05-27,"Jacob Zuma , the president of South Africa , has been forced to order a review of the purchase of top - of - the - range luxury cars for his four wives with nearly Â£400,000 of public funds in a bid to deflect public outrage .
The 11 cars were necessary â€œto provide comprehensive protection of VIP spousesâ€ � , according to a parliamentary answer from Nkosinathi Nhleko , the police minister , revealed earlier this week .
They included four Range Rover SUVs , two Land Rover Discovery SUVs and five Audi luxury vehicles .
Funds were drawn from the nationâ€ ™ s police budget .
Zuma has been hit by a series of scandals in recent years and the latest admission will increase pressure on the beleaguered premier to step down .
The ruling African National Congress ( ANC ) , led since 2007 by the 74-year - old veteran politician and activist , faces a tough battle at local polls in August , with wide losses for the party predicted by many analysts .
Opposition parties said the review was a political ploy ahead of the local polls .
Bongani Ngqulunga , a spokesman for the president , denied the charge and said the review was triggered simply by â€œa very difficult economic climate .
Elections or no electionsâ€ � .
Zuma had previously called for austerity measures in government to cope with a weak economy during his state of the nation address in February , he said .
His government has struggled to prop up a plunging currency and revive flagging growth .
The former anti - apartheid activist has been married six times , most recently in 2012 .
He divorced one wife in 1998 , and another died in 2000 .
Polygamy is legal in South Africa in some circumstances .
The Zulu ethnic group , of which Zuma is part , practises polygamy by tradition , though it is increasingly rare .
The criticism of the expenditure on cars comes among broader resentment at the lavish lifestyle of senior ANC officials .
Local media in south Africa this week accused the government of spending more than Â£20,000 on three monthsâ€ ™ accommodation in a five - star hotel for a junior minister and his family in the capital Pretoria .
Zuma survived an impeachment vote in April after the constitutional court said he breached the law by ignoring an order to repay some of the Â£11 m in state funds spent on renovating his private home in Nkandla .
Zuma has agreed to repay some of the money spent on non - security features ."
2016-06-07,"South Africaâ€ ™ s public protector called for extra resources to allow her to investigate allegations of improper use of influence levelled at a major business family and President Jacob Zuma .
Thuli Madonsela , who heads South Africaâ€ ™ s watchdog on government misconduct , said she had received complaints about the relationship between Zuma , who leads the ruling African National Congress ( ANC ) party , and the wealthy Gupta family , but had so far been unable to launch an inquiry .
â€œYes , we have been asked to investigate â€˜state captureâ€ ™ by the Gupta family , specifically whether or not the government of South Africa and specifically the president unlawfully allowed the Gupta family to choose ministers and other occupants of high office , â€ �
Madonsela told journalists in Johannesburg .
The investigation would also look at whether state contracts and licences were awarded improperly , she said .
Both Zuma and the Guptas deny all allegations of wrongdoing .
Madonsela said her office did not have sufficient resources to investigate the claims and had yet to receive a government response to a request for further funding .
â€œIt is a huge investigation but
â€
¦ we need just 3 m rand ( Â£140,000 ) as seed money .
We can do it economically , â€ � the former advocate and activist told the Guardian .
The controversy around the Guptas took a dramatic turn in March when the deputy finance minister , Mcebisi Jonas , issued a public statement claiming he had been offered the post of finance minister by the family after the respected incumbent resigned .
Zuma denied Jonasâ€ ™ s claims , saying only the president appointed ministers , as per the constitution .
The Guptas , who run dozens of companies employing thousands of people , said the allegation was â€œtotally falseâ€ � and â€œjust more political point scoring between rival factionsâ€ � within the ANC .
In March , the deputy president , Cyril Ramaphosa , a powerful figure in the ruling party , was reported as saying that the â€œANC is not for saleâ€ � .
â€œThe ANC refuses to be captured .
Those who might want to capture the ANC and make it their own and influence it to advance personal or corporate interests , you have come to the wrong address , â€ � he was quoted by the Rand Daily Mail as saying at an academic summit in Johannesburg .
Madonsela angered many within the ANC when she accused Zuma of conduct â€œinconsistent with his officeâ€ � and violating the executive ethics code by failing to protect state resources by spending public funds on his private home in KwaZulu - Natal .
In a 2014 report , the public protector described how 246 m rand of taxpayersâ€ ™ money had turned Zumaâ€ ™ s house into a display of â€œopulence on a grand scaleâ€ � amid a sea of poverty .
The report led to a power struggle after Zuma refused to accept the 400-page reportâ€ ™ s findings .
Madonsela was vindicated in March when the constitutional court , the countryâ€ ™ s highest court , said the president had breached the constitution by ignoring her recommendation that he repay some of the money .
Judges described Madonsela â€ “ who during her time in the role has faced death threats and allegations that she is a CIA spy â€ “ as â€œthe embodiment of a biblical David who fights the very well resourced Goliath that [ is ] the impropriety of government officialsâ€ � .
Commenting on her near seven years as public protector , Mandosela said â€œthe politics had been the most challengingâ€ � aspect ."
2016-08-04,"South Africans have delivered a stinging rebuke to the ANC , handing the party its first major election setback since it swept to power after the end of apartheid over two decades ago .
Frustrated with a stagnant economy , a 25 % unemployment rate and corruption allegations against Jacob Zuma , the president , voters in local elections turned away from the ruling party in their millions and it has been defeated in two of the three cities where it faced the strongest challenge .
The ANC is likely to claim a slim overall majority when final results are announced , but it has lost control of Port Elizabeth , an industrial city on the south coast , and Pretoria , the capital .
It did manage to win narrowly in the municipality of Johannesburg ,
the nationâ€ ™ s economic hub , but failed to win an outright majority .
In the Nelson Mandela Bay area , which includes Port Elizabeth , the DA secured enough votes to promise that although they would need to govern in coalition , they would not partner with the ANC .
The three cities together are home to more than 8 million people , with annual budgets of about $ 10bn ( Â£7.5bn ) .
The loss of control , amid plummeting overall support for the ANC , will be a major psychological blow to a party so convinced of its right to rule that the general secretary recently declared it had a mandate from God .
As the scale of their advances became clear , opposition leaders were quick to claim their victory as a transformation not just of local councils but of the national political landscape .
â€œWe have shown some incredible growth , â€ �
Mmusi Maimane , the DAâ€ ™ s first black leader , told 702 radio .
â€œWe call this the change election because we felt that it was a referendum on Jacob Zuma as a national figure , but we also had a referendum about the future of South Africa.â€ �
For decades the ANC has claimed an unshakeable dominance of South African politics , entering elections with an expectation of victory that critics say has contributed to stagnation and corruption .
This election will be the first time that the party of the anti - apartheid hero , Nelson Mandela , has won less than 60 % of the vote since countryâ€ ™ s first multiracial poll in 1994 .
Thursdayâ€ ™ s vote sent a clear message that the years when South Africa effectively operated as a one - party system are drawing to a close .
A record number of voters , over 26 million , registered for the election , with rival parties apparently mobilising supporters to sign up and then attend polling stations far more effectively than the ANC .
The DA was particularly strong in more prosperous suburban areas around the cities , said election analyst Dawie Scholtz .
But it also showed that a party once dismissed as the voice of the white middle classes could challenge the ruling party in its strongholds .
â€œThe DA did also make modest inroads into the ANC traditional township voter base , â€ � he told the Guardian .
â€œThat point is important.â€ �
There was also a small but significant challenge from a radical new party , the Economic Freedom Fighters , which has not taken control of any councils but claimed enough support to potentially serve as kingmaker in divided cities .
Led by ex - ANC firebrand , Julius Malema , it was contesting local elections for the first time on a platform that includes promises to nationalise mines and redistribute land without compensation .
The results will be damaging to Zuma .
In a personal blow , the ANC also failed to take control of his home ward of Nkandla from the Zulu Nationalist Inkatha Freedom party ( IPF ) .
â€œJacob Zuma will go home to an IFP - run ward , go to parliament in a DA - run city and likely to work in a DA - run capital city , â€ � said the DAâ€ ™ s spokesperson , Phumzile Van Damme in a triumphant tweet .
The results will increase pressure on Zuma , whose critics inside the party say he is irrevocably tainted and would like to see him step down before his term ends in three years , making way for a new leader to contest the 2019 general election .
They are likely to be shrugged off by a man who has weathered months of serious scandals with his power - base largely intact .
Earlier this year he was ordered by the constitutional court to repay over a half a million dollars of state money spent on upgrades to his personal home , which has become a virtual byword for corruption .
He has also been accused of allowing a family of businessmen , the Guptas , undue influence in national affairs .
Several senior politicians have alleged that family members were involved in deciding cabinet appointments .
Zumaâ€ ™ s handling of the economy has caused particular frustration .
South Africa is plagued by stagnation and crippling unemployment , which affects over a quarter of working - age South Africans and disproportionately its young people .
There is also anger about widespread inequality .
About 80 % of
South Africaâ€ ™ s 54 million citizens are black , but most land and companies remain in the hands of white people who make up fewer than 10 % of the population .
â€œWhile the middle classes are upset about government incompetence and corruption , the working classes are economically frustrated by the lack of jobs â€ “ good paying or not , â€ � said Sebastian Spio - Garbrah , DaMina Advisorsâ€ ™ chief Africa frontier markets analyst .
The DA has capitalised on a reputation for efficient management in the one city it does control , Cape Town , to lure voters hoping for a revival in an economy that never fully recovered from the 2008 global economic crisis and which is still teetering on the brink of recession .
It has promised to liberalise the economy , including cutting red tape and making it easier to hire and fire workers , and even modest urban victories for the DA are likely to be welcomed by markets and investors ."
2016-08-05,"South Africaâ€ ™ s ruling ANC party has lost control of the symbolic Nelson Mandela Bay area as millions of voters abandon it across the country in local elections that could rewrite the countryâ€ ™ s political landscape .
Twenty - two years since the party came to power , South Africans used the local government elections to warn the ANC that its historic achievement of overturning the apartheid system no longer guaranteed it the right to govern .
Frustrated by a stagnant economy , crippling unemployment and corruption scandals swirling around the president , Jacob Zuma , voters have turned away from the party of Nelson Mandela in huge numbers .
They cast their ballots for the Democratic Alliance ( DA ) , a party once considered a champion of the white middle classes that now has its first black leader , Mmusi Maimane .
South Africans also voted in smaller but significant numbers for the Economic Freedom Fighters , a radical far - left party led by the former ANC firebrand Julius Malema that is likely to serve as kingmaker in areas where the ANC or DA are forced to form coalitions .
Although voters were only choosing local councils , the elections were widely seen as a referendum on more than two decades of ANC rule .
Eyewitness News quoted Malema telling party activists : â€œWe are happy that the EFF is the first organisation to humble the ANC â€ “ the most arrogant organisation.â€
�
The first victory the DA claimed was the Nelson Mandela Bay area , named after the revered former president and once home to other heroes of the anti - apartheid movement .
The DA will have to rule in coalition , but the loss was still difficult for the ANC to digest .
Long after it was clear that support for the party had collapsed there , the deputy president , Cyril Ramaphosa , said it was too early to analyse the election results .
It would be like reading â€œsomebodyâ€ ™ s tombstone before they die , â€ � he said .
â€œIt was a hotly contested area , where we as the ANC had a number of challenges and problems .
We accept that the people have spoken.â€ �
In Johannesburg and the urban sprawl around Pretoria , results were still being counted nearly two days after polling stations closed , with support for the ANC and the DA too close to call .
Even if the ANC ultimately only loses control of one city , it will have been chastened by the election result .
It looks set to hold on to a slim overall majority nationwide , but this is the first time since Mandela took power that it has secured less than 60 % of the vote .
â€œWe need to have a serious introspection , â€ � the ANC chief whip , Jackson Mthembu , told reporters at the main counting centre in Pretoria .
The challenge , particularly for the DA , as it takes power in new areas as part of a coalition , will be coming good on election promises to rule for all , including the poorest black communities frustrated by inequality .
About 80 % of
South Africaâ€ ™ s 54 million citizens are black , but most land and companies remain in the hands of white people , who make up less than 10 % of the population .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve given the DA a chance to show what they can do .
I hope they donâ€ ™ t
let us down , â€ � said one township voter , who spoke to Reuters , but asked to be named only as Tando because of the stigma still attached to his choice .
â€œWhere I come from , there is a lot of pressure to vote for the ANC.â€ �
The DA has built up a reputation for competent management in Cape Town , its only power base until now , but has been dogged by lingering accusations of racism .
As recently as last year , a shadow cabinet member was demoted after sharing a Facebook post praising the apartheid president PW Botha .
The DA has worked hard to distance itself from that legacy .
In a major speech at the start of the year , Maimane spelled out that the party did not want votes from anyone not committed to a diverse South Africa .
â€œIf youâ€ ™ re a racist and you are thinking of voting for the DA , please donâ€ ™ t .
We are not the party for you , â€ � he told an audience at the apartheid museum , in a landmark speech on identity and race ."
2016-08-06,"South Africaâ€ ™ s controversial president , Jacob Zuma , is well known for his antipathy towards urban black intellectuals , whom he labels â€œthe clever blacksâ€ � .
In 2014 , when he was asked about public concerns that he had used state funds to build himself a Â£13 m palace in his home village in rural KwaZulu Natal , he replied that only â€œvery clever and bright peopleâ€ � cared about the issue .
In a speech in November 2012 , Zuma slammed urban blacks â€œwho become too cleverâ€ � , saying : â€œThey become the most eloquent in criticising themselves about their own traditions and everything.â€ �
Last week , the â€œclever blacksâ€ � had their revenge on Zuma , delivering the heaviest electoral loss to Nelson Mandelaâ€ ™ s African National Congress since democracy dawned in 1994 while setting up a mighty contest for national elections in 2019 .
Although the ANC retained massive support in rural South Africa , its losses in urban areas were shocking and comprehensive .
In Nelson Mandela Bay , the coastal city renamed in honour of South Africaâ€ ™ s most famous son , voters rejected the ANC and gave their votes to the opposition Democratic Alliance .
Just 10 years ago , the ANC got 66 % of the vote in the city famous for its struggle against apartheid .
It polled a disappointing 40 % last week .
Yesterday , Pretoria ( in the process of being renamed Tshwane ) , the executive capital of the country , was set to be run by an opposition coalition after the ANC came in at a paltry 41 % of the vote behind the DA .
The parliamentary capital , Cape Town , has been in opposition hands for more than a decade .
The African continentâ€ ™ s economic powerhouse , Johannesburg , saw the ANC lose its majority as opposition parties started coalition talks there too .
The national story tells a similarly depressing story for the ANC .
In local elections in 2006 , the party got 66.3 % votes nationwide .
The DA took 14.8 % .
Last week , the ANC reached just under 54 % and the main opposition DA stood at 27 % .
Wednesdayâ€ ™ s election was a major turning point for the ANC and for South Africa .
Last October , ANC general secretary , Gwede Mantashe , warned a party policy conference that were its support to plunge below 60 % this year it would mark a â€œpsychological and political turning
pointâ€
� .
That moment has now arrived as the party that led the international liberation struggle against apartheid failed to convince its core urban constituency to vote for it in significant numbers .
In urban townships such as Soweto , an ANC stronghold , voter turnout was as low as 46 % , while those who did turn up increasingly voted for the opposition DA and the radical three - year - old Economic Freedom Fighters formed by expelled former ANC Youth League firebrand Julius Malema .
This is a watershed moment because it means South Africa is no longer a country dominated by one party of liberation .
For long , we were slowly inching towards being a proper , lively , multi - party system that holds power to account .
We are now hurtling that way .
Itâ€ ™ s exhilarating .
Former ANC treasurer - general Mathews Phosa , a businessman and former Zuma ally , summed up the ANCâ€ ™ s losses thus : â€œWe need to accept the reality that there are many young people who voted for the DA .
Where do these people come from ?
They left the ANC and why did they leave the ANC ?
The clever blacks have spokenâ€ ¦
The masses are punishing us with the weapon we won for them .
The vote.â€
�
Itâ€ ™ s been a long time coming .
Since Zuma came to power in 2007 , the ANC has been racked by corruption scandals , infighting and splits .
Economic mismanagement has plagued the Zuma administration , with unemployment rising from 21 % to just over 26 % since 2008 .
The economy has taken a beating , with projections by the Reserve Bank saying that there will be zero growth this year , while ratings agencies have threatened a credit rating downgrade .
To mask these failings , the ANC ran a negative and racist campaign that aimed to paint the opposition DA as the party of apartheid .
Campaigning in Nelson Mandela Bay , Zuma called the DA â€œsnakes , the children of the National partyâ€ � and repeatedly referred to its young black leader as a puppet of whites .
Urban South Africans did not buy this scaremongering .
As the memories of the Mandela years and the liberation struggle have faded , and the ANCâ€ ™ s internal troubles have spilled out into the open , so too has unquestioning faith in the countryâ€ ™ s liberation party and its veterans such as Zuma .
The legitimacy conferred upon them by the struggle is no longer a mask for their failings in a country that is now scarred by stories of rampant political corruption , crime and poverty .
The country now enters a new era of competitive politics in a terrain where once the ANCâ€ ™ s struggle credentials ensured it unparalleled success .
Malema , the energetic young founder of the EFF , has won 8 % of the national vote and is a kingmaker in Johannesburg and Tshwane .
Malema says he predicts the ANC will not be governing South Africa when the country takes to the polls in the 2019 national government elections .
It is a claim that would have once been dismissed as a pipe dream .
No longer .
Even in its rural strongholds such as Limpopo , where Malema comes from , the ANC has slunk in way below its previous support levels .
In Zumaâ€ ™ s rural home municipality , the ANC claimed 44.25 % while the Inkatha Freedom party won with 54 % .
What does it mean ?
The post - colonial African story is replete with tales of liberation movements that have stayed in power with one leader and one party despite losing the support of the people .
Zimbabwe , just to the north of us , is a painful example of such a country ; Mugabe and Zanu - PF have been in power for 36 years .
South Africa has broken with that narrative .
First , Zuma is the fourth president of the country since 1994 .
Mandela broke with the â€œstrong manâ€ � tradition by stepping down after one term .
Now , with these results , a future where South Africa could be run by an opposition party is beginning to emerge .
We could see this in the next national election in 2019 or in 2024 .
It may be disconcerting for those of us who grew up with the ANC as the very heart of the South African political landscape , but it is not necessarily a bad thing .
It heralds the maturation of our politics and the steady , welcome move towards a lively , competitive , responsive multi - party democracy .
South Africans are using the ballot box to speak to their leaders and that can only be a good thing .

Have Now Begun Our Descent :
How to Stop South Africa Losing its Way"
2016-11-02,"The writing is on the wall for Jacob Zuma , South Africaâ€ ™ s embattled president , but will he heed it ?
Rumblings of discontent over alleged high - level corruption , influence - peddling and economic mismanagement have been growing in vehemence and volume all year .
They have now reached fever pitch amid impassioned calls for Zumaâ€ ™ s immediate resignation .
The intensifying furore follows
Wednesdayâ€
™ s
publication of a report by a respected independent watchdog demanding an urgent judicial inquiry into possible graft involving the president and his son .
Zumaâ€ ™ s position looks precarious .
The presidentâ€ ™ s term , his second , runs until 2019 .
As matters stand , few would bet on him going the full distance .
Zuma has been beset by intrigue and scandal since first taking office .
Unbending support from the higher echelons of the ruling party , the African National Congress , has mostly protected him .
But the ANCâ€ ™ s political firewall , like its grip on power , is weakening , as shown by unprecedented reverses in Augustâ€ ™ s municipal elections .
His latest humiliating setback came when he was forced to drop his court bid to block publication of the official report , by Thuli Madonsela ,
formerly South Africaâ€ ™ s most senior anti - corruption watchdog , into alleged influence - peddling .
The report is not conclusive .
But it expresses â€œserious concernsâ€
� about claims that Zuma conducted an improper relationship with the powerful Gupta business family and that government policy and cabinet appointments were influenced as a result .
It calls for a judge - led inquiry .
Both Zuma and the Guptas deny the allegations .
Earlier this year Zuma was also in hot water over the Nkandla scandal .
He was eventually forced to apologise after it emerged that the cost of taxpayer - funded luxury improvements to his rural residence had risen nearly tenfold .
In 2014 , Madonsela accused him of misuse of public money and unethical conduct .
Her report , entitled Secure in Comfort , noted the estimated $ 23 m ( Â£19 m ) cost was eight times what was spent on securing two private homes for the former president Nelson Mandela , and more than 1,000 times what was spent on South Africaâ€ ™ s last apartheid - era president , FW de Klerk .
Zuma was obliged to repay $ 500,000 .
Zuma came under additional fire this week over an attempt by the state prosecutor , Shaun Abrahams , to bring fraud charges against the finance minister , Pravin Gordhan .
The charges were suddenly dropped on Monday in the face of fierce opposition .
Critics suggested Zuma and his allies were attempting to discredit a minister who was blocking their access to lucrative government contracts and treasury funds .
Zuma has denied any conflict with Gordhan .
Public criticism of Zuma now reaches beyond his personal actions .
Opponents are claiming South Africaâ€ ™ s sometimes tenuous post - apartheid grip on democracy is under threat and that the economy , and the common peopleâ€ ™ s welfare , are at risk , exemplified by high youth unemployment .
The Gupta affair has rattled markets in Africaâ€ ™ s most industrialised economy , which is stagnating and faces possible ratings downgrades .
Zuma and the ANC are meanwhile under attack from all sides , including the opposition Democratic Alliance , church leaders , party rebels , the media and online petitioners .
The Nelson Mandela Foundation charity warned on Tuesday that the â€œwheels [ are ] coming offâ€ � South Africa , while business groups and CEOs have called for new political leadership .
At a rally in Pretoria on Wednesday , speakers from the Save South Africa coalition accused the ANC government of presiding over rampant corruption and called on Zuma to quit .
Cheryl Carolus , a former ANC luminary and respected anti - apartheid activist , said the country was in crisis and younger generations were being betrayed .
â€œWe have reached a point where we feel that the people of this country , including us in the ANC , have to take a stand and draw a line in the sand , â€ � she said .
â€œWe are appalled that â€ ¦ a small handful of people have decided that they would capture the state , its institutions and resources for their own benefit.â€ �
The chief rabbi , Warren Goldstein , of the national religious leadersâ€ ™ council , said South Africa was at a crossroads .
â€œThere is a titanic struggle taking place , â€ � he said .
â€œWho is really sovereign in this country ?
Is the government elected by the people , for the people , exercising sovereignty on behalf of the people , or does the very sovereignty of this country belong to a few corrupt families and those who benefit from them?â€
�
Yet the opposition to Zuma is by no means united .
Influential figures within the ANC are determined that he does not follow the former president Thabo Mbeki into involuntary early retirement , if only in order to safeguard their own interests .
Others may wish to jettison him for the same reasons .
There are also ideological divisions .
Julius Malema , the former ANC youth wing firebrand who leads the Economic Freedom Fighters , condemned the Save South Africa movement as representatives of â€œwhite monopoly capitalâ€ � .
He added : â€œThey must not think we are friends .
We will never be friends.â€
�
If he is to survive , Zuma must hope his many critics dislike each other more than they dislike him ."
2016-11-03,"On Wednesday , hundreds gathered in front of the Johannesburg high court to mark the death of Fezekile Ntsukela Kuzwayo , the feminist Aids activist who accused Jacob Zuma of rape .
The tribute was organised by the One in Nine campaign , a group of feminist activists formed a decade earlier to provide solidarity as Kuzwayo testified against Zuma â€ “
a family friend and prominent member of the ruling African National Congress â€ “ inside the selfsame court .
Although the media disclosed Kuzwayoâ€ ™ s real name at the time of the trial , activists chose to defend her right to privacy with the pseudonym â€œKhweziâ€ � .
The court proceedings were short and brutal , exposing her sexual history and questioning her sexuality .
Zuma admitted to intercourse but denied rape , explaining that he had unprotected sex despite knowing Kuzwayo was HIV - positive , but took a shower afterwards to prevent infection .
Zuma argued that Kuzwayo had invited his sexual advances by wearing a kanga ( a printed cotton wrap commonly worn by African women at home ) , and did not resist as he woke and penetrated her .
His testimony nullified the notion of active consent â€ “ of a woman verbally and clearly acceding to a sexual encounter .
Zuma was acquitted , while the presiding judge , Willem van der Merwe , questioned Kuzwayoâ€ ™ s past history of sexual assault .
One could argue that the proceedings were unremarkable .
Rates of violence against women globally are at epidemic proportions : an estimated one in three women will be violated in her lifetime .
Zuma is by no means the only elected official who has faced allegations of rape or sexual harassment .
Nor is he the only political figure who has laughed at the notion of a womanâ€ ™ s right to consent .
Rape is , as the South African feminist academic Pumla Dineo Gqola has said , â€œa crime of powerâ€ � .
What remains compelling in this story , however , is the example of Kuzwayo herself , and the people who came out publicly to support her as she stood up to the might of institutionalised patriarchy , and old political allegiances .
The One in Nine campaign â€ “ composed of seasoned activists and people from the feminist , queer and HIV and Aids movements â€ “ represented the constituencies from which she came .
Vastly outnumbered by Zumaâ€ ™ s supporters , they refused to leave the streets in front of the court despite verbal abuse from the crowds and harassment by police .
The protests were supported by a handful of public figures such as Pregs Govender , the former ANC MP .
Feminists from the broader African region also expressed their outrage at what they saw as the â€œhorrific and unethical victimisationâ€ � of Kuzwayo .
Even in death , Kuzwayoâ€ ™ s example is imbued with a power impossible to ignore .
The ANC Womenâ€ ™ s League , which had vociferously defended Zuma during the rape trial , greeted her demise with an offer of routine condolences .
The organisationâ€ ™ s secretary general made a sheepish nod to an apology , observing in an interview that Kuzwayo had been â€œbrave and fearlessâ€ � for coming forward with the accusation .
Rape is notoriously difficult to prosecute .
Most cases occur with only the accused and the survivor present , and forensic evidence is often minimal .
Feminists recognise how common rape is , and how often violators get away with it .
They use three simple words : â€œWe believe youâ€ � â€ “ because to believe a woman , publicly , is to stand up to male social dominance .
In Africa and beyond , the world has often acted shamefully in the face of rape .
Consider how few resources are available to support work to end violence against women .
Consider how many womenâ€ ™
s organisations remain underfunded , and consequently limited in their capacity to cope with the scale of violation .
And look at how one - stop centres established in collaboration with state police tend to falter once those who spearheaded their creation â€ “ usually women â€ “ move on .
We can no longer blame practical inaction on the apparent intractability of the problem .
Preventing violence against women is possible .
Indeed , research carried out in 2014 in Ugandaâ€ ™ s capital , Kampala , offered proof that changing the way we think about and manage gendered power in society can lead to reduced violence , changed attitudes and increased solidarity with women .
These positive shifts will only happen if we stop relying on a handful of the â€œbraveâ€ � to act as a frontline .
We , citizens and the state , need to redistribute this onus , and start taking seriously our collective responsibility to change the power dynamics that make rape possible .

2016-11-28,"Jacob Zuma , South Africaâ€ ™ s beleaguered president , is facing the most serious challenge of his seven years in power after three ministers called for his resignation .
The News24 agency , citing sources in the ruling African National Congress ( ANC ) party , said the calls came at a weekend meeting of senior officials amid heated debate over Zumaâ€ ™ s future .
He has faced mounting criticism of his leadership and a corruption probe unearthed fresh allegations of misconduct this month .
But the former ANC security chief retains strong loyalty among many party members and politicians , and easily survived a vote of no confidence in parliament on 10 November .
However , that vote was called by opposition politicians from the Democratic Alliance ( DA ) party .
At the time , commentators said that though a significant number of ANC officials wanted the president to resign , no one wanted the party to be pushed into a decision by outsiders .
Now the challenge appears to have come from within the ANC .
â€œThere is no doubt that Zuma is fighting for his political life , â€ � Ranjeni Munusamy , an analyst and commentator , wrote on the Daily Maverick website .
â€œHe is hanging on while it is clear that large sections of the ANC â€ ¦ no longer want him as president â€ ¦ The countdown for
Zumaâ€ ™ s exit has begun.â€ � Mmusi Maimane , leader of the DA , the biggest opposition party , said the ANC was steadily losing popular support .
â€œThe ANC has lost support , but how much is because of Zuma , how much because of the economy , how much just due to sheer corruption ?
The current battle is not about the fitness of the president but about the soul of the ANCâ€ � , Maimane said .
The release of the report by the countryâ€ ™ s public protector , an independent state office charged with uncovering maladministration , this month was a major blow .
It focused on Zumaâ€ ™ s close relationship with billionaire brothers Ajay , Atul and Rajesh Gupta , who run a business empire ranging from media to mining .
Zuma has denied giving the Guptas undue influence and they have denied seeking it .
A campaign by Zuma allies to oust Praveen Gordhan , the respected finance minister , has rattled investors .
Though the ANC is still has massive support , the unprecedented loss of major municipalities to a coalition of opposition parties after elections in August has also worried many among the partyâ€ ™ s â€œreformistâ€ � faction .
The ANC led the struggle against the racist and repressive apartheid regime and then took power in 1994 in South Africaâ€ ™ s first free elections .
Zumaâ€ ™ s enemies within the ANC are backed by increasing numbers of anti - apartheid veterans , trade unions , civil groups and business leaders .
A rally organised by a group called Save South Africa , described by one local newspaper as â€œa whoâ€ ™ s who of [ anti - apartheid ] struggle stalwartsâ€š religious leadersâ€š business people and civic activistsâ€
� , attracted hundreds in the capital , Pretoria , this month .
Some of the countryâ€ ™ s
best known political cartoonists have also called for Zuma to step down , even though it would mean losing one of their â€œrichest sources of materialâ€ � .
However , the 74-year - old veteran politician retains significant popularity among provincial ANC branches and grassroots activists .
â€œWe are not aware of any justified reasons for the president to not conclude his term of office , â€ � said Mdumiseni Ntuli , ANC provincial spokesman in KwaZulu - Natal , a stronghold of support for Zuma .
One senior ANC official , who asked to remain anonymous , said Zuma would probably manage to survive the latest attempt to dislodge him by the growing number of ANC figures unhappy with his leadership .
â€œEven if thereâ€ ™ s secret ballot ,
heâ€ ™ s still likely to get the numbers
, â€ � the official told Reuters .
An ANC spokesman did not respond to calls for comment .
Analysts said the new bid to oust Zuma would be weakened if the presidentâ€ ™ s allies managed to secure an open vote , one of the main ways he has controlled the party since taking over from Thabo Mbeki .
The ANCâ€ ™ s national executive committee , which is meeting in Pretoria , is the only body in the ruling party that can remove its leader , besides its five - yearly congress .
Zuma himself is one of the committeeâ€ ™ s 104 members , most of whom were elected in 2012 and many of whom are loyal to the president .
The president apologised earlier this year after the constitutional court said he flouted the constitution in a scandal over more than Â£13.7 m in state funds used to upgrade his rural home .
He eventually paid back 7.8 m rand ( Â£474,268 ) , an amount determined by the national treasury .
The next national elections are due in 2019 .
External experts have warned ANC strategists that the partyâ€ ™ s popularity was eroding fast .
But internal polls revealed that dissatisfaction with Zuma was only a minor factor for voters , with the ANCâ€ ™ s failure to deliver high - quality services such as water , schools , power and housing playing a greater role ."
2016-11-28,"Jacob Zuma , South Africaâ€ ™ s beleaguered president , appeared to have won a fierce battle to remain in office as the ruling African National Congress concluded an intense and acrimonious three - day debate on whether he should stand down from the office he has held for seven years .
Ministers and MPs who sit on the ANCâ€ ™ s national executive committee passed the day closeted in a hotel south of Pretoria , the administrative capital of South Africa , arguing over Zumaâ€ ™ s fate .
Though there was no clear decision by Monday night , aides said Zuma would be leaving for Cuba as scheduled to attend the funeral of Fidel Castro , suggesting the 74-year - old veteran politician has seen off the immediate challenge for now .
Senior officials remained tight - lipped however , leaving open the possibility of a major upset which could trigger a long period of further political instability .

2016-11-30,"With sombre speeches and a thunder of cannon , Havana held a mass eulogy for Fidel Castro on Tuesday night in a ceremony that underscored the polarising influence of the dead Cuban revolutionary .
President Raul Castro , dressed in his military uniform , led the memorial for his brother , who seized power in 1959 and turned the Caribbean island into a bastion of anti - imperialism and a focus of Cold War tensions with the United States .
Ideological allies , including Venezuelaâ€ ™ s Nicholas Maduro , Boliviaâ€ ™ s Evo Morales ,
Zimbabweâ€ ™ s Robert Mugabe and South Africaâ€ ™ s
Jacob Zuma came in person to say farewell to Castro , who died on Friday aged 90 , whilst nations on the other side of the political divide sent lower - ranking representatives .
â€œWe and our self - sacrificing ,
combative and heroic people say to you : Ever onward to victory , â€ �
Castro said in a tribute to his brother .
Castro embraced Maduro , his ideological ally , as the ceremony got underway .
â€œThey could overcome neither Fidel , nor the people of Cuba nor the dreams and hopes of this great nation , â€ � Maduro said in a tribute , chanting a refrain about the iconic revolutionary fending off imperialists that the crowd then finished .
â€œHe fulfilled his mission on this earth , â€ � he added .
â€œFew lives have been so complete , so bright .
He has left unconquered.â€ �
As well as tens of thousands of Cubans , the great and the good of the nationâ€ ™ s cultural and sporting world were also in attendance .
Among them was Ana Fidelia Quirot , a two - time world 800 m champion , who arrived in the colours of the national athletics team .
She recalled how Castro had visited her bedside every day while she was recovering from a life - threatening accident .
â€œIn my toughest moments he was always there for me ,
â€ � she said .
â€œI have come to honour an exceptional humanist .
He may not be here physically but he will stay in my heart.â€ �
A group of elderly veterans paused on their way to the square to share reminiscences and sentiments as chants of â€œViva
Fidel!â€ � resounded .
Eighty - year - old Armando Vasquez fought for Castro in the Sierra Maestra in the early days of the revolution .
â€œHe was like a father .
When he gave an order you knew you could do it , because he had already showed that it could be done.â€
�
Another pulled out his wallet and showed the Castro photograph he keeps inside .
â€œLook at this .
I donâ€
™ t keep a picture of my wife or daughter .
Thatâ€ ™ s how much Fidel means to me , â€ � said Gilberto Gonzalez .
â€œWe Cubans have been privileged to have a leader like this.â€ � Sandra Calvo â€ “ a Cuban - Mexican resident â€ “ arrived with her sister Patricia , pushing her 11-month - old son who was holding a Cuba flag .
â€œItâ€ ™ s the end of an era but something more than that , â€ � she said .
â€œI am a graduate of political science and I canâ€ ™ t think of any case where the loss of a former president has generated so much genuine sadness .
People arenâ€ ™ t forced to come here .
They want to respect him and his achievements .
There arenâ€ ™ t many countries where people can become doctors and philosophers regardless of their economic position.â€ �
Raul Castro closed the rally with a speech thanking world leaders for their words of praise for his brother , who he called the leader of a revolution â€œfor the humble , and by the humble.â€
�
Earlier in the day , lines stretched for hours outside the Plaza of the Revolution , the heart of government power and the place where Castro delivered fiery speeches to mammoth crowds after he seized power .
In Havana and across the island people signed condolence books and an oath of loyalty to Castroâ€ ™ s sweeping May 2000 proclamation of the Cuban revolution as an unending battle for socialism , nationalism and an outsize role for the island on the world stage .
Tribute sites were set up in hundreds of places across the island as the government urged Cubans to reaffirm their belief in a socialist , single - party system that in recent years has struggled to maintain the fervour that was widespread at the triumph of the 1959 revolution .
Many mourners came on their own accord to Havana but thousands were sent in groups by the communist government , which still employs about 80 % of the working people in Cuba despite the growth of the private sector under Raul .
Cuban state media reported that an urn containing Castroâ€ ™ s ashes was being kept in a room at the defence ministry where Raul Castro and top Communist party officials paid tribute the previous evening .
Inside the memorial thousands walked through three rooms with near - identical displays featuring the 1962 Alberto Korda photograph of the young Castro in the Sierra Maestra mountains , bouquets of white flowers and an array of Castroâ€ ™ s medals against a black backdrop , framed by honour guards of soldiers and children in school uniforms .
The ashes of the 90-year - old former president did not appear to be on display .
Signs read : â€œThe Cuban Communist party is the only legitimate heir of the legacy and authority of the commander in chief of the Cuban Revolution , comrade Fidel Castro.â€ � â€œGoodbye commander .
Your ideas remain here with us , â€ � 64-year - old retiree Etelbina Perez said between sobs , dabbing at her eyes with a brown handkerchief .
â€œI feel great pain over his death .
I owe my entire life to him .
He brought me out of the mountains .
I was able to study thanks to him.â€ �
The White House announced on Tuesday that Obama would not send a presidential delegation .
Instead , the United States will be represented by Jeffrey DeLaurentis , chief diplomat at the US embassy in Havana , and Ben Rhodes , an Obama aide who represented the United States in 18 months of secret talks that led to detente .
African leaders included Zimbabweâ€ ™ s Robert Mugabe .
Mugabe , 92 , himself a former Marxist guerrilla who has led Zimbabwe as prime minister or president since 1980 despite financial and health crises , praised Fidel Castroâ€ ™ s government for having trained thousands of Zimbabwean doctors and teachers .
â€œFidel was not just your leader .
He was our leader and the leader of all revolutionaries .
We followed him , listened to him and tried to emulate him , â€ �
Mugabe told reporters as he arrived in Havana .
â€œFarewell , dear brother .
Farewell , revolutionary , â€ � he said .

2017-01-13,"Hundreds of chambermaids , doormen and cocktail waiters have been flown to Davos to cater to every whim of world leaders , business executives and the super - rich who will descend next week on the Swiss Alps town for the annual World Economic Forum ( WEF ) celebration of capitalism .
While WEF guests , including Theresa May , Chinese leader Xi Jinping and South African president Jacob Zuma , will spend their nights in some of the worldâ€ ™ s most luxurious hotel suites , the staff brought in to serve them will be sleeping up to five to a room in bunk beds .
The manager of the fanciest hotel in Davos â€ “ the Grandhotel BelvÃ
©
dÃ¨re â€
“ said he had flown in 200 extra staff to work in shifts around the clock during the annual jamboree of the rich and powerful .
â€œWe normally have about 100 employees , but this week we have 300 to help us out , â€ �
Thomas Kleber , general manager of the BelvÃ ©
dÃ¨re , said .
Kleber said the extra staff have been flown in from partner hotels across the world to help out during the BelvÃ © dÃ¨reâ€ ™ s busiest week of the year , but because the whole of Davos is packed out with forum visitors there isnâ€ ™ t much space to accommodate the additional workers .
â€œWe have a staff house , but at this time of the year it is getting cosy , â€ � he explained .
â€œWe do have some different places with four or five people in one room .
We have set up high beds with one sleeping on top and one underneath.â€ �
Despite the contrasting sleeping arrangements , a key theme of this yearâ€ ™ s conference will be rising inequality , which the WEF has warned is the biggest problem facing the world .
The forum said the growing gap between rich and poor , which it said had helped trigger the UKâ€ ™ s Brexit vote and Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential victory , had led the west to â€œa tipping point and might now embark on a period of deglobalisationâ€ � .
The WEF has organised six sessions for Davos visitors to discuss inequality , including one entitled â€œCombating rising insecurity and inequalityâ€ � , to be introduced by the WEFâ€ ™ s chief economist , Jennifer Blanke .
Another session will explore rising inequality through a â€œvisual exploration that reveals the causes and consequences of fragility in cities now and through timeâ€ � .
The extra BelvÃ ©
dÃ¨re staff include â€œspecially recruited people just for mixing cocktailsâ€ � , as well as baristas , cooks , waiters , doormen , chambermaids and receptionists .
The BelvÃ ©
dÃ¨re is the focus of most Davos action , including top - level diplomatic meetings , the signing of billion - dollar business deals and , of course , the best parties .
The WEF organisers have taken control of 85 % of the hotelâ€ ™ s rooms to host world leaders , business people and celebrities , who this year include Grammy award - winner Shakira and Jamie Oliver .
Not even Kleber knows the identities of his guests due to security concerns , but he said in previous years that Bill Clinton , David Cameron , Ban Ki - moon and John Kerry stayed at the hotel .
â€œThere are always a lot of big famous people , big business bosses and state visitors , â€ � he said .
The BelvÃ © dÃ¨re will host more than 300 functions over five days , with the first executive coffee bar meetings starting at 6 am and the last of the late - night parties not turning out until 3 am .
â€œWe have all kinds of functions from breakfast meetings , politician lunches to nightcaps and cocktail receptions in every corner of the hotel .
Every company and every single party has its own individual needs , â€ � he said .
â€œIce sculptures are always part of it.â€ � Kleber declined to provide any details of what parties the hotel will be hosting this year , or how much the hotel charges for hosting events .
Last year , a Silicon Valley tech company was reportedly charged Â£6,000 for a short meeting with the president of Estonia in a converted luggage room .
The hotel has also previously flown in New England lobster , and provided special Mexican food for a company that was meeting a Mexican politician .
â€œI assume [ the staff ] get good tips , â€ � Kleber said , but â€œmost of them are not coming for the money â€ “ they are coming to be part of a once - in - a - year event â€
¦
Of course itâ€ ™ s hard work , but itâ€ ™ s a lot of fun , â€ � he added .
Theresa May will be the only G7 leader to attend this yearâ€ ™ s summit , which clashes with Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s inauguration as the 45th US president .
Downing Street refused to state which events or parties May plans to attend in her two - day Alpine sojourn .
Last year , Cameron was photographed partying tie - less with Bono , Leonardo DiCaprio and Kevin Spacey , at a lavish party hosted by Jack Ma , the founder of internet group Alibaba and Chinaâ€ ™ s richest man with a $ 34.5bn ( Â£28.5bn ) fortune .
Tony Blair , who also attended the Ma party last year , is also a regular at the glitziest events .
Travelling to Davos and finding anywhere to stay next week is very expensive , but not nearly as costly as getting an all - access pass to the schmoozing .
Basic membership of the WEF and an entry ticket costs 68,000 Swiss francs ( Â£55,400 ) , and that will only grant access to general sessions .
To get access to all areas , corporations must pay to become Strategic Partners of the WEF , costing SFr600,000 , which allows a CEO to bring up to four colleagues , or flunkies , along with them .
They must still pay SFr18,000 each for tickets .
All Strategic Partners have been told that at least one of their invitees must be a woman .
Strategic Partners are given access to all private sessions , and a car and driver with a special sticker allowing door - to - door pickup .
Just 100 companies are able to become Strategic Partners ; among them this year are Barclays , BT , BP , Facebook , Google and HSBC .
Companies have privately complained about the cost of the exclusive access , which helped the WEF bring in record revenue of SFr228 m last year , according to its annual report .
The most exclusive invite in town is to an uber - glamorous party thrown jointly by Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska and British financier Nat Rothschild at the oligarchâ€ ™ s palatial chalet , a 15-minute chauffeur - driven car ride up the mountain from Davos .
In previous years , Swiss police have reportedly been called to Deripaskaâ€ ™ s home after complaints about the noise of his Cossack band .
A former assistant to economist Nouriel Roubini has described Deripaskaâ€ ™ s parties as â€œendless streams of the finest champagne , vodka , and Russian caviar amidst dancing Cossacks and beautiful Russian modelsâ€ � .
Sandra Navidi , who was Roubiniâ€ ™ s director of research , recalled her trip to Deripaskaâ€ ™ s party in her book Superhubs : How the Financial Elite and their Networks Rule our World .
Many of this yearâ€ ™ s guests , who include outgoing US vice - president Joe Biden , Chinaâ€ ™ s two richest men , and London mayor Sadiq Khan , will travel on private jets to nearby airports before transferring by helicopter to escape the traffic on the approach to the picturesque town .
So many jets are expected that the Swiss government has opened up DÃ¼bendorf military airfield , an 85-mile helicopter flight away , to accommodate them .
Adam Twidell , chief executive of private jet booking service PrivateFly , said there were 1,700 private jet flights in and out of nearby airports last year , and he expected about 10 % more this year .
The increase in private jet flights â€ “ which each burn as much fuel in one hour as typical use of a car does in a year â€ “ comes as the WEF warns that climate change is the second most important global concern .
In its annual global risks report the WEF noted that environmental concerns were more prominent in the paper , drawn from 700 experts , than ever before .
Twidell said a last - minute flight to Davos from London on a small private jet would cost about Â£7,860 .
â€œClients we have booked so far include business leaders , heads of state and government individuals , â€ �
he said .
â€œ[But ] itâ€ ™ s not just pure politicians and business people who are wanting to be seen at Davos .
The parties there have become a place to be .
Davos is now on â€˜the circuitâ€ ™ along with the Superbowl ,
the Champions League final and the Monaco Grand Prix.â€ �
The rich and powerful at Davos Christine Lagarde
The managing director of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) is a firm fixture at the WEF , and will participate in at least three panels at this yearâ€ ™ s conference including â€œSqueezed and Angry : How to fix the middle - class crisisâ€ � , and another on how to â€œchallenge stereotypes and institutional inertia to achieve gender parity within our lifetimesâ€ � , as well as being keynote speaker on the wider challenges facing the economy this year .
Lagarde , formerly a French minister , was recently found guilty of negligence in approving a massive payout of taxpayersâ€ ™ money to controversial French businessman Bernard Tapie but avoided a jail sentence .
The court decided she should not be punished and that the conviction would not constitute a criminal record .
On Monday evening the IMF gave her its full support .

2017-02-22,"A South African judge has blocked the countryâ€ ™ s planned withdrawal from the international criminal court ( ICC ) , saying the move is unconstitutional without prior parliamentary approval .
Sitting in the high court in Pretoria , deputy judge president Phineas Mojapelo said on Wednesday that any move to pull out of the ICC must be â€œon the basis of the expressed authority of the constitutionâ€ � .
He ordered Jacob Zuma , the South African president , to retract the countryâ€ ™ s â€œinvalidâ€ � notification to the court of withdrawal .
Michael Masutha , the justice minister , said the government would decide how to proceed , including a possible appeal , after reading the full judgment but indicated it still intended to press ahead with the withdrawal .
He described the judgment as a policy decision .
Pretoria said last year it planned to leave the ICC after receiving criticism for ignoring the courtâ€ ™ s order to arrest the visiting Sudanese president , Omar Hassan al - Bashir , who is accused of genocide and war crimes , in June 2015 .
Under the Rome statute , the founding treaty of the ICC , countries have a legal obligation to arrest anyone sought by the tribunal .
Ministers had argued that the ICCâ€ ™ s obligations were inconsistent with domestic laws giving sitting leaders diplomatic immunity .
The clash over Bashir was the latest in a series of disputes rooted in deep suspicion of the institution among many leaders in Africa .
Opened in July 2002 , the court has repeatedly faced criticism by some on the continent who regard it as racist or imperialist .
Nine out of the 10 cases being investigated by the ICC involve alleged crimes in Africa .
Last month , African leaders adopted a strategy calling for a collective withdrawal from the court .
The non - binding decision came behind closed doors near the end of an African Union summit .
Late last year , Burundi and the Gambia also announced plans to leave the court , leading to concerns that other states would follow .
In a boost for the ICC , however , Adama Barrow , the new democratically elected president of the Gambia , recently reversed that decision â€ “ made by Yahya Jammeh , the west African stateâ€ ™ s former authoritarian leader .
Defenders of the ICC , the first legal body with permanent international jurisdiction to prosecute genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , say the majority of its investigations have followed an explicit request or grant of jurisdiction from the government in the country where the crimes were committed , as in the case of Uganda .
Wednesdayâ€ ™ s decision in Pretoria high court was largely expected as Mojapelo had already told government lawyers during a previous hearing that he was concerned that officials had exceeded their constitutional powers .
The application to stop the withdrawal was brought by one of South Africaâ€ ™ s two main opposition parties â€ “ the centre - right Democratic Alliance ( DA ) .
â€œWe have seen how our countryâ€ ™ s approach to foreign policy under [ president ]
Jacob Zuma has been at loggerheads with the human rights - based foreign policy spearheaded by the late president Nelson Mandela .
By irrationally withdrawing from the ICC , South Africa is out of touch with other progressive and democratic nations on the continent , â€ �
James Selfe , MP and chairman of the DAâ€ ™ s federal executive , told reporters earlier this week .
The government will decide whether to appeal , officials said ."
2017-03-31,"South Africa is facing a political crisis after its president , Jacob Zuma , sacked his respected finance minister in an overnight cabinet purge .
The dramatic move late on Thursday night sent the national currency plunging , outraged business leaders , and pitched the ruling African National Congress party into chaos .
The ANC , which came to power in South Africa under Nelson Mandela in the 1994 elections , now faces one of its biggest tests since leading the struggle against the apartheid regime .
Pravin Gordhan , who learned of his removal via the media , was widely seen as a competent manager of one of the worldâ€ ™ s most important emerging economies .
South Africa has struggled to deliver growth in recent years and to improve the lives of millions of its poorest citizens .
Gordhanâ€ ™ s
replacement , 45-year - old Malusi Gigaba , the current interior minister , is a Zuma loyalist with no business or financial experience .
The divisions within the ANC , which dominates parliament but lost power in key cities in local elections last year , were underlined by an unprecedented verbal attack on Zuma from the countryâ€ ™ s deputy president , Cyril Ramaphosa .
â€œI told him that I would not agree with him , â€ � Ramaphosa said .
â€œThere are quite a number of other colleagues and comrades who are unhappy about this situation â€ ¦
The minister of finance â€ ¦ was serving the country with absolute distinction .
For him to be removed â€ ¦ is to me unacceptable.â€
�
Zuma , 74 , said in a statement the reshuffle was intended â€œto bring about radical socioeconomic transformation and to ensure that the promise of a better life for the poor and the working class becomes a realityâ€ � .
On Friday Zuma gave a short speech in the poor Eastern Cape province , reportedly telling the audience his administration was â€œvery busy trying to fix what is wrong with the countryâ€ � .
Gordhan , a veteran of the fight against apartheid , told reporters that South Africans should to revive the spirit of that struggle and â€œorganiseâ€ � against political corruption and mismanagement .
He dismissed an intelligence report cited as a pretext for the move as â€œabsolute nonsenseâ€ � .
The report accused him of holding secret meetings to undermine the government during a trade trip in London this week .
â€œWe hope more and more South Africans would make it clear that our country is not for sale , â€ � Gordhan told reporters .
Zumaâ€ ™ s move has been variously interpreted as an attempt to install a minister who would allow populist measures which would reverse the electoral fortunes of the ANC blocked by Gordhan ; to gain control of the finance ministry to allow deals favoured by allies in the south African business community ; and to control the selection of his successor .
The veteran activist and politician will step down as ANC president later this year .
His replacement is likely to lead the country if , as widely predicted , the party wins elections due in 2019 .
Many pundits say the ANC may win less than 50 % of the vote , which would be a major blow .
Nkosazana Dlamini - Zuma , the presidentâ€ ™ s ex - wife and former African Union chief , is Zumaâ€ ™ s preferred candidate to succeed him .
She may be able to shield him from looming graft charges after he is out of office , but she has little support among the ANCâ€ ™ s electoral base .
Analysts say Zuma has struggled to live up to the standards of previous leaders of the ANC , such as Mandela and Thabo Mbeki , who was president from 1999 to 2008 .
â€œCompared to past ANC leaders , Zuma falls far short â€ “ and heâ€
™ s aware of it and extremely sensitive , â€ � said Mari Harris , a political analyst at Ipsos South Africa .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s tried to purge his cabinet of people who are opposition and put in a lot of yes - men.â€ �
Zuma has repeatedly been accused of corruption , with intense scrutiny of his ties to a family of local tycoons .
He has denied any wrongdoing .
Support for Gordhan from several ministers and major foreign investors , as well as many ordinary South Africans and veterans of the anti - apartheid struggle , made it difficult for the president to move earlier .
Gwede Mantashe , the ANC secretary general , said the way in which the cabinet reshuffle had been handled had made him â€œuncomfortableâ€ � .
He said : â€œThe president came with a list .
[ He ] said , â€˜you can comment if you want to comment , but this is my decisionâ€ ™

The outgoing finance minister received a standing ovation at the funeral of Ahmed Kathrada , one of South Africaâ€ ™ s leading anti - apartheid activists on Wednesday , as longtime ANC leaders including Winnie Madikizela - Mandela , ex - wife of Nelson Mandela , called for Zuma to step down .
The crisis may offer South Africaâ€ ™ s two main opposition parties an opportunity to make inroads into the ANCâ€ ™ s core support .
The far - left Economic Freedom and the centre right
Democratic Alliance said they would make a no - confidence vote in parliament .
The ANC has a near two - thirds majority in the 400-seat national assembly and can block any such move to oust Zuma .
The CEO Initiative , a coalition of top businessleaders , said it was â€œgravely concerned and disappointed by the ill - timed and irrational dismissalâ€ � .
In a statement , it said : â€œThis decision , and the manner in which it was taken , is likely to cause severe damage to an economy that is in dire need of growth and jobs.â€ � Some commentators saw a silver lining in the crisis .
â€œCurrently , the ANC is deeply fractured and wounded .
It has not been a cohesive force for some time .

Few have much time for politicians these days , but rare are those who have attracted as much opprobrium recently as Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma , leader of the â€œrainbow nationâ€ � since 2009 .
Last week , Zuma , 74 , sacked half his cabinet , including the respected finance minister , Pravin Gordhan .
The move , which South Africans learned about in the small hours of Thursday morning , sent the country into political crisis and further split the African National Congress ( ANC ) .
The 105-year - old party has ruled unchallenged since the end of apartheid in 1994 , but is now in disarray .
There has been much speculation about the motives of the president .
Critics accuse Zuma of hoping to assure the succession of a former wife who may protect him from multiple corruption charges once he has left office .
Zuma will soon have to step down as ANC leader and whoever fills the post will almost certainly become president after parliamentary polls in 2019 .
Other opponents suggest Zuma is seeking to take control of the finance ministry , to push through deals that will favour cronies , or simply preparing to unleash a raft of populist , economically unsustainable policies in a bid to reverse the ANCâ€ ™ s electoral decline .
Supporters say Zuma needed to act against those who have blocked â€œtransformationâ€ � of this stunningly beautiful , but deeply troubled land , where the consequences of nearly 50 years of apartheid and centuries of colonialism remain all too evident to all but the most obtuse visitor .
A flavour of Zumaâ€ ™ s world view was given to the Observer by the man he has just appointed as finance minister , Malusi Gigaba , a 45-year - old loyalist with limited financial or business experience .
In an interview last year , Gigaba spoke of how the ANC was ultimately â€œa fighting liberation movementâ€ � that , having overcome apartheid and seized political power , was now battling to gain control of the economy .
Zuma uses similar language , blaming â€œwhite monopoly capitalismâ€ � for attempts to oust him .
That the president sees the world in terms of a struggle is unsurprising .
Nelson Mandela was not the only South African to walk a long road to freedom , or to continue his march on a relatively rocky road beyond .
Zuma was born in the remote village of Nkandla in the centre of the historic homeland of the Zulu people in 1942 .
After his policeman father died , he accompanied his mother to Durban , where she became a domestic worker .
He received no formal schooling , later saying that he decided to educate himself when he realised that he , the eldest son , needed to earn to support his siblings .
At a recent visit to a school , he quoted Shakespeare , which he said he had believed at the time he needed to prove his new scholarship .
When he was six , minding herds in the hills around Nkandla , the National Party took power in South African and began to construct the racist and repressive system known as â€œapartheidâ€ � .
At 17 , influenced by a relative who was a committed union member , Zuma joined the ANC .
In 1960 , the party was banned and its leadership opted for a strategy of armed struggle .
This was a failure , resulting in massive arrests of members .
Zuma , who was an early recruit to the ANCâ€ ™ s clandestine military wing , was detained as he tried to leave the country for military training and sentenced to 10 years in prison .
He was sent to the famous jail on Robben Island , where he joined Nelson Mandela and other senior ANC leaders .
On his release , Zuma returned to activism .
In 1976 , the Soweto uprising marked a new wave of resistance , and the beginning of the end for the increasingly beleaguered apartheid regime .
Zuma , who had left South Africa for Mozambique shortly after his release from prison , was involved in organising and training the many young volunteers who sought out ANC - run camps in neighbouring countries .
He also undertook dangerous missions himself .
Canny , brave , hard - working , forthright , but charming when he needed to be , the young party cadre rose rapidly up the ANC hierarchy , taking on the crucial , and powerful , position of head of internal intelligence and security .
This means , commentators and former associates say today , that he knows â€œwhere all the bodies are buriedâ€ � .
Given the violence of the times and the fact that Zuma was a member of the shadowy ANC disciplinary arm , Mbokodo ( â€œthe stone that crushesâ€ � ) , the reference may not be entirely metaphorical .
As apartheid crumbled , Zuma returned to South Africa , playing a backroom role in negotiations leading up to the euphoric general elections of 1994 which brought the ANC to power and made Mandela president .
A key task was countering the powerful Inkatha Freedom Party , based in Zumaâ€ ™ s Zulu homeland , and then reconciling with this former enemy .
The battle between Inkatha and the ANC had claimed thousands of lives as gangs fought with knives , sticks and guns across much of the country .
The peaceful transition of power that , justly , appeared such a miracle to observers and participants alike , thus depended on the existence both of Mandela , who now has the status of a secular saint , and people like Zuma , who no one would describe as a model of moral probity and whose trademark tune is the struggle anthem â€œBring Me My Machine [
Gun]â€ � .
Last week , treasury staff sang a different song as the ousted finance minister , another veteran of the liberation fight , entered the ministry for the last time , the desperately mournful Senenzi na ,
â€œWhat have we doneâ€ � .
Zuma does not seem much given to retrospective heartache .
His career has been marked by a bullish disregard for convention and a rugged tenacity in the face of adversity .
This may have endeared him to some supporters as much as his populist rhetoric .
It certainly was a contrast with the distant , intellectual Thabo Mbeki , who , handpicked by Mandela , was president from 1999 to 2008 .
Zuma , the former herdsboy , got to be deputy president , and was fired in 2005 amid rape allegations â€ “
he was acquitted â€ “ and a raft of graft charges , dropped when a judge decided the case was politically tainted .
In 2008 , Zuma ousted Mbeki from the ANC leadership and in 2009 became prime minister .
If Zuma is blunt , his supporters can be brutal .
When a gallery exhibited a life - size painting of Zuma depicted as Lenin in a revolutionary pose with exposed genitals , the gallery received death threats .
Brett Murray , the artist â€ “
a former anti - apartheid activist â€ “ said the work was justified because Zuma , who has four current wives , as well as 22 children , has made no secret of his polygamy .
Yet he has known , too , how to capture visceral sentiments that are rarely voiced .
Though booed at the funeral of Mandela in 2013 , his singing of Thina sizwe , â€œWe the Nationâ€ � , a powerful struggle - era anthem that highlights the occupation of land by colonialists , was called a â€œpolitical masterstrokeâ€ � .
He may have calculated that a refusal last year to repay some of the Â£15 m of public funds improperly spent on his home in his native village would not outrage his heartland support .
Recent criticism has intensified as the ANCâ€ ™ s electoral fortunes , and the economy , have flagged .
The anger has been directed less against Zumaâ€ ™ s policy decisions than his exercise of power .
He is accused of undermining key institutions by making appointments based on loyalty rather than competence , and of improper relations with a family of very wealthy Indian - origin tycoons .
A recent report by the popular and respected public ombudsman , Thuli Madonsela , described a situation of â€œstate captureâ€ � by business interests .
Does Zuma care ?
Probably not .
He did not even consult government colleagues , including the deputy president , before firing Gordhan and the others last week .
But Zuma will be gone within a year or so .
The question now is what ANC , and what South Africa , he leaves behind .
In Clarens , a picturesque tourist town on the southern edge of the vast plains of the Free State , two young black men served coffee to a stream of white tourists , mainly South Africans , in an upmarket cafe on Friday .
The midnight political massacre had occurred only hours before .
Themba , 26 , and Daniel , 27 , were both born to poor parents in townships .
One just down the road ; the other 650 km to the northeast .
Neither can remember the days of the struggle against apartheid .
They can , however , remember how they could not go to college for want of funds , and how they were turned down for good government jobs , such as teaching , for lack of qualifications .
They are both acutely aware of the degree to which the colour of their skin still determines opportunities in their country , and of the effort needed to overcome and succeed .
â€œYouâ€ ™ ve got to keep trying , â€ � said Daniel .
â€œBut itâ€ ™ s a long , long tunnel before you see any light.â€

2017-04-01,"South Africaâ€ ™ s new finance minister has pledged to â€œradically transformâ€ � his countryâ€ ™ s economy , signalling a dramatic swing to the left less than 48 hours after taking up his post .
Malusi Gigaba was appointed after president Jacob Zuma sacked his widely respected predecessor , Pravin Gordhan , in an overnight cabinet purge last week .
The move , late on Thursday night , triggered a political crisis , pitching the ruling African National Congress party into chaos .
The ANC , which came to power in South Africaâ€ ™ s first free elections in 1994 , now faces one of its biggest tests since leading the struggle against the apartheid regime .
Radical economic change in the political language of the ANC means the redistribution of wealth , land and opportunity to the black majority .
â€œI will not be distracted by issues that are not relevant to the task at hand : accelerating radical economic transformation , â€ � Gigaba said .
â€œFor too long , there has been a narrative or perception around treasury , that it belongs primarily and exclusively to â€˜orthodoxâ€ ™ economists , big business , powerful interests and international investors .
The ownership of wealth and assets remains concentrated in the hands of a small part of the population .
This must change.â€ � Gigabaâ€ ™ s pledge suggests the ANC , hit by a decline in support in the recent poll , will bank on populist economic measures to reverse its electoral fortunes .
Though the ANC still has massive support , the unprecedented loss of major municipalities to a coalition of opposition parties after local elections last year is a concern as national polls loom in 2019 .
South Africa has struggled to deliver growth in recent years and failed to improve the lives of millions of its poorest citizens .
More than 90 % of the countryâ€ ™ s wealth is still in the hands of only 10 % of the 54 million inhabitants .
Ownership of land and companies remains mostly in the hands of South Africaâ€ ™ s white communities , who account for about 8 % of the population .
Gigaba also told reporters on Saturday he was committed to protecting South Africaâ€ ™ s cherished investment - grade credit ratings , which analysts have said are now threatened by the removal of his predecessor , Gordhan .
Gigaba , who was previously home affairs minister and is a Zuma loyalist , said : â€œI am fully aware that we are at a highly politicised , polarised and contentious moment in the history of our young democracy.â€ � Zumaâ€ ™ s enemies within the ANC are backed by increasing numbers of anti - apartheid veterans , trade unions , civil groups and business leaders .
The divisions within the party , which dominates parliament , were underlined by an unprecedented verbal attack on Zuma from the countryâ€ ™ s deputy president , Cyril Ramaphosa .
â€œI told him that I would not agree with him , â€ � Ramaphosa said .
â€œThere are quite a number of other colleagues and comrades who are unhappy about this situation â€ ¦
The minister of finance â€ ¦ was serving the country with absolute distinction .
For him to be removed â€ ¦ is to me unacceptable.â€ �
South Africaâ€ ™ s Communist party , a historic ally of the ANC , called on Zuma to resign .
However the youth wing of the party welcomed the wide - ranging cabinet reshuffle and the appointment of â€œexperienced and intelligentâ€ � Gigaba .
â€œYounger ministers will mean more transformation , â€ � ANC Youth League leader Collen Maine said , citing land redistribution , free education and the creation of a state bank as reforms the youth league wanted .
Zuma , 74 , said in a statement the reshuffle was intended â€œto bring about radical socioeconomic transformation and to ensure that the promise of a better life for the poor and the working class becomes a realityâ€ � .

Thousands marched through the rainy centre of Johannesburg , the commercial capital , on Friday amid a heavy police presence .
A large protest also took place in front of parliament in Cape Town .
Smaller crowds of a few hundred people protested on suburban street corners and bridges in the main cities and towns .
One protester , Lydia Potgieter , 69 , said she was there to â€œsupport the efforts of all South Africans to be rid of a corrupt system that is eating away everything we have worked for over the last 20 yearsâ€ � .
Thana Dzwane , 27 , had left her office with five colleagues to attend the rally .
â€œItâ€ ™ s about Zuma and his people
, â€ � she said .
â€œThey are ruining the country .
Things are only going to get worse unless there is a change soon.â€
�
In Pretoria , the administrative capital , thousands more gathered at the Union Buildings , the seat of government , carrying banners reading â€œZuma
not my presidentâ€ � and â€œthe power of the people is stronger than the people in powerâ€ � .
Analysts have described the crisis â€ “ triggered by a cabinet reshuffle last week in which widely respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan was sacked â€ “ as the most serious to face South Africa since minority white rule ended more than 20 years ago .
It has laid bare deep divisions within the country , and within the African National Congress , the party that led the liberation struggle and has ruled since 1994 .
Zuma , a party veteran in power since 2009 , has been accused of filling posts in key institutions with loyalists , packing party committees with supporters , and maintaining inappropriate relations with a powerful family of local tycoons .
The 74-year - old , who has been named in hundreds of corruption charges , denies any wrongdoing .
â€œI think this is a really important moment , â€ � said Nic Cheeseman , an expert in democracy in Africa at Birmingham University .
â€œThe South African state is under threat â€ ¦
The system now has problems throughout .
A lot of these tendencies were latent and Zuma has been so damaging because he has brought them out.â€
� The sacking of Gordhan , the finance minister , led to a slide in the value of South Africaâ€ ™ s rand currency and an almost immediate downgrading by international ratings agency Standard and Poorâ€ ™ s .
A second agency , Fitch Ratings , downgraded South Africa on Friday .
Zuma has brushed aside calls for his resignation from veterans of the liberation struggle , unions and South Africaâ€ ™ s Communist party , a historical ally of the ANC .
A powerful ANC committee backed the president last week , and he is expected to survive a no confidence vote in parliament later this month .
â€œThere is a battle for the soul of the ANC , â€ � Cheeseman said .
â€œThere is the party of [ Nelson ] Mandela and the Freedom Charter ; there is Zuma and his acolytes who want to use the party for their own interests .
It is unclear who will win out ... but we are clearly moving downhill.â€ �
Though members of all South Africaâ€ ™ s communities were present at the protests ,
South Africaâ€ ™ s
white minority , less than10 % of the population , was disproportionately represented .
â€œThere is a change coming , â€ � said Potgieter .
â€œThe white people are the middle class people .
Until now they have just sat down and taken it easy while black people have done something .
Now there is more mobilisation.â€ �
ANC loyalists accuse the main opposition party , the centre - right Democratic Alliance , of being â€œrun by whites and big business CEOsâ€ � .
Kedibone Khumalo , a 31-year - old from a small town in rural Free State who travelled for four hours in a bus with her local ANC branch to join a Zuma support demonstration outside the partyâ€ ™ s headquarters in Johannesburg , said :
â€œThe whites donâ€ ™ t like Zuma â€ ¦
but actually he looks after everybody .
It is a good government .
You get roads , homes , free medical aid if you are pregnant.â€ �
Zuma will step down as ANC president later this year .
His replacement is likely to lead the country if , as is widely predicted , the party wins elections due in 2019 .
Many pundits say the ANC , which suffered heavy losses in last yearâ€ ™ s municipal polls , may garner less than 50 % of the vote , which would be a major blow .
Investors fear a slew of populist measures which may further weaken a flagging economy .
Malusi Gigaba , the new finance minister , has pledged to â€œaccelerate radical economic transformationâ€ � which would redistribute wealth currently â€œconcentrated in the hands of a small part of the populationâ€ � .
South Africa has 54 million inhabitants , but just 10 % possess more than 90 % of the countryâ€ ™ s wealth .
Ownership of land and companies remains mostly in South Africaâ€ ™ s white communities .
Zuma has recently spoken of a new bid to expropriate land without compensation from big farmers .
This may play well with key rural communities which are strongholds of the ANC , but has less resonance in cities , where Zuma is deeply unpopular .
Hundreds of ANC supporters , some bearing sticks and bricks , others wearing combat uniforms , guarded the partyâ€ ™ s headquarters on Friday .
Police fired rubber bullets after some attempted to disrupt the opposition march .
Sifiso Motsweni , a senior official in the ANC Youth League , said the party was just â€œdefending its propertyâ€ � from opposition â€œthugsâ€ � and accused opposition parties of trying to use â€œunconstitutional meansâ€ � by taking to the streets .
â€œWe are not going to listen to white people and white CEOs who do not represent the majority of South Africans
â€
¦
This is not a race issue .
White people continue to be the bosses , to hold the economy and the land .
That is not racist , it is real , â€ � said Motsweni .
Dzwane , who joined the Johannesburg protest against Zuma with her colleagues , said : â€œThis is not about being white or black or whatever .
It is about whatâ€ ™ s best for the country.â€ �"
2017-06-30,"Jacob Zuma , South Africaâ€ ™ s embattled president , faces renewed pressure to step down this weekend after a series of media reports detailed links between elected officials and a family of tycoons accused of holding undue sway over his administration .
More than 100,000 documents and emails leaked to reporters in recent weeks appear to detail improper dealings in lucrative government contracts made with the Gupta family - secretive and immensely wealthy businessmen of Indian origin who have lived in South Africa for decades .
Authorities have launched an investigation into several allies of Zuma who have been linked to corruption at three state - owned companies .
One of the allegations involves suspected kickbacks worth $ 411 m ( Â£316 m ) .
The Gupta family and Zuma have consistently denied any wrongdoing .
The African National Congress , which led the fight against apartheid and has ruled South Africa since Nelson Mandela won the first multiracial elections in 1994 , met on Friday to debate the future of a country mired in recession , corruption and political deadlock .
Critics say Zuma has betrayed Mandelaâ€ ™ s legacy , replacing idealism and ethics with a brutal and avaricious bid for wealth and power , dividing the ANC and tarnishing the reputation of the post - apartheid â€œrainbow nationâ€ � .
In a defiant 90-minute speech , the 75-year - old politician told 5,000 delegates gathered in Soweto that to â€œrestore and maintain its character , the ANC needs to cleanse itself of the negative tendencies which have crept in over the yearsâ€ � .
Analysts have described the challenges facing the ANC as the greatest in 20 years .
Prof Anthony Butler , an expert and author at the University of Cape Town , said the party was â€œin very big troubleâ€ � .
â€œThe ANC is moving out of step with society â€ ¦ and is suffering from extremely destructive factional politics â€
¦
and we shouldnâ€ ™ t underestimate the amount of damage Zuma is doing [ to the party],â€ �
Butler said .
There is rising concern within the ANC that Zuma could cost the party power .
Tens of thousands protested against him in March after he sacked the widely respected finance minister , leading rating agencies to downgrade South Africa to â€œjunkâ€ � status .
The ANC was punished at municipal elections last year .
The economy is now officially in recession and unemployment has hit a 14-year high .
Butler added : â€œThe country is facing a wide range of problems .
There is no prospect of economic growth accelerating and no plan .
The [ ANCâ€ ™ s ] focus is always on internal politics.â€ �
Zuma is due to be replaced as ANC leader at a national conference in December .
The two strongest candidates are the deputy president , Cyril Ramaphosa , who is seen as the leader of the â€œreformistâ€ � faction of the party , and Zumaâ€ ™ s ex - wife , Nkosazana Dlamini , a former African Union chair and minister seen by analysts as closer to her ex - husband and his supporters .
Whoever wins the contest later this year is likely to become president of the country .
Parliamentary elections are due to be held in 2019 ."
2017-08-05,"Jacob Zuma , the Houdini of South African politics , has wriggled free from numerous attempts to oust him since becoming president in 2009 .
But persistent allegations of corruption , nepotism and abuse of power may finally be catching up with him as his enemies in the ruling African National Congress ( ANC ) and the opposition parties prepare to mount a vote of no confidence in parliament on Tuesday .
The showdown is especially dangerous for Zuma because it follows a court ruling in June allowing the speaker of the national assembly , Baleka Mbete , to hold a secret ballot .
Mbete , a Zuma ally who survived an attempt in 2014 to sack her for alleged bias , has yet to indicate whether she will do so .
But if the vote is held â€œin cameraâ€ � , at least 20 ANC MPs critical of Zumaâ€ ™ s leadership are expected to back the motion .
The ANC holds 249 of the parliamentâ€ ™ s 400 seats .
The opposition , principally composed of the Democratic Alliance ( DA ) and Julius Malemaâ€ ™ s Economic Freedom Fighters ( EFF ) , will need 50 ANC defectors for a majority .
A revolt on such a scale would once have been thought inconceivable in a party whose post - apartheid watchword is unity .
But extra - parliamentary pressure for change is intense and growing .
Major street demonstrations are planned in Cape Town this week .
A petition signed by more than a million people demanding Zumaâ€ ™ s removal has been presented to Cyril Ramaphosa , the deputy president , by the DA leader , Mmusi Maimane .
â€œSouth
Africans from all walks of life have stood up together and said ,
â€˜Look , we have got to a point now where we must ask Ramaphosa to do the right thingâ€ ™ ,â€ � Maimane said .
â€œThe question is , what is he going to do?â€ �
The answer could determine who , sooner or later , succeeds Zuma as ANC leader and president of South Africa .
Regardless of what happens in parliament , the ANC is due to meet in December to select an heir .
Ramaphosa is one candidate .
Other possibles are Lindiwe Sisulu , Jeff Radebe , Nkosazana Dlamini - Zuma , Zweli Mkhize , Mathews Phosa â€ “ and speaker Mbete .
The extent of the line - up indicates how divided the ANC has become .
Both Ramaphosa and Sisulu , the presumed frontrunners , face a dilemma .
They have repeatedly condemned Zuma - era factionalism , looting and so - called â€œstate captureâ€ � â€ “ self - interested influence exercised by private businesses and individuals over state policy - making .
But if Zuma falls , the main raison dâ€ ™ etre of their campaigns will fall with him .
And there is another problem : if Ramaphosa or the other presidential hopefuls back the parliamentary revolt , they will doubtless be lauded by the opposition .
But many ANC members , who will choose Zumaâ€ ™ s successor in December ( or sooner ) , may condemn them as traitors .
Zuma supporters thus have reason to hope he will survive this no - confidence vote , as he has five others .
Ramaphosa , who has been officially endorsed by Cosatu , the powerful trade union federation , has continued to argue that remaining silent about wrongdoing by the state and within the ANC amounts to a â€œbetrayal of the struggleâ€ � .
â€œThe ANC is your ANC .
It belongs to you ...
Nothing should stop you [ from speaking out],â€ �
Ramaphosa told a Cosatu conference in May.
The opposition also includes high - profile individuals with no stated interest in the presidential succession , such as Pravin Gordhan , the former finance minister sacked by Zuma in March .
Gordhan warned recently that state capture was crippling the countryâ€ ™ s economy .
If South Africans allowed the rot to continue , he said , â€œwe are going to slump into a 10-year disasterâ€ � .
Much of the controversy over state capture centres on the relationship between Zuma and the wealthy Gupta business family , and alleged bribes and kickbacks associated with government contracts .
Speaking to the BBC , Atal Gupta said the claims , including those made by Ramaphosa , were based on misunderstandings and misinformation , and denied any wrongdoing .
Controversy has also arisen over social media work undertaken by the British PR firm Bell Pottinger to defend Gupta businesses against the allegations .
CEO James Henderson has admitted his companyâ€ ™ s approach had been naive , but denied any intention to fuel racial tensions through use of terms such as â€œeconomic apartheidâ€ � and â€œwhite monopoly capitalâ€
� ( which Zuma has claimed lay behind calls for his resignation ) .
State capture has become a metaphor for the wider political and economic ills afflicting South African society .
In a damning independent report last May , entitled Betrayal of the Promise :
How South Africa Is Being Stolen , researchers from the universities of Cape Town , Witwatersrand , Johannesburg and Stellenbosch , funded by George Sorosâ€ ™ s Open Society Foundation , accused â€œZuma Incâ€ � of turning the country into a mafia - style fiefdom .
It stated : â€œCommentators , opposition groups and ordinary South Africans underestimate Jacob Zuma , not simply because he is more brazen , wily and brutal than they expect but because they reduce him to caricature.â€ �
In reality , the report said , Zuma had presided over a concerted political project to repurpose state institutions to channel money to his cronies in a shadowy elite .
The report called on South Africans of all backgrounds to â€œdefend the founding promise of democracy â€ ¦ by doing all that is necessary to stop the systemic and institutionalised process of betrayalâ€ � .
The no - confidence motion comes against a backdrop of increased disillusionment with the ANC , as evidenced by last yearâ€ ™ s local elections , when the DA and EFF made significant gains .
While Zumaâ€ ™ s unpopularity is undoubtedly to blame , so too is
South Africaâ€ ™ s worsening economic performance .
Comparing South Africa with other emerging countries , the Organisation for Economic Co - operation and Developmentâ€ ™ s 2017 survey makes alarming reading .
Growth has declined sharply since 2011 , it said , partly because of electricity shortages , falling commodity prices and policy uncertainty .
Unemployment is up , at 27 % , while youth unemployment was 53 % in 2016 .
Low - quality education , high crime rates , healthcare deficiencies and violence against women are cited as continuing problems .
A third of South Africans live on or below the poverty line , the survey found .
And more than a quarter of a century after the end of apartheid , inequality remains stark , with the top fifth of the population earning 40 times more than the lowest ."
2017-08-08,"The South African president , Jacob Zuma , has narrowly survived a motion of no confidence against him in parliament , the most serious attempt yet to unseat him after months of growing anger over allegations of corruption and a sinking economy .
It was the sixth such vote of his increasingly beleaguered presidency , but the first involving a secret ballot , with a broad coalition of opposition parties and renegade MPs from the ruling African National Congress ( ANC ) falling just short of the simple majority needed to force Zuma and his cabinet to resign immediately .
The ballot counting was accompanied by scenes of singing and dancing on both sides of the assembly , as rival parties sought to project confidence .
â€œWe taught you this song , and you donâ€ ™ t even sing it properly , â€ � jeered the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema , dressed in signature red overalls , addressing his ANC counterparts .
Baleka Mbete , the National Assemblyâ€ ™ s speaker , announced the result : 198 MPs voted against , compared with 177 in favour .
There were nine abstentions .
â€œTherefore the motion of no confidence in the president is accordingly negative , â€ � declared Mbete .
ANC MPs in parliament whooped and danced at the news .
An upbeat President Zuma arrived at the parliamentary precinct about an hour after the result was announced .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve just come to say thank you to all of you .
Those comrades who are in parliament needed the support from the membership .
You came in your numbers to demonstrate that the ANC is there , is powerful , is big .
It is difficult to defeat the ANC , but you can try , â€ �
he said .
He then gave a rendition of Yinde Lendlela , his signature tune .
The title translates from Zulu as â€œItâ€ ™ s a Long Roadâ€ � , and the implication is clear : his journey is not over yet .
In the hours before Tuesdayâ€ ™ s vote , a series of coordinated protests across South Africa demanded Zumaâ€ ™ s removal .
A petition signed by more than a million people was delivered to the deputy president , Cyril Ramaphosa , who is seen as Zumaâ€ ™ s main rival .
Zuma , 75 , has never been far from scandal since he became president in 2009 .
Another major criticism raised during the parliamentary debate included allegations that he had allowed the state to be â€œcapturedâ€ � by the Guptas , an Indian business family that has been at the centre of a string of media exposÃ
© s about graft in government and state - owned enterprises .
The no - confidence motion was brought by the Democratic Alliance ( DA ) , the largest opposition party , in response a cabinet reshuffle in March , in which Zuma sacked the popular finance minister Pravin Gordhan .
The president was playing â€œRussian
rouletteâ€ � with the economy , according to the DA leader , Mmusi Maimane .
â€œI never imagined that one day I would be here in this parliament fighting a new form of oppression , â€ � Maimane said during the debate on the motion .
â€œA corrupt system that keeps our people imprisoned in poverty .
If you told me that one day our democratically elected president would end up corrupted and captured by a criminal syndicate , I would have never believed you .
But here we are.â€
�
In response , ANC MPs argued that the party remained united behind Zuma , and had set up internal processes to deal with accusations of corruption and poor governance .
The no - confidence motion was dismissed repeatedly as an attempted power grab by the opposition .
â€œ[The opposition ] are using the constitution so as to collapse government , deter service delivery and sow the seeds of chaos in society so as to ultimately grab power â€ ¦ Shame on you!â€
� said Doris Dlakude , the ANCâ€ ™ s deputy chief whip .
Although Zuma has survived this battle , he is still fighting for his political future .
His term as president expires in 2019 and under the South African constitution he can not run again .
More immediately , his term as president of the ANC expires in 2017 .
He is lobbying hard to install the former African Union Commission chair Nkosazana Dlamini - Zuma , who is his ex - wife , as his successor .
Opponents within the party are largely rallying behind Ramaphosa , although there are other names in the mix .
Despite the parliamentary defeat , Maimane hailed the close vote as a victory for the opposition DA .
â€œTodayâ€ ™ s motion of no confidence result is closer than anyone expected .
The result reveals an ANC that is totally divided against itself .
Jacob Zuma has survived , but he has nothing to celebrate tonight .
He is mortally wounded and his party is in tatters .
Tonightâ€ ™ s result , despite the slender victory , signals the death of the ANC , â€ � he said in a statement .
But outside parliament , where hundreds of pro - Zuma supporters were gathered , a celebratory atmosphere prevailed .
The police minister , Fikile Mbalula , told the crowd .
â€œWe were inside [ parliament ] , they said theyâ€ ™ re going to topple the president .
But with your support , we have defeated them inside .
There are those who have been asking [ us to vote with ] our conscience .
Weâ€ ™ ve got political conscience to keep the ANC in power forever , and that is political conscience
â€ ¦
The African National Congress will survive!â€ � While the ANC , Africaâ€ ™ s oldest liberation movement , and the president live to fight another day , there is little doubt that both are wounded by Tuesdayâ€ ™ s proceedings .
â€œANC MPs were ordered to vote to retain President Zuma .
It looks like at least 25 , possibly as many as 30 , willingly defied that order .
This looks like the first big sign of a possible rebellion against him in the ANC , â€ � said Stephen Grootes , a political analyst with Eyewitness News .
Zuma must also contend with a supreme court of appeal hearing on 15 September , which will decide whether to reinstate 783 criminal charges against him , including fraud , corruption and racketeering ."
2017-08-08,"In voting to defeat a parliamentary motion of no confidence in Jacob Zuma , African National Congress MPs have merely postponed the presidentâ€ ™ s day of reckoning .
The internal party battle to succeed the weakened and unpopular leader is likely to intensify , while South Africaâ€ ™ s chronic economic problems and public disillusionment with the ANC , in power since 1994 , seem certain to grow .
Zumaâ€ ™ s survival could be short - lived .
He is immersed in spiralling allegations of corruption , mismanagement and personal financial wrongdoing .
One of the most notorious is the 2010 purchase of a family home on the exclusive Waterkloof Ridge , overlooking Pretoria .
Leaked documents suggest part of the the 5.24 m South African rand ( Â£300,000 ) used to purchase the property came from the Gupta business empire , which is at the heart of the â€œstate captureâ€ � scandal .
Zuma potentially faces criminal charges over allegations he received kickbacks linked to government contracts and tenders .
Julius Malema , leader of the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters and a high - profile ANC defector , personally lodged charges against Zuma and the Guptas at Johannesburg central police station in June , alleging a huge fraud .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re here because weâ€ ™ re protecting the poor African masses , â€ �
Malema said .
â€œWe want to protect the South African purse , which Zuma and his friends have turned into a personal purse.â€
�
Ongoing controversy over â€œstate captureâ€ � â€ “ when private individuals and businesses exert undue influence over government policy â€ “ will not evaporate simply because Zuma has survived .
Nor will the complaints that triggered Tuesdayâ€ ™ s vote : that the president showed â€œreckless and irrational behaviourâ€ � in managing the economy and in sacking successive finance ministers Pravin Gordhan and Nhlanhla Nene .
â€œ[Zumaâ€ ™ s ]
derelict leadership has resulted in a collapse of public confidence in the president â€ ¦ and ultimately undermined efforts to restore confidence in the South African economy , â€ � the leader of the main opposition Democratic Alliance , Mmusi Maimane , said in proposing the vote .
Maimaneâ€ ™ s grim verdict is broadly shared by South Africaâ€ ™ s powerful trade union federation , Cosatu , church leaders , student and academic bodies , and by South African businesses .
The value of the rand rose and shares rallied after Mondayâ€ ™ s announcement that the vote would be a secret ballot , since that was thought to increase its chances of success .
A corresponding negative market reaction can now be expected .
The economy is already in dire straits .
It slid into recession in March and was downgraded to junk status by two ratings agencies .
The voteâ€ ™ s
outcome is a mixed blessing for the ANC .
On the one hand , it has maintained a facade of unity and avoided handing the opposition its biggest victory since the beginning of majority rule .
On the other hand , the party is now a badly damaged brand , riven by deep fissures and seemingly out of touch with voters .
A divisive internal backlash against any ANC MPs who voted to dump Zuma is likely to follow , even though votes were cast anonymously .
The ANC is due to select a replacement leader in December .
Zuma will continue as state president until 2019 unless , like his predecessor , Thabo Mbeki , he is forced to quit early .
But there is no agreement on who should follow Zuma as party chief .
It is possible the vote could be brought forward if his position weakens further .
Half a dozen candidates are jostling for position .
They include Cyril Ramaphosa , Zumaâ€ ™ s deputy ; Lindiwe Sisulu ; Nkosazana Dlamini - Zuma ,
the presidentâ€ ™ s former wife ; and the speaker of parliament , Baleka Mbete , whose stock has risen following her handling of the ballot .
Intense politicking within the ANC hierarchy over the next few months is likely to distract attention from the countryâ€ ™ s problems and add to instability .
Disaffection among ANC voters also looks set to increase after the mass anti - Zuma street protests of recent months , with many tempted to abandon the party entirely .
This trend is already underway , as evidenced by last yearâ€ ™ s municipal election results , when support for the ANC fell to its lowest level since 1994 .
The first , big challenge facing Zumaâ€ ™ s successor as ANC leader will be to stop the rot .
But analysts predict that if the anti - Zuma factionâ€ ™ s candidate fails to get its top job , the party will split before the 2019 general election ."
2017-08-09,"Jacob Zuma may have survived a motion of no confidence in the South African parliament , but the fierce battle over his leadership has damaged the chances of the African National Congress of winning the 2019 national election .
The struggle between Zuma supporters and opponents within and outside the ANC has paralysed both the ruling party and the South African government , and it is likely to resume with even more vigour , potentially leading to another split in the party , this time possibly fatal .
Stand by for more paralysis in the ANC and the government .
This in turn will make the necessary economic reforms â€ “ among them cleaning up wasteful state - owned entities , improving the efficiency of public services and tackling public corruption â€ “ near impossible .
Failure to deliver these reforms will hurt business confidence and lead ultimately to increasing economic hardship among ordinary South Africans .
And the impact will be particularly acute among poor black traditional ANC supporters , who have borne the brunt of the effects of a technical recession , the downgrading of the country to junk status by global rating agencies and the resultant slew of mining and factory closures .
Zuma is facing at least 783 fraud , corruption and racketeering charges , all stalled by legal appeals .
The scale of corruption , mismanagement and lack of public service delivery combined with the sheer arrogance , bling and indifference shown by the Zuma faction , mean a tipping point has been reached for many ANC members and supporters .
Big numbers are already abandoning for the party and Zumaâ€ ™ s latest victory is likely to drive many more of them away .
Zumaâ€ ™ s victory now strengthens his factionâ€ ™ s hand within the ANC ahead of the partyâ€ ™ s December 2017 national elections , where a new president will be elected .
Zumaâ€ ™ s handpicked successor is his ex - wife , Nkosazana Dlamini - Zuma , the former head of the African Union .
She is opposed by Zumaâ€ ™ s main rival , the deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa .
Ramaphosa has now missed a crucial opportunity in the no - confidence vote to rally ANC MPs to get rid of Zuma .
Dlamini - Zuma is arguably much less electable among ANC rank and file , but could now be more easily placed in the party leadership , since the Zuma faction controls the partyâ€ ™ s electoral caucus , and their grip , following this parliamentary vote success has now been further strengthened .
Zuma and supporters successfully presented the no - confidence vote as a non - electoral attempt by opposition parties to dislodge the ANC , rather than punishing Zuma himself for his poor performance .
This played on the African liberation movement â€œcodeâ€ � whereby members are required to rally behind the party leader if the party is threatened by a common â€œfoeâ€ � .
ANC members also want to be seen to be getting rid of their leaders themselves , rather than having it done to them by opposition parties .
As Jackson Mthembu , the ANC chief whip said before the vote : â€œBecause this opposition wants to remove the ANC government , now , who in his right mind from the ANC desks would then assist such an opposition in removing its government.â€ � Zumaâ€ ™ s second term as ANC president comes to an end in December , when the ANC holds its national conference and his second term as South African president ends in 2019 , when national elections are held .
The constitution sets a two - term presidential limit but there is no term limit on the ANC presidency although Zuma has said he will stand down as party leader .
His main strategy has been to try to secure a sympathetic successor , who would be able to protect him from prosecution when he steps down .
His enemies within and outside the ANC have vowed to push ahead , however , in the same way that Brazilâ€ ™ s
Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva has been successfully prosecuted for corruption after his presidential term .
Dlamini - Zuma is arguably less electable than the business - friendly Ramaphosa who is also supported by the main trade unions .
This means that with Dlamini - Zuma as presidential candidate , the ANC may not win the 2019 national elections unless it can strike a coalition with either the opposition Economic Freedom Front ( EFF ) , the populist breakaway from the ANC , led by Zumaâ€ ™ s nemesis and former ally , Julius Malema , or the main opposition Democratic Alliance , invigorated by its first black leader , Mmusi Maimane .
If the opposition parties shun the ANC in a coalition and form their own governing coalition they may then come under popular pressure to prosecute Zuma .
His win this week could ultimately be a hollow victory.â€¢ William Gumede is an associate professor at the University of Witwatersrand , Johannesburg"
2017-08-13,"Bell Pottinger , the public relations company founded by
Margaret Thatcherâ€ ™ s
spin doctor Lord Bell , will on Friday be hauled before the public relations and communications association ( PRCA )
disciplinary committee over allegations
it ran a secret campaign to stir up racial tension in South Africa on behalf of billionaire clients .
Mmusi Maimane , leader of South Africaâ€ ™ s opposition Democratic Alliance party , has demanded that the British PR industry body censures Bell Pottinger for running a â€œhateful and divisive campaign to divide South Africa along the lines of raceâ€ � .
Bell Pottinger is accused of seeking to stir up anger about â€œwhite monopoly capitalâ€
� and the â€œeconomic apartheidâ€ � in the country to draw attention away from the wealthy and controversial Gupta family , who are accused of exploiting their friendship with President Jacob Zuma to extract billions of dollars from the state .
Bell Pottinger , which was being paid Â£100,000 a month by the Guptasâ€ ™ s Oakbay company , allegedly orchestrated the creation of fake Twitter accounts to target prominent white business people in South Africa , some of whom were Bell Pottinger clients .
Maimane , who this week called an unsuccessful vote of no confidence in Zuma over allegations that he gave the Guptasâ€ ™ companies preferential access to government contracts , has called for the PRCA to strip Bell Pottinger of its membership of the trade body .
He has also called on the Chartered Institute of Public Relations ( CIPR ) to also investigate Bell Pottingerâ€ ™ s work in South Africa , which has led to protests outside the firmâ€ ™ s offices and a social media campaign using the hashtag # bellpottingermustfall .
â€œBell
Pottinger must face consequences for their collusion with the Guptas using a hateful and divisive campaign to divide South Africans along the lines of race .
This was coordinated campaign to further Gupta financial interestsâ€š and ensure the captured ANC continued to provide lucrative contracts that lined Gupta pockets , â€ �
Maimane said .
â€œSouth Africa is not a political playground where international corporations can disregard ethics to turn a profit .
Bell Pottingerâ€ ™ s unethical compliance in these projects is unacceptable and the Democratic Alliance has taken steps to ensure they are held to account.â€
�
Maimane had called on the PRCA to open the hearing to the public , but Bell Pottinger has invoked its right for the hearing to be held behind closed doors .
Bell Pottingerâ€ ™ s role in the scandal , which was revealed in more than 100,000 leaked emails dubbed the GuptaLeaks , has thrown the PR company , founded in 1987 , into crisis .
The companyâ€ ™ s chief executive , James Henderson , has issued what he describes as an â€œunequivocalâ€ � apology and fired Victoria Geoghegan , the partner leading the Gupta account , and suspended three other staff for the â€œinappropriate and offensiveâ€ � social media campaign .
â€œMuch of what has been alleged about our work is , we believe , not true â€ “ but enough of it is to be of deep concern , â€ � he said â€œWe wish to issue a full , unequivocal and absolute apology to anyone impacted .
These activities should never have been undertaken .
We are deeply sorry that this happened.â€ �
Henderson , who declined to elaborate on his public statements to the Guardian , has appointed City law firm Herbert Smith Freehills to investigate the allegations and has said it will publish the report .
The contract with the Guptas , who own a mining - to - media conglomerate , was cancelled in April .
Henderson said he and other senior managers were â€œmisledâ€ � about the activities being carried out in South Africa , but Tim Bell , who quit the firm last year in part because of concerns about working for the Guptas , said he had raised concerns with the companyâ€ ™ s ethics committee .
Bell , who has previously represented the Pinochet Foundation , Syrian first lady Asma al - Assad and the governments of Bahrain and Egypt , told the BBC that working for the Guptas was a â€œpolitically toxic contractâ€ � and the firm should walk away .
He warned that it could lose other clients .
Bell Pottinger has lost some of its biggest clients , including South African investment bank Investec , the South African tourism board , London - listed African - focused miner Acacia and Richemont , the luxury goods company that owns Cartier and Montblanc and which is controlled by South African billionaire Johann Rupert .
Rupert reportedly told the annual meeting of his holding company Remgro that Bell Pottinger had arranged for him to be targeted as part of the social campaign against â€œwhite monopoly capitalâ€ � .
â€œAnd whilst they were still in the employment of Richemont , they started working for the Guptas .
The very same person â€ ¦ Their total task was to deflect attention [ from state capture allegations involving the Guptas ] .
Guess who they took as a target ?
A client of theirs
â€
“ Me!â€
�
Rupert said Bell Pottingerâ€ ™ s contract with Richemont was cancelled after 15 to 18 years .
As well as pressing for industry sanctions against Bell Pottinger , Maimane has written to a host of the PR firmâ€ ™ s biggest clients calling on them to drop the agency .
â€œThough legal action is effectiveâ€š corporations respond to their bottom line faster than they do to judgesâ€šâ€ � he said .
Danny Rogers , editor - in - chief of PR Week , said it was shocking that Bell Pottinger had once again allowed itself to become the story following a 2011 investigation by the Independent into the firms alleged â€œdark artsâ€ � used to improve companiesâ€ ™ reputations .
Those revelations also led to a PRCA hearing , which did not censure Bell Pottinger .
â€œThe word in the PR industry is that clients are very uneasy and more are considering leaving , â€ � Rogers said .
â€œClients do not want to be represented by PR firms that become the story or are associated with scandal .
And this has been a huge scandal that has damaged the reputation of political consultancies.â€ � Rogers
said it was rare for a PR firm as big as Bell Pottinger to be hauled before the PRCA and said he could not recall any big companies ever being disbarred from the association .
â€œIt would be quite a big deal if they got thrown out.â€ �
However , he said the industry â€œneeds to take a standâ€ � and â€œshow that these practices are not endemic and that the PR industry as a whole believes in open , transparent and ethical communicationsâ€ � .

2017-08-24,"Bell Pottinger will be given a â€œdisciplinary sanctionâ€ � by the UKâ€ ™ s public relations trade body over allegations that the leading PR firm ran a secret campaign to stir up racial tension in South Africa on behalf of its billionaire clients .
A Public Relations and Communications Association ( PRCA ) hearing last week heard allegations that Bell Pottinger sought to stir up anger about â€œwhite monopoly capitalâ€
� and the â€œeconomic apartheidâ€ � in South Africa to draw attention away from the wealthy and controversial Gupta family , who have been accused of benefiting financially from their close links to the South African president , Jacob Zuma .
Democratic Alliance , the South African opposition party which lodged a formal complaint with the PRCA about Bell Pottinger , issued a statement on Thursday saying it had received confirmation that the complaint had been upheld .
The PRCA declined to comment on what action it was considering taking against Bell Pottinger .
A final decision will be published in the week of 4 September .
Francis Ingham , the PRCAâ€ ™ s director general , said : â€œOur final decision on this case will be made once it has been through the full and balanced process set out in our professional charter and codes of conduct , including any appeals .
We canâ€ ™ t comment further while the process is ongoing.â€ �
The Guardian understands that the PRCA is considering a range of actions it could take against Bell Pottinger , including terminating its membership of the trade body .
Only one PR company has ever had its membership terminated .
Other possible disciplinary options include a formal warning or reprimand .
James Henderson , Bell Pottingerâ€ ™ s chief executive , was hauled before the PRCAâ€ ™ s disciplinary committee last week to answer accusations that the firm ran a â€œhateful and divisive campaign to divide South Africa along the lines of raceâ€ � .
Henderson told the Guardian that Bell Pottingerâ€ ™ s board was â€œconsidering all optionsâ€ � for the future of the business in the wake of the scandal .
Those options are understood to include the sale of Hendersonâ€ ™ s stake in the company , which would lead to his exit from the firm .
Henderson denied rumours that he had resigned .
When asked whether he had offered to resign , he said : â€œNo comment.â€ � â€œWe are looking at all options for the company , including future ownership , â€ � he said .
â€œWe are looking at the structure of the business at this stage .
As [ I am ] a significant shareholder you can draw your own conclusions.â€ �
He said several parties had approached the company about the possibility of acquiring an ownership stake .
Kevin Read , a Bell Pottinger partner , has resigned from the PRCAâ€ ™ s board before of its meeting to decide what sanction to issue against the PR firm , founded by

Bell Pottinger is accused of orchestrating the creation of fake Twitter accounts to target prominent white businesspeople in South Africa to draw attention away from the Gupta family .
The Guptaâ€ ™ s Oakbay company was paying Bell Pottinger Â£100,000 a month for its lobby and PR advice .
Bell Pottinger cancelled the contract in April .
Henderson issued an apology last month , fired Victoria Geoghegan , the partner leading the Gupta account , and suspended three other staff for the â€œinappropriate and offensiveâ€ � social media campaign .
â€œMuch of what has been alleged about our work is , we believe , not true â€ “ but enough of it is to be of deep concern , â€ � he said .
â€œWe wish to issue a full , unequivocal and absolute apology to anyone impacted .
These activities should never have been undertaken .
We are deeply sorry that this happened.â€ � Mmusi Maimane , the leader of South Africaâ€ ™ s opposition Democratic Alliance party , told the PRCA disciplinary committee : â€œBell Pottinger must face consequences for their collusion with the Guptas using a hateful and divisive campaign to divide South Africa along the lines of race.â€ � Maimane , who recently called an unsuccessful vote of no confidence in Zuma over allegations that he gave the Guptasâ€ ™ companies preferential access to government contracts , called on the PRCA to take the strongest possible action against Bell Pottinger .
â€œThis was a coordinated campaign to further Gupta financial interestsâ€š and ensure the captured ANC continued to provide lucrative contracts that lined Gupta pockets , â€ � he said .
â€œSouth Africa is not a political playground where international corporations can disregard ethics to turn a profit .
Bell Pottingerâ€ ™ s unethical compliance in these projects is unacceptable and the Democratic Alliance has taken steps to ensure they are held to account.â€

Henderson said he and other senior managers had been misled about the activities being carried out in South Africa .
But Bell , who quit the firm last year in part because of concerns about working for the Guptas , said he had raised concerns with the companyâ€ ™ s ethics committee .
Bell , who has previously represented the Pinochet Foundation , Syriaâ€ ™ s first lady , Asma al - Assad , and the governments of Bahrain and Egypt , told the BBC that working for the Guptas was a â€œpolitically toxic contractâ€ � and warned that it could lose other clients .
Bell Pottinger has lost some of its biggest clients , including the South African investment bank Investec , the South African tourism board , the London - listed , African - focused miner Acacia , and Richemont , the luxury goods company that owns Cartier and Montblanc and is controlled by the South African billionaire Johann Rupert .
Maimane has written to other clients calling on them to drop the agency .
â€œThough legal action is effectiveâ€š corporations respond to their bottom line faster than they do to judgesâ€šâ€ � he said ."
2017-09-03,"The chief executive of Bell Pottinger has resigned just days before a ruling over accusations that the public relations firm stoked racial tensions in South Africa through its work with the billionaire Gupta family , which condemned opponents of President Jacob Zuma as agents of â€œwhite monopoly capitalâ€ � .
James Henderson , who confirmed he had left the role over the weekend , was under pressure to quit after the firm was given a â€œdisciplinary sanctionâ€ � by the UKâ€ ™ s public relations trade body earlier this year .
The action was taken after a Public Relations and Communications Association (
PRCA ) inquiry heard allegations that Bell Pottinger sought to stir up anger about â€œeconomic apartheidâ€ � in South Africa to draw attention away from the controversial Gupta family , who have been accused of benefiting financially from their close links to Zuma , although they have denied this .
Henderson issued an â€œunequivocalâ€ � apology in July , but last week the firm appealed against the initial ruling ahead of a final decision expected this week .
Henderson previously told the Guardian that Bell Pottingerâ€ ™ s board was â€œconsidering all optionsâ€ � for the future of the business in the wake of the scandal .
Those options were understood to include the sale of Hendersonâ€ ™ s significant stake in the company , with such a move likely to trigger his exit from the firm .
The case follows a complaint to the PRCA by South Africaâ€ ™ s main opposition party , the Democratic Alliance , about the campaign run for the Guptas .

Lord Bell told the BBC in an interview that he quit the firm last year in part over concerns that the Gupta contract was â€œtoxicâ€ � .
Last week the PRCA confirmed that an appeal had been submitted and said its board of management would issue its final decision on 5 September .
If found to have violated the associationâ€ ™ s professional charter , the maximum penalty Bell Pottinger could face would be termination of its PRCA membership .
The PRCAâ€ ™ s code states members should â€œtake all reasonable care that professional duties are conducted without causing offence on the grounds of gender , race , religion , disability or any other form of discriminationâ€ � ."
2017-09-15,"The fallout from the scandal that brought down PR firm Bell Pottinger is spreading after the resignations of the chief executive , chairman and a string of top executives from the South African arm of KPMG , which audits companies owned by the controversial Gupta family .
The resignations follow the publication of an investigation into the auditorâ€ ™ s work on businesses owned by the wealthy Guptas â€ “ who hired disgraced PR firm Bell Pottinger to run a secret campaign focused on â€œeconomic apartheidâ€ � and â€œwhite monopoly capitalâ€
�
â€ “ as well as for work for the South African Revenue Service .
The Guptas have been accused of benefiting financially from their close links to the South African president , Jacob Zuma , whose son Duduzane has been a director at several Gupta - owned companies .
KPMG South Africa audited Gupta - owned firms for 15 years until March 2016 , when it resigned the contract .
â€œWhile
the investigation did not identify any evidence of illegal behaviour or corruption by KPMG partners or staff , this investigation did find work that fell considerably short of KPMGâ€ ™ s standards , â€ � said KPMG International , which published a 10-page report on its investigation into the South African arm .
KPMG said it was donating the equivalent of 40 m South African rand ( Â£2.2 m )
â€ “ the total fees earned from Gupta company work from 2002 â€
“ to not - for - profit groups working in education and the anti - corruption sector .
The South African armâ€ ™ s top management has all resigned â€“the chief executive , Trevor Hoole , the chairman , Ahmed Jaffer , and chief operating officer Steven Louw â€ “ as well as five partners .
KPMG said that it has decided to take disciplinary action seeking dismissal in relation to Jaques Wessels , the lead partner on the non - listed Gupta businesses .
The auditing firm enjoyed close ties with its Gupta clients well beyond office duties including four KPMG partners attending a lavish Gupta family wedding in 2013 .
â€œWhile
the investigation concluded that their attendance was not a breach of auditor independence rules , we accept that the partners should not have attended this wedding , â€ � said KPMG International .
The audit of KPMGâ€ ™ s dealings with Gupta businesses found that teams â€œfailed to apply sufficient professional scepticism and to comply fully with auditing standardsâ€ � .
Further , it found that management of â€œmanyâ€ � Gupta companies responded â€œmisleadingly and inadequately to audit teamsâ€ ™ enquiriesâ€ � .
â€œDespite the deficiencies in the audit work , KPMG International found no evidence of dishonesty or unethical behaviour on the part of the audit partners and audit teams working on the audits for the Gupta group of companies , â€ � the report says .
The report also cleared KPMG of allegations that it was involved in facilitating tax evasion for the Guptas .
It found that a â€œseries of misrepresentationsâ€ � from Gupta company clients over the period KPMG provided tax advice , but said its staff did not break the law .
â€œThe investigation concluded there was nothing to indicate that in the delivery of these tax services , KPMG South Africa , its partners or staff , were involved in any activities of the Gupta family involving potential money laundering , tax evasion , corruption or any other illegal activity , â€ � the report said .
â€œThis has been a painful period and the firm has fallen short of the standards we set for ourselves , and that the public rightly expects from us , â€ � said Nhlamu Dlomu , who has been promoted internally to succeed Hoole .
â€œI want to apologise to the public , our people and clients for the failings that have been identified by the investigation .
It is important to emphasise that these events do not represent KPMG , our people or the values we have adhered to over decades of committed client service .
My pledge and promise to the country is that we can and will regain the publicâ€ ™ s confidence.â€ �
Separately , it has emerged that Heather Kerzner , the fiancee of London - based Bell Pottingerâ€ ™ s ex - chief executive James Henderson , has hired lawyers to investigate how to get back some of her significant investment in the PR firm .
Kerzner owns a possible 15 % stake in Bell Pottinger , making her one of its biggest shareholders after Henderson , who owned about 20 % at the time of its collapse on Tuesday .
The stakes are now effectively worthless with any money recovered by the administrators , BDO , going to banks and other creditors ahead of equity shareholders ."
